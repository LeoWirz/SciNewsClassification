There is no need to know the divine energy force, God dwells in each and every human being, and if one concentrates, if one surrenders totally to any one such person, that human being can be a door to the divine. To grasp this cosmic energy, I performed all rituals during my lifetime; I did whatsoever said by whosoever. And ultimately, I surrendered in totality at the place where I finally experienced cosmic energy. I made it a single point, a single spot to receive the entire cosmic energy, because I could know, I could recognize the divine indication. The divine indication was, I should see the GURU himself as the PARMATMA, the GURU through whose medium I could reach to PARMATMA. I am seeing the entire cosmic energy, the entire cosmic powers in the GURUCHARAN. That's why; my attention is not diverted to any other energy in the world. For me, the entire energy centralized at one point, at one place. If you can concentrate the entire energy at one point, you will receive the maximum from there only. The cosmic energy is spread across the universe; PARAMATMA is spread across the universe. That governs the entire universe. From which source you are receiving it? From which direction you are receiving it? What does it indicate? One who has understood this indication, one who has known this indication, one who has recognized this signal; he has known the entire cosmos. No thirst is left to know anything else, to understand anything else. The most important desire of the lifetime, the pure desire, the desire to know PARAMATMA has been fulfilled. \nSadguru Shri Shivkrupanand Swamiji", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sadguru shri shivkrupanand swamiji", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "paramatma", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:12:34.194+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3c2384320d8ae83a32a822b2187aa73b527105eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTyNH0ZJuEkuSvNggkXCOslZBgX9JELlAKAMEsOC8cXIuX26MUiuE8WOWSd2CpINxBTS5uy92QXxA--", "site_full": "forum.axishistory.com", "site": "axishistory.com", "site_section": "https://forum.axishistory.com//viewforum.php?f=113", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "USA 1919-1945 -

The ISA Worlds Are Heading to Brazil in November 2018   Terrene Black and Olivia Piana competing at the 2017 ISA Worlds in Denmark. Next year, the Aussies and French will be heading to Brazil (photo: Ben Reed/ISA) \nTime to brush up on your \u201cbom dia\u201ds and \u201cobrigado\u201ds \u2014 the International Surfing Association just announced the host for next year\u2019s ISA Worlds: Brazil. \nThe 2018 championship event \u2013 the 7th annual edition \u2013 will be hosted in Brazil from November 23 \u2013 December 1 (dates are tentative, according to the official release). The venue is the postcard-perfect resort town of B\u00fazios, which sits on the coast about an hour north of Rio de Janeiro and has a long history of hosting domestic SUP races. \nToday\u2019s announcement will give both the host nation and teams from around the world almost an entire year to prepare, which is very good news. \nHowever, the proposed dates do run extremely close to the big races in Paris and Perth \u2014 the ISA originally had this event penciled in for October, so I assume the \u201ctentative\u201d nature of the dates means it may be brought forward slightly. But for now, plan on the final week of November. \nMuted talk about Brazil started swirling back at the Worlds in Denmark, but the deal wasn\u2019t officially confirmed until a couple of weeks ago. Other host nations that got thrown around in the annual ISA rumour mill included France, Tahiti, Israel and South Africa, however I don\u2019t believe any of them made a formal bid this year. \nThe success of finding a host nation for what is a relatively expensive event is a triumph for the ISA, especially given their battle with the ICF over the Olympic side of the sport (the ICF is expected to announce their own SUP \u201cworld championship\u201d shortly). \nWhile we might see a drop in participating teams given the logistics of traveling to Brazil (Denmark and its ease of access in Europe helped set a record for participation), no doubt this event will provide the ultimate festival atmosphere. B\u00fazios is a beautiful beachside location, while anyone that\u2019s ever visited the country will tell you the locals know how to have fun (can the Brazilians beat the Danes and host a record number of after-parties?). The golden beaches of Buzios, Brazil, will play host to the world of paddleboarding in November 2018 \nI recently chatted with ISA Vice President Casper Steinfath about the prospect of heading to Brazil, and this is what \u201cThe Viking\u201d had to say: \n\u201cThere\u2019s something special about Brazil and the passion the community has for surfing and SUP. I think it\u2019s going to add even more energy to the event. It was incredible experience to be the host in Denmark, though I certainly look forward to merely being a guest at the 2018 ISA Worlds! \nCasper jokingly added that he\u2019ll \u201chave to share some tips with Vinni about how to schedule 178 different interviews while also preparing to compete.\u201d \nVinni is of course Vinnicius Martins, Brazil\u2019s best-known and highest-ranked racing export over the past half a decade. \nI chatted with Vinni last week and got his thoughts on the imminent Brazil announcement. Not only is the ISA event coming to his home country, Buzios is actually Vinni\u2019s hometown, which gives him the honour of being the unofficial \u201chost athlete\u201d for the event (though first he\u2019ll have to qualify for the national team \u2014 no small order given the level of talent in Brazil these days). \n\u201cOne of the nicest things about the SUP community for me is to travel the world and paddle in the hometowns of my friends and fellow competitors. They give you the best tips and really make you feel like a local. So I can\u2019t wait to give back and let people know all the amazing things B\u00fazios has to offer. I\u2019m sure everyone will enjoy the amazing conditions on the water and the exciting Brazilian culture on land!\u201d \n(On a side note, Vinni actually runs the \u201c Por B\u00fazios \u201d adventure company in his spare time, which does exactly what he just said: shows people the funnest spots to explore in B\u00fazios.) Vinnicius Martins at home in Buzios (photo: Anna Veronica) \nIn other news, the ISA is expected to confirm to national federations this week that, starting in 2018, all ISA events will be 14\u2032 instead of 12\u20196 (for both men and women), which would be a positive step that should go a long way to helping resolve the infamous board class debate. \nThe 2018 ISA Worlds in Brazil is a collaboration between the Brazilian Sports Ministry, the City of Buzios and the Brazilian Surfing Confederation (CBSurf), which shows the commitment this nation has to surfing-related sports. \nSurfing has cemented itself as a top 10 sport in the Brazil over recent years, which will hopefully trickle down to stand up paddling in terms of support from government and corporate sponsors as well as general participation numbers. The Brazilian surfing and paddling community is one of the most passionate and dedicated on the planet (two of the past three WSL men\u2019s world champions come from the Brazilian Storm ), and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll welcome the world with a warm embrace in 12 months\u2019 time. \nWhile it\u2019s a little too early to start talking form guides, many nations have already held their 2018 ISA qualifiers with the likes of France and Australia set to field impressive squads (though again, that depends on the Worlds avoiding a clash with the big Aussie downwind races in late November/early December). \nAlthough we\u2019re almost full 365 days out from the event, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much of a risk to say Oz/France will start favourites for the prestigious team trophy (assuming they send their top talent). \nBut could the home team cause an upset? For sure. \nIn addition to Vinni, Brazil has produced dozens of world-class paddlers including Caio Vaz, Nicole Pacelli, Guillerhme dos Reis, Aline Adisaka, Leco Salazar and this year\u2019s SUP surfing gold medalist Luiz Diniz.

Its more the three year olds that still walk around with them in there mouth that bothered me. Paige and Parker never took one but Harleigh felt different. I felt like she needed one. She took one and we didn't really think anything of it. When she turned one she had her first dentist appointment. I won't lie the dentist scared me once she knew she had a dummy. So I decided to get rid of it.  \nShe only really used it for nap times and bed times but would have it occasionally during the day if she was teething as it helped calm her.  \nI decided to go cold turkey and take it away completely. I didn't want to try nap times first and then give it her for bedtimes as I didn't want to confuse her.  \n\nThe first few days were rough. I was used to placing Harleigh in her cot and having her fall asleep on her own, with the dummy this became a lot harder. The first nap she took 1 hour 10 minutes to go asleep, this was with me going in to comfort her every few minutes. She slept 40 minutes whereas usually she would sleep 1.5 hours. The second nap was better. She only took 20 minutes to go down but slept 1.5 hours. Then  nighttime came and this is what I was dreading the most but she only woke up once around 2am for half an hour and then went back off.  The naps went very similar for the next few days, sometimes she would skip her morning nap all together but then have a good afternoon one. The second night was one of the worst nights we've ever had, she wouldn't settle at all and wanted to be held all night.  \n\nSince then things are still a little up and down. She has just finished a leap so maybe my timing wasn't the best and I should of waited until after the leap but I can't change that now. She hasn't had her dummy since November 22nd and the picture above is the last picture I have of her with her dummy. Its such a bittersweet moment. She looks so much more grown up sleeping without a dummy but we thought it would be best to get rid of it now rather than wait a year and try get rid at 2.  \n\nI am happy we got rid but it'd been a little rough.

Stephy Mavididi could return to the PNE squad at Burton on Saturday \nThe Arsenal loanee missed the games against Norwich and Queens Park Rangers but has been back in training. \nDefender Woods pulled up in training last week, forcing him out of the win over QPR. \nNorth End boss Alex Neil said: \u201cStephy has trained this week and I expect him to be fit for the weekend. \n\u201cAs long as he comes through the rest of the week, he should be fine. \n\u201cStephy had tweaked his hamstring a little bit. \n\u201cThat was probably down to the fact he had not played in a lot of games and then had a few together \u2013 he played for England Under-20s and then successive games for us. \n\u201cThat took it\u2019s toll on his body a bit but hopefully he will be fine.\u201d \nMavididi was used up front in Jordan Hugill\u2019s absence against Bolton last month. \nHe then started the 2-1 win over Bristol City alongside Hugill as Neil opted to play two strikers. \nIt was early in the second half at Ashton Gate that the 19-year-old got the injury and had to be substituted. \nNeil was more reserved about Woods\u2019 hopes of being on the bus to Burton. \n\u201cWe will have to monitor Calum as the week goes on,\u201d said Neil. \n\u201cI think that one will be a late decision but we\u2019ve still got a bit of time.\u201d \nOne player definitely back available for the Burton game is Daniel Johnson. \nThe midfielder missed the QPR victory as he was serving a one-match suspension for five yellow cards. \nSlowly, more options are becoming available to Neil as the queue for the treatment room shortens. \nHowever, patience will be needed for a while longer with some of the walking wounded. \nSaid Neil: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bit of a way to go with some of them. \n\u201cGreg Cunningham who was our No.1 left-back at the start of the season, hasn\u2019t been available for a large part. \n\u201cJosh Earl who took Greg\u2019s place, had surgery last week and will take a few weeks to get back. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got Sean Maguire who was so influential, in the same boat. \n\u201cTommy Spurr has had knee surgery, so there you have four key players who aren\u2019t available to us yet. \n\u201cPeople sometimes forget about these lads because they have been out of the limelight day in and day out. \n\u201cBut we see the lads every day and see how hard they work behind the scenes. \n\u201cIt will be nice when we get them back.\u201d Follow Us On", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "preston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean maguire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "said neil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg cunningham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh earl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tommy spurr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hugill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephy mavididi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mavididi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woods", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bolton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calum woods", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex neil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wyre & garstang arsenal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qpr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "queens park rangers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "burton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norwich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashton gate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bristol city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:12:37.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7eacec67138d2c9b8299cd826cc3fdff22a3e927", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzuW0Up1GA78hY1rCz1aAuFGOtfAfBB.ZnQsw0CYwKfyrK3Apc8DUxUIzs20PQ5aumbSX7jhvCOZyMg7MlMkxQrwdc6bnIANpczYeG.Yo4lnVOcKFXpBqSkftrNi1Lz_v5Ju7fC.sPowwvRxSdEwBoi", "site_full": "forums.hardwarezone.com.sg", "site": "hardwarezone.com.sg", "site_section": "http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/handheld-mobile-gaming-384/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Handheld and Mobile Gaming -

Aren't we horror fans grateful for the 1970s, when so many directors decided to grace us with their best work? And mustn't Stephen King have been grateful (and probably a bit surprised) when his first published horror novel was turned into what has long been acknowledged as one of director Brian de Palma's best films? What if you'd gone to see CARRIE only knowing about, say, 1974's PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE? \"Maybe it'll be a laugh, with a few songs and some funny performances mixed in there.\" Then again, maybe not. \n\nForget the remakes (yes there have been two so far - in 2002 with Angela Bettis and then in 2013 with Chloe Grave Moretz). I can remember nothing about either, mainly I suspect because de Palma's original is so good that it needs someone of extraordinary skill and vision to make anything comparable, combined with the supremely talented cast and crew he had at his disposal, & it hasn't happened yet.  \n\nCARRIE has been released in the UK and the US on Blu-ray befpre in markedly different packages. To anyone / everyone who may wonder why anyone would release the film again, here's what you need to know: It's a 4k transfer that looks better than any other Blu-ray incarnation. All the extras from the previous UK MGM Blu-ray release have been ported over (two 40-minute documentaries, 6 minute piece on the musical and a trailer) All the extras from the US Scream Factory Region A release have been ported over as well (except for a still gallery and text gallery). This includes all the interviews with screenwriter Laurence D Cohen, DP Mario Tosi, composer Pino Donaggio, editor Paul Hirsch and casting director Harriet Helberg.  \n\nThere are new extras in the form of a commentary track from Lee Gambin and Alexandra Heller-Nicholas and a 21 minute visual essay comparing the various adaptations of the novel over the years.  Arrow's package also comes with a 60 page book with new writing on the film by Neil Mitchell, a reprint of a 40th anniversary fanzine and an archive interview with Brian de Palma.  CARRIE is a classic worthy of a place in the library of any film fan (and not just horror aficionados). Arrow's set is absolutely gorgeous and impressively exhaustive. Another must-buy from the company.  \nArrow Films are bringing out Brian de Palma's CARRIE on Blu-ray on Monday 11th December 2017 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian de palma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carrie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mario tosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de palma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandra heller-nicholas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul hirsch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laurence d cohen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pino donaggio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carrie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee gambin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chloe grave moretz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angela bettis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harriet helberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen king", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:12:39.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70cd46ac880eca50a32be05a04438e600873f4b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCHrHxSYgLNTX2liNq_rqyrzCwKNbsibUtnAhqcZUgqRVA9Ll_P6T6jjn6qPUuHnA-", "site_full": "spikerwindows.livejournal.com", "site": "livejournal.com", "site_section": "http://spikerwindows.livejournal.com/data/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "spikerwindows", "title": "Save your electricity bills by using Upvc windows", "title_full": "Save your electricity bills by using Upvc windows", "published": "2017-12-07T09:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/spikerwindows/73661460/51658/51658_original.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "70cd46ac880eca50a32be05a04438e600873f4b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCHrHxSYgLNTX2liNq_rqyrzCwKNbsibUtnAhqcZUgqRVA9Ll_P6T6jjn6qPUuHnA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "Save your electricity bills by using Upvc windows", "text": "December 7 2017, 13:02 Save your electricity bills by using Upvc windows \nAre you getting more electricity bills ??. Rising electricity bills bothers both institutions and individuals. Air-conditioners, heaters are essential materials in the home or in corporate buildings, but these equipment cause maximum electricity bills. People take many precautionary measures to keep low electricity bill like trying to use more energy efficient devices and minimizing the use of this equipment. Government always encourages the manufacturing and using of energy efficient materials. Only a few people understand that energy can be lost through doors and windows. Some windows and doors may look closed but there will be tiny gaps or holes that may be because of low-quality materials. \nPacking up windows and doors spaces is not only the importance of modern buildings. They should also behave as a rainproof and decay proof as well. A drop of water can rot or rust the furniture or window itself. Wooden windows don't possess any of these characters as they get easily rusted after it is exposed to water and started decaying, repainting or re-polishing is always required in wooden windows and doesn\u2019t have a long life as termite can affect the material. \nIn India intensity of UV radiations is more. UV radiations can cause skin pigmentation and can also cause dermatological consequences. So it is very essential to get best quality windows and doors that protect from UV radiation. With all these qualities windows and doors should also look good uniquely designed. \nThe best solution for all these requirements is in UPVC . This product is refined version of polyvinyl chloride. Upvc windows and doors have many advantages as compared to other products and frames are very strong. Upvc is a material which has high strength, durability. Upvc windows are the first choice of any builders, architects. These materials are eco-friendly and better than wood. Spiker windows is one of the best UPVC windows and doors manufacturers and supply to all over India, even to international markets.

From what I gather each simulate their own bodies and collide with world static geometry but not anything else.\nhttps://youtu.be/FwDT2b-8x9c?t=16m41s\nIt's seems easy to use RigidBody to do ponytails and \"dangly bits\". You just insert the RigidBody node right before your final pose and then set the physics type of the bodies you want simulated to \"simulate\" in your physics asset. (They also recommend using a separate physics asset for your character that only has bodies for the \"dangly\" bits)\nI'm guessing for ragdolls you would just set all bodies to simulate. However I think there must also be property changes you need to make in your character's skeletal mesh component to transition into ragdoll? For example if I have my mesh using the \"character\" collision preset it will just fall through the floor when it goes into simulation mode.\nIt seems everything I've tried that *does* actually get my characters to go into ragdoll and not just fall through the floor would also work even if i wasn't using the RigidBody node.

One such scene involves Prince Philip, on a visit to Stephen Ward, osteopath to the A-list, hearing about a weekend party he is organising.\nPhilip spies a picture on the mantelpiece. \u201cThat\u2019s Christine,\u201d says Ward. \u201cShe\u2019ll be there and Mandy will be there too.\u201d When years later the Profumo scandal breaks, writer Peter Morgan, still exercising his dramatist\u2019s licence to thrill, has Philip telling the Queen he never took up Ward\u2019s invitation.\nThat the show should try to tie Philip, however tangentially or fictitiously, to the Profumo affair shows the mesmerising allure of the scandal even after all these years. If there was ever any doubt about this, the reaction to the death this week of \u201cChristine\u201d, Christine Keeler, has wiped it away like dust from an old photograph.\nWith the demise of a 75-year-old woman in a hospital in Kent we are suddenly back in 1963 again. Cue minister of war Profumo arriving at the Commons where he will lie about the affair. Cue West End good time girls Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies flitting to and from court. Cue pictures of the Russian naval attache, cue Harold Macmillan humiliated, cue Keeler in a swimsuit \u2026 We know the story so well it has acquired the status of a repeat. The Great Escape might only show at Christmas but the Profumo affair is always with us.\nLest a film, a play, books, and documentaries have not been enough, there is a new six-part BBC drama, The Trial of Christine Keeler, out next year. Its writer, Amanda Coe, describes the story as \u201cthe Salem Witch Trial meets OJ Simpson \u2013 a perfect storm of gender, class, race and power that resonates into the world we\u2019re living in today\u201d.\nKeeler cashed in on her own story of course, many times. Yet in any settlement of accounts for the Profumo affair, she remained firmly in the column of those who lost out badly. She did not seek refuge in a life of charitable works like Profumo (who was awarded a CBE a decade later), or find escape in suicide, like Ward. Keeler took a spectacular dive into infamy only to find no-one had filled the swimming pool.\nThough she tried to start again \u2013 new name, marriages, children, a succession of low-paid jobs \u2013 she was never able to escape the shadow cast by Profumo. The shame initially heaped on her head stayed with her for life. She became that dreadful thing, a cautionary tale. As her son, Seymour, put it: \u201cShe earned her place in British history but at a huge personal price.\u201d\nIt was telling that the reaction to news of Keeler\u2019s death has been largely sympathetic. Finally, we seem to have grown up, seeing Ms Keeler for what she was: a young woman, just 19 when she met Profumo, who fell in with a crowd of men who were older and vastly more powerful than herself, and who used her for their own ends.\nViewed from that angle, the whole Swinging Sixties scene, the benefits of which only seem to have been available to a handful of those and such of those, were a sham in which the new bosses were the same as the old bosses \u2013 men. We would never put up with such an obscene imbalance of power today, would we? We would never allow rich, powerful, badly behaving men to break young women like so many butterflies on a wheel, would we?\nThose last inquiries, lest there be any doubt, should be played out against a background of hollow laughter. For we know with the Weinstein scandal, and the many more people who have come forward with allegations (mostly women, but men too), that the power gap was never closed. Despite time and legislation passing, it continued, just as before.\nIf anything, it was easier for the less powerful in the Profumo Affair, Ms Keeler and Ms Rice-Davies, to have their say. The age of deference was on its way out, helped by a bold, voracious press. The story broke relatively quickly, and thereafter there was no holding it back.\nContrast this with how long the lid appears to have been kept on the allegations surfacing today. Consider, too, the ways in which alleged victims were ostracised, silenced by threats of legal action, or by fear they would not be believed. The New York Times, which has led the way on Weinstein, produced fresh revelations yesterday about what it called the workings of his \u201ccomplicity machine\u201d staffed by \u201cenablers, silencers and spies\u201d.\nAll of which makes the fightback of 2017, a year defined by scandal as surely as 1963, seem even more incredible, bordering on miraculous. Several things have made the difference in helping the previously powerless take on Goliath. First and foremost has been the bravery of those who have come forward. Next is the crucial part played by social media. Being able to get the story out there, to ask for support, to feel that safety in numbers, heartened those who came forward first and encouraged others to follow.\nThe old dead-tree media played its part too, piling time, money, and energy into taking on those who had too often been able to shut down inquiry with the threat of legal action.\nLet us not get too carried away at how far we have come, however. As you may have noticed, the backlash is already here. It has started small, with a series of half-baked apologies peppered with words like \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d and \u201cmissteps\u201d, that make you wonder if the person saying sorry is genuinely contrite, or just sorry they were called out. Add to this the number of people, women often to the fore, who are questioning what all the fuss is about, and it is clear that there is a long way to go before those scales of power are anywhere close to being balanced.\nAs for Ms Keeler, she is the last of the main Profumo cast to depart. The story will never go away, but as reaction to her death has shown, it can be viewed differently, smaller voices can be picked out from the din.\n\u201cWe are all very proud of who she was,\u201d said her son. I hope, in the end, she came close to feeling the same.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christine keeler", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alison rowat", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "christine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen ward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandy rice-davies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oj simpson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice-davies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keeler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "profumo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harold macmillan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amanda coe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seymour", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "profumo affair", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kent", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:12:39.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "64ab5f5f4f1d99dd5032eda1d24881fb463b7030", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBIoXOvuuG_adDeCg9qU1ULKxSkc2_6PmB5194kRGBKL4ND42dlQL42XlZrzzO86VakUGRcKmjnJyR", "site_full": "www.lse.co.uk", "site": "lse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.lse.co.uk/share-chat.asp?page=201", "site_categories": ["united_kingdom", "travel", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Share Chat on London South East.

Toffee, Coconut and Pecans have never tasted so good! \nChristmas baking has commenced at my place. Every year I make sweets after sweets after sweets. All of my family members have their favorites but I always like to try something new every year. Oh don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ll still be making Snickerdoodles , Spritz Cookies and this trifle . But I\u2019ll also be updating some old recipes to give them a little kick this year. Stay tuned for that. But to kick off the holidays I present this German Chocolate Christmas Crack. \nMy holiday baking started off early this year. I began experimenting during Halloween. I took this take on the classic Saltine Toffee aka Christmas Crack and pumped it up. You know the one where you melt sugar and butter and pour it over saltine crackers. I first saw Trisha Yearwood make it on her show years ago. \nI can never leave well enough alone and decided to make it into a Samoa/German Chocolate Christmas Crack. Oh. Em. Gee. The addition of the toasted coconut, caramel and nuts on top is absolutely divine and totally addicting. \nI brought this to our office party and it was an absolute hit. I\u2019m already planning to take it to a couple of Christmas parties I have going on this year. It\u2019s super simple but tastes like it took a lot of time to meld the flavors. \nThe hardest part is letting it set!

And was even planning to back the Horde until Garrosh alienated all the other races in the Horde.\nAll of this \"siding with the Alliance\" thing could be a long con.
