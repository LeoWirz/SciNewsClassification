The product aims to add internal ND style functionality to the DSCM2 line up.\nThe Revolva is a complete lens mount for RED DSCM2 bodies available in either PL or EF mount. iData for PL & lens communication for EF is passed through which is important to maintain functionality of EF lens control & stabilisation. \u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nQuick Specs Price: \u00a32000. Shipping Q1 2018. Includes complete PL or EF mount for RED DSMC2 and two cartridges covering ND 0 (clear) to 2.1 ND in 1 stop steps. Slot in upper right side of mount receives easily swapped cartridge. Each cartridge has four filter positions, changed by rotating orange wheel. Always quick to return to clear filter. No backfocus shift. Most PL and all common EF lenses compatible. PL and EF both have OEM circuitry and firmware support. Designed and made by KipperTie in the UK. Pre-orders open Dec 2017.\nRevolva Cartridges The Revolva uses a quick change cartridge system with each containing four filters. Rotating the filter wheel results in changing the filter. The individual filters in the cartridges are not user changeable.\n\u200b\n\u200b On its release, KipperTie has the following filter cartridges with further cartridges in development:\nND Cartridge 1: 0 (clear) / 0.3 / 0.6 / 0.9 ND Cartridge 2: 1.2 / 1.5 / 1.8 / 2.1 Diffusion Cartridge #1: Gold / Carbon / Pearl / Optical Clear\n\u200b\nBackfocus Compensation Kippertie claims that back focus is compensated for in the Revolva with the filters having a high refractive index rear optical window combined with precise and specific flange depths. Adjusting back focus on RED DSCM2 body can also be done manually.\nWhat are the negatives? Certain lenses just don\u2019t fit. A small number of lenses vignette on VV. Gate flare when not using a sunshade is potentially different from normal expectation. Certain combinations of camera accessories will obstruct fitment and require changes to your rigging.\nPricing & Availability The Revolva is available for pre-order with the kits priced at \u00a32000. The diffusion cartridge is priced at \u00a3750. The Revolva is expected to start shipping in March/April 2018.\nConsidering the price of a standard DSCM2 lens mount, matte box with accessories & the individual ND filters, the Revolva does look like great value. \ucd9c\ucc98:\nhttp://www.newsshooter.com/2017/12/07/revolva-built-filtration-red-dscm2/\nRevolva - Built-in filtration for RED DSCM2 - Newsshooter KipperTie announce the Revolva, built-in filtration for RED DSCM2 camera bodies www.newsshooter.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://kippertie.com/revolva/", "http://dthumb.phinf.naver.net/?src=%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsshooter.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F12%2Frevolva.jpg%22&type=f560_336", "http://postfiles2.naver.net/MjAxNzEyMDdfMjQz/MDAxNTEyNjI3Mjc1Njg2.DShHwDWLyij_-G8QRDhSehbdSm1GbkJ2qldXfo5SQtkg.6lrvU7FXeXYrA_Rm-KRyZF4VsaOtuIu1y9PSf3NNfGsg.JPEG.1967jk/2.jpg?type=w1", "http://www.newsshooter.com/2017/12/07/revolva-built-filtration-red-dscm2/", "http://static.naver.net/blank.gif", "http://postfiles8.naver.net/MjAxNzEyMDdfMTYy/MDAxNTEyNjI3Mjc1MTky.at3suzUVEioNyzBtVS8ieE4PDlwIRsNtqtr3RGpCu3Ig.cUat3jWir6jgGtJgTqTDxw_IEq9mj-WArQ6dqCN5-S4g.JPEG.1967jk/1.jpg?type=w1", "https://kippertie.com/", "http://postfiles9.naver.net/MjAxNzEyMDdfMTcx/MDAxNTEyNjI3Mjc2MDAx.bHAPG9MFKsStPK9KrCCbEYASBR6j7q7ZjXRSEInat4sg.3vpImDco6gpRiXIv8Nbj8EIajkxPbz5LMkhU-l6BjnEg.JPEG.1967jk/4.jpg?type=w1", "http://postfiles11.naver.net/MjAxNzEyMDdfMTYw/MDAxNTEyNjI3Mjc1ODMx.elK8ZIlNQFlVJIdGtsC7MhVWKU9vmvdKWAWRP2nKvysg.PmY59VGvLEUTvr51zw88tOrxpagDRK51vSFgWarMj7kg.JPEG.1967jk/3.jpg?type=w1"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kippertie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nd cartridge", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pearl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:35.083+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "38650d6b3d694acae94497efa17f3f2189ba1966", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS99qQBXA1ahWl5T5MeFphzfZCygvAAlQSAGROKja.uOU1N.tz8HTdAf41PPyAVcaVWsJ8gAjghFA--", "site_full": "www.moneyam.com", "site": "moneyam.com", "site_section": "http://moneyam.com//news/rss.php/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "options"], "section_title": "MoneyAM News", "title": "Land Secs Cap Mkts Indicative Results of Offers", "title_full": "Land Secs Cap Mkts Indicative Results of Offers", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "38650d6b3d694acae94497efa17f3f2189ba1966", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS99qQBXA1ahWl5T5MeFphzfZCygvAAlQSAGROKja.uOU1N.tz8HTdAf41PPyAVcaVWsJ8gAjghFA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "Land Secs Cap Mkts Indicative Results of Offers", "text": "The Offeror will announce the final aggregate principal amount of Notes of each Series accepted for purchase as soon as reasonably practicable after the Pricing Time.

(And this was a spoiler, of course.) A bunch of people end up in the afterlife, which turns out to be very different from what they expected, but against all odds they manage to evolve and build relationships. It\u2019s created by Michael Shur, of Parks and Recreation fame, and Kristen Bell stars as Eleanor, a truly awful person who learns to be not necessarily good, more like human.\nHow I found it: \nI saw a trailer before it started and I really didn\u2019t like it. I thought the jokes simplistic and couldn\u2019t imagine how they would keep up the premise in any interesting way at all.\nSummary judgment:\nIt surprised me! While it\u2019s not as funny as Parks and Rec , it\u2019s funny enough but, most of all, the ongoing arc turns out really interesting.\nBest things about it:\nIt\u2019s a smart show, with little ongoing jokes and meaningful background details. It\u2019s got a consistent visual style that is pleasant to watch with the bright colors and the theatrical artifice. The actors are great and make you slowly learn to like the characters. But most of all, while it has a lot of funny ideas, it also manages to get you invested in the long-term story.\nWorst things about it: \nYou really need to wait through the first two episodes or so to become invested in the characters because Eleonor is truly awful at first and impossible to root for. Luckily, the episodes are short and the whole thing quite breezy so in no time you find yourself excited about the developments.\nOther pluses:\n\u2724 It doesn\u2019t fall flat on its not-that-exciting premise and finds new things to do with it. In this it differs from most \u201cStatus Quo Is God\u201d sitcoms.\n\u2724 It has so many quotable lines though I will need to re-watch it to cite anything specific.\n\u2724 I enjoyed Adam Scott\u2019s appearance so much, especially because he was so different from Ben. I hope to see more Parks and Rec alumni in the future.\nOther minuses: \n\u2724 Sometimes the philosophical part is a bit clunky, especially when the shows is trying (?) to teach the viewers about the studies of morality.

The stock has experienced bearish momentum as it\u2019s ATR or Average True Range has dipped consistently over the past 10 sessions. \nWhen focusing on technical stock analysis, traders and investors may choose to also study the ATR or Average True Range. The present 14-day ATR for Ester Industries Limited (ESTER.NS) is currently standing at 2.00. The ATR basically measures the volatility of a stock on a day-to-day basis. The average true range is typically based on 14 periods and may be calculated daily, weekly, monthly, or intraday.

Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would support a strong trend.

Many investors look to the Relative   reading of a particular stock to help identify overbought/oversold conditions. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970\u2019s. Wilder laid out the foundation for future technical analysts to further investigate the RSI and its relationship to underlying price movements. Since its inception, RSI has remained very popular with traders and investors. Other technical analysts have built upon the work of Wilder. The 14-day RSI is still a widely popular choice among technical stock analysts. \nInvestors may be watching other technical indicators such as the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. The Williams %R is a momentum indicator that helps measure oversold and overbought levels. This indicator compares the closing price of a stock in relation to the highs and lows over a certain time period. A common look back period is 14 days. Ester Industries Limited (ESTER.NS)\u2019s Williams %R presently stands at -90.35. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would indicate an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would indicate an oversold situation. \nTaking a closer look from a technical standpoint, Ester Industries Limited (ESTER.NS) presently has   -237.02. Typically, the CCI oscillates above and below a zero line. Normal oscillations tend to stay in the range of -100 to +100. A CCI reading of +100 may represent overbought conditions, while readings near -100 may indicate oversold territory. Although the CCI indicator was developed for commodities, it has become a popular tool for equity evaluation as well. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ester ind", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ester industries limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:36.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6cb2fcb45246d0288f3f11c1e3da93b6f77825fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzqFJpqHknnua48TOKL92uSwUt2_8Mv2qUjmLnkPkeklyUWkmhJDW2pb", "site_full": "www.booking.com", "site": "booking.com", "site_section": "https://www.booking.com/hotel/tr/yenisehirpalas.en-gb.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "The Peak Hotel, \u0130stanbul, Turkey - Booking.com ", "title": "1959 Verified Hotel Reviews of The Peak Hotel | Booking.com", "title_full": "1959 Verified Hotel Reviews of The Peak Hotel | Booking.com", "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 74, "participants_count": 63, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://t-ec.bstatic.com/static/img/facebook-image-else/566c7081f1deeaca39957e96365c3908f83b95af.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 105, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8f9e6530def9207f3c637834b2ac50370dac2d7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzqFJpqHknnua48TOKL92uSwUt2_8Mv2qUjmLnkPkeklybuTWU3JrqUj4BIj9EJfEQePndRw8m7.c3ulo37Pw05SDLjAiumWHN0-", "ord_in_thread": 74, "author": "Fiaz", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\"Good location and reception staff.

Il nome del fortunato giocatore viene ovviamente mantenuto top secret: in paese si dice che sia un habitu\u00e9 del locale, una persona del posto, che dopo avere giocato tante volte senza successo questa volta \u00e8 stata baciata dalla fortuna (e con gli interessi). \n\nHa offerto da bere \nQuando il giocatore si \u00e8 accorto della vincita non ci voleva credere. Poi si \u00e8 ripreso dallo choc e ha subito offerto da bere. Amos Ubertini, il titolare del \u00abBig Mama\u00bb, non rivela il nome del fortunato: \u00abSono contento perch\u00e9\u00e8 una persona perbene - dice Ubertini -. La fortuna questa volta ha premiato una brava persona. Non fatemi dire di pi\u00f9, non posso, \u00e8 una questione di correttezza\u00bb.

Il mio augurio \u00e8 che questa vincita non rimanga isolata, ma ne arrivino altre, anche perch\u00e9 la gente ne ha bisogno\u00bb. In passato il \u00abBig Mama\u00bb ha gi\u00e0 distribuito biglietti fortunati, ma non di questo livello: \u00abAbbiamo avuto vincite di 10 mila euro, che sono gi\u00e0 una bella cifra, ma nessuno \u00e8 mai riuscito a portare a casa un bottino cos\u00ec alto\u00bb. Oltre al \u00abGratta & vinci\u00bb a Cavaglio d\u2019Agogna va ancora forte anche il gioco del Lotto: ogni settimana qualcuno riesce ad ottenere un buon gruzzoletto, in genere si tratta di qualche centinaio di euro.

The stock has experienced bearish momentum as it\u2019s ATR or Average True Range has dipped consistently over the past 10 sessions. \nWhen focusing on technical stock analysis, traders and investors may choose to also study the ATR or Average True Range. The present 14-day ATR for Bio Green Papers Ltd (BGPL.BO) is currently standing at 0.03. The ATR basically measures the volatility of a stock on a day-to-day basis. The average true range is typically based on 14 periods and may be calculated daily, weekly, monthly, or intraday. The ATR is not considered a directional indicator, but it may reflect the strength of a particular move. \nCurrently, the 14-day ADX for Bio Green Papers Ltd (BGPL.BO) is sitting at 61.63. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would support a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would identify a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would lead to an extremely strong trend. ADX is used to gauge trend strength but not trend direction.

Many investors look to the Relative   reading of a particular stock to help identify overbought/oversold conditions. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970\u2019s. Wilder laid out the foundation for future technical analysts to further investigate the RSI and its relationship to underlying price movements. Since its inception, RSI has remained very popular with traders and investors. Other technical analysts have built upon the work of Wilder. The 14-day RSI is still a widely popular choice among technical stock analysts. \nInvestors may be watching other technical indicators such as the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. The Williams %R is a momentum indicator that helps measure oversold and overbought levels. This indicator compares the closing price of a stock in relation to the highs and lows over a certain time period. A common look back period is 14 days. Bio Green Papers Ltd (BGPL.BO)\u2019s Williams %R presently stands at 0.00. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would indicate an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would indicate an oversold situation. \nTaking a closer look from a technical standpoint, Bio Green Papers Ltd (BGPL.BO) presently has   78.27. Typically, the CCI oscillates above and below a zero line. Normal oscillations tend to stay in the range of -100 to +100. A CCI reading of +100 may represent overbought conditions, while readings near -100 may indicate oversold territory. Although the CCI indicator was developed for commodities, it has become a popular tool for equity evaluation as well. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wilder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bio green papers ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:36.066+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a1bf9e7eb9c54a08fc1c89a9cbce13820febedc0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_WsNOuPOZGHrsYm.vqAXwlx3L3iz.2XWKgmHznt_pQAzJp9c8Exve92lzvrAeQjEOtrUtMPFNNvc30NtBnn50z", "site_full": "www.weirduniverse.net", "site": "weirduniverse.net", "site_section": "http://www.weirduniverse.net/blog/rss_2.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Weird Universe", "title": "Official fog watchers", "title_full": "Official fog watchers", "published": "2017-12-06T14:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a1bf9e7eb9c54a08fc1c89a9cbce13820febedc0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_WsNOuPOZGHrsYm.vqAXwlx3L3iz.2XWKgmHznt_pQAzJp9c8Exve92lzvrAeQjEOtrUtMPFNNvc30NtBnn50z", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T14:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "Official fog watchers", "text": "I don't know why, but this seems like a very British type of job.

(WAVY) \u2014 The USS Gerald R. Ford successfully completed its first underway replenishment (UNREP) Monday.\n\nDuring an UNREP, supplies such as fuel, ammunition and food are sent across cables from another ship.\n\nUSNS William McLean transferred 16,000 gallons of jet fuel (JP-5) to the ship.\n\nThe successful completion of the UNREP was a huge milestone for the Ford, which is underway conducting test and evaluation operations.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most important qualifications we need for the ship,\u201d said Boatswain\u2019s Mate 2nd Class Christopher Joseph in a press release.\n\nThe number of times a UNREP can occur while out to sea varies on the mission of the ship, according to Joseph.\n\nWith the Ford being a brand new, first-in-class aircraft carrier, sailors anxiously anticipated the experience.\n\n\u201cThis is our first time doing this,\u201d said Boatswain\u2019s Mate Seaman Chauncey Cram in a press release. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting a long time to do an UNREP, and I\u2019m pretty excited.\u201d\n\nA lot goes into preparation for an UNREP to ensure everything goes smoothly. Safety is also a key factor in the operation.\n\nChief Boatswain\u2019s Mate Robert Shirley said in a press release, \u201cThis is probably the most dangerous evolution that Deck department does; it\u2019s two ships side-by-side going through the water hooked up by tension wire. There\u2019s always a danger. We can\u2019t get rid of all of the danger, but we mitigate it the best we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday was a significant day for the ship and our crew,\u201d said Capt. Richard C. McCormack, Ford\u2019s commanding officer, \u201cThis is an important milestone in the life of the ship and I could not be more proud of how the team came together to make today\u2019s UNREP a success.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis Post's News source is WAVY.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "usns william mclean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boatswain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chauncey cram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard c. mccormack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert shirley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher joseph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r. ford", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "uss gerald ford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unrep", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "va.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portsmouth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jp-5", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:36.074+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e6026ea3e4b06951eae3f101cedbe78988f04714", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWxDqguzhyfS0Nb_zkTFpDQ9mESuTtNOHDHZvZSosgqt1.gxxm8.NBvFjoHLaSw16ZUWT5CBYf_Bg4ihV7wt1viBybmzksGug3R69hZHY_rnCQS49y1MB4hSRAewFjlmbwkAo7xGMDHoM-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-laundry-cleaning/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Laundry &amp; Cleaning - Buy Laundry &amp; Cleaning at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "Durable Steel & Adjustable Height Single Garment Rack", "title_full": "Durable Steel & Adjustable Height Single Garment Rack | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2015-10-07T18:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 45, "participants_count": 44, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0813b4b6c545e841ba9812dad6283d916bbdf1dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWxDqguzhyfS0Nb_zkTFpDQ9mESuTtNOHDHZvZSosgqt1.gxxm8.NBvFjoHLaSw16ZUWT5CBYf_Bg4ihV7wt1viBybmzksGug3R69hZHY_rnCQS49y1MB4hSRAewFjlmbw2RVSdqEf4BC1_CP0vKhxNQ--", "ord_in_thread": 42, "author": "Nor S.", "published": "2017-11-22T15:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "Four Stars", "text": "ok", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:36.115+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e6026ea3e4b06951eae3f101cedbe78988f04714", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWxDqguzhyfS0Nb_zkTFpDQ9mESuTtNOHDHZvZSosgqt1.gxxm8.NBvFjoHLaSw16ZUWT5CBYf_Bg4ihV7wt1viBybmzksGug3R69hZHY_rnCQS49y1MB4hSRAewFjlmbwkAo7xGMDHoM-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-laundry-cleaning/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Laundry &amp; Cleaning - Buy Laundry &amp; Cleaning at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "Durable Steel & Adjustable Height Single Garment Rack", "title_full": "Durable Steel & Adjustable Height Single Garment Rack | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2015-10-07T18:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 45, "participants_count": 44, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8d05297fb11fa966072799354e1f6f29922735bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWxDqguzhyfS0Nb_zkTFpDQ9mESuTtNOHDHZvZSosgqt1.gxxm8.NBvFjoHLaSw16ZUWT5CBYf_Bg4ihV7wt1viBybmzksGug3R69hZHY_rnCQS49y1MB4hSRAewFjlmbwzUXeR9lO7HARd9KyWHdbng--", "ord_in_thread": 43, "author": "April O.", "published": "2017-11-23T09:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "Five Stars", "text": "Nice and light.

of Love with Members in Brazil By LDS.org \u00b7 December 6, 2017 \nWhen Elder Ronald A. Rasband spoke recently to a nationwide gathering of young people in Brazil, he concluded with a simple message: I love you. The Brethren love you. And, most importantly, Heavenly Father loves you. \nThen the unexpected occurred. \n\u201cFrom far in the back, a youth held his hands up high and made the heart symbol,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I gave the heart symbol back from the pulpit.\u201d \nThat spontaneous communication of love between a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and a Brazilian youth triggered an immediate and vast response. Thousands of young people, gathered in 92 locales to watch Elder Rasband\u2019s November 15 remarks, lifted their hands and, in unison, formed the heart symbol. \n\u201cIt was phenomenal what happened,\u201d he told the Church News . \u201cWe all adopted the heart symbol that day as a symbol of unity and love for our Savior, Jesus Christ.\u201d \nTo read the full article on LDS.org, click here .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ronald a. rasband", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus christ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rasband", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "church news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:37.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "796598be6b02224a8170b410275351a53ea7f239", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_GbzPSD3e8vS.s8ZsXJjqE.9fV0gwUSy_O1LsjUyeuxhrTq5ZQMxrKEYax.hLOTg5XI2htTf209CB8r.BYzTKe.KaSmNbiwjc0LLfJIW3rSY7VX4wO8.Cm", "site_full": "www.unionleader.com", "site": "unionleader.com", "site_section": "http://www.unionleader.com/section/?template=RSS?nocache=1?omniture=0", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "All Stories", "title": "Editorial Cartoon: Dec. 7, 2017", "title_full": "Editorial Cartoon: Dec. 7, 2017", "published": "2017-12-07T09:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/storyimage/UL/20171207/OPINION03/171209396/AR/0/AR-171209396.jpg?q=70?ExactW=600&ExactH=314&imageversion=MainHighlight&q=70", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 41865, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "796598be6b02224a8170b410275351a53ea7f239", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_GbzPSD3e8vS.s8ZsXJjqE.9fV0gwUSy_O1LsjUyeuxhrTq5ZQMxrKEYax.hLOTg5XI2htTf209CB8r.BYzTKe.KaSmNbiwjc0LLfJIW3rSY7VX4wO8.Cm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "Editorial Cartoon: Dec. 7, 2017", "text": "Gov.

Alex Wong / Getty Images \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Stzrok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order. Copyright 2017 NPR.

The bed was very comfortable and the large TV had Sky which enabled us to watch films and programmes in English! We visited in November so it wasn't warm enough to sit in the garden but we imagine it would be a delightful way to spend an evening. The inside bar is very small and there is limited internal space to sit, but this is only an issue during the colder months.

The Relative   is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book \u201cNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\u201d. \nFor further review, we can take a look at another popular technical indicator. In terms of moving averages, the 200-day is currently at 25.16, the 50-day is 26.02, and the 7-day is resting at 26.11. Moving averages are a popular trading tool among investors. Moving averages can be used to help filter out the day to day noise created by other factors. MA\u2019s may be used to identify uptrends or downtrends, and they can be a prominent indicator for detecting a shift in momentum for a particular stock. Many traders will use moving averages for different periods of time in conjunction with other indicators to help gauge future stock price action. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pimco income opportunity fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pimco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:38.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f4809859985feee50f5094686284146270471371", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.VaHZQXXpGgovEiKTuNj0L8KhUAeEzq4Fu.W8oaebNhaYNLsCjyqgj3N7H4qBinsoVguHNWkyLFbzilxvGw9DxN", "site_full": "knkx.org", "site": "knkx.org", "site_section": "http://knkx.org/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["music", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "KNKX Public Radio", "title": "Australian Parliament Approves Same-Sex Marriage", "title_full": "Australian Parliament Approves Same-Sex Marriage", "published": "2017-12-07T10:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201712/569035628.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f4809859985feee50f5094686284146270471371", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.VaHZQXXpGgovEiKTuNj0L8KhUAeEzq4Fu.W8oaebNhaYNLsCjyqgj3N7H4qBinsoVguHNWkyLFbzilxvGw9DxN", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Neuman", "published": "2017-12-07T10:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "Australian Parliament Approves Same-Sex Marriage", "text": "A group of women in Federation Square in Melbourne react on Thursday as it is announced that same-sex marriage will be legal in Australia. Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of registered voters and ensured that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\" Copyright 2017 NPR.

The new system is for use by the vendor community. Bidders registered in the old system (as of May 8, 2014) will need to re-register to continue receiving notices for solicitations (bid opportunities). If you are also registered with Loudoun County Public Schools, you will only need to re-register your company once as it is a shared database between the Loudoun County Government and the schools. iSupplier allows multiple user access for the same company profile if needed. iSupplier allows prospective (new) bidders and current suppliers to register as a source for formal procurements and small purchases as well as benefiting from additional online capabilities. Required information to register a company profile can be found on this page During the registration process, a commodity code(s) must be selected to indicate the products and services you provide. Register for all commodity codes related to your business. Once approved, the self-service profile becomes a registered supplier record. Registration Benefits Suppliers once registered receive solicitation notices as an invite. Suppliers have the ability to view solicitations, bid online, view orders, and track payments issued to the supplier. In addition, suppliers can maintain their company profile information and assign online access to multiple users. Bid Opportunities Government opportunities are listed on our website as Bid Postings. Access our Current and Past Solicitations page to view our listing. You may also be interested in opportunities with Loudoun County Public Schools. Registration and Login Access Click here for iSupplier Registration and Login access . Sourcing & Online Bidding (Launched June 2, 2014) The Division of Procurement has launched Sourcing. We will use Sourcing to send notices to registered (bidders) suppliers based on the applicable commodity codes selected for a solicitation. Registered Suppliers will login to iSupplier to access the Sourcing home page and have the ability to view a solicitation and bid online. Once a solicitation is awarded, the suppliers who bid will receive notice of the award. The Solicitations - Bid Opportunities Guide for the Loudoun County Government, which details how to view solicitations on this page and how to submit an online response, is online here . Contacts for iSupplier Assistance Our offices are open between the hours of 8:30 am and 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday, excluding government holidays. We are located on the fourth floor of the Loudoun County Government Center, 1 Harrison Street, S.E., Leesburg, Virginia.

You paid for their free\r\nlunches, but were too stupid to notice they have\r\nbeen slipping you the bill when you weren't\r\nlooking. But, now, the bill is becoming too big to\r\nignore. In a bizarre multicultural inversion of\r\nmorality, those who truly love Australia are\r\nturned into enemies of the state, and racist\r\nsubversives. Multicultural diversity, the official\r\ndoctrine of the state, is enforced with\r\ndictatorial ruthlessness. Turn your nation into a\r\nthird world cesspit: Allow the home market for\r\nyour own industries to be captured by foreign\r\nfirms, and import masses of scab labour to\r\nundercut wages and overload schools, hospitals,\r\nhousing and the natural environment.\r\n\r\n\"Celebrate\" increased house prices and feel your fragile national bones turn to chalk\r\n\r\nThere are certain tame economists who spin the\r\nline that plague immigration is a uniform good and\r\nall we need to do is import ever-increasing\r\namounts of scab labour and she'll be right. I\r\ndon't subscribe to that disingenuous Ponzi scheme\r\nfairy tale. The current modern western lifestyle\r\nrequires the equivalent of 140 slaves per person -\r\nthe rate for the USA today is around 300. They\r\nhave only managed to achieve this through cheap,\r\nnon-renewable, fossil fuels. There is no\r\nalternative fuel. A lot of unearned money can be\r\npicked up by sabotaging Aussies. The plague\r\nimmigration Ponzi scheme is a classic example of\r\nthis principle. As a result, public wealth has\r\nshifted to the blood-stained hands of globalist\r\ngangster parasites.\r\n\r\nOur elected quislings are involved in globalist business (corrupt to the core)\r\n\r\nWho are the stupid people? Aussies are. They gave\r\ntheir country away without a fight. A globalist\r\nconspiracy to deprive Australians of their nation,\r\ndisarmed them with multicultural propaganda and\r\nglobalist cultural diversity spin. The globalist\r\ncabal that's seized control of the political and\r\neconomic mechanisms in Australia suffers under the\r\ntotally insane delusion that it can loot as much\r\nmoney from workers as it wants, and still come out\r\nwith a viable society. George Soros on the global\r\neconomy: \"I think this is probably more serious\r\nthan anything in our lifetime. This is a period of\r\nwealth destruction. The people who make money will\r\nbe few and far between. There will be a lot more\r\nmoney lost than made.\"\r\n\r\nThe unsustainable character of plague immigration fed Ponzi scheme debt-bubbles, and left nations bankrupt\r\n\r\nThe illusion of prosperity from plague immigration\r\nand overpopulation hides the true and catastrophic\r\ncosts of multicultural infantilism. How credulous\r\nor intensely stupid must people be if they never\r\nsee through the globalist bullshit? Globalist\r\nsuckholes like to tell us that immigrants raise\r\nour GDP. What about the countries the immigrants\r\nleave, does their GDP rise also? If imported scab\r\nlabour is so valuable here, why isn't it also\r\nvaluable back in their countries? When our\r\nglobalist quislings mention freedom of expression,\r\nthey describe it only as a threat to their\r\ntotalitarian perspective. How much longer will\r\nAussies remain paralyzed and silenced by imposed\r\n\"sensitivities\" to multicultural bullshit?\r\n\r\nYour Imported Scab Labour Apocalypse: Why It's Happening\r\n\r\nBeware of this new breed of roving \"demographer\"\r\nor \"economist\" who uses the idiotic mass media to\r\npush globalist plague immigration nostrums as\r\ncure-all quack remedies, while calling down the\r\nwrath of God on sceptics. Lies, damn lies and\r\nstatistics. My favourite thing about the illusion\r\nof globalist progress, is how utterly threadbare\r\nit is. It does not withstand even the most casual\r\ninspection. Yet the globalist mass media drones\r\nstill eulogize this alien monstrosity as our\r\nsaviour. Our quisling \"leaders\" and globalist\r\nmedia stooges claim that to stop terrorism and\r\norganized crime, Australians must give up their\r\npersonal freedom and privacy, and to end so-called\r\nracism, they must allow their country to be\r\ninvaded by all comers.\r\n\r\nSelf-sustaining, parasitic \"ethnic diversity lobbies\" and \"anti-racist networks\"\r\n\r\nThe rate of population increase is in slight\r\ndecline, but population growth is catastrophically\r\nhigh, with 77 million new blobs of unsustainable\r\nwailing misery popped onto the planet annually.\r\nWar, famine and disease will dominate humanity.\r\nUrban Aussies now live like rats competing with\r\nimported scab labour in whatever physical and\r\neconomic spaces are left over after globalist\r\nparasites and property pimps have gorged\r\nthemselves on the wealth of the nation. Driven by\r\na stinking multicultural wind across the putrid\r\nseas of an international financial cesspit,\r\nAussies are now adrift and rudderless in a\r\nwhirlpool of bullshit- easy prey for globalist\r\npirates and their stooges.\r\n\r\nExposing bloodsucker landlords, property developers and property speculators\r\n\r\nAs a result of the globalist plague immigration\r\nand multicultural hate-attack on Australians, the\r\nwheel has returned to the nationalist idea of\r\npolitical guerilla warfare against festering State\r\npower. Australia must be saved by all available\r\nmeans. Evidently, many \"greens\" spring from a\r\nfraudulent collective of quasi-Marxist gays and\r\ndykes. They also seem to be quite comfortable with\r\nnational and environmental destruction as long as\r\nit is wrought by pandemic immigration. When\r\npoliticians and the wealthy make no sacrifices for\r\nimported scab labour, why should you? Agents of\r\nplague immigration present their acts of\r\nself-interest as high-minded philanthropy. It's\r\ntime to close the immigration floodgates I think.\r\n\r\nA filthy journey into the diseased multicultural mind\r\n\r\nRecent events holed the economic argument for\r\nbrute-force immigration below the waterline,\r\nforcing the hyperactive globalist politicians to\r\ninvent even more strained bullshit to cover their\r\nreal motives for imposing plague immigration on\r\nAustralia. Even if you are mad enough to think an\r\nAustralia of 40 million suffering bodies will be a\r\nprosperous, wonderful place to live, the\r\noverpopulation growth is like the Titanic. You\r\ncannot stop, or turn it fast enough to avoid\r\ndisaster. Do this: 1. Open a new file in your PC.\r\n2. Name it \"Plague Immigration\". 3. Send it to the\r\nRecycle Bin. 4. Empty the Recycle Bin. 5. Your PC\r\nwill ask: \"Do you really want to get rid of Plague\r\nImmigration?\" 6. Firmly Click \"Yes\" 7. Feel\r\nbetter?\r\n\r\nWealthy parasites take every opportunity to screech and howl for more imported scab labour and desperate tenants\r\n\r\nI suggest that it is the poorest members of the\r\npublic who pay for the globalist treason of plague\r\nimmigration. A great dark fog of globalist\r\nbullshit hangs over the world, with all the bleak\r\nheaviness of an evil too great to be confronted\r\nlest one's robopathic life of consuming,\r\ndefecating and breeding be disturbed. We live in\r\nsocieties rotten with hypocrisy. Like drunken\r\ngamblers, governments plunder the public purse to\r\ncover ever greater losses from the corporate\r\nPonzi-schemes that they promote and protect. When\r\nwill the sheeple understand that the \"profits\"\r\nfrom speculation are stolen from them?\r\n\r\nForget tolerance. Aussies have tolerated too much already. Too much ethnic bullshit is being shoved down Australian throats\r\n\r\nThe current wave of mass immigration has been a\r\nnational failure and disgrace almost unparalleled\r\nin history, but it is regularly portrayed by the\r\ngrowth-mad multiculturalist politicians and media\r\ndrones as a great national success. Plague\r\nimmigration is not a substitute for a development\r\npolicy, and it ultimately drags the whole economy\r\ndown to a third world level and industry down to a\r\nstone-age style. This is usually called \"the race\r\nto the bottom.\" There are well-known bad outcomes\r\nfrom continuously importing scab labour over time.\r\nThere is every reason why desperate and costly\r\nenergy, infrastructure, and urban planning\r\nstrategies, will fail to mitigate the toxic\r\neffects of plague immigration.\r\n\r\nMore globalist horrors are coming. Why can't Aussies stop this shit?\r\n\r\nThe catch with mass immigration, of course, is\r\nthat Australians expect to be paid an Australian\r\nwage. Apparently, this is not the wage the Open\r\nBorders parasites have in mind. The popular mass\r\nmedia and government view of cultures as being\r\nabout festivals and cuisine is an infantilism that\r\ntrivializes the whole issue of national and\r\ncultural identity. Smokescreens, red herrings and\r\nrackets are everywhere. Nine of the ten wealthiest\r\nnations have fewer than 8 million people. And\r\nGermany, the paradigm of a large economy, with 82\r\nmillion people, has a markedly lower per capita\r\nGNP than adjoining Austria (8 million) and\r\nSwitzerland (7.5 million).\r\n\r\nFake blackfellas on drugs, and frothing-at-the-mouth ethnic psychotics, represent the \"intellectual elite\" of multiculturalism\r\n\r\nAussies better take note of the Netherlands, where\r\nnative Dutch people flee from hostile immigrants\r\nin that densely-populated multicultural nightmare.\r\nBoth Islamist tacticians and neo-Left pragmatists\r\nplot against Western sovereign states. To all the\r\npoor gay lemmings crying over the death of\r\nmulticulturalism: Suicide immediately you faggots,\r\nor get over it. Say goodbye to the most\r\ndestructive thing ever imposed on our nation. But\r\nthe real battle for Australia is coming. Don't\r\nhold your breath waiting for wealthy\r\nmulticulturalists to share their slice of the\r\nnational pie with their imported ethnic friends.\r\nPicking up the bill for plague immigration is left\r\nto Aussies at the other end of the economic Ponzi\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nWe will need plenty of rope when the treason trials are over\r\n\r\nWhen politicians are ready to bung-on another\r\ngiant immigration scam, they rely on the globalist\r\nmass media drones to send public unrest away with\r\na globalist sleeping pill or a multicultural drug\r\nfix. This is the way of The Revolution. A\r\nglobalist society is being spawned where those\r\nwith the most unsociable behaviours, deviant\r\nlifestyles, or personal failures are given the\r\nmost by government. Importing cheap labour from\r\nfailed third world nations, accelerates this\r\nprocess. Please don't remain lemmings. Care for\r\nAustralia and end the plague immigration nightmare\r\nwe all live under. Pauline Hanson and a mere\r\nhandful of people organized a very effective\r\npolitical response to mass immigration in\r\nAustralia - it can be done.\r\n\r\nTolerating plague immigration is really spinelessness\r\n\r\n\"Diversity\" brings terrible weakness into a\r\nsociety. There is only so much fracturing of the\r\nsocial masonry possible before the whole structure\r\ncrumbles. But this is also an intended outcome of\r\nthe plague immigration revolution. Australia is\r\nlong past the point where population growth in any\r\nway increases quality of life for most\r\nAustralians. The silly multicultural dream is\r\nturning into a third world pandemic immigration\r\nnightmare. For ordinary workers, plague\r\nimmigration is a force of applied multicultural\r\nhatred. Aussies don't want to be \"ethnically\r\ncleansed\" to benefit skinflint employers,\r\nrealtors, property speculators, developers, plague\r\nlandlords and such parasites.\r\n\r\nThe strong patriotic weapon of national will and discrimination\r\n\r\nFuture Australians will inherit nothing but rivers\r\nof foul effluent - ethnic bodily fluids dribbling\r\nfrom putrid Asian-style \"Stack and Pack\" slums. It\r\nis the guaranteed outcome of massively importing\r\nethnic scab labour. If you're talking national\r\ncollapse, you're talking massive plague\r\nimmigration and genocide through\r\n\"cultural-diversity\" propaganda. Unfortunately, it\r\nis too much to ask the sheeple public to educate\r\nitself and to select an effective action plan. In\r\ncontrast to the rosy pictures painted by\r\npoliticians and media drones about a glorious\r\nfuture under globalist fascism, most younger\r\nadults expect to see a pretty grim unsustainable\r\nfuture of resource depletion and social violence.\r\n\r\nQuislings colluding with corrupt globalist elites to rob their own nations blind\r\n\r\nWe are in the terminal phase of this Ponzi scheme\r\neconomy. The window of opportunity for increasing\r\nplague immigration is closing fast. The damage to\r\nAustralia has been too great, and the\r\nsocio-political landscape is probably at the\r\ntipping point. Our unproductive, and hypocritical\r\nleaders tear the guts out of the fundamentals of\r\nsustainability while bleating about how Aussies\r\nmust work harder and cheaper, consume ever more,\r\nand step aside for imported scab labour and\r\nbreeding locusts. Most elections in western\r\ndemocracies are prearranged shams, contested\r\nbetween bipartisan members of globalist crime\r\ngangs. The political parties are just fronts for\r\nthe ongoing invasion of Australia and the\r\ndispossession of Aussie workers.\r\n\r\nOnce a real estate Ponzi scheme tastes the blood of plague immigration, it wants ever more!\r\n\r\nAussies are being savagely raped by real estate\r\ngangsterism that wants unlimited population growth\r\nto drive Ponzi schemes. Politicians protect these\r\nrackets and plan to take off with their bribe\r\nmoney before it all implodes. Aussies don't know\r\nthe full extent of Australia's natural resources\r\nand yet their living standards get worse each\r\nyear, while they are amongst the most highly taxed\r\npeople in the world. Aussies are quickly heading\r\ntowards third world nation status. The worst\r\ngreenhouse gas emissions blast from the fat arses\r\nof bloated globalist plutocrats, so don't let them\r\nlecture you about your carbon-using ways. Those\r\nrich lice are the plague immigration spin doctors\r\nof multicultural poisoning.\r\n\r\nSwallowing all that cultural diversity shit\r\n\r\nThe narcissistic ego of some preening politician\r\nrunning wild as it grooms itself, indicates the\r\npathology behind globalist multiculturalism. It is\r\na form of self-deception, and psychic blindness\r\nwhere people lie to, and hide from themselves.\r\nWeaken our borders even more with the plague\r\nimmigration Trojan Horse? Wreck the future for\r\nyour own flesh and blood as well as innocent\r\nothers? There's the two digit multicultural IQ\r\nhard at work. Well done, you total fuckwits!\r\nGlobalism is very hungry, and you are probably on\r\nthe multicultural menu. You may be able to survive\r\nin the hostile and inhuman Chinese-style \"Stack\r\nand Pack\" slums replacing Australian communities,\r\nbut you would soon lose the will to live.\r\n\r\nThe ALP and the unions, betrayed their constituency when they conspired to export Aussie industries and import third world scab labour\r\n\r\nImported ethnic hate cultures breeding like\r\nlocusts within ugly \"Stack and Pack\" urban\r\nincubators, help to increase residential densities\r\nand unearned real estate profits. Violent ethnic\r\ncrime is the jewel in the multicultural crown. Do\r\nthe people of developed countries have any rights\r\nin the grand globalist social engineering scheme?\r\nOr are we just to be the cows who are to be\r\ncontinually milked to provide that \"better way of\r\nlife\" for the world's ethnic poor? Any land-use\r\nplanning structure that streams immigrants into\r\nnewly built suburban enclaves, has the effect of\r\nkeeping new and old Australians apart, but it\r\ncreates a captive vote market for multiculturalist\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nWhen our elected quislings say that mass immigration is not about the numbers, they know that it IS about the numbers\r\n\r\nIt is now certain that our industrial civilization\r\nwill ultimately collapse, like others in history\r\nbefore it, such as the Mayans or Roman Empire. The\r\ncollapse will be many times worse than previous\r\ncollapses as there are so many more people. In the\r\nprocesses and decisions that impact on their\r\nlives, Aussies living under globalist rule are\r\nroutinely denied a say. They are not consulted or\r\nallowed to participate in decision-making\r\nprocesses controlled by dirtbag property\r\ndevelopers. Decades of frantic economic and social\r\n\"reform\" have prepared the subhuman resources for\r\nembalming, and now the poison enters the\r\nbloodstream of national life, one drop after\r\nanother. Just lie there and let the globalist\r\nembalming fluid do its work.\r\n\r\nWeasel words like \"strong growth in house prices\" sound better than \"increasing numbers of homeless poor\"\r\n\r\nPandemic immigration feeds the housing crisis, as\r\nit increases inequality by increasing the wealth\r\nof those who employ or rent to immigrants and\r\nreducing the wealth of those bloodsucked by the\r\nwealthy. Plague immigration is never good in any\r\nmeasure, even with state control. Official\r\ncultural diversity is almost an unqualified evil.\r\nA society made up of ethnic ghettoes creates\r\nfestering pockets of distrust, the reverse of the\r\ncosmopolitan fantasy. Congested third world\r\ncities, and increasing pressure on the\r\nenvironment, will be terminated by total social,\r\nenvironmental and economic collapse. The resulting\r\nfamine, pandemic disease and ethnic violence will\r\nproduce a global population crash.\r\n\r\nAsian-style \"Stack and Pack\" slums will be grotesque monuments on Australia's grave\r\n\r\nBloated globalist hypocrites are the very diseases\r\nthey lecture us about. They aid the malignant\r\nspread in Australia of every exotic pathogenic\r\ndisease they can force on to us. We don't need\r\ntheir plague immigration or infantile\r\nmulticultural drivel. For citizens to support\r\nnational ideals, they must first understand what\r\nthat means. For citizens to act against plague\r\nimmigration, they must grasp how it works\r\nferociously against national ideals. Insofar as\r\npeople are oblivious, they are helpless. How\r\nstupid would a working-class Australian have to be\r\nto want the flood of imported scab labour to\r\ncontinue when it means reduced wages, higher\r\nprices and increased taxation? Let's not be\r\nmulticultural (homosexualized) weaklings about\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nCivilization struggles against multicultural genocidal fascism\r\n\r\nAn impenetrable bubble of shared, rigid beliefs\r\nsurrounds brute-force immigration and\r\nmulticulturalism which deflects any other views\r\nthreatening to the growth-mad politicians and\r\nmedia drones. It is time to burst this happy\r\nbubble of bullshit. Mass immigration is doomed,\r\nbecause the natives know one simple truth:\r\nimmigrants are coming to take what they have. The\r\nmore immigrants the robber barons import to drive\r\ndown wages, the more that fear and resentment\r\ngrows, until it explodes. Politicians recently had\r\nplans to replace paid labour with \"volunteer\"\r\nlabour. All kinds of fancy names have been\r\ninvented for these varieties of not-so-mutual\r\nobligation, but there are always \"difficult\"\r\ncitizens who insist on being properly paid.\r\n\r\nMass immigration from third world pestholes increased human misery, strife and poverty in developed nations to an explosive degree\r\n\r\nFor decades Australia has been without the\r\ninfluence of nationalist leaders, and has been\r\nsubjected to the globalist socio-economic agenda.\r\nSince 1972 and the abolition of the white\r\nAustralia policy, Australia has been invaded by\r\nmass immigration. Enthusiasm for embracing foreign\r\nscab labour has made advocates for immigrants\r\noblivious to the burdens they place upon\r\nAustralian workers. This is no way to build a\r\ncommunity or enhance national solidarity. You\r\nshould wonder at this plague immigration neurosis.\r\nIt infects the weak-minded with an urgent panic to\r\ncram all countries to the utter limits of their\r\ncarrying capacities. Half-wits always trump wise\r\npeople it seems.\r\n\r\nDispossession through plague immigration\r\n\r\nBecause of parasite property developers' bribes,\r\nplanners and policy makers talk the talk of\r\nprotecting Australia's environment, but their\r\nactions have the opposite effect. Most relevant\r\npromises were routinely broken, and they will be\r\nbroken again. Those societies that submit to\r\nglobalism and mass immigration, cannibalize\r\nthemselves until they die. Australia is a client\r\nstate, ruled by a well-bribed traitor class.\r\nMulticulturalism does not seek an average\r\nintelligence; it hungers for mediocre dullness\r\nthat finds comfort and submergence in the\r\nshuffling conformist mob, surrounded by oneness of\r\nmind, with lemmings that ooze like-thinking\r\nconcurrence.\r\n\r\nDon't ask Jewish lawyers, landlords and real estate financiers whether Australia needs a larger population\r\n\r\nThe great wheel of national retribution is\r\nturning. When the treason trials begin, will the\r\ngrowth-mad multiculturalist politicians and media\r\ndrones still be so keen to demonize the critics of\r\ntoxic immigration? Even if it is only stupidity or\r\ncowardice that causes them to attack their own\r\npeople, anyone claiming to be Aussie who would put\r\nenemies in a position of advantage, should be\r\ntried for treason, found guilty and punished\r\naccordingly. Plague immigration is a race to the\r\nbottom where Aussies will always lose. The real\r\nestate debt-bubble is one disastrous aspect of\r\ndecades of mass immigration and cultural diversity\r\ncontinuously inflicted on Australians.\r\n\r\nYou can smell the multicultural stench of moral compromise everywhere\r\n\r\nIf you extend the thinking that urges infinite\r\npopulation growth, the vision is a squalid, putrid\r\nplanet crowded with humans, pests and captive\r\nanimals. Biodiversity will disappear and the\r\nentire world will resemble a dirty diseased lump\r\nof filth. It seems that nothing can stop greasy\r\nproperty developers. They are invulnerable, and\r\ntheir bulldozers unstoppable. Soon our\r\nimpoverished cities and suburbs will be infested\r\nwith profitable third world \"Stack and Pack\"\r\nslums. The proliferation of violent ethnic\r\npestholes in Australian cities, and a runaway\r\nforeign debt signals Aussies that they must act\r\nfast if they wish to save their country from\r\nglobalism. Selling their grandmothers won't cover\r\ntheir growing debts.\r\n\r\nMulticultural \"values\" are complete and utter bullshit\r\n\r\nThanks to mass immigration, intelligent, capable\r\npeople are left on the scrap heap. Chaos agents\r\nhave nothing to fear while Nazi groups attract\r\npeople with fewer IQ points than teeth, but if\r\nreal Einsteins join-up it will be another game\r\nentirely. Australia is caught in an unaffordable\r\nhousing death-vortex. The big crash and burn is\r\noverdue, and the rotten plague immigration Ponzi\r\nscheme will collapse and implode like the WTC\r\ntowers which were also overdue for demolition.\r\nPlague immigration is presented as an ideological\r\nbattle between left and right.

I\u2019m not sure why the concept couldn\u2019t fly, so to speak.I don\u2019t believe the Gate City has ever tried to accomplish the same thing; at least I can\u2019t recall such an effort, but being an artistic and creative soul myself I would like to see our city also give it a whirl.I\u2019m talking about a new city flag for Nashua. Actually, our city doesn\u2019t have an official flag, according to the mayor\u2019s office. What it does have is a city seal, which I\u2019ve seen on large banners displayed on the walls at events such as a Nashua Police Department news conference. The \u201cflag\u201d features a sky blue background with a yellow border.Our city seal features a circular disc with the words \u201cTownship of Dunstable, 1673,\u201d and on the lower edge of the disc the words \u201cCity of Nashua, 1853.\u201dIt\u2019s a busy-looking illustration with images of an anvil and hammers, a plough, a bale of goods, a regulator, a horn of plenty, a bridge and a train of railroad cars, a cotton mill, and iron foundries. And at the top of the circular emblem are two clasped hands.I can bet that a number of Nashuans are unaware that our community even has a city seal, and some residents could probably care less.It\u2019s not an unattractive symbol; it\u2019s traditional and proudly represents the amazing city and people of Nashua. The seal has recently been engraved into a handsome granite medallion that graces the center of City Hall\u2019s brick plaza. That\u2019s wonderful, but I think it\u2019s time to design an official city flag to hang both inside and outside City Hall that is simple, colorful, modern and does not include the current city seal. I like the way Manchester presented the concept on its ballot question. Voters had their choice of three designs submitted by residents, along with the current flag featuring the city seal. As was the case in Manchester, in Nashua the vote would be a nonbinding referendum question that would have to be ratified by Nashua\u2019s Board of Aldermen.Other cities across the nation have dumped their old, tired city seals and opted for new flags, and some of these symbols have become popular with residents, visitors, sports fans and those who just love getting inked.For example, the Windy City displays a cool looking flag that has two sky-blue bars separated by a white bar with four red stars in the middle and another thinner, white bar at the top and another at the bottom of the flag. The stars represent four key events in Chicago\u2019s history: the building of Fort Dearborn along the banks of the Chicago River in 1803, the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition of 1893, and the Century of Progress Exposition of 1933\u201334. Tattoo enthusiasts go wild over the Chicago city flag and add images of it to their skin portfolios, if you will.The Chicago city flag is imprinted on T-shirts, coffee mugs, stickers, posters, cufflinks, beach towels, pet tags, drinking glasses, keychains and so on.

The polls, that will elect members of the national and provincial assemblies to end almost two decades of an interim government, opened at 7 a.m. and will conclude at 5 p.m.\u201cThe elections are taking place in a peaceful manner across the country except for some stray incidents,\u201d Election Commission spokesperson Nabaraj Dhakal told Efe news. Two homemade bombs had exploded in Kathmandu\u2019s Manamaiju area and in Dharan, located some 400 km to the east of the capital, but did not cause any damage to life or property, he added. By 10 a.m., around 20 per cent of the 12.2 million people who were eligible to vote had cast their votes, Sudhir Shah, one of the five election commissioners, told Efe.\u201cWe want stability so that the country can move toward prosperity. I hope this election gives us a stable government,\u201d Yadav Dhakal, a 67-year-old retired teacher, said after casting his vote. Nepal has a total of 15.4 million registered voters, out of which more than 3 million had voted in the first phase of the elections that were held on November 26 across 32 districts in the northern part of the country. With a total of 25 governments in the last 27 years, three of them in the last two years, Nepal has been steeped in grave political instability for long. In these elections, Nepalese voters will directly elect 165 national lawmakers while another 110 members of the lower house will be elected through the party-list proportional representation system, which takes into account the total number of votes secured by the parties.

prosecutors are seeking a maximum one year prison term for a former beauty queen who was stripped of her crown over a social media posting deemed to be \"insulting\" to the victims of last year's failed coup, state-run Anadolu Agency reported on Thursday. \nProsecutors in Istanbul have charged 18-year-old Itir Esen with \"overtly insulting a section of the public\" for a remark she posted on Twitter as the country held memorials on the anniversary of the July 15, 2016 coup attempt, the agency reported. \nEsen was stripped of her Miss Turkey 2017 title a day after the competition in September when the tweet came to light. The model and university student denies any intent to insult. \nTurkish media reported that the tweet, which has since been erased, said: \"I got my period on the morning of the July 15 martyrs' day. I'm marking the day by bleeding as a representation of the martyrs' blood.\" \nThe posting caused uproar on social media. \nA court must accept the indictment before a trial date is set. \nRunner-up Asli Sumen was given the title and represented Turkey at the Miss World competition in China. \n  Photos", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tur", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "itir esen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "esen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asli sumen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "anadolu agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ex-miss turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:41.000+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15102172, "moreResultsAvailable": 15102072, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512640541000&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 381}
