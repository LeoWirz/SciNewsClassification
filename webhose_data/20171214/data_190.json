REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo \nDecember 7, 2017 \nBy Joseph Nasr \nBERLIN (Reuters) \u2013 German industrial production fell unexpectedly in October, data showed on Thursday, but the cause was probably public holidays that let workers take long weekends, the Economy Ministry and analysts said. \nIndustrial output decreased by 1.4 percent after falling by a revised 0.9 percent in September. The two successive declines came after an increase of 2.6 percent in August, the biggest rise in more than six years. \n\u201cLooking at the bigger picture, despite today\u2019s drop, developments over the year 2017 so far confirm that the weak spots of the past few years \u2013 investment and industrial production \u2013 have gradually returned as a strong growth engine,\u201d Carsten Brzeski of ING Diba wrote in a note. \n\u201cJudging from the data for the first 10 months of the year, industrial production has had its best year since 2011.\u201d \nEurope\u2019s largest economy is firing on all cylinders. Consumption, state spending and rising exports are driving growth in both industry and services. \nSupported by low interest rates and a robust labor market, the economy is weathering a political impasse resulting from Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s failure to form a government since an election in September. \nShe is expected to open talks next week with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) on renewing their coalition, which has governed Germany since 2013. \n\u2018SO WELL\u2019 \nSurveys indicate that investors want to know how expensive an alliance with the SPD would be. The party is demanding more rights for workers, a broader social security net and significantly more investments in education and infrastructure. \nDespite the political uncertainty, the economy continues to power ahead. Data released on Wednesday showed that industrial orders had risen unexpectedly in October, suggesting the economy will strengthen in coming months. \nThe October industrial output reading compared with the mid-range forecast in a Reuters poll for a rise of 1.0 percent.

Many people claim to have pets that they are selling and some will sell you a bad breed. So, before looking for Hampion Labrador retriever puppies for sale, ensure you know how to choose the right pup.\n\nA seller is always an important person whenever you are buying a puppy. It would be foolish if you bought a pet form someone who has little or no knowledge about dog breeding and then you expect the best. The best thing to do if you care about the breed of the dog is to search for a renowned breeder and buy from them or ask them to breed one for you.\n\nThink about your lifestyle. While some pets are friendly and interactive, others will spend most of their time alone. So, you should choose the pup depending on the personality you should like your dog to have. Also, when it comes to intelligence, some pups are more intelligent than others. Therefore, you should think about the level of intelligence you expect the pet to have.\n\nInquire the store owner to provide you with credentials. It is only by checking the credentials that you can confirm whether the breeder is permitted to sell the pups. Also, it will help you get away from scam sellers and those who sell stolen dogs. There are cunning guys who will who will give you forged papers. Therefore, be vigilant and check whether they are legitimate.\n\nCheck the reputation of a seller. There are some sellers who will do follow ups to know how the pet is doing. Such a seller is concerned not only of their reputation, but also the love for animals, and they want to ensure they find happy and loving families. So, buy from someone who can come to help you in case the pet falls sick.\n\nAlso, it is wise for you to drop by and see the pet store before buying the puppy. The facility where the pets were reared plays a key role in both the health and the behavior of the animal. If it was raised in a dirty place, then it might have contracted the disease and therefore cost you more to take it to the animal health specialist.\n\nReflect on the price. No one likes to spend more than they should. It is painful when they acquire a poor breed of a pet at expensive price. One thing that could contribute to this is if you go to a store when you are not prepared. It is sensible that you search for information about various breeds, characteristics and the prices. This can enable you to avoid making errors which might cost you your money.\n\nIt is now confirmed beyond doubt that buying the puppy from anyone you find is a huge blunder. As well, you can see that pets have different personalities and thus you must choose wisely to avoid selecting the one that will not fit in your family.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are looking for information about hampion Labrador Retriever puppies , pay a visit to our web pages today.

He has silver/gray eyes and one of them has been injured to the point that it is light sensitive, prompting Guts to occasionally wear an eye patch. Guts has black hair fitted with constant, short pointy spikes already built from short hair itself. At the base of his hairline, he allows a few strands (to take on the role as bangs) to hang just above his forehead. He wears bandages over his right hand (a style he has used since the beginning, most likely to assist in handling a sword). Over his torso he Dawns a metallic black, light-weight armor and wears a sleeveless white undershirt beneath it, allowing him to move his body freely. On his pants there is also a set of armor featured in the groin and leg areas most likely for protective purposes.\nGuts full Armor:\nPersonality\nKnown for his air of austerity, Guts is a gruff, cynical man holding an overall bleak outlook on life. This is a consequence of having endured waves of suffering and numerous betrayals since his youth, with nearly all highlights of his life having, in time, become lows. In spite of his guarded, brooding exterior, he shows a more easygoing, compassionate side around the people he trusts, appearing markedly less unsociable and distant, though still retaining his dry candidness. Even as his inner darkness festers deep within him and its temptation becomes increasingly harder to resist, he retains his empathy and compassion, refusing to completely discard his humanity.\nVillage Information\nVillage of Birth: Heaven Village of Alliance: Purgatory\nNinja Rank\nS-class\nSpecialty\nEnochian Abilities (Main)\nNinjutsu (Secondary)\nElements\n\u96f7 Raiton (Complete)\n\u6c34 Suiton (Complete)\n\u571f Doton (Complete)\n\u706b Katon (Complete)\n\u98a8 Futon (Complete)\n\u92fc Enochian (Horseman) Other Skills\n\u5fcd Ninjutsu (Complete)\n\u5fcd Sound Ninjutsu (Complete)\n\u5e7b Genjutsu (Complete)\n\u4f53 Taijutsu (Complete)\n\u5263 Kenjutsu (Complete)\n\u4f53 Numerous cfs (Complete) Summonings\n\u5fcd Toads (Complete)\n\u5fcd Tiglons (Creator)\nBackground Information\nInconclusive! Despite, an ever growing presence the mans' past is shrouded in mystery. Anbu intelligence has noted he first sprung into prominence in Land Of Lightning and gained notoriety ever since. However, by then he was a grown adult and all events prior are hearsay. However, it is known that he has aligned with the Enochian Clan and has a penchant for violence. Information that was sufficient to brand him a Bandit. Those who know him are more intrigued with his story as it develops at present rather than a reflection of his past.\nOther Information\n\u2206 Guts carries an abnormally large sword, which is strapped to his back. Though he also carries numerous normal sized katana, wielding the larger one just as easy.\n\u2206 He also carries the typical ninja tools such as smoke bombs, wires, explosive tags etc.\n\u2206 After generations upon generations of dwelling upon the Nature Energy-enriched island of Purgatory, the Enochian clan's natural aptitude and knowledge of Nature Energy grew immensely. The bodies of Enochians adapted and evolved to act somewhat as a magnet or battery of Nature Energy; in addition to being able to detect it where ever it may be, the body of an Enochian naturally draws in moderate amounts of Nature Energy from the surroundings, storing it within without negatively affecting their bodies(i.e., turning it to stone or grotesque transformations).\nWhile not on the same level of Nature Energy amounts that is absorbed to invoke Sage Mode, the natural conduction of Nature Energy is sufficient to also invigorate the Enochian due to its naturally empowering properties, affecting the spiritual and physical fortitude of clan members.\nEnochians have a sharp mental resilience, possessing indomitable wills that allow them to mentally endure pain and emotional distress to the extreme, resulting in an all around well-roundness in their mental states, though their wills are not completely unbreakable. This mental fortitude also led to Enochians being very quick learners and highly intelligent people, very skilled in deduction, empathy, persuasion, and analysis. (Especially Guts who is of one from the four ranked directly below the Clan head. He even specializes in the clan's techniques, capable of utilizing them without hand seals.) It is this that leads to most Enochians being generally considered charming by most people.\nPhysically, Enochians have similar resilience. Enochians are naturally stronger and faster than the average shinobi and even shinobi of similar/equivalent ability due to the natural empowerment that comes with Nature Energy. Their invigorated Physical Energy causes an Enochian to have a stronger life force and higher stamina than what is common to Shinobi. Their bodies are extremely resistant to most diseases and pathogens, leaving them effectively immune. Enochians are all physically powerful, making them ideal for combat and to be warriors. While to no degree immortal, they are able to better withstand extreme conditions, such as drastic changes to temperature(extreme cold and heat), crushing pressures, etc.\n\u2206 Being a Ninjutsu specialist, Guts has a personal companion in battle in the form of a Tiglon summoning. His chosen companion is MoMo: The Sidekick, the Tiglon family's most renowned Sidekick. MoMo typically is napping on Guts' head, or due to her size (and the sheer massive size of guys), she is often found inside one of his inner pockets on his shirts and such.\n(Tiglon Kuchiyose: MoMo No S\u00ecd\u016boK\u00edck)-Tiglon Summoning: MoMo The Sidekick\nType: Summon\nRank: S-rank\nRange: Short\nChakra: 40\nDamage: N/A\nDescription:\nThe user first draws blood from his hand and does the hand signs for the summoning technique. In return he/she is able to summon the Tiglon contracts self proclaimed greatest side kick, MoMo. MoMo is the daughter of the Tiglon Bach, as such she bares a striking resemblance to him in terms of their dark black fur that wrapped around their bodies. Unlike most Tiglons, MoMo isn't very large at all, in fact she only stands about 1ft tall and weighing a few pounds at most thus allowing her to sit on a summoners shoulder or head. Just like her father and uncle who are summonings of the contract, she has inherited the keen ability to communicate mentally with signers of the contract, allowing them to better strategize mid battle.\nAbilities:\nMoMo's abilities come from her being a pure ninjutsu specialist, being able to perform normal ninjutsu up to S-rank, but has no skill in elemental usage or Genjutsu. Her real talent comes in the form of specific jutsu such as the chakra transfer technique, which makes her the perfect side kick. She has Mastered the chakra transfer technique to such a degree that at all times that she's in contact with her summoner or another Tiglon, she begins passively transferring chakra into them, boosting the damage of their techniques +10. The only downside to her constant transferring of chakra into who she's aiding is they're chakra would constantly disrupted so they wouldn't be able to perform jutsu that are overly complex such as Genjutsu and Fuuinjutsu.

Read more about our latest survey with @EnvAgency , @thameswater , @Thames21 https://t.co/x7aeun8IZ6 @ZSLMarine \n\u2014 ZSL (@OfficialZSL) December 6, 2017 \nJoe Pecorelli, project manager for the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) estuaries and freshwater team, said: \u201cWe\u2019re calling on home and business owners across the capital to have their plumbing checked for misconnections. \n\u201cWe\u2019re also asking local authorities to ensure the plumbing systems of new developments meet correct standards, and that funding is increased for industry-wide awareness schemes like ConnectRight.\u201d \nFor the study more than 100 trained volunteers assessed 1,177 outfalls \u2013 drains that send surface water into rivers. \nSigns of contamination including sewage fungus were found in 356 locations. For every kilometre of river surveyed, there were two to three polluting outfalls on average. \nMr Pecorelli said: \u201cApproximately 600km of rivers and streams flow through Greater London into the tidal Thames. \n\u201cTogether, these waterways represent an invaluable habitat for wildlife, from eels and water voles, to kingfishers and dragonflies. \n\u201cBut a history of poor water quality, badly-designed flood defences and adaptations for navigation has prevented many of them from achieving their full ecological potential. As a result, just one of the 39 rivers in Greater London has so far qualified as having \u2018good\u2019 ecological status or potential.\u201d \nThe findings are contained in a new report published by ZSL. \nDebbie Leach, chief executive of the waterways charity Thames21, said: \u201cThere is a massive environmental accident happening across London, and it is devastating our rivers. \n\u201cBut because it is happening day after day, it isn\u2019t making the news. That has to change. \n\u201cEach day, more and more waste water pipes from our houses are being connected up to rainwater drains going straight into rivers, and the result is horrendous.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joe pecorelli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pecorelli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "debbie leach", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sewage treatment works", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zoological society of london", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "thames", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greater london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:57.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cd5d2b1755cba9b9762bd3ddc55afb9023d9bf5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOY2Vu62HdS2fx3k67ipt6upNUj_7ZtN6YJ.gs90DwCbCISM1XaATbEGwcyt0_pKfYZ9NwHrCTMfKmAYRYe00QwxlNXEpokPw49wEsBCSYAMtz_37RLwYMWbwY84L78LI-", "site_full": "article.wn.com", "site": "wn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.wn.com/English/keyword/health", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WN.com - Health News", "title": "AP Exclusive: Poor health and high expectations for Medicaid", "title_full": "AP Exclusive: Poor health and high expectations for Medicaid - Worldnews.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zxSTzSEiZ2c/0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5594, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cd5d2b1755cba9b9762bd3ddc55afb9023d9bf5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOY2Vu62HdS2fx3k67ipt6upNUj_7ZtN6YJ.gs90DwCbCISM1XaATbEGwcyt0_pKfYZ9NwHrCTMfKmAYRYe00QwxlNXEpokPw49wEsBCSYAMtz_37RLwYMWbwY84L78LI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "wn.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "AP Exclusive: Poor health and high expectations for Medicaid", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- People on Medicaid are more prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor.

Do you think that for elderly people the resistance for new technologies (e.g. smartphones) would be smaller if interfaces were designed differently - uniquely for them?\n\nI have quite huge experience, when it comes to creating software for elderly people and I participated in hackaton like that. After variety of applications and research I believe that not the user interface is a problem but using electronically devices itself. We have created super simple interface and when we tested it, by presenting to old lady, even before trying she did not want to use it. And the reason was because she never used laptop, tablet or smartphone. The problem is device itself not the design of our work.\n\n2. Have you ever done usability study before starting product development? How did the research look like?\n\nYes I did many times. I have read a lot of books, asked specialists, created paper mockup, created clickable user interface in proto.io.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo \nDecember 7, 2017 \nBEIRUT (Reuters) \u2013 Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s negotiating team is set to arrive in Geneva on Sunday to participate in peace talks, Syria\u2019s state news agency SANA reported on Thursday, quoting a foreign ministry source. \nThe delegation, led by Bashar al-Ja\u2019afari, walked out last week and returned to Damascus. Negotiations resumed on Wednesday without the Syrian government delegation. \nThe talks began last week and after a few days with little apparent progress, the U.N. mediator Staffan de Mistura said that the government delegation was returning to Damascus to \u201cconsult and refresh\u201d. \nThe government delegation blamed its departure on the opposition\u2019s uncompromising stance on Assad\u2019s future. Last month, the opposition drew up a statement in a meeting in Riyadh that rejected any future role for Assad in Syria. \nDuring last week\u2019s sessions, de Mistura shuttled between the representatives of the two warring sides, who did not meet face-to-face. He had planned to continue the round until Dec. 15. \nThe opposition negotiating team arrived at the U.N. offices in Geneva on Wednesday morning to resume talks with de Mistura. \nFrance accused the Syrian government on Wednesday of obstructing the peace talks with its refusal to return to Geneva and called on Russia not to shrink its responsibilities to get Damascus to the negotiating table. \n(Reporting by Sarah Dadouch; Editing by Angus MacSwan)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sarah dadouch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bashar al-ja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "staffan de mistura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angus macswan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bashar al-assad", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.n.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations special envoy for syria staffan de mistura", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beirut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "damascus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intra syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riyadh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:58.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1d591f2c0049ad751bd09c2e1ea1de1692455da1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kdgErVlnrHA4dhR.1U321yfNo5YJUtYOKSTW8cUN4KvEEZL57ljmWpheQTlnr.fed1rfUemxr3wnazK8l4k9ioXFhPxe2cYndpPde4Kvu5lfXTARkDTBa2nyx9XD1KePqLDKz6.ckBQ--", "site_full": "www.bordertelegraph.com", "site": "bordertelegraph.com", "site_section": "http://www.bordertelegraph.com/news/national_news/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Border Telegraph | National News", "title": "Sculptor creates anatomical torso from cardboard", "title_full": "Sculptor creates anatomical torso from cardboard", "published": "2017-12-06T18:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.bordertelegraph.com/resources/images/7149717/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1d591f2c0049ad751bd09c2e1ea1de1692455da1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kdgErVlnrHA4dhR.1U321yfNo5YJUtYOKSTW8cUN4KvEEZL57ljmWpheQTlnr.fed1rfUemxr3wnazK8l4k9ioXFhPxe2cYndpPde4Kvu5lfXTARkDTBa2nyx9XD1KePqLDKz6.ckBQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T18:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "Sculptor creates anatomical torso from cardboard", "text": "Sculptor creates anatomical torso from cardboard Artist James Lake worked with students from Exeter Medical School to create a stunning sculpture from cardboard (Azure Photography/PA) 0 comments \nAn artist and a group of medical students have created a stunning artwork from cardboard. \nJames Lake began sculpting as part of his recovery after losing his leg through bone cancer aged 17 and he now uses cardboard to create intricately detailed life-size sculptures. \nThe sculpture portrays an anatomical torso, complete with meticulously detailed muscles, spinal cord and face. Artist James Lake worked with students from Exeter Medical School to create a stunning sculpture from cardboard (Azure Photography/PA) \nStudents at Exeter University\u2019s medical school worked with Mr Lake to create the sculpture\u2019s cavity, including internal organs and elements. \nStaff and students wrote messages to express their learning, ambitions, and their wish to inspire future students, which were then incorporated into the sculpture, as part of the skin. \nThe sculpture, which is over 7ft tall, was unveiled on Wednesday and is available to view in the medical school foyer. \nMr Lake, from Exeter, said: \u201cIt was a real privilege to be part of such an exceptional learning environment. \n\u201cWhilst working with the students I realised how much the diverse disciplines interlock to create new avenues for the development of medicine in the future. \n\u201cThe journey of the project, from the initial idea to finished sculpture, has shown the importance of strong core values that can be transferred from teacher to student for the benefit of wider society.\u201d James Lake began sculpting as part of his recovery after losing his leg through bone cancer aged 17 (Azure Photography/PA) \nDr Stephanie Bull, a senior lecturer in the medical school, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure to work with such a talented artist on this project. \n\u201cThe sculpture makes an excellent addition to the foyer, and I\u2019m thrilled that James has created a piece of art that reflects the wonderful staff and students that we have here. \n\u201cOur teaching ethos brings together small groups of people to find the best solution to a particular issue, and this project has applied the same principle to making us more human and accessible as a medical school. \n\u201cThe sculpture will encourage a shared sense of purpose and enjoyment for staff, students and visitors to the medical school.\u201d \nMedical student Naomi Fuller, who was involved in the project, said: \u201cStudying a scientific subject can mean our creative sides can sometimes feel slightly neglected, so it\u2019s fantastic to have this sculpture displayed in the medical school. \n\u201cThe sculpture will serve as a good reminder of the beauty in what we are studying.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "james lake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mr lake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie bull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naomi fuller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lake", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "exeter university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medical school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "exeter medical school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "exeter", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:58.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c8b77ce8d95d15d05ad47dcb1b98f79ab8b0ab13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxmlefHEBDqYEtkUGAfzGjbCajb.PR1_tftn.s5z3zBrd2_VVp2wFeVqBD9ucV9Lor2PUVyFcDaPmoiWCP4iB0YbRrv1mFLSGTj66u6NQ4ZxA--", "site_full": "ficoforums.myfico.com", "site": "myfico.com", "site_section": "http://ficoforums.myfico.com/t5/Credit-Card-Applications/bd-p/Applications", "site_categories": ["credit_debt_and_loans", "finance"], "section_title": "Credit Card Applications - myFICO\u00ae Forums", "title": "PenFed Question 5107790", "title_full": "PenFed Question - myFICO\u00ae Forums - 5107790", "published": "2017-12-07T01:51:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8044, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0ff1abeb1fe84c1ea7494d6c9d4fcbd1cec518d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxmlefHEBDqYEtkUGAfzGjbCajb.PR1_tftn.s5z3zBrd2_VVp2wFeVqBD9ucV9Lor2PUVyFcDaPmoiWCP4iB0YbRrv1mFLSGSMpFU.rsQLfJVZweE3ErVA", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "SteiCamel", "published": "2017-12-07T08:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I actually joined and immediately applied for a card and then an auto loan the next day.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) \nBy CARLA K. JOHNSONAP Medical Writer \nCHICAGO (AP) - Modern birth control pills that are lower in estrogen have fewer side effects than past oral contraceptives. But a large Danish study suggests that, like older pills, they still modestly raise the risk of breast cancer, especially with long-term use. \nResearchers found a similar breast cancer risk with the progestin-only intrauterine device, and they couldn't rule out a risk for other hormonal contraceptives like the patch and the implant. \nBut the overall increased risk was small, amounting to one extra case of breast cancer among 7,700 women using such contraceptives per year. Experts who reviewed the research say women should balance the news against known benefits of the pill - including lowering the risk of other cancers. \n\"Hormonal contraception should still be perceived as a safe and effective option for family planning,\" said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital, who was not involved in the research. \nWomen in their 40s may want to consider non-hormonal IUDs, getting their tubes tied or talking with their partners about vasectomy, Manson said. \nStudies of older birth control pills have shown \"a net cancer benefit\" because of lowered risk of cancer of the colon, uterus and ovaries despite a raised breast cancer risk, said Mia Gaudet, a breast cancer epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society. \nThere was optimism that newer, low-dose contraceptives would lower the breast cancer risk, but these results have dashed those hopes, said Gaudet, who wasn't involved in the research. \nAbout 140 million women use some type of hormonal contraception, including about 16 million in the United States. \nResearchers analyzed health records of 1.8 million women, ages 15 to 49, in Denmark where a national health care system allows linking up large databases of prescription histories, cancer diagnoses and other information. \nResults were published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. Novo Nordisk Foundation funded the research, but played no role in designing the study. The foundation has ties to the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, which primarily makes diabetes drugs and does not make contraceptives. \nCurrent and recent use of hormonal contraceptives was associated with a 20 percent increased risk of breast cancer. Risk increased with longer use, from a 9 percent increase in risk with less than a year of contraceptive use to a 38 percent increase after more than 10 years of use. \nDigging further, the researchers found no differences among types of birth control pills. Because of fewer users, the results for the patch, vaginal ring, implant and progestin shot were less clear, but the analysis didn't rule out an increased breast cancer risk for those methods. \n\"No type of hormone contraceptive is risk-free unfortunately,\" said lead author Lina Morch of Copenhagen University Hospital. \nResearchers accounted for education, childbirth and family history of breast cancer, but they weren't able to adjust for several other known cancer risk factors such as alcohol use and limited physical activity, or protective factors such as breast-feeding. \nWomen with a family history of breast cancer may want to ask their doctors about other contraceptives, said Dr. Roshni Rao, a breast surgeon at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. \n\"Oral contraceptives are like any other medication,\" Rao said. \"There are risks and there are benefits. If you have a reason to be taking them, it's perfectly reasonable to do so.\" \n___ \nFollow AP Medical Writer Carla K. Johnson on Twitter: @CarlaKJohnson Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Image by : \nopensource.com \nFossdroid is an alternate web interface for the F\u2011Droid repository of open source apps for the Android operating system. Unlike the official F\u2011Droid website, Fossdroid's design is based on the Google Play Store, which gives users who have never used an external app repository a familiar interface to search, browse, and install Android apps. Users who use a lot of F\u2011Droid apps should install the F\u2011Droid app , which can install apps and keep them automatically updated, but Fossdroid provides a nice way to explore what the F\u2011Droid repository offers. Here's how to use the Fossdroid website to find, download, and install apps. Fossdroid's homepage fossdroid_homepage.png \nThe Fossdroid homepage has a Play Store inspired look and feel. The interface is not exactly the same, but it's close enough to be familiar to Android users. The homepage features a menu that lets a user browse by category, a search box, and a selection of apps displayed as individual tiles. The tiles can be sorted by recent, trending, or most popular apps. Browsing or searching for an app fossdroid_categories_menu.png \nTo browse the Fossdroid collection by category, tap the three horizontal bars icon in the top left corner of the webpage. A menu will appear that contains all the categories of apps available. Select a category by tapping on it, which will open a page with all the apps in that category. Like the homepage, the category pages can be sorted by recent, trending, or most popular. fossdroid_search.png \nTo search for an app, either by name or by function, enter the search terms in the \"Search application...\" box on the homepage. This will open a page listing the apps that match the search results. The search function can also be accessed by tapping on the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner of the webpage on both category and individual app pages. Learning more about an app fossdroid_app_page_with_menu.png \nTapping on the \"view app\" link in an app's tile opens the app's information page. This page shows all the information about the app, including its name, version number, when it was added to the F\u2011Droid repository, when it was last updated, a written description, and screenshots. Tapping the three vertical dots brings up a menu with links to the app's official website, F\u2011Droid page, source code, issue tracker, donation information, APK file, and a QR code linking to the APK file. For quick access, the icon with angle brackets at the bottom right of the screen links to the app's source code, and the down-arrow icon downloads the app's APK file. There is also a comment section to discuss the app, but most apps on Fossdroid have no comments. Downloading and installing an app fossdroid_download.png \nTo download an app from its Fossdroid page, tap on the orange down-arrow icon in the bottom right of the screen, or tap on the three vertical dots in the upper right of the page and select Download. Either way, the APK file will start downloading. Once the download is complete, tap on the Android download-complete notification to begin installing the app. A screen will appear describing the permissions the app needs to operate and offering the option to install or cancel. Tap on Install to install the app. Once installation is complete, tap on the app's icon in the list of installed apps to start it. unknown_sources_security_setting.png \nNote that if you have never installed apps from a non-Play Store source before, a message indicating that the installation was blocked may appear after tapping on the Download notification. If it does, tap on Settings in the notification, which will open a settings page with the option to change the security settings. Change the Unknown Sources setting to On and tap OK in the dialog box that opens.

(PA Graphics) \nMobile thefts peaked at 897,000 in 2008/09 (equivalent to 2.1% of mobile owners). \nThe figures also show that thefts of phones are most common among young adults. \nAmong 22 to 24-year-olds, 2.2% \u2013 roughly one in 45 people \u2013 had a mobile stolen in 2016/17. This is down from 4.3% in 2006/07, however. \nMobiles were involved in 32% of all thefts from the person in 2016/17, down from 51% in 2014/15. \nThefts from a person are defined as items taken from an individual using little or no force. \nThe average (mean) cost of items stolen during thefts from the person rose from \u00a3202 in 2015/16 to \u00a3221 in 2016/17, with the middle range (median) cost of items being around \u00a3100 in both years. \nHowever, the proportion of more expensive items, valued between \u00a3500-\u00a3999, stolen also rose significantly compared with a decade ago, from around 3% of thefts from the person in 2006/07 to 16% in 2016/17.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "office for national statistics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pa graphics", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:59.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0daf2f590ab2338f66100fd114a00fb6b35149ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFrcWb7lLbQm.KWg4TcPf72QG.3pFlSFDq3UIti44TGBfrFVLisvbgLXbzqkScgwXnpIjsBTPILNYSAn_8PHo3FCs4yRPpZfVZ0-", "site_full": "gordonmckechnie.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://gordonmckechnie.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Gordon McKechnie", "title": "On the Irish Border Question", "title_full": "On the Irish Border Question", "published": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0daf2f590ab2338f66100fd114a00fb6b35149ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFrcWb7lLbQm.KWg4TcPf72QG.3pFlSFDq3UIti44TGBfrFVLisvbgLXbzqkScgwXnpIjsBTPILNYSAn_8PHo3FCs4yRPpZfVZ0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gordon McKechnie (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "On the Irish Border Question", "text": "It should have become obvious over the past few days that there is no solution to the current Irish Border debate unless one side or the other backs down. The two possibilities before us - a hard border versus the same arrangements as today - are dependant on what sort of a trade deal the UK negotiates with the EU. The Irish Border question, which should be a result of the trade negotiations, has however become a precondition to them. \nIf, perchance, we end up, over the objections of the DUP, with a special deal for Northern Ireland, then Scotland and Wales would be quite right to demand something similar - moving the hard border off the islandof Ireland and onto the island of Britain. But then wouldn't Englandwant a special deal too, given the problems an English hard Brexit (\"Engxit\"?) would cause/is already causing to the English economy, and particularly to the less-well-off members of the population? \nThis route, if followed, would likely end up at something close to the UK(if it remained intact) remaining a member of the Customs Union and Single Market, though formally exiting EU. The UK would then, like a typical vassal state, pay into the running of the EU, but have no say (no MEPs, no representation on the Commission...) in the running thereof. It might then, with hindsight, look rather better to have remained a full member of the EU, on the terms Mr Cameron negotiated oh-so-long ago, and with influence on the EU's future direction. \nThe choice, if the UK remains intact, seems to come down to             a) Hard Brexit,             b) Vassal State, or             c) EU Member. \nDoes the (Sovereign?) Parliament at Westminster have a (cross-party) majority in favour of one of these options on the most important question of our times?

Could it be a record winter match weight average for Ireland\u2026 \nI said last match that when the Lower Bann is good it\u2019s very good, well when it\u2019s very good it\u2019s bloody excellent!! 28 anglers assembled for this match 5 in the EBCAC winter league series and found the river higher that the last occasion with three flood gates open. However it was very clean and dropping and the roach population must have been very hungry because they fed with a vengeance. The average weight this week exceeded 13kg which must be a record for any winter venue in Ireland. \nMichael Cormican on peg 47 fished his favourite 7m whips using 12 and15g floats for a superb 27.840 kg. Second and third weights came from nearby with Paul Hutchman on peg 49 weighing 22.850kg narrowly pipping Ron Jordan who had 21.950kg from 48. \nRon Jordan however retains his position at the top of the league. Results table \nClick here for the East Belfast Coarse Angling Club Facebook page Well it\u2019s that time of year again! The temperature\u2019s dropping, the leaves are turning and our attention turns to the Winter League.

Yesterday, one friend asked me if it is going to reach $50000 and I only could answer that right now you can not put any limits to its price, as I\u2019ve never witnessed no bullish price action of this kind. \nIn the 1H chart, you can draw a series of bullish channels that should be key levels for the short-term BTC/USD price action . BTC/USD 1H Chart \nAs for its indicators, chart shows the following patterns: \nMACD is positioned for a bearish move on a very short-term, but this could change in barely few minutes \nThe Directional Movement Index is showing an increase of shorts in the most recent steps of the bullish ride. Buyers still with the edge but losing a bit of steam \nWe should not forget the vertigo that the $10000 mark triggered barely a few days ago, yet now Bitcoin is not knocking on the $15000 door. There is not any bigger bullish trigger for the main Cryptocurrency than buyers\u2019 hopes of seeing much higher levels. \u00bfA bubble? Of course, but until it pops, expect more stratospherical gains as the norm, with not many traders willing to stay in the sidelines while others take big profits. \nIn the 4H chart, you can force a bit the trend analysis and spot some patterns that in other assets would be tagged as extreme and non-sense. But you can\u2019t discard these kind of moves with Bitcoin. Everything is possible with BTC/USD as it\u2019s going right now. BTC/USD 4H Chart \nThis chart shows the following trend indicator patterns: \nMACD still on its way to breaking any ceiling you may try to establish. Structure not showing any divergence, still with big bullish potential \nThe Directional Movement Index is showing sellers retreating and buyers still with the foot on the pedal Conclusion \nBitcoin is now looking at the $15000 mark as a clear, short-term goal. At the time of finishing this article up, BTC/USD is at $14710 and rising. \nOn the upside, there is an ultra-accelerated trend that sets the $15300 mark as a resistance level that could be reached today. If broken, we could start drawing 90-degree lines to try to find new bullish targets. \nOn the downside, the first support level is $14000, followed by $12750 and a bigger one located at $11700. \nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
