If a village has common land, with a stream or river running through it, that will do. We need ground sonar \u2013 so the best idea is if we get a company involved with sonar and drilling equipment. They take their money out of the free power we generate, and the 2% to cover plant maintenance/renewal. They the rest of the power money goes towards the village/ land owner. We should fins that the river of geothermal water tracks over ground rivers. And all land is forced up by steam fill mantel pockets. We drill down to enter the water chamber from below: we may choose to use a local hill \u2013 as the ground will sink by 2cm a century. So we get at water at 8 atmospheres, and 178 o C. This super heated water has gold, silver, platinum, copper, lead, arsenic... in. So we vent the gas to 6 atmospheres, and it boils, dropping to 168 o C. We pass through a Dyson double helix, and collect the heavy metal power. We sell to a local metals agent \u2013 who will collect and pay by metal content, and price. 40% of the metal dust will be gold! This will be worth more than the power we produce. We get 120MW of carbon 0 power: we pass the steam through a small turbine, or a commercially source thermoelectric generator. Each house only needs 8kW. So we power 196 houses. Off free carbon 0 power. The national grid pays up 3,165 UK pounds per kW year. So get get 600,000 UK pounds. Money we receive \u2013 and do not pay the power companies. And the gold pays us 720,000 UK pounds today. So each farmer, land owner of village is about to get very rich. Power with no CO 2 , or hyper-toxic radioactive waste. I gave this idea to my PhD supervisor at Sheffield University 2000. It is a first year rneginering practical, to build the plant and get it working, over a university term.

http://www.lrb.co.uk/v09/n19/tony-blair/diary\n\n\u201c But there is nothing more ridiculous than the notion that socialism is inexorably dying, or has been compulsorily retired on grounds of redundancy. Socialism, as its name suggests, is based on a belief in the notion of action through the community, in the idea that individuals do not stand alone, and that it is not merely morally right that we should think of ourselves in this way but that it is the most rational way to organise our lives. The world we face today makes a socialist approach all the more relevant: from new technology to the arms race, co-operation surely makes more sense than competition. \u201d\n\u201c Post-war Britain has seen two big changes. First, and partly as a result of reforming Labour governments, there are many more healthy, wealthy and well-educated people than before. In addition, employment has switched from traditional manufacturing industries to a more white-collar, service-based economy. The inevitable result has been that class identity has fragmented. Only about a third of the population now regard themselves as \u2018working-class\u2019. Of course it is possible still to analyse Britain in terms of a strict Marxist definition of class: but it is not very helpful to our understanding of how the country thinks and votes. In fact, of that third, many are likely not to be \u2018working\u2019 at all: these are the unemployed, pensioners, single parents \u2013 in other words, the poor.\nA party that restricts its appeal to the traditional working class will not win an election. That doesn\u2019t entail a rejection of socialism\u2019s traditional values: but it does mean that its appeal, and hence its policies, must address a much wider range of interests. \u201d\n\u201c The trick for Labour is not to follow them and abandon the notion of government and collective provision: but to re-fashion it so that real power is exercised by people and not by institutions or bureaucracies. The fundamental error of Dr Owen (and, oddly, of David Steel since the election, though not before it) has been to surrender to Mrs Thatcher\u2019s philosophy and say that power can only be devolved through the market. The 1990s will not see the continuing triumph of the market, but its failure. \u201d\n\nRoy Hattersley: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/24/labour2001to2005.news\n\u201c Tony Blair discovered a big idea. His destiny is to create a meritocracy. Unfortunately meritocracy is not the form of society which social democrats want to see. ... A Labour government should not be talking about escape routes from poverty and deprivation. By their nature they are only available to a highly-motivated minority. The Labour Party was created to change society in such a way that there is no poverty and deprivation from which to escape . ... The certain knowledge that the Conservative Party would be a worse government than Labour is not enough to sustain what used to be a party of principles. ... At this moment Labour stands for very little that can be identified with social democracy \u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:10.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "141e38b9abace68911e03690c6cf6e690a92b71e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFe0DRNX1j4iYgNSbZFs.PuyfRXc4Qhhd_pwoIK5WQCfgxWBPFYlQE57OxN6RWlvqpKdl7KHkbVnAb6meqUjyERDDzHR6V7zwObilqd5TNL5XqdfjZPRWPPXzY7avqLA4NuVpJaRvxrFIJkHr9uMmk9inPgRB4COpVA", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/exterior-accessories", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Exterior Automotive Accessories for the Best Price in Malaysia", "title": "8Pcs/Lot Car Vinyl Stickers Universal Door Handle Bowl Protective Film- 8*9 cm", "title_full": "8Pcs/Lot Car Vinyl Stickers Universal Door Handle Bowl Protective Film- 8*9 cm | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2016-10-21T03:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 58, "participants_count": 52, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "739748f03877fad63a8e4c9416f121ef5ae6dda7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFe0DRNX1j4iYgNSbZFs.PuyfRXc4Qhhd_pwoIK5WQCfgxWBPFYlQE57OxN6RWlvqpKdl7KHkbVnAb6meqUjyERDDzHR6V7zwObilqd5TNL5XqdfjZPRWPPXzY7avqLA4NuVpJaRvxrFIJkHr9uMmk9immdVTUOVRPAY7.m9YsYIvA-", "ord_in_thread": 55, "author": "Ng", "published": "2017-11-28T15:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "Its not universal car friendly", "text": "Just go to accessories shop and ask expert to do it for you instead of do this on your own.

It also highlighted that Vodafone-Idea would have high leverage at 3.8 times. \nThe company was in the news recently when it declared its results for the September quarter. \nThe telecom operator reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 1,106.8 crore for the second quarter of the current fiscal. The company had reported a net profit of Rs 91.5 crore in July-September a year ago. \nIts revenue from operations dropped 19.72 per cent to Rs 7,465.5 crore in the quarter under review, from Rs 9,300.23 crore in the year-ago period.

(YuYao Gao) \nRecently, a child star has attracted attention in China, and she published a very interesting rap song: \u201cFreestyle In the Girl\u2019s Dorm\u201d. Thousands of reposts were received on weibo just one day. The song is sung by a girl named Yuyao Gao, who is only 12 years old. She is a talented child star since childhood, and she has lots of perform experiences on CCTV, local TV and other important events. There are countless art awards she has got. Apart from a great singer, she also has the talent on acting. She got a role in the TV Situation Sitcom \u201cfamily with children\u201d, and also directed and acted in many children\u2019s micro-films by herself. \n(YuYao Gao) Today, Yuyao Gao has been influenced by the hip-hop, and learning rap with the China hip-hop leader group \u2013 XinJieKou Band.It\u2019s amazing that under the guidance of her teacher she finished the whole song independently as the generation after 00\u2019s. \n(Xinjiekou) Her performance means that the first post-00 rapper enters the Chinese music industry and is now the youngest female rapper to officially release her single rap song. More and more children are fond of hip-hop with the support of their parents. In the past the choices were folk music and main stream music. (Group) \nThe new era is quite unexpected. \nWe are expecting hip-hop will be flourishing in China and perhaps make a bigger surprise for the world. \nMedia Contact Company Name: FINANCE NEWS CO., LTD.

At times, the child\u2019s attorney ad litem also serves as a guardian ad litem. However, attorney ad litems are tasked with arguing for what their assigned child or children want. When there\u2019s a conflict, Darnell said she will typically appoint another attorney, who likely has other cases demanding their time. \n\u201cIf I have a CASA volunteer on the case, I know that that person is involved in that child\u2019s life, there\u2019s not another child that\u2019s demanding attention from that CASA volunteer so I know that I\u2019m just going to get a whole lot more information about what\u2019s going on with my kids when I have a CASA volunteer involved,\u201d she said. \nA CASA volunteer\u2019s duties also include making sure their assigned child is doing well in school and in foster care, which means spending time with the child and providing whatever support or services they need. Sometimes it\u2019s as simple as getting them their favorite toy. \n\u201cIf I can make a kid happy by collecting a toy from the home and stuff like that goes overlooked because there\u2019s so much going on in these cases and if a CASA can sit down and listen to a child and really pull that kind of information out of the child and bring that information to me if I can help or if they can help, that\u2019s so helpful to me,\u201d Darnell said. \nThe trust Darnell has for the recommendation of a CASA volunteer comes from firsthand experience when she volunteered as one when she was a lawyer in Amarillo. She said she was unfamiliar with child protective cases at the time and signed up after a friend\u2019s recommendation. \n\u201cI did the training for CASA and I got my one boy that I helped through the system. Then I really, really, just kind of fell in love with that area of the law and kids who are in care,\u201d she said. \nHow to contribute: \nn Mail : Goodfellows, P.O.

Socialism, as its name suggests, is based on a belief in the notion of action through the community, in the idea that individuals do not stand alone, and that it is not merely morally right that we should think of ourselves in this way but that it is the most rational way to organise our lives. The world we face today makes a socialist approach all the more relevant: from new technology to the arms race, co-operation surely makes more sense than competition. \u201d\n\u201c Post-war Britain has seen two big changes. First, and partly as a result of reforming Labour governments, there are many more healthy, wealthy and well-educated people than before. In addition, employment has switched from traditional manufacturing industries to a more white-collar, service-based economy. The inevitable result has been that class identity has fragmented. Only about a third of the population now regard themselves as \u2018working-class\u2019. Of course it is possible still to analyse Britain in terms of a strict Marxist definition of class: but it is not very helpful to our understanding of how the country thinks and votes. In fact, of that third, many are likely not to be \u2018working\u2019 at all: these are the unemployed, pensioners, single parents \u2013 in other words, the poor.\nA party that restricts its appeal to the traditional working class will not win an election. That doesn\u2019t entail a rejection of socialism\u2019s traditional values: but it does mean that its appeal, and hence its policies, must address a much wider range of interests. \u201d\n\u201c The trick for Labour is not to follow them and abandon the notion of government and collective provision: but to re-fashion it so that real power is exercised by people and not by institutions or bureaucracies. The fundamental error of Dr Owen (and, oddly, of David Steel since the election, though not before it) has been to surrender to Mrs Thatcher\u2019s philosophy and say that power can only be devolved through the market. The 1990s will not see the continuing triumph of the market, but its failure. \u201d\n\nRoy Hattersley: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/24/labour2001to2005.news\n\u201c Tony Blair discovered a big idea. His destiny is to create a meritocracy. Unfortunately meritocracy is not the form of society which social democrats want to see. ... A Labour government should not be talking about escape routes from poverty and deprivation. By their nature they are only available to a highly-motivated minority. The Labour Party was created to change society in such a way that there is no poverty and deprivation from which to escape . ... The certain knowledge that the Conservative Party would be a worse government than Labour is not enough to sustain what used to be a party of principles. ...

The spiritual Motto of Pre. Trump\u2019s declaration from Isaiah 62.1: \u201cFor Zion\u2019s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem\u2019s sake I will not rest, un6til her triumph go forth as brightness and her salvation as a torch that burneth\u201d \n2. Pre. Trump: \u201cAfter more than two decades of waivers, we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result. Therefore, I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel\u2026\u2026.. Today, Jerusalem is the seat of the modern Israeli government. It is the home of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, as well as the Israeli Supreme Court. It is the location of the official residences of the Prime Minister and the President. It is the headquarters of many government ministries\u2026\u2026.Jerusalem is the capital the Jewish people established in ancient times,\u201d Trump said. \u201cToday Jerusalem is the seat of Israel\u2019s government\u2026..Today, we finally acknowledged the obvious, that Jerusalem is Israel\u2019s capital. This is nothing more than recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do\u2026..That is why consistent with the Jerusalem Embassy Act, I am also directing the State Department to begin preparations to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This will immediately begin the process of hiring architects, engineers, and planners do that a new embassy when completed, will be a magnificent tribute to peace\u201d.\n3. After days of speculation and rumor-mongering, The American Pre. Donald Trump delivered the speech of a lifetime \u2013 at least in the lifetime of the Jewish People. I never thought he would have it in him, but I give Trump full credit. The speech was excellent. He hit all the right notes without committing any great diplomatic faux pas. He declared America\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel \u2013 \u201crecognizing reality\u201d as he accurately called it. He simply reaffirmed the blindingly obvious \u2013 that Jerusalem has always been the capital of Israel and that it\u2019s about time America recognized that fact. He walked a diplomatic tightrope by not going into the details of exactly where the US Embassy will be located or how long it will take to get it ready. In this way he satisfied the Israelis, and if the Palestinians were so inclined, they could be satisfied too, since the issue of the Embassy was left open-ended. He also didn\u2019t mention the dreaded two-state solution \u2013 which by now should be recognized by all as a non-starter. He simply reaffirmed the United States\u2019 commitment to peace and to settling the Arab-Israeli conflict, calling on all sides for restraint. In fa, t the speech was startling for the lack of any great new insights. It was the very fact that every point was obvious, and has always been evident for anyone who cared to look, that was so unusual \u2013 because when it comes to Middle East Peace-processing, wishful thinking is the name of the game. This speech was almost an \u201cEmperor has no clothes\u201d moment, except that here Donald Trump was playing the part of the naive child who states the reality for all the world to see.\n4. The Arabs, the Palestinians in particular, are threatening \u201cdays of rage\u201d in response to Trump\u2019s declaration. But did they ever declare \u201cdays of peace\u201d when countless UN resolutions were passed in their favour? How about that miserable UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which declared all of Judea and Samaria as Palestinian territory, and calling all the settlements illegal, which was passed with the aid, abetting and active assistance of the United States under President Barack Obama? Did we get peace talks and normalization, or offers of land-swaps? We did not. We simply got more of the same old violence: stabbings, car-rammings, shootings and more. So please, give us Israelis one reason why we should take any more notice of these latest threats of days of rage than any other days of rage that are routinely declared on the slightest of pretexts.\n5. The Taylor Force Act passed the US House of Representatives by unanimous consent on Tuesday, confronting the Palestinian Authority with the prospect of a massive cut in US aid for as long as it maintains its policy of paying monthly salaries and other benefits to the families of slain or convicted Palestinian terrorists. Named in memory of Taylor Force \u2014 the former American army officer stabbed to death during a knifing spree by a Palestinian assailant in Tel Aviv in March 2016 \u2014 the legislation prevents the transfer of funds \u201cthat directly benefit the Palestinian Authority\u201d for a six-year period beginning in 2018 unless the PA verifiably ends its so-called \u201cmartyr payments\u201d policy. \n6. One that will read this post will think that the skies fell down. No, it didn\u2019t. All seen here is a result of one thing: It is the result of the constant refusal of the Arabs to negotiate peace with Israel and their declaration that all of Israel, unconditionally, belongs to them. In order to achieve it, rule over the entire of Israel, they will kill all Jews. Moreover, Trump\u2019s declaration and the written in #4 are results of the Palestinian continuous pressure, on Israel, and the massive majority of Muslims in every UN committee. All the resolutions that were confirmed in the UN different departments, in favor of the Arabs, were achieved due to religion, not political and or historical facts, vote. Although none of them was a critic for the survival of Israel, It bothered Israel. Even those that didn\u2019t have any formal juridical foundation. (There was couple like these). So, Trump\u2019s blessed declaration will be a torch, to the international world, that will light the way of the UN towards voting for the truth, not for dark political resolutions and that also tiny states have rights in this world especially a state like Israel, that contributes to the world many times more than the Muslim states that feed 1.7 billion mouths of Muslims that contribute very little to the society.\n7. Pre. Trump opened a wide door for peace. His declaration gives one in a generation, to go forward with it. But, the Arabs/PA, like in all previous cases/attempts holds all trials, repeat their stubbornness. Moreover: The leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniya said that they, Hamas will do what they know the best: to make war. He said that he will open the gates of the sky. Mr. Abu Mazen was not less extreme when he declared the following: \u201cFurther to Trump\u2019s declaration of USA recognition Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, the Palestinian issue is now in a very critic condition. The American regime decided to overrule the international resolutions and prefer to ignore international consensus. We, Palestine, condemn this behavior of the American president\u2026\u2026\u201dJerusalem is the city of peace, the city of Al Aqsa Mosque, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and the capital of Palestine\u201d. Please pay attention: No word about any past/previous/ancient relations between Israel and Jerusalem. So, does anybody can consider bridging/creating peace between over such a wide gap? I am sorry. I don\u2019t see any possibility for such.\n8. This atmosphere, as described in #7, is the direct result of UNESCO\u2019s resolution, that fully supported the Muslims side, concerning the full relations/contacts of the Muslim to Jerusalem/Al Aqsa, and on the other hand the complete lake of Jewish relations to the Temple and the Mount Temple in Jerusalem. From this point of view Pre. Trump\u2019s declaration put a break in the wheels of the train that carry the Muslim\u2019s lies. I am certain that Trump\u2019s declaration, which can be considered as Balfour declaration, will help Israel in its position, concerning Jerusalem internationally.\n9. Trump\u2019s effect: Further to Pre. Trumps decision to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem, more states expressed their will to do it. Trump broke the glass ceiling and now Jerusalem will get its right position, like all capitals in the world, that all embassies will be located in the capital of Israel-in Jerusalem.\n10. There is a silent agreement, among the Arabs and Muslims, of being Jerusalem the capital of Israel. The late Pre. Sadat came to the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, in Jerusalem to take his speech. The same was with king Hussein of Jordan. Many Muslim leaders from Africa and the Middle East visited/visiting will visit Israel and its capital Jerusalem. They give publicity to their visits. This means that they recognize Israel and its capital.\n11. This is what the Arabs/Muslims are dealing with: 2 Muslim terrorists were arrested in GB suspected in planning to murder the PM of GB. Well, what is this vast murder done by Muslims against Muslims and Non Muslims too Is it normal to behave this way???\nJerusalem was, is and will stay Israel\u2019s capital forever in spite of all pressure that is coming from the Muslim, only from Muslim world.\nPlease share the post.\nPlease buy Israel and support us everywhere.\nLike every day but today much more joyful\nIn friendship\nAmir", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "isaiah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balfour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu mazen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ismail haniya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sadat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem/al aqsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hussein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "israeli parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israeli supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestinian authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "temple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taylor force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knesset", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east peace-processing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al aqsa mosque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount temple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samaria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:14.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c5b610502e78c923b9c5219f2f312f1aa1f63977", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT7WbmF8KXMMu2hUizmo8M_jbwKnI.NNbj2Al9Os9EDzvqiPLxa5QYUSQUr0.FMxilGQv61jIV0KyUGwKumPHt4eD1KZvTvafFdQV8Qzh.uRv6w6cLdFjkAKoB2Kl1HYYM-", "site_full": "www.axios.com", "site": "axios.com", "site_section": "http://livinfo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "information - Google News", "title": "Uber paid 20-year-old hacker to destroy data breach information - Axios", "title_full": "Uber paid 20-year-old hacker to destroy data breach information - Axios", "published": "2017-12-07T03:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://axios-img.rbl.ms/simage/https%3A%2F%2Fassets.rbl.ms%2F16545476%2F980x.jpg/2000%2C2000/iDGXaXKFGFgqRw8w/img.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c5b610502e78c923b9c5219f2f312f1aa1f63977", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT7WbmF8KXMMu2hUizmo8M_jbwKnI.NNbj2Al9Os9EDzvqiPLxa5QYUSQUr0.FMxilGQv61jIV0KyUGwKumPHt4eD1KZvTvafFdQV8Qzh.uRv6w6cLdFjkAKoB2Kl1HYYM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T03:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "Uber paid 20-year-old hacker to destroy data breach information - Axios", "text": "NYC terror suspect in custody after subway blast The scene following an explosion near Times Square on Monday. Photo: Andres Kudacki / AP \n27-year-old Akayed Ullah is in custody after he intentionally detonated a low-tech pipe bomb in a subway station near Times Square on Monday. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the explosion was \"an attempted terrorist attack.\" \nThe Department of Homeland Security said Ullah came to the U.S. in 2011 after presenting a passport displaying an F43 family immigrant visa. Ullah \"is a Lawful Permanent Resident from Bangladesh who benefited from extended family chain migration,\" said DHS spokesman Tyler Houlton. Keep reading ... words \nDetails of attack: The New York Police Department said the explosion occurred in an underground walkway that runs through the Port Authority bus terminal and Times Square along 42nd Street. NYC Police Commissioner James P. O'Neill said during a press conference that Ullah had attached the \"low-tech\" pipe bomb to himself with a \u201ccombination of Velcro and zip ties.\" It's unclear whether Ullah was attempting a suicide bombing. O'Neill also said Ullah acted alone and no other devices had been found. Following the blast, Ullah was taken into custody and transported to Bellevue Hospital where he was treated for severe burns to his hands and abdomen. NYPD said three others suffered minor injuries. No formal announcement has been made on what's next, but both federal and local law enforcement officials have indicated that Ullah will be prosecuted in federal court in Manhattan, reports the New York Times . The attack is also being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. \nWhat they're saying: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo: \"This is New York. The reality is that we are a target for people who would like to make a statement against democracy, against freedom. We are not going to allow them to disrupt us.\" Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen: The Trump administration is taking \u201cappropriate action to protect our people and our country ... The administration continues to adopt significant security measures to keep terrorists from entering our country and from recruiting within our borders.\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders: : \"We know that the president's policy calls for end to chain migration .. had [Trump's] policy been in place, then the attacker would not have been allowed to come into the country.\" ",

Meta Viers McClatchy Wildfire destroys mobile homes in California retirement park By ELLIOT SPAGAT and AMANDA LEE MYERS Associated Press December 08, 2017 01:55 AM FALLBROOK, Calif. \nA brush fire driven by gusty winds that have plagued Southern California all week exploded rapidly Thursday north of San Diego, destroying dozens of mobile homes in a retirement community and killing race horses at an elite training facility. \nThe fire exceeded 6 square miles (16 square kilometers) in a matter of hours and tore through the tightly packed Rancho Monserate Country Club community in the small city of Fallbrook, known for its avocado orchards and horse ranches. Three people were burned trying to escape the flames, said Capt. Nick Schuler of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \nThe destructive blaze broke out as firefighters tried to corral the largest fire in the state that was burning around Ventura \u2014 130 miles (209 kilometers) to the north \u2014 and destroyed 430 buildings as it grew to 180 square miles (466 square kilometers) since Monday. Fire crews also fought large fires around Los Angeles, though they made enough progress to lift most evacuation orders. \nLike other fires that have broken out this week, Fallbrook has a history of destructive blazes. Ten years ago, as a series of similar fires raced across Southern California, a blaze in Fallbrook injured five people, destroyed 206 homes and burned 14 square miles (36 square kilometers).

SUBSCRIBE NOW \nDriven by winds above 35 mph (56 kph), Thursday's fire wiped out rows of trailer homes in the retirement community and left behind charred and mangled metal where they had stood. \nThe fire started from an unknown cause next to State Highway 76 and blew across six lanes to the other side. The highway was closed Thursday night. \nEvacuations were ordered in the area near the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base and schools and casinos were being used as shelters. \nJim Peratt was in Las Vegas on business when his wife called and said she was rounding up their two horses and evacuating their property in Bonsall, a community of 4,000 amid the rolling hills of rural San Diego County. \n\"She saw nothing but smoke and flames all around,\" Peratt said. \"I'm praying I'll have a home when I get back.\" \nAs the flames approached the elite San Luis Rey Downs training facility for thoroughbreds, many of the more than 450 horses were cut loose to prevent them from being trapped in their stables if barns caught fire, said Mac McBride of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club. \nHorse trainer Scott Hansen said he knows that some of his 30 horses at the facility died. \n\"I don't know how many are living and how many are dead,\" he said. \"I guess I'll have to figure that out in the morning.\" \nMost of the horses were saved, McBride said, and were being loaded to go to the Del Mar Fairgrounds. \nSome ranchers posted urgent pleas on Twitter for help moving horses, including Rawhide Ranch, well-known for running riding camps for children. \nThe fire and a smaller one 12 miles (19 kilometers) north in the city of Murrieta broke out the day after state officials sent an unprecedented alert to cell phones across seven Southern California counties warning that strong Santa Ana winds could cause extreme fire danger. Although hurricane-force winds predicted did not materialize, firefighters faced gusts that fanned flames and put thousands of homes in jeopardy. Related stories from The Sun News California sent fire danger text alert to 12 million people \nAlong the coast between Ventura and Santa Barbara, tiny beach communities were under siege as fire leapt from steep hillsides across U.S. Highway 101. \n\"We drove through a wall of flames,\" Wendy Frank said, describing her ordeal after evacuating her horses from Ojai on Wednesday night. \"I didn't know if we'd make it. I just put the accelerator down. I know we were going over 100 mph (160 kph), we could have been going much more, and just hoped for the best.\" \nFires flared up Thursday along the highway, forcing an evacuation of dozens of homes at Faria Beach. \n\"Anyone in your homes still, you need to leave now,\" a California Highway Patrol officer said through a loudspeaker while driving down a smoke-shrouded street. \"The fire is here, you need to leave.\" \nJoseph Ruffner had left earlier in the week but returned and said he was staying put this time. \n\"This morning there was a wall of fire back right over here,\" he said. \"I didn't think it was no big deal, but it's coming back to burn what it didn't burn yesterday.\" \nThe highway, which runs the length of the state and is a major commuter corridor to Los Angeles, was closed intermittently along the 28-mile (45-kilometer) stretch between Ventura and Santa Barbara. \nThe Ventura and LA-area fires have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure almost certain to rise. \nA woman was found dead in a wrecked car in an evacuation zone near the city of Santa Paula, where the Ventura County blaze began Monday night, but officials could not immediately say whether the accident was fire-related. \nThe massive fire threatened Ojai, a scenic mountain town dubbed \"Shangri-La\" and known for its boutique hotels and New Age spiritual retreats. \nMost of Ojai's 7,000 residents were warned to clear out late Wednesday and patients unable to walk were moved from the Ojai Valley Community Hospital because of unprecedented, hurricane-force Santa Ana winds in the overnight forecast. \nAsh fell like snowflakes on citrus orchards scattered around town and on Spanish-style architecture as firefighters parked their trucks around houses in anticipation of winds picking back up. \nSome businesses were closed, but staples could be found at Pat's Liquor, where Hank Cheyne-Garcia loaded up with supplies to fuel through another edgy night keeping sentry on the fire. \n\"It got a little too intense yesterday with the wind kicking up,\" he said. \"There was just so much smoke. Yesterday you couldn't see the street.\" \n___ \nMyers reported from Ventura.

There's only one form of privilege, and that's wealth. All other forms of cultural resentment - which is what identity politics is really about - spring from that concern. \n\nIt's good that society is more aware of identity politics, but the downside of that is that not everyone involved in such activity is (to be quite blunt) reasonable, sensible, or worth listening to out of anything more than politeness. In this, I should add, they are no different from anyone else. Does someone automatically become wise or insightful by being discontented? \n\nOf course, it's not an either/or situation. You can have class consciousness and partake of identity politics. I think a bit of the latter is generally a good thing, but the trouble with it is that it is primarily a product of the 'level playing field' illusion provided by social media, in which hierarchies are rendered more or less inoperative.

Athens", "text": "Dear TA members\nHere is my trip report of our visit to Athens during the last week of November 2017. We, a family of three adults, had a great 4 nights 3 days stay at Athens, thanks to Nick Arch, Absolute Athens, kinghiss, Yiassas and others for so many valuable tips and info.\nOur Athens experience was overwhelming; Classical Athens, once the cradle of western civilization and birthplace of democracy with impressive architecture, most of which are in ruins leaving it all to our imagination and the modern Athens teaming with people everywhere and nightmare traffic in narrow roads.\nI have also posted the report along with photos in my blog to make it look visually interesting for readers. All photos were taken by me. I hope the report and the blog will be useful for TA members and visitors.\nhttps:/\u2026\nhttps:/\u2026\nhttps:/\u2026\nDay 1. Reached Acropolis entrance around 10 am. Not many visitors and the weather was pleasant. First stop was Theater of Dionysus and then walked up via the Odeon of Herodes Atticus theatre (much better preserved than Theater of Dionysus and reached the grand edifice The Parthenon grounds. The area around main Parthenon Temple is cordoned off due to renovation work so we had to just go around the temple amid ruins and renovation debris. Spent little more than an hour and walked down to Roman Agora through winding lanes. Passed the Athens University Museum and stopped at a cute little caf\u00e9 Klepsydra(?) for some Baklawa and coffee. Reached Roman Agora and were put off by the aggressive hawkers (looked like Africans?) at the gate trying to sell some color threads. The Roman Agora was a disappointment as there was practically nothing except a few pillars. Moved on to Adrianou Street to reach Ancient Agora. We were hungry by now, partly due to the mixed aroma of food from the restaurants lining up the street. Had a quick lunch at a corner restaurant with a local beer Mythos. Just realized that it was past 3 pm and the Ancient Agora was closed for the day. Walked in to the by lanes visiting the several colourful shops selling souvenirs, knickknacks, clothes etc. Bought ice cream at the Hans &Gretel themed confectionery shop and walked further to realize we were already into the thick of Monstiraki Flea Market! The market was teaming with people locals as wells tourists. Spent a couple of hours in the area and then took the metro from the Monastiraki Station and reached our accommodation close to Acropolis Museum station.\nDay 2: Visited the Acropolis Museum \u2013 a very modern building \u2013 housing some of the precious artifacts and remains of the classical Athens. The major exhibits at the ground level are not allowed for photography. Pity to see most large exhibits, i.e statues, figurines etc are only in parts and pieces mounted for visitors to visualise. However, many smaller exhibits inside the glass shelves such as ceramics/terracota treasures were intact. TA members recommended the restaurant at the museum but since it was a bit too early for lunch we ordered Baklawa topped with ice cream and some coffee. Both were amazing quality!! Highly recommended, though the service is a bit slow. Took the metro to reach Monastiraki and walked up to Ancient Agora.\nMostly in ruins except the reconstructed museum at one end and the Temple of Hephaestus at the other end, the Agora leaves much to our imagination of how bustling and thriving the place should have been once upon a time. The museum itself is interesting with its artifacts. Spent about 2 hours in the area and then walked across the street; this time to Psirri. With the help of GPS on our mobile, we found Taverna Tou highly recommended by TA members. Tucked inside a lane the Taverna is typically Greek. We ordered local red wine that was served in copper mug!, grilled pork with mashed potatoes, grilled chicken with fresh potato fries with local flavour, Baked vegetables, fava beans and spinach in thick sauce\u2026. The quality of the food was simply amazing\u2026 every dish was well worth the money. Highly recommended.\nCame out and saw some local cafes already decked up in elaborate Christmas decor and then stumbled across a few antique/flea stores. Spent an hour rumbling through and bought a few interesting stuff.\nWalked further to Hadrian\u2019s Library and wandered inside the grounds. Walked back to Ermou street and spent rest of the day getting in and out of the several boutiques and fashion shops. Took the metro from Monstiraki and reached our apartment.\nDay 3: This was a Sunday and we had already planned to be at the Parliament Square ( Syntagma ) to watch the Change of Guard ceremony. Reached the spot at 10.30 am; the ceremony began around 10.45 and ended by 11.30 am. Interesting spectacle watching the Evzones and their royal gear!! Went around the Parliament building and entered the National Garden through a side gate open for public to reach Zappeion a landmark building, which is currently used for conferences and exhibitions. Spent some time looking around the building and then made our way to our planned lunch at Avacado restaurant at Nikis, highly recommended by TA members. We had to wait for about 20 minutes as the place is popular but the number of tables is limited. True to its status the restaurant\u2019s menu was very unique with several signature dishes. We ordered a mix of Asian and Mediterranean- Spicy Thai soup, Falafel, Mushroom forest burger, Om Shanthi -a delicious creamy curry and rice- and a Carrot Cake (total cost Euro 23 for three pax). The food was very delicious!! Not to be missed. Unfortunately they don\u2019t take reservations so you have to reach and wait until you are seated.\nAfter a relaxed lunch took a taxi to reach Lycabettus hill. Took the cable car to the top and enjoyed the panoramic views of the sprawling city as we waited for the sunset. As the sun went down and the lights went up, it was spectacular to see the Acropolis lit up against the backdrop of Aegean Sea afar. There is a small but beautiful church atop. Getting a taxi on return may be tricky. A couple of taxi guys waiting at the gate wouldn\u2019t switch on the meter and were demanding a fixed (higher) fare. We waited a while and soon there was a taxi coming in; we jumped in and reached our apartment early, as we had to pack up and leave for Santorini by the next morning flight.\n6 places mentioned in this post 1 Parthenon Ranked #3 of 325 things to do in Athens 11 728 Reviews 2 Roman Agora Ranked #45 of 325 things to do in Athens 546 Reviews 3 Adrianou Street Ranked #42 of 325 things to do in Athens 336 Reviews 4 Syntagma Athens, Attica, Greece 5 Acropolis Ranked #2 of 325 things to do in Athens 25 240 Reviews 6 Santorini Cyclades, South Aegean, Greece See all 6", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://footnotesbykaran.com/2017/12/07/three-days-in-athens-a-heady-mix-of-ancient-and-modern/", "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif", "https://footnotesbykaran.com/2017/12/07/three-days-in-athens-day2/", "https://footnotesbykaran.com/2017/12/07/three-days-in-athens-day-3/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:15.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72aa3021a4d626f21269ce814fe282b98a9370a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TdDeGOxVTGrOf0WpU2tVDr9__EOe03m8E0yPrOBvYLNmogIqV04JM1IfCldeYKPm9tScTHPMAjdSAlb8t8u3.xsmWLmTq07GUA7fe9acmmpw--", "site_full": "averypublicsociologist.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://averypublicsociologist.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "All That Is Solid ...", "title": "Hammond's Excruciating Budget", "title_full": "Hammond's Excruciating Budget", "published": "2017-11-23T00:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a7928de9031cae8f7f57537d74ecde61a0fe4092", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TdDeGOxVTGrOf0WpU2tVDr9__EOe03m8E0yPrOBvYLNmogIqV04JM1IfCldeYKPm9tScTHPMAjdSAlb8t8u3.xsmWLmTq07GXM80WRn953B3Q2mNh.vsqv", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-06T13:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I am not sure that the grounds you site, alone, are sufficient to refuse party membership. (I suspect he will, for vanities sake, only apply to re-join if \u201cinvited). There are plenty of people within the party who hold similar, or worse views, and we have also taken on floor-crossing Tories without significant analysis of their previous positions.\n\nWhat we have here however is a former MP who, like as not, sought expulsion with his comments, but then went all out to damage the party. He did so in 3 parliamentary elections, it is probably not fair to describe his 2017 candidature nor his London Mayoral run as harmful. These were all dirty campaigns involving unacceptable reliance on communalism. In line with your observations on 2 of these occasions this involved women, BME candidates \u2013 Oona King probably being deliberately targeted. Both were horribly treated. Respect also damaged the party in local elections. \n\nThough Respect folded \u2013 finally due to the Assange comments you cite \u2013 he grandiosely saw it as a \u201crebirth\u201d of Labour. Forget celebrity big brother, his RT shows, his appalling use of litigation to silence opponents, and even the issues on which you rightly take him to task. Until he offers some honest political accounting for this there can be no place for him in the party.\n\nSP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:15.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72aa3021a4d626f21269ce814fe282b98a9370a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TdDeGOxVTGrOf0WpU2tVDr9__EOe03m8E0yPrOBvYLNmogIqV04JM1IfCldeYKPm9tScTHPMAjdSAlb8t8u3.xsmWLmTq07GUA7fe9acmmpw--", "site_full": "averypublicsociologist.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://averypublicsociologist.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "All That Is Solid ...", "title": "Hammond's Excruciating Budget", "title_full": "Hammond's Excruciating Budget", "published": "2017-11-23T00:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "649e0f63a6ce6c270cd0beed5e36f8775a7af5cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TdDeGOxVTGrOf0WpU2tVDr9__EOe03m8E0yPrOBvYLNmogIqV04JM1IfCldeYKPm9tScTHPMAjdSAlb8t8u3.xsmWLmTq07GXM80WRn953Bxypm6N_K2GG", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "asquith", "published": "2017-12-06T22:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Does he still think appearing alongside Nigel Farrago in the Brexshit campaign was a good idea?\n\nIs he still a supporter of Russian imperialism, the only good kind according to \"anti-imperialists\"?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:15.034+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15135795, "moreResultsAvailable": 15135695, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512638295034&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 814}
