It\u2019s OK to oppose a tax bill that lets people keep more of their own money (by misquoting the Bible), but don\u2019t you dare suggest that the Bible prohibits killing unborn babies, same-sex sexuality, and the claim that there are more than two sexes. \nNancy Pelosi said the Republican tax reform bill, misquoting the Bible, will mean \u201cthe end of the world\u201d and \u201cArmageddon.\u201d So what was our nation like when we didn\u2019t have an income tax? \nThere are many Christians who do not understand the basics of economics or what the Bible says about taxation and government interference in the marketplace, as evidenced by a group of \u201cChristian\u201d socialists led by Jim Wallis who protested the tax cut legislation \u201cin the atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building in Washington. They were reading Bible verses about caring for the poor, and doing it so loudly that their voices could be heard at the doors of senators\u2019 office suites nine stories above.\u201d \nJoel McDurmon describes the scene : \nAt one point in the demonstration, one of the priestesses declared, \u201cSenators, we put you on notice: your souls are in danger, and this is your final warning\u201d\u2014as if any single one of these liberal theologians really believed in a final judgment. \nThen, one of them read from Isaiah: \u201cyou are a city full of murderers\u201d ( Isa. 1:21 ). \nThey were right on one point. The city is full of murderers. It\u2019s the city where killing the unborn is public policy supported by confiscated tax dollars. But these so-called religious leaders weren\u2019t there to protest abortion. McDurmon continues: \nPlanned Parenthood is one mile down the road, and the Jim Wallis parade is nowhere to be found. \nHere is a map of places where actual murders are taking place within the same vicinity, every day, multiple times a day: \nThe protestors fail to note that in Isaiah 1 there is an indictment against government fraud, oppression, and theft: \nHow the faithful city has become a harlot, She who was full of justice! Righteousness once lodged in her, But now murderers. Your silver has become dross, Your drink diluted with water.

Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, and many of Hamas' supporters in the West Bank have been arrested.\nEven so, Hamas possesses a large arsenal of rockets in Gaza capable of striking many areas in Israel.\nMeanwhile, clashes between hundreds of Palestinian protesters and Israeli troops erupted across the West Bank on Thursday while demonstrators in Gaza burned posters of President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as Israeli and U.S. flags.\nIn the West Bank, crowds of protesters set tires on fire and hurled stones at anti-riot troops. In the biblical town of Bethlehem, troops fired water cannons and tear gas to disperse a crowd, in clashes that could cloud the upcoming Christmas celebrations in the town of Jesus' birth. Projectiles were hurled through the air as protesters shot rocks with slingshots, CBS News correspondent Seth Doane reports. In Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian government, protesters set tires on fire, sending a thick plume of black smoke over the city.\nIraq's government on Thursday decried the Trump administration's decision, calling it \"unjust\" and urging the United States to revoke it. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi warned in a statement of \"dangerous consequences\" for the region's stability and the world, as hundreds of Iraqis gathered in Baghdad to protest.\nIraq is a key U.S. ally in the region, with more than 5,000 American troops remaining in Iraq, according to Pentagon. With the backing of the U.S.-led coalition, Iraqi forces have retaken nearly all territory held by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) group since 2014.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also voiced his disapproval on Thursday, calling the move a \"unilateral decision.\" He said the status of Jerusalem should be part of an international decision between Israel and the Palestinians.\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson responded to criticism by saying that the President was merely recognizing reality. Tillerson defended Mr. Trump's move on the sidelines of an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe conference in Vienna, where Foreign ministers from the OSCE nations were roundly condemning the decision.\nTillerson said the United States would still support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \"if that's the desire of the two parties.\" He said Jerusalem's final status is still for Israelis and Palestinians to workout, and that \"the whole world\" wants a peace process, and the U.S. still believes there's an opportunity.\nMr. Trump's dramatic break Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. The Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital.\nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, condemned the Trump administration's decision in a rare public rebuke by the U.S. ally.\nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\"\nMr. Trump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Mr. Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who leads Mr. Trump's efforts to restart Mideast peace talks.\nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa warned American citizens of possible protests following Mr. Trump's move, and New York City law enforcement said security would be beefed up around possible targets in New York's diplomatic area, CBS News' Pamela Falk reports.\nNew York Police Department Counter-Terror and Intelligence Deputy Commissioner John Miller on Thursday morning confirmed to CBS News that the NYPD was increasing security around the U.S. Mission, Israeli diplomatic sites, and other relevant missions and residences in New York City.\nAdditional NYPD vans, officers with K9s, and other NYPD officers were visible and more in force than usual on First Avenue, outside the U.S. Mission, office of U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley, opposite the U.N. Headquarters, Falk reports.\nIn recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Mr. Trump was seen as siding with Israel's hard-line government which says it will not give up any part of the city.\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has suggested that the United States disqualified itself as mediator between Israelis and Palestinians, a role it has played exclusively in more than two decades of stop-and-go negotiations on setting up a Palestinian state alongside Israel.\nThe talks, stalled in recent years, have failed to bring the Palestinians closer to the state the seek in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. In parallel, Israel has steadily expanded Jewish settlements on war-won lands, even as it said it wants to negotiate a deal.\nMr. Trump's claim Wednesday that he still wants to pursue what he has called the \"ultimate\" Mideast deal was met by mounting skepticism.\n\"With its decision, the U.S. has isolated itself and Israel, and has pushed the area into a dangerous situation and stopped the peace process,\" said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a senior Abbas aid. \"Without a doubt, this decision will not help at all in solving the problems in the area, but rather strengthen the extremists.\"\nAbbas has not said what steps he would take, if any. Later Thursday, he is to meet with his closest Arab ally, Jordan's King Abdullah II, to coordinate positions.\nJordan plays a central role in the mounting controversy and, alongside other U.S. allies in the region, has slammed Trump's decision on Jerusalem.\nThe king is seen as one of Washington's most dependable partners in the battle against Islamic extremism in the region.\nAt the same time, the legitimacy of his Hashemite dynasty is closely linked to its special role in Jerusalem, as religious guardian of a key Muslim shrine in east Jerusalem. Jordan, which has a large population with Palestinian roots, cannot afford to be seen as soft on Muslim claims to the holy city.\nThe consultations between the monarch and Abbas will kick off a series of meetings in the Arab and Muslim world on how to respond to Trump.\nThe Arab League, a group representing most states in the Middle East and North Africa, will meet Saturday. Next week, Turkey will host a gathering of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation , which has 57 Arab and Muslim member states.\nThe region has been bracing for fallout from Mr. Trump's seismic policy shift.\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday accused Mr. Trump of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" and said his motives were difficult to fathom. \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it, Erdogan said, referring to Mr. Trump in a speech to a group of workers at Ankara's airport.\n\"Political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace,\" Erdogan said. \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\"\nWith his announcement Wednesday, Mr. Trump shattered decades of unwavering U.S. neutrality on Jerusalem.\nDefying dire, worldwide warnings, Mr. Trump insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, starting with what he said was his decision merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. He also said the U.S. would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable.\n\"We cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past,\" Mr. Trump said, brushing aside the appeals for caution from around the world.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "abdullah ii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ismail haniyeh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haniyeh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammad bin salman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nabil abu rdeneh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king salman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "organization of islamic cooperation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arab league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:04.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42daa586cf306b13c5a658db25241337de03f8ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8_DRNYNHvKGwBXjWTOM6I0DqkaNuiAPwRvlXGzkX67IkiqCtgNhyM1", "site_full": "www.55188.com", "site": "55188.com", "site_section": "http://www.55188.com/forum-8-2.html", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "\u0104\u017e\u0161\u00c9\u0118\u0110\u0118\u013e\u0150\u02dd\u0110\u0139\u010e\u02d8\u02dd\u0165\u00c1\u00f7\u00c7\u0159\u0104\u017c -

This has made me reticent to try them on the 5, which has Schallers. The posts are wider on the Schallers but not by much. Anyway I finally decided to give it a shot, so I got the 40-120 set and they came today and I just tried the B string.\nIt didn't break! And it sounds a whole lot better to me with them, and it's making me mad I can't use them on the 4 without breaking the E. The 4 also has a Kahler whammy bridge, so any sort of string extension tricks are out. Sucks. That's the last of my long scale basses to be converted. All they'd have to do is make the E's speaking length an inch shorter, maybe even a half inch.

This has made me reticent to try them on the 5, which has Schallers. The posts are wider on the Schallers but not by much. Anyway I finally decided to give it a shot, so I got the 40-120 set and they came today and I just tried the B string.\nIt didn't break! And it sounds a whole lot better to me with them, and it's making me mad I can't use them on the 4 without breaking the E. The 4 also has a Kahler whammy bridge, so any sort of string extension tricks are out. Sucks. That's the last of my long scale basses to be converted. All they'd have to do is make the E's speaking length an inch shorter, maybe even a half inch. I guess it fits Fenders better this way so I get it, but I can't be the only one who could use a shorter speaking length on their E to keep it from breaking on Sperzels, am I? Click to expand...

This has made me reticent to try them on the 5, which has Schallers. The posts are wider on the Schallers but not by much.

All they'd have to do is make the E's speaking length an inch shorter, maybe even a half inch. I guess it fits Fenders better this way so I get it, but I can't be the only one who could use a shorter speaking length on their E to keep it from breaking on Sperzels, am I? Click to expand...

This is true. We\u2019ve been strong proponents of the elimination of both the criminal and civil statutes of limitation in child sexual abuse cases. \nSenate Republican President Pro Tempore Joseph Scarnati\u2019s bill, however, contains problematic measures and is not the best legislation to provide justice for victims of child sexual abuse. \nPCAR strongly urges the House of Representatives to amend the bill to provide additional reforms to the civil statutes of limitations. \nPCAR has been working with Pennsylvania rape crisis centers, law makers, adult survivors of child sexual abuse and their families for nearly a decade to advocate for the allowance of a one-time window of opportunity (length of time to be determined \u2014 other states have provided 1 or 2 years) for adult survivors to seek damages in the civil courts for harms resulting from child sexual abuse \u2014 even if the statutes of limitations had previously expired. Additionally, we would ideally like to see the civil statutes abolished as well, if not extended well beyond the current limit of age 30. \nTo be clear, PCAR supports the abolition of both the criminal and civil statutes of limitation, and supports amending the current bill to do so, as well as to provide a one-time two-year window of opportunity for those survivors previously blocked from seeking civil damages. \nOur full position on this issue can be reviewed on our website, www.pcar.org , as well as information about the impact of child sexual abuse, how adults can protect children, and the contact information for all 50 rape crisis centers in Pennsylvania. \n\nCEO, Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph scarnati", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pcar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania coalition against rape", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:05.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "111f17230918cb1df2ca045f876a6740027f21ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR4WbPvBJfyDdGuUkELafiDW0PQ6C9iUXzHIf5w55Hjy98R.DKq2tqKcgNYx7.DaY3ehO3YdxKJV5Vrj6p6wYMUsChDC6eCwYvcsjYIRD95PA--", "site_full": "www.talkbass.com", "site": "talkbass.com", "site_section": "https://www.talkbass.com/forums/strings-bg.16/", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health"], "section_title": "Strings [BG] | TalkBass.com", "title": "Time to switch to Dunlop Super Brights!!! | Page 49", "title_full": "Time to switch to Dunlop Super Brights!!! | Page 49 | TalkBass.com", "published": "2017-11-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.049, "main_image": "https://images.talkbass.com/data/avatars/m/151/151377.jpg?1442590921", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31197, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c9a279da6d3006b75e4e615a8a4556a0a18fee2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR4WbPvBJfyDdGuUkELafiDW0PQ6C9iUXzHIf5w55Hjy98R.DKq2tqKcgNYx7.DaY3ehO3YdxKJV5Vrj6p6wYMUsChDC6eCwYt.dwBs41G1Yo4pcczYfxBf", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "JimmyM", "published": "2017-12-06T19:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "mmbongo said: \u2191 You can't have ANY wraps going around the posts with Sperzel tuners.

OCTOBER 6, 2017 BREAKING NEWS!!! VW MANAGER SLAPPED WITH PRISON TIME; SEVEN YEARS! AND HUGE CRIMINAL FINE TODAY! CLICK HERE TO SEARCH BajaRacingNews.com 'CLEAN DIESEL' ; Scott Evans, November 2008: \"Following the wildly successful introduction of the Jetta TDI diesel sedan into the U.S. market, Volkswagen is preparing to follow-up with the Touareg TDI. The Touareg TDI shares its engine with the previously announced Audi Q7 diesel, which we had a chance to drive as part of Audi's \"Mileage Marathon\" event. The Touareg TDI is powered by a 3.0L turbocharged diesel V-6 producing 221 hp. and 406 lb-ft of torque. That mountain of torque is available from 1,750 RPM and hustles the Touareg to 60 mph in 8.5 seconds on its way to an electronically-limited top speed of 130 mph. The all-wheel-drive Touareg boasts strong fuel economy numbers; 17 mpg city and 25 mpg highway, according to Volkswagen. For comparison, we achieved an average of 25.9 mpg in the Audi Q7, though other drivers on the Mileage Marthon returned nearly 30 mpg. Helping the Touareg achieve those numbers is a six-speed automatic transmission. Volkswagen says that the V-6 in the Touareg TDI is the one of the cleanest and most efficient six-cylinder engines in the world. The company boasts that the Touareg has met both BIN5 and ULEV II emissions standards and is 50-state legal. To achieve those certifications, Volkswagen has fitted the Touareg with a multi-stage emissions system. Starting in the combustion chambers, Volkswagen has developed the first in-chamber sensors that monitor pressure conditions in every cylinder to maximize efficiency. Volkswagen has also lowered the combustion chamber temperatures so that fewer raw emissions are created, and those that still are get picked-up in part by an exhaust gas recirculation system. Those that make it past the recirculation system are picked up either by the oxidation catalytic converter, the particulate filter, or the Selective Catalytic Reduction catalytic converter. In the SCR catalytic converter, a urea-based solution called AdBlue is injected into the exhaust flow that turns NOx into Nitrogen and water. Volkswagen claims this system reduces NOx emissions by up to 90%. The AdBlue solution is stored in a 4.2 gallon tank under the spare tire and the Touareg only burns 0.26 gallons of the solution every 1,000 miles, meaning the solution only needs to be replenished after about 16,000 miles. Volkswagen says that the solution is inexpensive and can be added by the dealership or by the owner relatively easily. Also present at Volkswagen's display was its entry into this year's Baja 1000 race, which begins tomorrow. The SCORE truck features 12-cylinder 5.5L TDI diesel engine that produces 550 hp. Volkswagen is hoping to repeat the success the Touareg had at Baja last year. Driving this year's race will be driver Mark Millen and Co-Driver Ryan Arciero.\" SEE THESE RELATED BAJA RACING NEWS.COM STORIES:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "volkswa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark millen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mileage marthon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan arciero", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "volkswagen clean diesel das fail in baja racing news   volkswagen clean diesel das fail in baja racing news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "touareg tdi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "volkswagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "audi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ulev", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baja", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:06.031+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "85a83027b2651148365d869d81f661968be48411", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90J5ryLRQGLz93i16UGrqd4d96yCPEsGa13gjYpVCM4TKsScH1C_rd8mF6wRdQSML2YhzzJ7yIybEW0O7W27JccQq3NKune6RrWB_6YgP8Z3YPb3wFm48NwgHm8XyUjLkxukxXyXrUTN_pEPz5nsyl", "site_full": "www.topix.net", "site": "topix.net", "site_section": "http://www.topix.net/rss/city/santa-barbara-ca.xml", "site_categories": ["entertainment"], "section_title": "Santa Barbara News", "title": "Audio of 1993 Corey Feldman interview found by Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office", "title_full": "Audio of 1993 Corey Feldman interview found by Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office", "published": "2017-12-07T02:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//static.topixcdn.com/ext/t9/topix-og-image-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "85a83027b2651148365d869d81f661968be48411", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90J5ryLRQGLz93i16UGrqd4d96yCPEsGa13gjYpVCM4TKsScH1C_rd8mF6wRdQSML2YhzzJ7yIybEW0O7W27JccQq3NKune6RrWB_6YgP8Z3YPb3wFm48NwgHm8XyUjLkxukxXyXrUTN_pEPz5nsyl", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "Audio of 1993 Corey Feldman interview found by Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office", "text": "Topix \u203a California \u203a Santa Barbara County \u203a Santa Barbara \u203a Audio of 1993 Corey Feldman interview...

In his tweet , the 24-year-old actor wrote that he\u2019s had so much fun playing Jax and Firestorm.\n\nBrandon Routh responded to Drameh\u2019s tweet, telling the British actor that both he and his character are missed. \u201cThank you for bringing such heart to both him, and the show,\u201d tweeted Routh, who plays Ray on the series. \u201cAnd on a personal note, we miss your energy and jokes on set! Thank you friend!\u201d\n\nTala Ashe, who plays Zari on the show, also reacted to Drameh\u2019s exit. The Iranian actress uploaded some behind-the-scenes photos from this week\u2019s midseason finale on Instagram . In the caption, Ashe made sure to tell Drameh that she misses him.\n\nIn Season 3, episode 9 , the Legends rescued a time-displaced younger version of the late Martin Stein (Victor Garber). While Jax tried to warn young Stein of his impending death, Stein realized that his eventual passing comes after living a full life. So instead of trying to change his fate, Stein decidedly burned the warning letter Jax gave him.\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna cheat death, Jefferson,\u201d young Stein told Jax. \u201cNone of us live together. And if I had one wish, it wouldn\u2019t be for me to prolong my life, it would be for you to live yours and to have the happiness you deserve.\u201d\nWhen Drameh returned to the Waverider, he told Sara (Caity Lotz) that he would never be able to move on from Stein\u2019s death if he stays on the ship. So he decided to leave the team and come back to 2017 Central City.\nWhile Jax will no longer be a regular face on the show, Entertainment Weekly reported that the door is open for the character to pop up again in the future.\nJax\u2019s void, however, was almost immediately filled by Constantine (Matt Ryan) who made his debut on the show at the end of the midseason finale. Constantine is set to return for Season 3, episode 10 but it remains to be seen whether the character will eventually become a regular fixture on the show.\nAre you sad about Drameh\u2019s exit from the series?

Where Beyonc\u00e9 shows up and when she decides to speak reveal so much. Last night, Beyonc\u00e9 showed up for Colin Kaepernick . She presented him with Sports Illustrated's Mohammed Ali Legacy award . \nAs you know, Colin Kaepernick \u2013 former star quarterback\u2014 is not currently playing in the NFL. Kaepernick\u2019s peaceful protest of police brutality and racism in America cost him his job. His decision to kneel made him the face of a movement and the target of the hatred and bigotry so engrained in American history, it\u2019s what moved him to kneel in the first place. Through all the noise and false rhetoric that has surrounded Kap\u2019s protest, he has barely spoken. Like Beyonc\u00e9, he\u2019s been very deliberate about his public engagements. He was named GQ\u2019s Citizen of the Year and he let 10 influential people speak for him . When the narrative of his protest, one that started in response to the unarmed black men who are disproportionately shot by police, was twisted into chatter about disrespecting the U.S. flag or American troops, Kaepernick remained silent. He continued to work for his community wordlessly and powerfully by donating his time and money and by bravely taking on the NFL . \nLast night, Beyonc\u00e9, someone who also knows the power of silence and is also a beacon of black excellence who continually uses her platform as a form of protest, chose these words to honour Colin Kaepernick: \n\"Thank you for your selfless heart, and your conviction. Thank you for your personal sacrifice. Colin took action with no fear of consequence or repercussion, only hope to change the world for the better, to change perception, to change the way we treat each other, especially people of color. We\u2019re still waiting for the world to catch up. It\u2019s been said that racism is so American that when we protest racism, some assume we\u2019re protesting America. So let\u2019s be very clear, Colin has always been very respectful of the individuals who selflessly serve and protect our country and our communities and our families. His message is solely focused on social injustice for historically disenfranchised people. Let\u2019s not get that mistaken.\u201d \nPREACH, QUEEN. I just googled Kap and one of the first things that came up was a headline that read Tomi Lahren slams Beyonce, Colin Kaepernick for hating police . No quotations to imply that the hating police part is her dumbass opinion, not fact. Out of context, if you don\u2019t read further or know the details of the situation, you could read this and deduce that Beyonc\u00e9 and Colin Kaepernick did or said something to remotely suggest an anti-police stance. They didn\u2019t. This was not the point. And yet, it has become a part of the narrative. I would want to run through the streets screaming my intent if I was attempting to do something GOOD and it was twisted in this way. I would want to talk all the time. Isn\u2019t it a basic human instinct to want to correct lies being spread about you? Instead, Colin Kaepernick has been patient and, like Beyonce said, SO selfless. He has faced the ultimate repercussions and sacrificed his passion and talent to stand up to a system designed for him to fail. At no point throughout his protest has Colin tried to make the conversation about him or his personal forfeiture. Even when BEYONC\u00c9 presents him with an award, Colin Kaepernick upholds his humility. \n\u201cI accept this award not for myself, but on behalf of the people. Because if it were not for my love of the people, I would not have protested. And if it was not for the support from the people, I would not be on this stage today. With our without the NFL\u2019s platform, I will continue to work for the people because my platform is the people.\u201d 'With or without the NFL\u2019s platform, I will continue to work for the people' @Kaepernick7 receives SI's Muhammad Ali Legacy award #Sportsperson https://t.co/3wqaUVYZnf pic.twitter.com/dKJNX0d8vi \u2014 Sports Illustrated (@SInow) December 6, 2017 \n\nThe new People\u2019s Champ is here.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Giancarlo Stanton sits and waits while Marlins brass, including Derek Jeter, try to figure out the player's future. (Photo by Rob Foldy/Miami Marlins via Getty Images) Derek Jeter\u2019s first major objective as Chief Executive Officer of the Miami Marlins is to move Giancarlo Stanton\u2019s massive contract from the club\u2019s payroll. As unpopular as the goal may be, and despite roadblocks in the way that include a no-trade clause within the slugger\u2019s deal, it remains something that new ownership desperately needs to quickly handle or risk going under water in what could eventually become baseball\u2019s biggest black eye. \nEarlier in the week, in the wake of discovering that Stanton may be sent to the San Francisco Giants or St. Louis Cardinals even though neither team may have been on his \u201cwish list,\u201d many people in South Florida started to wonder whether immediate prior owner of the Marlins, Jeffrey Loria, once described as the worst owner in sports , was better for the City of Miami then than Jeter\u2019s group that currently controls the team. However, it was the prior ownership, constantly ridiculed in Miami and largely despised by the fan base, that put together the irresponsible Stanton contract in the first place. \nMarlins fans should understand that no matter the make-up of group that ended up purchasing the Marlins from Loria, Jeter\u2019s or otherwise, it would likely be looking to get the large liability off the books. It is a deal that guarantees Stanton a total of $295 million on the final ten years of the contract, that is hard for any businessperson to stomach. \nIt would be unfair to chastise Jeter if he executes on a plan that may have not initially been backed by Stanton, but ultimately can be blocked by the superstar if he chooses. If Stanton does decide to get out of the way, which is undoubtedly his prerogative, the shift of Stanton to another Major League Baseball team should not be blamed on Jeter or the rest of the current Marlins organization. \nTo be clear, nothing has yet been concluded. Miami Marlins site reporter for MLB.com Joe Frisaro says it is a two-team race for Stanton and that the Giants and Cardinals are the front-runners, while the Los Angeles Dodgers \"monitor the situation.\" The particulars on a trade package are not finalized, and any trade requires Stanton's consent. \nIf Stanton is traded away from Miami, then Jeter's mission has been accomplished, and that is all that business brass both at the Marlins and the league will care about for the foreseeable future. \nThe questions have and will continue to surface as to whether Jeter is fit for his new office space in Miami. He will also continue to be questioned on how he handles his business and the means he employs to achieve his ends. Firing a scout who needs a kidney transplant while the individual is in a hospital recovering from colon cancer surgery is not a good look, but it is also completely unrelated to the Stanton saga. \nIf you are going to be upset about Stanton\u2019s delivery to San Fransisco, St. Louis or another franchise, then your anger should really be directed at MLB, which approved the Jeter group\u2019s purchase of the Marlins with knowledge that its plans included a restructuring of the club\u2019s roster to make it a more financially appealing holding. This was not the group with the largest capital reserve supporting its bid. It was the sexiest bid, for sure, but it was also one that seemed destined to deliver on a goal that Stanton would be out of Miami in due course. This was MLB\u2019s doing more than any other individual or entity. \nFurthermore, a deal to move Stanton away from Miami does not cripple the Marlins organization in any respect, and perhaps it even is what the franchise needs to start rebuilding a depressed farm system, ranked second-to-last in MLB by ESPN 's Keith Law.

Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, set a new standard in silliness in his recent remarks about the repeal of the estate tax. \n\u201cI think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing,\u201d he told the Des Moines Register. \u201cAs opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it\u2019s on booze or women or movies.\u201d \nThis folksy bit of nonsense contains plenty of fallacies, among them the contentions that the poor are more profligate than the rich, that the rich all use their money to the benefit of the whole economy and the implication that the rich somehow earned what they have by thrift. And as a critic, I think there\u2019s something particularly dopey and insidious about the idea that people without vast fortunes ought to forswear the movies of all things. (I\u2019ll leave dining writers to defend alcohol and dating columnists to make the case for investing in courtship.) \nBefore we get there, let\u2019s be very clear: The poor aren\u2019t the only people who spend a lot of money on their pleasures. Whoever just spent $38.05 million on a New York City penthouse that didn\u2019t even have the walls installed yet wasn\u2019t exactly socking away that money for the future, much less using it to create jobs or give raises to anyone they might employ. People who spend $90 million a pop for \u201cairliners configured as private jets,\u201d a category of sales that saw increases in 2017, cannot make a plausible case that they\u2019re pinching their pennies. (Spare me your lectures about how valuable your time is.) This fall, Town & Country put the price of having it all at $100 million, with \u201call\u201d meaning everything from \u201ca driver who can multitask\u201d to \u201ca trophy collection\u201d of art. \nGiven figures such as these, the most sensible way to teach financial responsibility might be an all-out class war. Redistribute wealth from people who buy Warhols to stroke their egos to people who treat a trip to the movie theater or an evening at the local bar like a carefully-guarded indulgence, and the people at the upper end of the spectrum might learn a thing or two about restraint. \nBut if we\u2019re really going to scrutinize the leisure spending of the people who have not yet amassed estates, there\u2019s something odd about targeting the movies. In 2016, the average price of a movie ticket was $8.65; for a family of four, that means a trip to the movies cost $34.60, which stacks up favorably with a day at a theme park at a cost of $233.40 or tickets to an NFL game, which would cost that family $371.92 on average. Even if that family watches their movies via a streaming service such as Netflix, which runs $10.99 a month, a year\u2019s-worth of movie watching still stacks up economically next to these other indulgences. \nAnd for that comparatively modest price, American moviegoers get more than a few hours of entertainment: they get access to a broader cultural conversation. Huge numbers of everyday references emerge from the movies: If you don\u2019t know what it means to \u201cgo to the mattresses\u201d or what the Force is and what it means for it to be with someone, you\u2019re going to be befuddled by phrases and metaphors that have an established part in the American lexicon. \nThe effect isn\u2019t only American; whether or not you think they\u2019re banal, big franchises such as the Marvel movies provide a common story framework for millions of viewers not just here in the United States, but around the world, where movies are one of our most enthusiastically embraced exports. Big controversies over the movies, like the discussions over the monochromatic nature of the Academy Awards, are proxy battles over who gets to be at the center of our national life, and whether America is actually a meritocracy. \nAsking people to give up the movies (or other pop culture) isn\u2019t merely a matter of preaching a frugality so strict as to be emotionally impossible. It\u2019s asking people who aren\u2019t rich to cut themselves out of the loop that helps to define who we are \u2014 or at least to define the debates over who we are. The Republican tax bill already looks like an attempt to further the financial gap between the wealthiest Americans and the rest of us. Grassley\u2019s bad financial advice is just another way to widen that gulf. \nAlyssa Rosenberg blogs about pop culture for The Washington Post\u2019s Opinions section.

According to a statement from the party, this is because of the provision of the Constitution that deals with new entrants into the party. However, the party said he would be allowed to speak at the convention. While revealing more details, the party spokesperson, Prince Dayo Adeyeye, who spoke with journalists at a press briefing in Abuja on Wednesday, said the party's constitution should be used as a guide on the issue. Adeyeye said, \"All you need to do is pick up the constitution of the party and see whether Atiku is qualified to vote or not.\" When pressed further, he said, \"First of all, I can tell you that we are happy with Atiku coming back to the PDP. It is very exciting for all of us. It is a good omen to everybody in the PDP. \n\"He was one of the founding fathers, one of those who built this party and he is coming back home. His room was never occupied, so we have opened it for him. \n\"He will be part of this convention. He will even make a speech at the convention, but he may not be voting at the convention.\" Chapter 2 (Part 1) of the party's constitution deals with admission of members into the party. On procedure for rejoining, sections 8 and 9 explain, \" A person who desires to rejoin the party after leaving it shall - (a) apply to his Ward Secretary for re-admission; and \n(b) unless given waiver by the National Working Committee, be placed on probation for a period of not less than one year. \n(9) Subject to the provision of Section 8(b), a member on probation shall have the right to attend all meetings of the party, but shall not be entitled to vote at such meetings, nor shall he be eligible to contest for elective office on the platform of the party. \" Atiku, who was a foundation member of the party, defected to the All Progressives Congress in 2014, and vowed that the new party would be his \"last bus stop.\" He rejoined the PDP from the APC last Sunday.

The lead plaintiff is a 7-year-old second-grader who can\u0092t spell words like \u0093need\u0094 and \u0093help,\u0094 lawyers said. \nThey said students in one charter school class couldn\u0092t read their social studies lesson and had to listen to an audio version. Some Stockton students \u0093start crying when asked to read out loud in class,\u0094 the lawsuit said. And one student said his brother didn\u0092t learn to read until he was held in juvenile hall at age 16. \nStatewide, the picture is equally grim, the suit said: Among the nation\u0092s largest school districts, California has 11 of the 26 lowest-performing districts in literacy and basic education. \n\u0093California is dragging down the nation,\u0094 said attorney Mark Rosenbaum of the nonprofit Public Counsel, which filed the suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court along with the San Francisco law firm of Morrison & Foerster. \nIn response, the state Department of Education, a defendant in the suit, said California \u0093has one of the most ambitious programs in the nation to serve low-income students.\u0094 \nThe state spends more than $10 billion a year on programs for English learners, students from low-income families and foster youths, said the department, headed by Superintendent Tom Torlakson. It said it will provide further support next year to 228 school districts, including those of the three schools in the suit. (Excerpt) Read more at sfgate.com ...

budget. \nThe governor will also be permanently disqualified from public office and forfeit all his retirement benefits. \nMorales also ordered charges for violating the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act filed against Degamo, who is currently serving a 90-day preventive suspension for a different case, the allegedly irregular use of Negros Oriental\u2019s P460-million calamity fund. \nThe suspension order was served October 18 and the vice governor, Edward Mark Macias, has been acting governor since then. \nThe Department of Interior and Local Government has been directed to implement Degamo\u2019s dismissal. InterAksyon \nDegamo\u2019s dismissal stems from an order he issued on April 15, 2013 ordering the release of the province\u2019s P10-million intelligence fund \u201cwithout further delay.\u201d The next day, the funds were released to Degamo as a cash advance. \nThe provincial board had earlier disapproved of the intelligence fund\u2019s inclusion in the proposed 2013 budget Degamo had submitted to the body in October 2012. However, the board did not override the governor\u2019s veto of the non-inclusion of the intelligence fund. \nHowever, the Commission on Audit later said that \u201cthe \u201ccash advance was made in the absence of an approved appropriation ordinance in violation of Section 305(a) of the Local Government Code and Section 4(1) of the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines.\u201d \nThe Ombudsman also ruled that \u201cas appropriation ordinance no. 1, series of 2013, does not contain any item on confidential/intelligence fund, the release of the cash advance in the amount of P10 million was not supported by the necessary appropriation\u201d in violation of both the Local Government Code and the Government Auditing Code that \u201cprovide that no money shall be paid out of the local treasury except in pursuance of an appropriations ordinance or law.\u201d \nMorales said Degamo\u2019s insistence on the release of the money \u201cdespite the apparent absence of the necessary appropriation is thus a clear badge of willful intent to violate the laws and established rules.\u201d \nOn June 17, Degamo had also been served a dismissal order for the misuse of the calamity fund but managed to secure a temporary restraining order. The Court of Appeals had, however, dismissed an administrative case against the governor over the same issue. \nThe money was intended for the rehabilitation of infrastructure damaged by typhoon Sendong in December 2011 and the 6.9-magnitude earthquake in February 2012. \nThe Department of Budget and Management withdrew the Special Allotment and Release Order for the funds because of local officials\u2019 failure to comply with the guidelines for infrastructure projects. \nDespite this, Degamo and other officials proceeded to implement he projects, for which the COA issues 11 notices of disallowance.

Hewitt \nPosted on 12/07/2017 1:52:54 AM PST by Oshkalaboomboom \nA year after the election and the Democrats, the media, establishment Republicans are still apoplectic over the inauguration of President Donald Trump. \nIt\u0092s obvious they hate him. When did the media stop looking at Donald Trump as an entertainment figure and begin to loathe him? True, bat-guano, off-the-charts loathing. The answer, of course, is when Donald Trump challenged President Obama to produce a birth certificate. \nEven today, few things get a liberal Democrat or the media more riled up than questioning President Obama\u0092s qualifications to be president. It\u0092s almost (but not quite) the same level of hate and disgust as they reserve for climate deniers whom they want to strip their citizenship, stuff in a boxcar, and shuffle them to a gulag. Conservatives and Republicans have learned to just \u0093not go there.\u0094 No good could ever come from even a rational discussion. \nIsn\u0092t the liberal hysteria a case of: They doth protest too much, methinks. What is the source of their hatred that they would do something like hiring a third party to generate a phony document in order to get back at and unseat the president? \nOutside the myth-making and propaganda-making apparatus that is the media, President Obama\u0092s story has rarely been told\u0097without spin. Why is there even a question\u0097isn\u0092t it \u0093settled science\u0094 since a birth certificate was produced? Wasn\u0092t it all about the birth certificate? No. \nBorn in America (Hawaii) of a foreign father (a British subject before Kenya gained their independence) and an American mother, any lawyer in the (now defunct) Immigration & Naturalization Service would have said of the infant, \u0093Per the U.S. Constitution, Little Barack is an American citizen.\u0094 Also, per the father\u0092s country\u0092s constitution, Little Barack is also a British subject or Kenyan citizen\u0097pick one. That is how constitutions and laws work. (Excerpt) Read more at americanthinker.com ...

What I would be more interested in seeing is his college application to see if he tried to claim he was foreign-born in order to get an edge over other applicants. I don\u2019t see how someone with such an undistinguished academic record could get into an Ivy League school unless he met some kind of affirmative action quota, and just being black wouldn\u2019t cut it. 3 posted on 12/07/2017 2:13:02 AM PST by Oshkalaboomboom [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies ] To: x1stcav \nThey would probably have to fight their way through a legion of Hawaii\u2019s national guard to get to Obama\u2019s forged birth certificate. 4 posted on 12/07/2017 2:16:28 AM PST by Pontiac (The welfare state must fail because it is contrary to human nature and diminishes the human spirit.L) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies ] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Every match between the two arch-rivals sees the fans on either side engaged in trolling battles on social media and the result of the match adds even more spice to the exchanges, with the winners having a field day as the losing side faces the music. However, some moments have made these exchanges immortal as rivals as star players like Team India captain Virat Kohli has made overtures towards some Pakistan players which have become extremely popular on both sides of the border. \nThe International Cricket Council has chosen one such event as the one of the best moments of the 2017 in its 'Spirit of Cricket' campaign. It is a video, on ICC's official Twitter handle, shows Indian and Pakistani players sharing a laugh after the ICC Champions Trophy final in England on June 18, 2017.
