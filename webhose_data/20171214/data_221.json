Accordingly, the study recommended a number of options for renovating and/or replacing one or more of our arenas. \nThe MURF committee officially disbanded after its report was tabled. Unlike the committee, the report was not shelved. Developments and events over the ensuing four years show an indirect but clear reference to the influence of the study. \nWhile the MURF had nothing to do with the arrival of the Battalion, the upgrades to Memorial Gardens to accommodate an OHL franchise included many improvements recommended in the study. \nThe engineering inspection that prompted the removal/renovation of West Ferris arena highlighted similar deficiencies identified in the study. \nThe study\u2019s description of various partnership models had at least some influence on Canadore and the city initiating talks to partner on a multi-use recreational facility. \nFinally, with a breakdown in the talks and facing the imminent demise of the West Ferris arena, the city, in late 2016, announced it would begin the process of replacing West Ferris \u201cwith specific reference to confirming the needs identified in the\u2026MURF study.\u201d \nCouncil has established a subcommittee to investigate and make recommendations to the full council regarding the number of ice pads, site selection, and funding options. The subcommittee acknowledged the relevance of the MURF study as a resource in its investigations. \nThe subcommittee\u2019s mandate was to investigate municipal-owned sites: West Ferris arena, Memorial Gardens and Omischl Sports Complex. \nHowever, to give other plans a fair hearing, the subcommittee agreed to hear alternate site proposals from Nipissing University, the Near North Board, the Pinewood Park area, and a Nipissing and /or Canadore plan on College drive. \nThe subcommittee has referred these proposals to the full council to request a RFP from each proposal for further consideration. \nMeanwhile, deficiencies unearthed at the West Ferris site-foundation, electrical, ice plant, accessibility, rink size, and HVAC system- were considered too intensive for either an upgrade or a dual pad replacement. Geotechnical engineering studies on the subsurface at both the Gardens and Omischl indicated both sites were suitable for further examination. \nThe MURF was pretty clear in its support for the Gardens site. Citing considerable public support from its surveys and consultations, the MURF viewed the Gardens site as \u201cexcellent\u201d and presenting an opportunity to expand the community\u2019s recreation infrastructure. \nI can see other advantages of the Gardens site: \n\u2022 Based on the heavy investment already made in the Gardens to improve functionality, comfort and ability to host sporting events, why not build on its viability? It\u2019s our city\u2019s highest profile sports venue, full of nostalgic memories of North Bay\u2019s ice history. We could take pride in inviting teams and visitors to a first-class multi-use facility. \n\u2022 The Gardens location gives maximum accessibility to residents and visitors alike. Located in the city\u2019s core, the site is close to downtown, a shopping centre and a thoroughfare highway. It offers reasonable proximity to residential areas. It could become a highly visible community focal point. \n\u2022 Pairing a multi-use facility with the Gardens would result in operational efficiencies and economies of scale; bookings, scheduling, cleaning, budgeting, allotting dressing rooms, ice making, non-ice activities, and general administration could all be better co-ordinated. \n\u2022 Operational savings will be further maximized by linking up a new dual pad with the electrical micro grid presently under construction at Thomson Park. Connecting the grid to the YMCA, Gardens and to the new pads is projected to save approximately $200,000 annually. With the additional benefit of offering residents refuge in the Gardens and YMCA during a prolonged blackout, wouldn\u2019t the dual pad provide shelter to additional residents? \nThe above points: location, operational savings, the appeal of the upgraded Gardens connected to a multi-pad arena enhance the opportunity for additional sport tourism revenue. The co-ordinated arena could better accommodate larger tournaments, bid for provincial and national events \u2013 Royal Bank Cup, Telus Cup, Esso Cup - and host non-ice entertainment and competitions. \nThere are concerns surrounding the Gardens site. Among them the loss of Rollie Fischer and Johnson fields, negotiating with the Battalion and parking. \nThere are alternate sites for slo-pitch and the Bulldogs such as Near North property and/or other municipal sites. An access road onto Fisher may have to be costed. But my arguments are that the Gardens should be the first option, not the only option. If the issues with it become prohibitive then we go to option two. But the Gardens site deserves detailed consideration first. This will probably be our facility for the next 50 years. Let\u2019s get it right. \nMike Finner \nNorth Bay What\u2019s on your mind? \nGot something on your mind? Care to share it with our readers?

What was once the exclusive domain of hippies and New Agers has become mainstream, as millions of Americans now get acupuncture treatments or practice yoga as a way to heal and prevent illness.  One Eastern discipline gaining attention among some health professionals is a mind-body practice with roots in ancient Chinese culture. The practice is called  Falun Gong . \nFalun Gong practitioners meditate at Union Square in New York. (Benjamin Chasteen/Epoch Times) \nIn a new book, \u201c The Mindful Practice of Falun Gong: Meditation for Health, Wellness, and Beyond,\u201d  author, researcher, and counselor Margaret Trey discusses what research has to say about  Falun Gong \u2019s healing potential, and explores her own experience using the practice in  counseling . \nA new book by Dr. Margaret Trey looks at what science has to say about the health effects of Falun Gong. \nMeditation as Therapy Since the 1970s, psychotherapists have used Buddhist teachings as a way to help patients manage stress and alleviate physical and emotional pain. Trey noticed that Falun Gong could have similar benefits. \u201cI have had a lot of success integrating Falun Gong with my  counseling ,\u201d Trey said. \u201cDuring these sessions, it actually helps them to clear whatever their issue is. At the end of it, they feel a lot better.\u201d For many generations, Falun Gong was a secret practice passed from master to student before being introduced to the Chinese public in 1992, according to introductory materials to the practice. It was never intended to be used as therapy. Like Buddhism and Taoism, Falun Gong primarily serves as a path to enlightenment, adherents say. Thus, practitioners spend time sitting in meditation; practicing slow, gentle exercises; and striving to meet a high moral standard in their everyday lives. However, since Falun Gong directly addresses issues such as clearing the cluttered mind and overcoming the human inevitability of suffering, Trey finds that applying Falun Gong concepts in counseling can offer valuable guidance to lost or wounded souls seeking clarity and understanding. \u201cA lot of my cases are anxiety disorders. Getting them to do Falun Gong exercises in the counseling session actually helped them to calm down. I don\u2019t know how it happens. I just know that it helps them,\u201d she said. One example Trey mentions in her book is a client named April (a pseudonym). April was plagued by anxiety, but she found that Falun Gong could immediately quiet her busy mind. \u201cI feel more relaxed, less anxious, and [have] less stuff buzzing in my head,\u201d April said in an interview with Trey. According to Trey, April was able to defeat \u201cher inner demons one by one through counseling integrated with Falun Gong.\u201d As a result, her confidence and self esteem grew, allowing her to overcome painful memories from her childhood. \nResearcher, counselor, and author Dr. Margaret Trey integrates elements of Falun Gong into her counseling. (Daniel Ulrich) \nApril\u2019s therapy tapered off 15 years ago, but she still continues to practice. \u201cFalun Gong is never far from my mind,\u201d she wrote in a recent letter to Trey. Unlike April, most of Trey\u2019s clients don\u2019t go on to adopt Falun Gong practice. However, Trey says that integrating some elements of Falun Gong during appropriate times in a counseling session has helped many make breakthroughs and reach insights that were previously elusive. Another of Trey\u2019s clients, Oskar (not his real name), presented a lot of problems that typical counseling techniques couldn\u2019t touch. Oskar was an adult in his 30s but had the mental age of an adolescent and a history of aggressive, even violent behavior. \u201cI would explain the principles of Falun Gong to him in very simple terms,\u201d Trey said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if it would help him, but somehow they stuck in his mind.\u201d\u2018 As his treatment progressed, Oskar told Trey about an argument he had had with his girlfriend. During the altercation, his girlfriend threatened to leave him, so he grabbed a kitchen knife to stop her. But as he recalled something he learned from Falun Gong, Oskar reconsidered his action. \u201cI remember you said that I must show compassion and consider the other person first, so I did,\u201d Oskar told Trey. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t hurt her. I put the knife down instead. I showed compassion, but she still left me.\u201d Falun Gong isn\u2019t a treatment strategy like cognitive behavioral therapy\u2014and it is not appropriate in severe mental illness\u2014but it can be used in the clinic alongside more conventional techniques, Trey says. According to Trey, Falun Gong makes a complement to Rogerian-style counseling. \u201cRogerian philosophy is a counseling approach with three principles: empathy, unconditional positive regard for the client, and congruence during practice. I immediately saw how the three principles of the Rogerian technique correlate with the three principles of Falun Gong: truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance,\u201d she said. Mind and Body While Trey\u2019s experience finds that Falun Gong may be good for mental health, evidence shows that it may also be beneficial to physical health as well. \u201cIn my studies of neuroscience, I\u2019ve seen that the mind is very powerful,\u201d Trey said. \u201cIf you can change your mind, you are on the road to health and wellness. The power of the mind is very important.\u201d To examine the healing potential of Falun Gong, in 2007 Trey conducted a pioneering study known as the Australian survey. The survey was developed as part of her doctoral dissertation at the University of South Australia. It compares the health and wellness effects of Falun Gong as perceived by practitioners measured against a control group of non-practitioner participants. The results strongly suggest that practicing Falun Gong has a positive effect on both physical and emotional health. In designing her study, Trey looked to researchers who had considered health effects with other spiritual disciplines. One such influence is Dr. Harold G. Koenig, director of the Center for Spirituality, Theology and Health at Duke University. The prolific Koenig has published over 400 scientific, peer-reviewed publications and 40 books on various medical subjects, but he\u2019s best known for his insights on religion. Koenig\u2019s controlled trials show that practicing religion and spirituality actually helps people improve their health and well-being. \u201cKoenig is a Christian, so all his research shows the health and wellness impacts of practicing the Christian faith,\u201d Trey said. \u201cI cited his work to give a rationale for my own research.\u201d The Australian survey reveals that Falun Gong practitioners rarely take medication or see a doctor, yet this group scored much higher than the non-practitioner control group in every health metric. \u201cBefore they started practicing, the Falun Gong group had a lot more health and medical problems than the non-Falun Gong group. After practice, they reported significant improvement in their condition,\u201d Trey said. According to Dr. Heather Mattner, a health psychologist and adjunct professor at the University of South Australia who served as an advisor to Trey, the Australian survey demonstrates the powers of stillness, peace, and awareness for those who practice Falun Gong. \u201c[Trey\u2019s] study indicates that Falun Gong brings important benefits for many individuals suffering illnesses, compromised mental health, and chronicity, in safe, sound, and satisfying ways that defy medication and typical curative processes,\u201d Mattner wrote in a forward to Trey\u2019s book. According to Dr. John Court, a retired professor from the University of South Australia who served as program director to Trey when she was designing the Australian survey, Falun Gong demonstrates the same underlying values found in all spiritual traditions. \nA person studies the central text of Falun Gong, \u201cZhuan Falun,\u201d which outlines its moral philosophy and principles. (Minghui.org) \u201cWe should not be too surprised that strong benefits are reported, since the processes involved in practice are similar in many ways to other transpersonal and behavioral approaches, and strengthened by some careful advantages (regular practice, variety of strategies, emphasis on personal empowerment and moral improvement,)\u201d Court wrote in a forward to Trey\u2019s book. \nAlthough Falun Gong research is still in the preliminary stages, the studies available thus far present a similar picture to Trey\u2019s survey. For example, in a 2005, peer-reviewed study of Falun Gong, published in the online journal of the American Counseling Association, a team of U.S. medical doctors found superior gene expression and improved immunity among Falun Gong respondents compared to non-Falun Gong respondents, indicating that Falun Gong could influence gene expression, enhance immunity, balance metabolic rate, and promote cell regeneration. In the most recent  study  on the practice, published as an abstract for the American Society of Clinical Oncology\u2019s annual meeting in 2016, 97 percent of cancer patients reported complete symptom recovery after practicing Falun Gong. The average time for symptom recovery was 3.6 months after starting the practice.  Changing Perceptions Earlier this year, Trey was invited to do a 90 minute presentation on her approach to using Falun Gong in counseling and psychotherapy for the American Counseling Association\u2014the biggest counseling organization in the world. She says the support she received from colleagues has been tremendous. \u201cIn the counseling profession, it is very widely accepted now that Eastern meditative practices are beneficial. Spirituality and counseling is a big thing at the moment,\u201d Trey said. \u201cI have had so many counseling students, both masters and doctoral, and even professors tell me that it was great that I was doing a study of this.\u201d Trey is continuing her research of Falun Gong with a new project she calls \u201cHearts Uplifted,\u201d which looks at case studies of individual Falun Gong practitioners and their miraculous experiences with healing and perseverance. In the future, she hopes to see Falun Gong put to the test in randomized controlled trials, similar to evaluations of yoga. \u201cThey have studied yoga for cancer, sleeping disorders, anxiety, stress reduction, all different kinds of problems, but we have a long way to go, Trey said. \u201cStudies on the health and wellness effects of Falun Gong are still in their infancy. I hope that people will contact me with interest in doing further research.\u201d Trey\u2019s work also has an unintentional political edge. While China conducted its own surveys demonstrating remarkable health and wellness effects of Falun Gong in the late 1990s, the reputation of the practice suffered a devastating blow in 1999, when then Chinese dictator Jiang Zemin waged a brutal campaign against Falun Gong in an effort to eradicate it from the country. To justify the torture and imprisonment of Falun Gong practitioners, the discipline was labeled a cult, and the regime spent years disseminating anti-Falun Gong propaganda designed to demonize the practice. Though these ideas were discredited years ago, Trey expects that one likely outcome of her research is that a more complete picture of the Falun Gong phenomenon will emerge. \u201cFalun Gong is beneficial for overall health and wellness improvement, as the findings from the Australian survey have indicated, and it is good as a lifestyle and spiritual cultivation,\u201d Trey said. \u201cAlso, as a counselor I find that sharing this with clients brings them something they can appreciate and take away.\u201d Source:  https://www.theepochtimes.com/western-counseling-gets-a-boost-from-eastern-wisdom_2097261.html \nWATCH  Health Recovery Miracle from Cancer (With English Subtitles) ( https://youtu.be/xYU-CGx6qx4 ) \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "conan milner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harold g. koenig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "falun gong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oskar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heather mattner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mattner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jiang zemin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margaret trey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koenig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel ulrich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "non-falun gong", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "falun gong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epoch times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for spirituality, theology and health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duke university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american society of clinical oncology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new agers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anti-falun gong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buddhist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhuan falun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of south australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin chasteen/epoch times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "non-falun gong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american counseling association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taoism", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "falun gong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "union square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:38.114+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b1f0332aa547bcbbe62db54c3b1ece67676ed8f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpMfouZbcTsqM3wju51VzJFa_stwQIk8q9fSpMG7LQ82YX6I8hWfYlV2FtYg1b_u7qbr1c22Pmdvw51EsM98f2yfPaBVuDbws-", "site_full": "onehallyu.com", "site": "onehallyu.com", "site_section": "https://onehallyu.com/forum/14-love-relationships/", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Love &amp; Relationships - OneHallyu", "title": "Are you on good or bad terms with your ex(es)?", "title_full": "Are you on good or bad terms with your ex(es)? - Love & Relationships - OneHallyu", "published": "2017-12-02T21:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://onehallyu.com//public/style_images/master/meta_image.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15761, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "866a61ab133a9d1c5ebd6b222eedcc96c021cffc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpMfouZbcTsqM3wju51VzJFa_stwQIk8q9fSpMG7LQ82YX6I8hWfYlV2FtYg1b_u7qbr1c22Pmdvw51EsM98f2fT.MTPx6pqfY25E9Iy_JPA--", "ord_in_thread": 15, "author": "Cakeyness123", "published": "2017-12-03T20:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I\u2019ve never dated lol.

Project collaborators include individuals from the Roslin Institute, the University of Aberdeen, Benchmark's SalmoBreed, the Institute of Marine Research (Norway), INRA (France), Marine Science Scotland (Aberdeen) and Cefas (UK). \nThe aim of the study is to identify genes involved in the infection of Atlantic salmon by ISA and make alterations to increase resistance. This could then be applied to produce ISA resistant broodstock for farming. \nGene editing is a new technology which uses enzyme systems such as CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN amongst others to make precise, targeted alterations to the DNA sequence. In contrast with previous technologies it does not rely on introduction of genes from other species. \nISA causes high mortality and significant monetary losses in affected salmon farms worldwide, and is a major welfare issue. There are no treatments for ISA and, in the event of an outbreak, producers are forced to cull all affected stock. Existing solutions such as vaccination and biosecurity cannot fully prevent the spread of the disease. Gene editing can provide an additional way to combat ISA. \nThis study is the first of a number of initiatives being undertaken by Benchmark in this field. Gene editing represents a significant long-term opportunity, and learnings from this study will be applied to other disease areas and species including shrimp and tilapia. \nMalcolm Pye, Benchmark CEO, commented: \n'Gene editing is a potentially powerful tool to combat disease in aquaculture and, with a team of world class geneticists, Benchmark is at the forefront of this research in line with our strategy of developing world class aquaculture health products. This is a very exciting time for gene editing with major breakthroughs in human health resulting from decades of research which augur well for animal health. We are delighted to be collaborating with leading institutions to use this novel technology to improve the health and welfare of farmed fish.'\n\nBenchmark Holdings plc published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:01:02 UTC . \nOriginal document http://www.benchmarkplc.com/articles/benchmark-participates-in-gene-editing-research-to-develop-disease-resistance-in-salmon/ \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/FF06E4EA1689808103CB7BED3B136C0108977E26", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "malcolm pye", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute of marine research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benchmark holdings plc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roslin institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "biological sciences research council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "norway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:39.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ccaadf77a5a1c3c0037ed6d2622d80af7ced2653", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTQZLYK2UXAhaFdzlgGy2EgL6Zh58AXk9lVn1l6mKdSFnhvZo8WXjRdnKSKT7OM6tvD.8ZYHldAiOk3A6vkPTvxYusWLlMh6J_piqfDDl4ncA--", "site_full": "fortcollins.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://fortcollins.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist fort collins | personals search", "title": "looking for a hung discrete man tonight -

The Photographs of Charles Duvelle: Disques Ocora and Collection Prophet (2017) World | 2:01:04 | WEB FLAC (tracks) | 624 MB Label: Sublime Frequencies The Photographs of Charles Duvelle: Disques Ocora and Collection Prophet focuses on composer and musicologist Charles Duvelle's pioneering field recordings, as well as his now-iconic photographs and graphic design. The material focuses on the five regions surveyed during his time with Ocora: West Africa, Central Africa, Indian Ocean, Pacific Islands, and SouthEast Asia.\"Disques Ocora, a French label dedicated to capturing and publishing the sounds of folkloric culture from around the world, is held in the highest possible regard in the realms of professional and amateur ethnomusicology. Instigated in 1958 by Pierre Schaeffer, the founder of musique concr\u00e8te, Disques Ocora's sterling reputation is largely built on composer and musicologist Charles Duvelle's pioneering field recordings, as well as his now-iconic photographs and graphic design. Charles Duvelle's work is indisputably one of the most important contributions to the human understanding of the rich biodiversity of our planet's music and language. In 1977, his field recordings from Benin were selected by Carl Sagan for inclusion on the Voyager Golden Records, which were carried into outer space by the Voyager spacecraft to stand as an example of humanity's highest musical expressions for the universe's unknown listeners. Sublime Frequencies' most ambitious project to date, this 296-page fine-art photography book comprises an exhaustive collection of Charles Duvelle's field photography from 1959 to 1978 (188 black-and-white and 58 color photographs), demonstrating that this master musicologist had an equally unerring eye for photography; Includes a photo index listing the details of each photograph. It also contains an exhaustive interview with Charles Duvelle by Hisham Mayet, detailing the history of the label and offering Duvelle's unique insights into the discipline of field recording (French and English facing text).The package includes two full-length CDs of archival recordings (some of which have never been published) selected, compiled, and fully annotated by Duvelle himself. Most of the tracks on CD one (Africa) are complete versions of truncated tracks from OOP Ocora LPs. CD two, which includes performances by Sohan Lal, Kheo Oudon, and Madurai Ramaswami Gautam, is focused on material from Asia (music from India and Laos), with two long tracks that have never been released (a third track is a complete unedited version). The material focuses on the five regions surveyed during his time with Ocora: West Africa, Central Africa, Indian Ocean, Pacific Islands, and SouthEast Asia.\"Tracklist:01.

A careless talker destroys himself.\u201d\nJames 3:7-12 (AMPC) says; \u201cFor every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea animal, can be tamed and has been tamed by human genius (nature). 8 But the human tongue can be tamed by no man. It is a restless (undisciplined, irreconcilable) evil, full of deadly poison. 9 With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse men who were made in God\u2019s likeness! 10 Out of the same mouth come forth blessing and cursing. These things, my brethren, ought not to be so. 11 Does a fountain send forth [simultaneously] from the same opening fresh water and bitter? 12 Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a grapevine figs? Neither can a salt spring furnish fresh water.\u201d\nMark 11:22-24 (AMPC) says; \u201cAnd Jesus, replying, said to them, Have faith in God [constantly]. 23 Truly I tell you, whoever says to this mountain, Be lifted up and thrown into the sea! and does not doubt at all in his heart but believes that what he says will take place, it will be done for him. 24 For this reason I am telling you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe (trust and be confident) that it is granted to you, and you will [get it].\nThe tongue can be a great weapon, a great source of blessings, but also a great source of heartache and pain. We, as the children of God, need to be so very careful what we say to those around us. Have you ever seen this unfold in a store or somewhere around you? A child is happy, having a great time and begins asking the parent for something and, suddenly, as you observe, from a distance, it\u2019s as though hot water has been poured over the child and he/she wilts before your eyes.\nWe\u2019ve all experienced this, haven\u2019t we? What about the fact you are excited about something that has just occurred and you tell your friend, spouse, coworker, or anyone, the good news, and they aren\u2019t nearly as excited as yourself. They may even say something derogatory about the news you are so excited about and you, personally, feel let down, again, wilted and dejected. You were happy and now you are just so so or even thrown into a tailspin and disappointed.\nOne more scenario, and this has happened to me, many times, concerning the Word. There is a bad storm coming and it threatens to mess up all that\u2019s yours even destroying said stuff. This can be a literal storm or a storm in the spirit that threatens your very existence. The Lord gives you a Word, from THE WORD and you begin quoting the Word, out loud, \u201cshouting at the enemy\u201d so to speak. As you continue to declare the Word, speaking for the removal or change in direction of whatever storm is bearing down, you see it change directions and miss you.\nIn the physical, I\u2019ve seen this with so very many thunderstorms, hail storms, and the like, several times within my life. A storm is coming and I begin to speak to the mountain, as in Mark 11:23, and the storm changes direction, going north of my location, south, or whatever, it goes somewhere else.\nWhat\u2019s happened? The Word, that\u2019s what!!!! In all three scenarios, above, saying something, using the tongue has brought about change, two of them negative and one positive. My Dad used to tell me about the reason we have two ears and one tongue. He would say we need to listen twice as much as we speak, this will keep us out of trouble, more often than not. In the above negative scenarios, if the person we observe in the story, would think about what they say or never attempt to hurt the child or even ourselves, the spirits would not be wilted an dejected.\nI just read a quote from Marcus Garvey a black activist in the early twentieth century. He said; \u201cThe pen is mightier than the sword, but the tongue is mightier than both put together.\u201d Wow!!! My encouragement to you, today is twofold. First of all, be careful what you say, you can hurt those you love with one word that will last forever, even causing so very many problems down the road. Secondly, if you need your situation to change, speak to the mountain!!!!\nHebrews 4:12 tells us; \u201d For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.:\nI can assure you, the Word will work in bad situations, it has for me and countless others, so very many times, and will always work. The Word of God is the greatest weapon we have Use it.\nLove in Jesus,\nDavid", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus garvey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ampc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:39.042+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f81ba1dc3bbc115a107ced55a76e9c5e607907b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTyxEUjCKvctwplvESCK43LAJLdNH3FvDKSTbLgNJaz130wRLW495hSi.0JJLoUJsPkM_AACI2eVj_qs.zbSx6qloUpJucXxvBrjIZhx3c5cgBWfP5VRt5D.2ai967Su0IlEGCfHwfTPA--", "site_full": "ddcc.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://ddcc.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Aggregate Digitally Projected Images (DPI) Competition:  6th December 2017. \u2013 Deal and District Camera Club", "title": "Aggregate Digitally Projected Images (DPI) Competition: 6th December 2017.", "title_full": "Aggregate Digitally Projected Images (DPI) Competition: 6th December 2017.", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f81ba1dc3bbc115a107ced55a76e9c5e607907b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTyxEUjCKvctwplvESCK43LAJLdNH3FvDKSTbLgNJaz130wRLW495hSi.0JJLoUJsPkM_AACI2eVj_qs.zbSx6qloUpJucXxvBrjIZhx3c5cgBWfP5VRt5D.2ai967Su0IlEGCfHwfTPA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ddccpubsec", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "Aggregate Digitally Projected Images (DPI) Competition: 6th December 2017.", "text": "On Wednesday 6th December 2017, the club held its second DPI competition of the season.

Pitcher plants are carnivorous, drawing nutrients from trapped and digested insects. The species shown here (Nepenthes bicalcarata) secretes sweet nectar on the rim and fang-like structures, which are very slippery for most insects except for one specialised ant (Camponotus schmitzii). The ants live in the curled hollow tendrils of the plant and manage to climb in and out of the pitcher without any difficulties to steal a bit of nectar, as shown here.

includes $950,00 borrowed by North Bay Hydro and transferred to the city \n 51:37 EST AM North Bay council chambers (File Photo)   \nReport an error \nTo the editor: \nThe good news from city hall regarding the lowest tax budget increase in years is evidence of the truth of the saying that \u201cthe devil is in the details.\u201d \nThe city is including in 2018 revenues $950,000 in funds borrowed by North Bay Hydro and transferred to the city under the Mayor\u2019s Plan. This means taxpayers will not only pay the $950,000 but an additional $396,000 in interest and taxes through their hydro bills during the next 20 years. \nThe entire plan will cost taxpayers, in addition to the principal repayments, approximately $1 million per year for the next 20 years. Rather than admit they are costing taxpayers millions of dollars by moving forward with this plan, the mayor and some council members are choosing to avoid public embarrassment and save face by refusing to discuss this in a public forum. \nThe North Bay Taxpayers\u2019 Association has asked for a public discussion on many occasions only to be told that the mayor does not debate with persons or groups. \nThe city has been suggesting that new assessment growth decreases the tax levy. This is an error by staff and multiple confirmations of this fact made been ignored by council. \nThe budget includes an amount for wages for a communications officer which amounts to more than $125,000. This estimate is in spite of the fact that the position is not presently occupied, has not been filled and the attempt to fill this gratuitous position has been suspended. \nWages and benefits account for 45 per cent of the city\u2019s total budget. Any realistic attempt to lower the tax levy must include a reduction in the amounts taxpayers are asked to pay for services. Services which are not increasing and are not improving to any noticeable degree. \nThe city has the equivalent of 410 full-time employees not including those employed by the ABCs. The ABCs include, among others, the police department, Library and DNSSAB. These 410 employees each earn an average of $91,690 in wages and benefits. \nFire department employees who receive an average $154,608 in wages and benefits per person are the biggest reason for this state of affairs. However, even removing them and council members\u2019 remuneration from the equation means the average is still $77,973 per employee. The average wage in Canada for 2016 was just under $50,000. \nWe believe the compensation being paid is far beyond the market value of the services we receive from the city. The hard-pressed taxpayers of North Bay can no longer afford to support this level of compensation for public employees. Taxpayers need council to fulfil its mandate by protecting the interests of citizens in general and not shrink from that duty. \nMunicipal elections are being held at the end of next year and we\u2019re urging all citizens to identify those candidates that understand these issues, as well as their mandate to citizens and then vote accordingly. \nD.

That\u2019s the very essence of his being. That he is kind. He is caring, considerate, loving, responsible, reliable, and has a damn bad habit of taking responsibility for everything that goes wrong around him. \nScott was just a kid when we first met him, and in six years our time, two from his perspective, he managed to grow into a true leader, the kind of leader who leads by example and understanding, rather than by trying to dominate or control others. A mentor to others, and the kind of inspiration that even adults felt hard to ignore. \nHe\u2019s probably one of the best and most understanding friends a person can hope for. Too selfless by far, especially once you pass the s4 marker. He\u2019s forgiving to a point, giving people second, third, and even fourth or fifth chances. \nOne of the things about Scott is that he inspires those around him to be better. Whether it\u2019s his friends, or his (former) enemies, it\u2019s hard not to try and become a better person when you\u2019re around someone like Scott. He never tries to shine at other\u2019s expense, and is in general more concerned with other people\u2019s wellbeing than with his own. \nIt\u2019s why most of the time I want to take the poor depressed nigh suicidal boy, wrap him up in a blanket and keep him somewhere warm and safe where no one can hurt him. It\u2019s why I want so desperately to see him able to stop Monroe\u2019s crusade so he can go to college, be a kid for a while and then become the veterinarian that he\u2019s always wanted to be. \nScott is also wise beyond his years, holding a vision of a better world, but instead of just dreaming, he tries to force that vision upon the world, and possessing the strength and will power to make that happen. And it\u2019s that strength of will that made him rise to true Alpha. \nWhat I like most about Scott, is how unique he is as a character. He\u2019s a subversion of the usual protagonist tropes, he\u2019s not the funny sarcastic guy, or the dark broody anti hero, he\u2019s not even the reckless, overly brave but na\u00efve hero who jumps into danger without a thought. Scott is not a rebel, with or without a cause. He can be stubborn, but essentially he\u2019s the good kid. The one that wants to listen to authority figures, and only resists them because his best friend keeps dragging him along into trouble. (and quietly, he enjoys Stiles\u2019 tendency to do so, because it tends to shake up his life a bit. Even if it isn\u2019t always in good ways) \nHe\u2019s a rational minded kid, who cares so much, that he\u2019ll take risks if other people\u2019s lives are in danger, but won\u2019t throw himself at a threat, just for the sake of it. But most of all, he\u2019s the kind of kid, who\u2019d be perfectly happy, leading a boring life, doing his homework, getting a job, a family, playing sports. But who can\u2019t bring himself to do just that, as long as other people are suffering. And it\u2019s just that, that makes him a hero. \nAs for a headcanon in regards to him. I probably have too many. But the one that\u2019s currently playing in my head is that after the series, Scott went and studied further martial arts and especially BaguaZhang (aka the martial arts craft that Deucalion used on Teen Wolf). This is an art aimed at using your opponent\u2019s force against them, and tends to specialize in fighting multiple opponents at once. Which just feels perfect for Scott and what he needs it for. \nAs for his future. I like to think that eventually they\u2019ll form a peace treaty with the hunters, even if only with the Argents, the Callaveras and other hunting families who follow the code. That these families look down on people like Monroe and her band of honorless madmen (and women) who murder the innocent, who murder children with no proof of any wrongdoing, or any regard for the code. And once hunters side with werewolves against Monroe\u2019s people they finally find a way to stop her and her crusade, or push it down enough that Scott can finally go fulltime back to school. (funded by Derek and or Chris) \nHe\u2019ll of course keep busy, being an alpha isn\u2019t the kind of thing you can just push aside, but he\u2019ll graduate as a veternarian, and maybe even learn how to use his werewolf abilities to not just take away pain, but actively heal the sick. He\u2019ll be the kind of alpha others come to for advice and maybe marry Malia, or find new love, who knows, have children, a life, and hopefully find happiness, which is all I want for him.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stiles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott mccall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monroe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "teen wolf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:39.102+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15128666, "moreResultsAvailable": 15128566, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512638859102&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 715}
