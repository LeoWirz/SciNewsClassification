The preacher in the sermon blasted the Igbo people for being arrogant and proud, explaining that even if he preaches till tomorrow, the Igbo man will never shed tears because his heart is hard. \n\nRevd Uma said that during the war, the Biafran leader never seek God for victory and never made any prayers during the war, describing Biafrans as Judah in the bible. He further explained that Judah after committing sin will go back to God for repentance, but the Biafrans never went to God. \n\nThe preacher said he would not call names but if he calls, he would tell the congregations the number of women the Biafran leaders were carrying at once during the war, explaining that sometimes, a Biafran Soldier would capture a lady because she is beautiful. \n\nHe however went on to commend the Igbo people for being wise, knowledgeable, hardworking, but yet many crawl through life because they fail to acknowledge God. \n\n\"And even after the war, no one has asked why we lost the war\", Uma Ukpai said. \n\nKindly Click HERE  or HOME to see other latest Posts Be the first to get News updates via WHATSAPP, Add us +2349037601079 and say Hi.

The unit powers on, the Rhythm component, speaker, 1/4\" output, and the volume controls all work based on some quick testing.

FILE - This June 1, 2017, file photo shows a Walmart store in Hialeah Gardens, Fla. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is changing its legal name effective Feb. 1, 2018, to Walmart Inc. from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. \nBy ANNE D'INNOCENZIOAP Retail Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is changing its legal name effective Feb. 1 as it shifts away from physical stores in the age of Amazon's increasing dominance. \nThe world's largest retailer, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, said Wednesday it will change its legal name to Walmart Inc. from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. \nIt said the move underscores its growing emphasis on serving shoppers in different ways beyond just physical stores but also online, on their mobile devices and through pickup and delivery. The company has been making inroads in narrowing the gap between itself and Amazon by making big investments in its online business. It tripled the number of items sold online from a year ago, overhauled its free shipping strategy and is expanding such services as allowing shoppers to pick up online grocery orders curbside at the stores. That has helped drive strong e-commerce sales gains in the past several quarters, most recently 50 percent growth in its fiscal third quarter. \nWalmart operates more than 11,600 stores and clubs under 60 different banners worldwide. \n\"Whether it's in our stores, on our sites, with our apps, by using their voice or whatever comes next, there is just one Walmart as far as our customers are concerned,\" wrote Doug McMillon, Walmart president and CEO, in a blog post Wednesday. \nThe discounter's formal legal name when it incorporated on Oct. 31, 1969 was Wal-Mart Inc. It was changed to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. on Jan. 9, 1970, the same year it went public. It will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange as \"WMT.\" It's been using the current Walmart logo in its operations since June 2008. \nBut for employees who still want to do the \"squiggly\" in the Walmart cheer where they move their hips when they get to the hyphen, there is nothing to fear. \n\"Getting our blood flowing and choosing not to take ourselves too seriously is still part of our culture,\" McMillon wrote Wednesday. \"It's important to have some fun at work, so for our associates in countries where your cheer calls for the squiggly, keep doing it!\" \n___ \nFollow Anne D'Innocenzio at http://www.Twitter.com/adinnocenzio Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Agony from dictatorship turned into the biggest war in history. \nUnfortunately, this has left a black mark, that isn\u2019t easy to scrub off. However, this land has many great cities and their inhabitants have worked long and hard to prove their successes and leave the shadowing judgment for a place in the spotlight. \nBerlin is very popular and has made its way into every Europe top-10 thinkable. For good reason, as I also discussed in my previous chapter of Based in a Suitcase . But how about Hamburg? Frankfurt? Cologne or Munich? \nI was lucky enough to book work in all of the above over the years, as well as visiting my best friend David, who was temporarily living in each and every one of them. Rarely has a place ever exceeded my expectations as much as Munich. It\u2019s the home of overpowering amounts of green, a hub for classical music and an incredible spot for urban surfing. These are qualities the city is widely known for, but not celebrated enough. I\u2019d like to leave an impression of my time spent in awe as I can wholeheartedly say this is one of my favorite places to spend a day or two. \n#1: Das Goldene Bar Did anyone say Nazi\u2019s? Well, yes. Das Goldene Bar is located in the Haus der Kunst, built by the Third Reich\u2019s leader in 1937. It was home to the creations of artists loved by the art critic manqu\u00e9, not far from his own four-story residence.To not allow this block of granite to become a white elephant, Haus der Kunst now houses an ever changing collection and serves the grand public the best Rueben sandwich straight from an establishment adorned with world maps, depicting spirit heritages and tobacco routes, renovated in 2010. Their team consists of well dressed and character carrying individuals who recommend drinks with a savoir faire that reaches impeccability, though this place is far from incapable of sin. Their homemade absinthe will have you speaking in tongues in no-time while your chorizo holding potato soup is on its way to heat up your soul and calm your appetite. \n#2: Munic Ey ewear Scratch the H and you\u2019ll find the brand that dedicated its name to its birthplace and are my helper in need when it comes to focus. Especially when trying to write when the sun is out or trying to jump on an inflatable unicorn (champagne problems I admit, but still). By no means am I blind without my glasses, as my main issue is Astigmatism, a refractive error first reported by Thomas Young in 1801, but the written word is important to me and what I can\u2019t see correctly, I cannot write to be read. On my latest trip to the Bavarian capital, I visited Munic\u2019s HQ and was greeted with a pair of customized frames for my mom, who had been telling me how obsessed she was with my sunnies. Granted, it\u2019s hard for us small headed people to find fitting glasses, so clearly I was on a mission. When I entered the office, I had an immediate peek into the new collection, carrying gold frames and clip-ons. No doubt I\u2019ll be making a return trip to pick up some new pairs early 2018. \n\n#3: Spatenhaus Everything one can know about this place is true; they brew their own beer, their decor is the true to it\u2019s kind and makes one feel like they\u2019re in a proper Opera-district places establishment and their Bavarian cuisine hits the spot. They have a private dining room upstairs if you want to get cozy with some friends or have a formal business meal with a family style touch. For vegetarians, this two menu-carrying Kuffler restaurant isn\u2019t top choice as for many dishes the chef has embraced the wishes of a carnivore. So if you like your sausages and fish-filled plates this place will rock your world. I\u2019m a fan.

It heated my 1950 vintage, 2000 sq ft ranch style home & full finished basement to 68-70 degrees F with 2 bags of pellets/ day on 20-40 degree F winter days, up to 3 bags/day on 0-20 degree F winter days running the stove at about half of its capacity. The stove essentially paid for itself in the first three years with fuel oil prices at the $3-$4/gallon. The stove did its job and is ready when I need it. Its on standby now given that fuel prices and pellet prices favor heating with fuel oil at this time.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 4.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:31.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c101e28e81a27fd4f9046df90d8cf1ed73e996f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxUl5XaPQ9WeJOesupv5r.j7uf8R2dSY2JK8Iu5YeVC.7Pl9_taeCmCmMAf8Tta38y67fcK5NZ5hw--", "site_full": "f30.bimmerpost.com", "site": "bimmerpost.com", "site_section": "http://f30.bimmerpost.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=412", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "UK - BMW 3-Series and 4-Series Forum (F30 / F32) | F30POST", "title": "2nd service", "title_full": "2nd service", "published": "2017-12-06T10:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 21, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "http://www.bimmerpost.com/bpfb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21282, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dbe847b4198ad9be8f89e118d3889440d4bfd60b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxUl5XaPQ9WeJOesupv5r.j7uf8R2dSY2JK8Iu5YeVC.7Pl9_taeCmCmMAf8Tta38x29OVq12PqdJpEpnIikUJE", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "F30 Steve", "published": "2017-12-06T11:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I would love to take it to a good Indy but I have no confidence in either of my local ones after taking my e46 to one of them with a faulty thermostat and when I went to collect it 8hrs later was told \u0093there\u0092s nothing wrong with it mate I\u0092ve had it running in the workshop for an hour and it\u0092s lovely and warm\u0094\nAnd the other one made a right mess of my air bag system \ud83d\ude44", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:31.020+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15075429, "moreResultsAvailable": 15075329, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512642211020&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 26}
