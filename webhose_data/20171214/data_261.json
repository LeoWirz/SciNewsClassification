battling rare cancer", "text": "The amazing community spirit that we know is the real Canberra has shone brightly again, for a very brave and very ill little girl.\nMembers of the C3 Church Monash and the Canberra Raiders were among the volunteers undertaking a special project for six-year-old Freyja Christiansen.\nThe big-hearted workers are creating a new garden for Freyja and her family at their home in Denman Prospect.\nSix-year-old Freyja is with her mum Lizzie at the Sydney Children's Hospital for an infection - just another battle for the little girl who has a very rare and life-threatening cancer in her neck, a clear-cell sarcoma.\nThe garden us a surprise for Freyja when she returns home next, hopefully next week.\nLizzie said she met with members of the church, which is attended by friends of Freyja's at her school, Yarralumla Primary.\nAdvertisement They plan to put in grass, trees and plants, making paths, a cubby for Freyja and her sisters, Inge and Brynn, and a home for Freyja's rabbit, Cottontail.\nYou will now receive updates from AM & PM Update Newsletter AM & PM Update Newsletter Get the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy . \nThere will also be a \"healing garden\" of fruit trees, vegetables and herbs, something Lizzie, who cooks all organic food for her daughters, most appreciates.\n\"They said, 'This is our Christmas gift to Freyja,\" Lizzie said.\n\"And, oh my gosh, I was just in tears.\n\"They felt it was something they could do to help and they really understood what Freyja needed.\n\"Somewhere simple, quiet, safe - just somewhere she can relax and be a little girl. Go into the cubby house and have a chat to the fairies, because she still believes in fairies.\"\nNatalie Kingston, a member of C3 Church Monash, is also friends with Lizzie and her daughters.\n\"Over the next two weeks, our church is conducting a campaign called Love Canberra which is encouraging people to go out and do an act of random kindness that people would not be expecting,\" Mrs Kingston said.\n\"I picked the garden for my project but I would have done it anyone. It's a whole community coming together to make it happen.\"\nThe Raiders who helped with the garden on Thursday were captain Jarrod Croker, Nick Cotric, Jordan Rapana and Aiden Sezer.\nThey got a good workout moving wheelbarrows of soil and laying turf.\nLizzie and her supporters are closing in on their goal to raise enough money to send Freyja overseas for potentially life-saving treatment.\nShe will first have surgery at the Chris O'Brien Lifehouse, a cancer treatment centre named in honour of the late surgeon Chris O'Brien.\nThose costs are being covered which means a step close to getting the proton treatment in Europe. Australia will begin a trial of proton therapy in 2020.

Luke Skywalker is back, but changed. And Leia Organa's story will soon be coming to an end. \nThe Star Wars that inspired four decades of passionate fandom appears to be slowly but surely fading as \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" prepares to descend on Dec. 15, giving way to a newer generation of intergalactic rebels and their foes, like Rey and Kylo Ren, and a fresh voice behind the endeavor in writer-director Rian Johnson (\"Looper\"). \nJ.J. Abrams'\"The Force Awakens\" set the stage for this new era of the franchise, but \"The Last Jedi\" has to move it forward and keep audiences interested for the next one too. \nAfter all these years and billions of dollars, Star Wars isn't exactly a scrappy underdog anymore, but the franchise is in somewhat uncharted territory. The prequels did their own damage, but at least no one had to say goodbye to their original heroes. \nAnd then there's the seemingly impossible standard set by that other Star Wars sequel, \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" \nBesides the main cast, filmmakers and some Lucasfilm and Walt Disney Co. brass, no one will see \"The Last Jedi\" until the Los Angeles premiere on Dec. 9. And determining what exactly audiences should expect is a bit like trying to assemble a puzzle with no picture and most of the pieces missing. The cast has left some adjective breadcrumbs (\"intense,\"''emotional,\"''intimate,\"''cinematic\") but for the most part, it's a mystery. \n\"For me, 'The Last Jedi' is not a particularly happy story to tell, but it's just my part,\" Mark Hamill says cryptically. Hamill, 66, returns to play Luke Skywalker after being seen in only a few frames of \"The Force Awakens,\" which ends on a wind-swept cliff as the young protege Rey (Daisy Ridley) approaches him looking for training from the missing Jedi. Luke and Rey are just one of the new pairings promised for the film, which finds every character out of their comfort zone and facing new challenges as the Resistance organizes to go up against the First Order. \n\"It's got so much going on,\" Hamill adds. \"You can cut from the more somber scenes I have to the action/adventure, the suspense, the humor ... I've only seen it once but I thought, 'This is too much information to process.'\" \nThe marketing campaign, no doubt playing into the tone set by \"Empire,\" has focused on the darkness and intensity of \"The Last Jedi,\" but Johnson says that's only one element. He stresses that it is, first and foremost, a Star Wars movie. To him, that means capturing that thing that makes you want to \"run out of the theater and into your backyard\" to play with your spaceship toys \u2014 even without the curmudgeonly wit of Harrison Ford's Han Solo. \n\"That's what everyone was concerned about going in: How do you do it without him?\" Johnson, 43, says. \"I saw so much potential for humor in it. I was looking at every single character and trying to find opportunities to break the tension. I think people are going to be surprised by how fun and light on its feet it is.\" \nIn addition to Luke and Rey, the film brings back Carrie Fisher as Leia in her last film role (Fisher died after filming had wrapped), Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, fresh off murdering his father Han Solo, the mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), Domnhall Gleeson's General Hux, the ace pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac), the ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) and his old boss Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie), Chewbacca, the droids and a host of newcomers, like Laura Dern's purple-haired Vice Admiral Holdo, a maintenance tech, Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a hacker (Benicio Del Toro) and some cute little creatures called Porgs. \nHis script, which he was able to write while \"The Force Awakens\" was being made, took some of the cast aback at first. \n\"I was going, 'Uh, I'm not sure about this,'\" Ridley says. \"It just took us all a second to be like, 'Ok this is where the story is heading.'\" \nJohnson jokes that he's like the new boyfriend at Thanksgiving dinner who everyone has to get used to. \n\"(Rian) had a different challenge which was to expand the Star Wars universe further with more inventive ideas, taking more risks,\" Boyega says. \"He was a real fan. I feel like he ticked off his Star Wars fanboy theories just one by one with this film.\" \nThat fandom has also helped Johnson, who Hamill refers to as his Obi-Wan, reach a sort of zen-like state with the film. It also doesn't hurt that Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, who has not been afraid to make tough decisions and fire or bench directors if something isn't working, was so pleased with their collaboration and the resulting film that she has already enlisted Johnson to develop a new Star Wars trilogy separate from the Skywalker saga (he'll write and direct the first). \nNow it's just a matter of putting \"The Last Jedi\" out in the world. Financially, there's not much to worry about \u2014 it's tracking to open somewhere in the $200 million range (far below \"The Force Awakens'\" $248 million debut, but stunning nonetheless). Also box office and the expectations and hopes of a loyal fanbase, who have been burned before, are two very different things. \n\"Having been a Star Wars fan myself for the past 40 years, I know intimately how passionate they are about it and how everyone has stuff they love and hate in every single movie. That takes the pressure off a little bit just thinking, 'Ok, there's going to be stuff that everyone likes, there's going to be stuff that people don't like and it's going to be a mixture,'\" Johnson says. \nAnd with a smile and a shrug, he adds: \"That's what being a Star Wars fan is.\" \n___ \nAP Entertainment Writer Sandy Cohen contributed from Los Angeles.

The updated app throws in a few more goodies for when you\u2019re inside the room, including TV remote with all the channels options showing up on your display (favorite any you like for fast access), light controller, and thermostat. \nSloser claimed Hilton is the first in the industry to \u201cenable connected guest rooms with an integration at scale in a consistent experience.\u201d \nFor anyone without a smartphone or who simply don\u2019t want to fiddle around with it, Hilton is launching a \u201csimplified\u201d remote to fiddle around with instead. Failing that, you\u2019ll have to actually have to move your body close to the various devices and adjust them manually. \nAccording to Skift, Hilton isn\u2019t yet ready to incorporate voice activation for controlling room amenities, thought that\u2019s likely to become a feature at some point down the road. \nThe revamped app\u2019s new features will be tested first at the Hilton in Memphis, Tennessee, by guests enrolled in Hilton\u2019s \u201cHonors\u201d loyalty program. The hotel chain wants to have it rolling out to more properties in the next few weeks before taking it to all of its U.S. properties during 2018. \nWe like the sound of Hilton\u2019s efforts, but we\u2019d also like to see a few robots dropping by to help , or even an entire hotel run by robots.

INTRODUCTION Units 7 and 8 review the theory, logic, and application of t tests. The t test is a basic inferential statistic often reported in research. You will discover that t tests, as well as analysis of variance (ANOVA) studied in Units 9 and 10, compare group means on some quantitative outcome variable. Logic of the t Test Imagine that a researcher compares the mean IQ scores of Class A versus Class B. The mean IQ for Class A is 102 and the mean IQ for Class B is 105. Is there a significant difference in mean IQ between Class A and Class B? To answer this question, the researcher conducts an independent samples t test. The independent samples t test compares two group means in a between-subjects (between- S) design. In this between- S design, participants in two independent groups are measured only once on some outcome variable. By contrast, a paired samples t test compares group means in a within-subjects (within- S) design for a single group. Each participant is measured twice on some outcome variable, such as a pretest-posttest design. For example, a researcher could measure self-esteem for a class of students prior to taking a public speaking course (pretest) and then measure self-esteem again after completing the public speaking course (posttest). The paired samples t test determines if there is a significant difference in mean scores from the pretest to the posttest. Units 7 and 8 focus on the logic and application of the independent samples t test. There are two variables in an independent samples t test: the predictor variable ( X) and the outcome variable ( Y). The predictor variable must be dichotomous, meaning that it can only have two values or groups (for example, male = 1; female = 2). Group membership must be mutually exclusive. In non-experimental designs, group membership is based on some naturally occurring characteristic of a group (such as gender). In experimental designs, participants are randomly assigned to one of two group conditions (for example, treatment group = 1; control group = 2). In contrast to the dichotomous (nominal) predictor variable, the outcome variable must be continuous to calculate a group mean (for example, IQ scores, self-esteem scores). Assumptions of the t Test All quantitative statistics, including the independent samples t test, operate under assumptions checked prior to calculating the t test in SPSS. Violations of assumptions can lead to erroneous inferences regarding a null hypothesis. The first assumption is independence of observations. For predictor variable X in an independent samples t test, participants are assigned to one and only one \"condition\" or \"level,\" such as a treatment group or control group. This assumption is not statistical in nature; it is controlled by proper research procedures that maintain independence of observations. The second assumption is that outcome variable Y is continuous and normally distributed. This assumption is checked by a visual inspection of the Y histogram and calculation of skewness and kurtosis values. A researcher may also conduct a Shapiro-Wilk test in SPSS to check whether a distribution is significantly different from normal. The null hypothesis of the Shapiro-Wilk test is that the distribution is normal. If the Shapiro-Wilk test is significant, then the normality assumption is violated. In other words, a researcher wants the Shapiro-Wilk test to not be significant at p < .05. Unit 7 -t Tests: Theory and Logic The third assumption is referred to as the homogeneity of variance assumption. Ideally, the amount of variance in Y scores is approximately equal for Group 1 and Group 2. This assumption is checked in SPSS with the Levene test. The null hypothesis of the Levene test is that group variances are equal. If the Levene test is significant, then the homogeneity assumption is violated. In other words, a researcher wants the Levene test to not be significant at p < .05. SPSS output for the t test provides two versions of the t test: \"Equal variances assumed\" and \"Equal variances not assumed.\" The statistics you present depend on the outcome of the Levene test. If the Levene test is not significant, researchers report the \"Equal variances assumed\" version of the t test. If the Levene test is significant, researchers report the more conservative \"Equal variances not assumed\" calculation of the t test. Hypothesis Testing for a t Test The null hypothesis for a t test predicts no significant difference in population means, or H0: \u03bc1 = \u03bc2. A directional alternative hypothesis for a t test is that the population means differ in a specific direction, such as H1: \u03bc1 >\u03bc2 or H1: \u03bc1 <\u03bc2. A non-directional alternative hypothesis simply predicts that the population means differ, but it does not stipulate which population mean is significantly greater ( H1: \u03bc1 \u2260\u03bc2). For t tests, the standard alpha level for rejecting the null hypothesis is set to .05. SPSS output for a t test showing a p value of less than .05 indicates that the null hypothesis should be rejected; there is a significant difference in population means. A p value greater than .05 indicates that the null hypothesis should not be rejected; there is not a significant difference in population means. Effect Size for a t Test There are two commonly reported estimates of effect size for the independent samples t test, eta squared (\u03b72) and Cohen's d. Eta squared is analogous to r2 studied in Units 5 and 6. It estimates the amount of variance in Y that is attributable to group differences in X. Eta squared ranges from 0 to 1.00, and it is interpreted similarly to r2 in terms of small (.02), medium (.13), and large (.26) effect sizes. Eta squared is calculated as a function of an obtained t value and the study degrees of freedom. Cohen's d is an alternate effect size representing the difference between the means of the two groups divided by the standard deviation of the variable of interest for both groups combined (pooled standard deviation). A small Cohen's d indicates a high degree of overlap in population means (see Figure 3.4 on p. 106 of the Warner text). A large Cohen's d indicates a low degree of overlap in population means (see Figure 3.5 on p. 106 of the Warner text). A Cohen's d of .20 is considered a small effect, .50 is a medium effect, and .80 is a large effect. Larger effect sizes indicate findings of greater practical or clinical significance.

Photo: Tony Moore \nHealth, security and community safety chairwoman Sheila Ireland said Ipswich\u2019s cemetery officer discovered the underground crypt when a sinkhole appeared in the unmarked grave section of the cemetery. \n\u201cCouncil\u2019s cemetery officer at the time investigated the hole and saw a previously unknown underground crypt containing two coffins,\u201d Cr Ireland said. \n\u201cThe crypt was made of stone and had a partially filled in stairway running underground.\u201d \nThe two coffins preserving Mr Fleming and his wife lie against the walls of the underground crypt. \nThe 1998 drought caused the soil to compact, which forced the \u201clynchpin\u201d holding the crypt roof intact to fall through. \nIpswich cemetery project officer Ashley Ward said the council now planned to restore the crypt and make it a tourist attraction. \n\u201cWhat we want to do is have a virtual reality tour of the crypt,\u201d he said, which could be shown online and in Council libraries. \nJoseph Fleming was born in New South Wales in 1811 and by the mid 1830s he was running properties in the Liverpool Plains. \nIn 1839 he helped arrest local \u201cGentleman Dick\u201d bushrangers and by 1848 moved to Ipswich where he began buying properties and businesses, including a \u201cboiling down works\u201d, a sawmill and a flour-mill. \nHe became a business partner in the steamer, Bremer, which took cargo down the Bremer and Brisbane rivers to trade in Brisbane. \nHe was elected the West Moreton MP in 1860, but famously never uttered a word in Parliament. \nIn fact, history records he did not attend at all in the first month of Queensland\u2019s first Parliament in 1860. \nFalling wheat prices and a long-running legal stoush meant Mr Fleming was declared bankrupt in 1862 and he left Parliament. \nThe couple had nine children and Mrs Fleming died in the 1850s. \nMr Fleming was again elected West Moreton MP in 1866, but lost office in July 1867, again without saying a word in Parliament. \nHe returned to storekeeping, but died in bankruptcy in 1891. \nIpswich City Council has set aside $50,000 to restore his underground crypt and will ask the Queensland Government for help to bring the virtual reality tour crypt to life. \nThe council is now trying to find relatives of Joseph and Phoebe Fleming to help with the restoration.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tony moore", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "bremer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrs fleming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheila ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashley ward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fleming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheila ireland photo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wayne wendt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph fleming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phoebe fleming", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ipswich city council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ipswich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "queensland parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony moore  health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ipswich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west moreton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new south wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liverpool plains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "queensland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:20.092+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6b8a5b7f3ec13602869fba5916758765931daaf8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCohPDKZnFyWYuPMQ89IgWP7bD4zH1m9IeCRjfDTLWmAf934yt43ctaVTdpklpfd_vDFZVNS2H37QR5W2aAu_R2O", "site_full": "bussiness-line.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bussiness-line.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "News for you", "title": "Google Alert -

Before going to sleep at night, wrap the Malaysian Hair with a silk scarf. This will keep the mark on your head, the first wear becomes obvious, lying flat. Scarf will not be the same as the scarf hair torn.\n2. Gently brush. It is important to brush your knit everyday, just as you do with natural hair. Be very careful when brushing your teeth, do not pull out the glued runway, and do not loosen the braids on the runway. Gently brush the shaft with the other hand and hold the braid with one hand to reduce the pulling force.\n3. Touch the top. If you know it's time to weave your knit but have no time or money to redo right away, try removing and re-applying the hair layer. Although knit in the crown may be loosened, as long as the hair on the top and around looks fresh, you can take a look again for about a week.\n4. Shampoo once a week. Too much fabric washed may dim its luster, but not enough to shampoo it will cause it to bunch at the ends, lose sway and bounce. Once a week cleaning can achieve the perfect balance.\n5. Keep the adhesive free from oil. If your fabric is stuck inside, you will want to keep the hair away from the weave marks. Oil will cause the track to slide out.

Updated: December 7, 2017, 1:25 PM IST France is the world leader in fighting food waste. (Photo courtesy: AFP Relaxnews/ PHILIPPE HUGUEN) When it comes to eating well, eating responsibly and practicing sustainable farming, France is the world leader, while the United Arab Emirates ranks last. That's according to 2017 edition of The Food Sustainability Index, developed jointly by The Economist Intelligence Unit and the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition. For the index, researchers studied 34 countries across three main pillars: food loss and waste; sustainable agriculture; and nutritional challenges. The countries represent more than 85 percent of the global GDP and two-thirds of the planet's population. Along with taking the highest spot overall, France was the top performer in the food and waste pillar, thanks to a government and policy-level response to food waste. Last year, new legislation was passed to prohibit supermarkets from throwing away food approaching its sell-by-date, requiring them instead to donate the surplus to charities and food banks. Likewise, to help combat food loss, public awareness campaigns in the country remind consumers that deformed \"ugly\" fruit and vegetables are perfectly edible. Impressively, the report points out that France loses less than 2 percent of its total food production to wastage a year. Per capita, annual food waste is equal to 106 kg. For perspective, that's equal to less than a third of per capita waste in Australia. After France, the top five performers on the index are Japan, Germany, Spain and Sweden. Common thread A common thread among the top scoring countries? In general, they typically demonstrate strong and effectively implemented government-level policies on food and agriculture, authors say. The report was prepared to align with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, a list of 17 targets aimed at ending poverty, protecting the planet and equalizing prosperity. \"Sustainable food systems are vital in achieving the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Major global developments such as climate change, rapid urbanisation, tourism, migration flows and the shift towards Westernised diets put food systems under pressure,\" said Martin Koehring, managing editor at The Economist Intelligence Unit in a statement. \"The Food Sustainability Index is an important tool to help policymakers and other relevant stakeholders to design effective policies to improve food system sustainability.\" Though high-income countries tend to perform well on the list, researchers point out that the United Arab Emirates bucks the trend: Despite having the highest GDP per head, the UAE ranks last on the index, while the poorest country on the list, Ethiopia, ranks a respectable 12th. The reason? Like many countries in the Arab world, the UAE has a high level of food waste, rising levels of obesity, and receives a low score for sustainable agriculture. The top scoring country in the sustainable agriculture pillar, meanwhile, is Italy, while Japan is the standout performer in the pillar of nutrition. The report also looked at lifestyle factors like physical activity, diet, monthly freshwater scarcity, and the participation of women in farming.

The NATO allies are divided by a series of decades-old issues, including territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea, and have come to the brink of war three times since the early 1970s.\nBut from the outset, the discussions focused on disagreements.\nOn the eve of his visit, Erdogan rattled his Greek hosts by telling Greece's Skai television that the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne should be \"updated.\" The treaty delineated modern Turkey's borders and outlines the status of the Muslim minority in Greece and the Greek minority in Turkey, among other issues.\nIn a visibly testy first meeting with Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos, the two engaged in a thinly-veiled verbal spat over the treaty and Greece's Muslim minority, which Erdogan is to visit Friday.\n\"This happened in Lausanne, that happened in Lausanne. I get that, but let's now quickly do what is necessary,\" Erdogan told Pavlopoulos. \"Many things have changed in 94 years. If we review these, I believe that all the sides will agree that so many things have to (change.)\"\nThe spat continued during Erdogan's appearance at an unusually candid joint news conference with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras .\nThe two listed a series of grievances their countries have with each other, including religious and minority rights, the divided island of Cyprus and the case of ten Turkish servicemen who have applied for asylum in Greece following a Turkish government crackdown after a failed coup last year.\n\"It is very important to strengthen our channels of communication, and this can only happen on the basis of mutual respect,\" Tsipras said.\nThe prime minister said the two also discussed tensions in the Aegean Sea, where Greece complains Turkish fighter jets frequently violate its airspace.\n\"The increasing violations of Greek airspace in the Aegean and particularly the simulated dogfights in the Aegean pose a threat to our relations, and particularly a threat to our pilots,\" Tsipras said.\nFor his part, Erdogan insisted once more that the Lausanne treaty needed to be reviewed, but stressed his country had no territorial claims on its smaller neighbor.\nOn the topic of the Muslim minority in Greece \u2014 which the country recognizes only as a religious minority, while Turkey has long pressed for better rights \u2014 Tsipras said his government agreed that improvements must be made in their quality of life.\n\"But issues that concern reforms involving Greek citizens are not an issue of negotiation between countries,\" he said.\nTsipras noted it was unclear exactly what Erdogan was seeking with his call to update the 1923 treaty.\n\"The truth is I am a little confused about what he is putting on the table,\" he said.\nGreeks have been aghast at Erdogan's previous comments over possibly revising the Lausanne treaty, fearing that could harbor territorial claims.\nErdogan and Tsipras also sparred over Cyprus, a Mediterranean island divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion into a Turkish-occupied north and an internationally recognized Greek Cypriot south. Another round of internationally-brokered peace talks to reunify the island failed earlier this year.\n\"Who left the table? Southern Cyprus did ... we want the issue to reach a fair and lasting solution but that is not southern Cyprus' concern,\" Erdogan said.\nTsipras retorted: \"My dear friend, Mr. President, we must not forget that this issue remains unresolved because 43 years ago there was an illegal invasion and occupation of the northern part of Cyprus.\"\nErdogan also raised the issue of Athens having no official mosque, to which Tsipras responded by saying Greece had restored several mosques around the country, including a centuries-old mosque in Athens.\nThe refugee crisis appeared to be the only issue the two sides did not disagree on, with both noting they had shared a significant burden of the migration flows into the European Union . More than a million people crossed from Turkey through Greece at the height of the crisis.\nLater Thursday, several hundred leftist, anarchist and Kurdish protesters held a peaceful march through Athens against Erdogan's visit.\nOn Friday, Erdogan will visit the northeastern town of Komotini to meet with members of Greece's Muslim minority.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSuzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, Derek Gatopoulos and Nicholas Paphitis in Athens contributed.\n  Leaders of Turkey, Greece air grievances at tense conference  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitris tzanakopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexis tsipras", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united nations general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kayhan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shares star   file", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lausanne", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:22.056+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "efca59a58f88546df07fba0b338f016b77420ce9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJppuce9gtqc0VJRrvCCmh0aNx9dHO_OsqQmPTZSBxRV6NiG1hU619gO1oC5vCOclK4_evvXgMwXCrJS1vs6bhuO.pIH3WYb9fH6wlKTFkOrI25_twhvLuJYbjDlO1_7jU9zcQ8xvup1Dqu6EWcGkBbXs10wIDgY7o", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Bath-Bathroom-Cabinets-Storage-Bathroom-Wall-Cabinets/N-5yc1vZcfve/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Foremost Naples 26-1/2 32-3/4 8 in White-NAWO2633", "title_full": "Foremost Naples 26-1/2 in.
