In order to recover from the DoS condition, the devices must be manually restarted. \nThe mitigating factors section of Siemens\u2019 advisory lists the requirement that the attacker must have network access for exploitation, and the fact that it advises organizations to operate these devices only in trusted environments. \nHowever, CyberX told SecurityWeek that there are roughly 2,000 Siemens devices accessible from the Internet, including approximately 400 that have an open SNMP port, which could make them vulnerable to the company\u2019s exploit. \n\u201cDoS vulnerabilities shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly,\u201d CyberX said. \u201cThe December 2016 attack on the Ukrainian electrical grid used this type of exploit to disable protection relays and make it more difficult for operators to recover.\u201d \nThe security firm said Siemens was very responsive to its vulnerability report. The vendor has released firmware updates that patch the flaw in some SIMATIC S7, EK-ERTEC, SIMOTION and SINAMICS products. \nUntil fixes become available for the other affected products, Siemens recommends disabling SNMP, which fully mitigates the vulnerability, protecting network access to port 161, applying defense-in-depth and cell protection concepts, and using VPNs.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eduard kovacs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cyberx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george lashenko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "securityweek", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "udp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simocode", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simatic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sirius", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siemens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:58.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08df11b19f741a63d060267850320f3b47a42de2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ30XM4y.RZCK12E.XjrZGatrSp5sfPM6HRj0JejFom_jg1vEb9PVKRxUMc7KsZguwhvqowRXFDLo4pEA5q9Buy5U-", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/o-t-lounge/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "O-T Lounge | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Official California Wildfire Thread 2", "title_full": "Official California Wildfire Thread | Page 2 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T06:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9bbf2e0a18c9f916c91a6fc436d908a6e9590959", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ30XM4y.RZCK12E.XjrZGatrSp5sfPM6HRj0JejFom_jg1vEb9PVKRxUMc7KsZguwhvqowRXFDLo4oqFeySNa2iv.SH9DXrx5ow--", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Tiger70503", "published": "2017-12-07T08:51:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Oh man\n#ThomasFire - Reported house surrounded by fire & people trapped @ 3500 Maricopa Hwy (Hwy33), strike team of type 1 engines sent to that location.\nSimilar report for an elderly couple trapped inside their home in the 9000blk of Santa Paula Ojai Rd. #ThomasFire", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:58.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08df11b19f741a63d060267850320f3b47a42de2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ30XM4y.RZCK12E.XjrZGatrSp5sfPM6HRj0JejFom_jg1vEb9PVKRxUMc7KsZguwhvqowRXFDLo4pEA5q9Buy5U-", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/o-t-lounge/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "O-T Lounge | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Official California Wildfire Thread 2", "title_full": "Official California Wildfire Thread | Page 2 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T06:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "92bb777f13e9e68ba444ecf982ffcb0fbbb46459", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ30XM4y.RZCK12E.XjrZGatrSp5sfPM6HRj0JejFom_jg1vEb9PVKRxUMc7KsZguwhvqowRXFDLo4oqFeySNa2itbJ5Pr9POOpQ--", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "Tiger70503", "published": "2017-12-07T08:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "#ThomasFire: The Ojai area is getting hit very hard right now.

Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake. (Photo: Charlie Leight, The Arizona Republic) CONNECT 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE As miscalculations go, John McCain\u2019s lighthearted but misguided bid to reach a milestone in Twitter followers was appropriately, in the social media universe, an inconsequential fail. The Arizona senator sought 74 more followers to hit 3 million; instead, thousands took to an #UnfollowMcCain campaign within hours. More: I know Jeff Flake. Trump has shaken him to his core. More long-lasting and serious is the outcry over his vote \u2014 and that of fellow Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \u2014 in favor of the GOP tax reform bill that won passage without a single Democratic vote. In so doing, McCain and Flake squandered a perfectly good opportunity to cement their legacy as deficit hawks, fiscal conservatives and sensible Republican senators. The #UnfollowMcCain campaign matters because it reflected the frustration and anger of Democrats and independents who counted on the \"maverick\" McCain to reject the tax reform bill that nonpartisan experts say will benefit the wealthiest Americans while hurting the poor and the middle class. They were holding out for the same maverick who just earlier this year cast the decisive vote that killed legislation to repeal Obamacare. Flake caved for THAT? Flake, meanwhile, has been a prominent Trump critic who essentially, and famously, chose to end his political career rather than compromise his \u201cprinciples\u201d to do what was necessary to win over Trump supporters. In the tax vote, however, Flake and McCain clearly chose the interest of the Republican Party rather than what's best for the country. If the senators were going to support the tax bill despite its fiscal irresponsibility, I wish they\u2019d have fought harder to win more consequential concessions. Flake\u2019s explanation is most baffling because he prides himself as a deficit hawk, yet was nonetheless willing to vote for the plan that could increase the federal deficit by more than $1.4 trillion over a decade. POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media And what did Arizonans get in return? Well, a lot if you\u2019re among the \"1%\" super-rich. But wait, Flake explained that he also got a commitment from the Trump administration to have a seat at the table to negotiate protections for so-called \"dreamers\" who were brought to this country illegally by their parents. Seriously, congressman. You took the Trump administration\u2019s word? Why #UnfollowMcCain matters This is the president that ended the Obama-era program that protected the roughly 800,000 dreamers and gave Congress until March to pass legislation. Trump has used dreamers as political pawns, consistently spewed lies on all sorts of issues and hasn't hesitated to throw under the bus anyone who criticizes him. And are we supposed to be grateful that our senator, whom Trump has repeatedly mocked and forced him out of his re-election bid, may be welcomed to the negotiating table? Forgive me if I\u2019m not impressed. I understand that for wealthy Americans, Flake and McCain don\u2019t need to justify their tax vote. For them, after all, it\u2019s a perfect holiday gift. But for idealistic people like me and many of those who unfollowed McCain in anger and protest, we believe elected officials should represent the interests of all Americans \u2014 not just those affiliated with their political party. Tax reform is overdue. But tax cuts and redistribution of wealth should be equitable. That turns out to be too much to ask of our Arizona senators and their Republican brethren in Congress.

Will a small piece of the extreme sadness I have felt stay within?\"\nYes and no. I have been over my depression for years now and at first, was waiting for it to come back. I was more anxious waiting for it to come back than when I was suffering previously. It never came back.\nNow I can think about those times and though I feel sad about the things that happened the happy memories from earlier on in my life are shining through with a vengeance. I can remember bad/sad things but also see the good things that happened before and after without the bad/sad things hanging around for more than a few minutes. There's no more dwelling on bad times.\nI'm glad I can remember and 'feel' the sadness as it's helped me to understand others who are still suffering.\nSo for me. Yes, a little bit of the depression has stayed deep within me. No, it's not the same as feeling depressed. For me, once the depression was gone, the happy memories, which I had forgotten about or just never seen as happy at the time, began shining through.\nSM", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

I tried for years undiagnosed to deal with PTSD anxiety and depression. I went further and further down until I could not function. Initial medical treatment when it came did improve matters as did the removal of a major stressor, my employment.\nIf you had asked my during those early years if I thought it possible for the depression and other symptoms to leave I would have said no.\nMy treatment, meds, hospital and family support all contributed to improvment. This has (by and large) kept up until now I'm not depressed for very long periods and the bouts, when they come, are short. Anxiety has lessened, and can mainly be dealt with.\nDo I have a happy life? Yes. Extreme sadness? No\nOf course one is changed by the events in one's life, they certainly put me in a very bad place. But that is not all. Treatment takes time. Perspective and coping skills grow with experience too. Plus I believe - at least in my case - time has greatly lessened symptoms.\nIf you are like me depression and sadness will have shorter and shorter bouts and be mostly manageable when they hit.\nI don't know if that is much help to you, at least you know from my example a much better life is possible\nCroix", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:58.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b662c18432bd152c7f2497c3cb63f9609b94a36d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8C1Q610nHYYevCfzN9JDN6Ry1.8HtOoaP_4lBDE29osnVuatDFFpUkWQOP4wzQEmHTBmarncODjQ--", "site_full": "www.scarymommy.com", "site": "scarymommy.com", "site_section": "http://www.scarymommy.com/feed", "site_categories": ["family_and_parenting", "parenting_teens"], "section_title": "Scary Mommy", "title": "It\u2019s Hard When A Spouse Travels For Work, And This Is Why", "title_full": "It\u2019s Hard When A Spouse Travels For Work, And This Is Why", "published": "2017-12-07T08:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dad-work-travel.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10926, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b662c18432bd152c7f2497c3cb63f9609b94a36d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8C1Q610nHYYevCfzN9JDN6Ry1.8HtOoaP_4lBDE29osnVuatDFFpUkWQOP4wzQEmHTBmarncODjQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ashleigh Wilkening", "published": "2017-12-07T08:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "It\u2019s Hard When A Spouse Travels For Work, And This Is Why", "text": "Ashleigh Wilkening Hero Images / Getty \nIt sucks when my husband isn\u2019t home. I\u2019m not talking about the small windows of time while he\u2019s at work, running an errand or any other brief moment out of the house \u2013 it\u2019s when he\u2019s away for larger stretches of time while traveling for work. \nAm I capable? Yes! Am I strong? Absolutely! Am I independent? You betcha! Regardless of me being all these things and more, I still feel as though a part of me is missing when he\u2019s gone. My support, my partner, my best friend is hundreds, sometimes thousands of miles away for a duration of a couple of days, weeks or even months. As a military family, this is a routine occurrence in our household and although it\u2019s something we experience on a semi-regular basis, it doesn\u2019t make it any easier. \nWhen he\u2019s home, his presence gives me a physical support system and a wingman to our partnership in marriage and this wild ride of parenting. Although I take the lead in managing our household and my role doesn\u2019t deviate much while he\u2019s away, his absence is felt stronger on an emotional level that\u2019s difficult to manage alone. \nI\u2019m the knower of schedules, planner of activities and events and everything else keeping this family functional and operational-ish. While this is shared with my husband on a day-to-day basis, I\u2019m usually the doer because honestly, I\u2019m hella good at project managing our family. Often times it\u2019s the invisible, intangible efforts that consumes more of my time and energy, but none the less, I take pride in this role. I wear it as a badge of honor and rock the shit out of it. \nWe both have our strengths. He\u2019s better at grilling dinners, fixing crap and tending to anything else on his \u201choney do list\u201d that I assign him. He takes care of the big bugs and I take care of the spiders because he cowers at the sight of them. Yes, he cooks, cleans and does laundry. He also changes diapers, gives baths and everything else related to child-rearing, while I\u2019m making sure we aren\u2019t running out of the essentials and packing school lunches like a boss. This list isn\u2019t all encompassing with definite cross-over without anything completely resting on one person. But like I said, we each take the lead on certain tasks because we both are better off if I don\u2019t attempt to fix the dryer or hang anything on the walls, just as we all enjoy not running out of toothpaste and toilet paper. \nResponsibilities aren\u2019t set in stone nor split down the middle because life raising a family doesn\u2019t work that way. With him home, I can count on him as a back-up and have an assurance of knowing someone else will and can be there if needed. If I\u2019m running late, he can pick up our son from school. If one of our kids needs to go to the doctor and I\u2019m unable, he can do it. He can do the grocery shopping because taking our three little ones on my own sounds like my worst nightmare. While he does all of this and more, without him, I carry the burden of doing it all for everyone, stretching myself thinner than ever. \nSelf-care doesn\u2019t take a backseat, but rather becomes non-existent. The option to have family nearby to lean on most often isn\u2019t a luxury I\u2019m afforded. It\u2019s just me, myself and I. Sure he\u2019s a phone call away, but it isn\u2019t the same. \nI\u2019m the last line of defense and that scares me more than anything. If I fail, I fail my kids. While he\u2019s gone, I\u2019m the sole provider of comfort, security, and caregiving. I\u2019m their one and only and that\u2019s a huge responsibility and weight to carry around. \nWhat if I accidentally sleep in and don\u2019t get my son to school on time. What if someone breaks in and I\u2019m by myself with the kids? What if I have a flat tire on the freeway, or worse, get into an accident? What if I lock us out of the house? There are so many what ifs constantly running through my mind that I don\u2019t normally have when he\u2019s home. I don\u2019t even realize how much his presence puts me at ease until he\u2019s gone leaving me drowning in anxiety until he returns. \nDespite proving I am more than able to take care of everything and everyone by myself, as I have done many times before, the unsurmountable strength it takes can be overwhelming at times. It goes far beyond the physical act of keeping everyone alive, but rather the mental load of feeling and worrying for everyone. I\u2019m taking in all the fears, anxieties, frustrations and every other emotion, only to supply everlasting comfort, security and love in return. \nAs my children are young, unable to fully understand my husband\u2019s absence, other than \u201cdaddy at work,\u201d my heart pangs every time they cry asking for him with no comprehension of situation. In those moments, it takes all of my energy not to breakdown right alongside of them. They miss him. I miss him. And when nightfall finally sets in, while the children are asleep, I can\u2019t help but to be overcome with loneliness. \nAlthough the weight on my shoulders to keep it together is heavy, I\u2019m reassured it\u2019s only temporary. In the meantime, I make sure everyone is living their best lives in hopes of providing a much-needed distraction. Rules are bent, sometimes broken. Spoiling and bribes are at an all-time high. We all seem to be drowning our sorrows in ice cream and cupcakes. I do whatever I can to reassure, console and make sure my children feel loved, secure and protected until their father returns and our family is whole again.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "i. sure", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:58.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "495d7e2549219daea4d75ea45c0693a3d3f934d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8C1Q610nHYYevCfzN9JDN6N1.ro8j_WcJEqE09IDR0ckEUEghz.ENT6p1CKuQokd8-", "site_full": "www.scarymommy.com", "site": "scarymommy.com", "site_section": "http://www.scarymommy.com/feed", "site_categories": ["family_and_parenting", "parenting_teens"], "section_title": "Scary Mommy", "title": "I Can Talk About My Anxiety, But I Don\u2019t Know How To Ask For Help", "title_full": "I Can Talk About My Anxiety, But I Don\u2019t Know How To Ask For Help", "published": "2017-12-07T08:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cant-ask-for-help.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10926, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 55, "comments": 0, "shares": 55}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "495d7e2549219daea4d75ea45c0693a3d3f934d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8C1Q610nHYYevCfzN9JDN6N1.ro8j_WcJEqE09IDR0ckEUEghz.ENT6p1CKuQokd8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mandy Rubink", "published": "2017-12-07T08:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "I Can Talk About My Anxiety, But I Don\u2019t Know How To Ask For Help", "text": "Mandy Rubink Kat Jayne / Pexels \nIt took me nearly thirty years, but I am finally fairly capable of articulating my anxiety. The way that my skin crawls, the way my chest tightens, and most notably, the way I feel when I crave control of everything. \nI am not trying to be neurotic and obsessive. I understand that this is a disease. I get that these are unrealistic and impractical thoughts. I recognize that many (most?) of the feelings I have are preposterous. \nBut I still have them \u2014 and even if they are silly, they are real. They are still my feelings. And I still feel them, oftentimes too strongly. \nI write lists and re-write lists. I fully plan for events that will never come to fruition. I keep at least eight budgets to be sure all the bills can be paid and we have enough money for groceries before the next pay period. I rearrange the furniture in my brain, hoping a change of thinking will allow me to feel comfortable in my own space. \nI have mentally prepared for the death of my husband. Where the kids and I would live, how we\u2019d manage without him. No, he\u2019s not ill \u2014 not even close. I\u2019m just constantly worried, constantly making plans. And it goes beyond my husband \u2014 my parents, sister\u2026 even my two children. \nThese are the things I am able to adequately express. I am not, however, capable of telling you when I need help though I\u2019m secretly pleading and begging that you can swoop in and save me. \n\u201cI\u2019m exhausted. I was up all night again.\u201d I lie awake until the early morning hours, my legs stiffening and my body sweating. I change clothes and turn the ceiling fan on high. Nothing helps. I sit up to do some deep breathing exercises and I can finally feel my chest loosening. But the second my head hits the pillow, my brain spins so fast I can almost hear the wheel. My body aches of fatigue and I pray I can sleep away these wretched fears and guilt. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been puking again.\u201d It\u2019s gotten really bad. My worry has become so heavy that my stomach constantly turns. \n\u201cI just need a girl\u2019s night.\u201d Please. Give me an excuse to talk through my ridiculous illusions over some diet coke and carbs. \nAnd then I receive the ever-popular \u201cLet me know if you need anything,\u201d and I shut my eyes so tight and I can feel the tears trickle down my cheeks. \u201cI am,\u201d I scream inside my head. \u201cThis is me asking \u2014 no, pleading!

Turner in a Memphis courtroom. Judge Lee Coffee told her he would not allow another such interruption, but he did not charge her with contempt of court. \nTurner was indicted Tuesday on a first-degree murder charge. His bail is set at $1 million. Turner told the judge that he was planning to hire an attorney and Coffee set a hearing for Tuesday. \nWright's body was found in a swampy field in suburban Memphis on July 28, 2010, 10 days after the 34-year-old was reported missing. He was shot multiple times. The seven-year investigation into his death has been one of the Memphis Police Department's most high-profile unsolved cases. \nProsecutors and police have declined to say much about the case. Police said last month that they had found a gun used in the killing in a lake near the small town of Walnut, Mississippi, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Memphis. \nAfter Marion's statement, Turner was led out of the courtroom in the custody of court officers. The judge called Marion to a microphone in the courtroom and told her he understands her pain because his father was killed.

It's certainly somewhat surreal. Also, certain cringe-making attitudes, alas. \nLatest episode of Tremontaine. \nKJ Charles, The Price of Meat (2016) - alt-Victoriana queer horror novella, riffing off various existing motifs. \nSophie Hannah, The Monogram Murders (New Hercule Poirot Mysteries no 1) (2014). At least I acquired this, I am pretty sure, as a giveaway. Feel Dame Agatha must be turning in her grave. The thing with her is that when you have what seems like a massive elaborate intricate murder plot going, the real reason is going to be something simple that is being covered up, no? Also our narrator is a Scotland Yard detective who, in the annals of unlikely men of the Met, is among the unlikeliest - is a man with trauma issues to do with corpses suited to a career in homicide, we ask? Is it is in the Christie tradition to provide a narrator/detective with Baggage, in the modern style? Also, however improbable we may deem Handsome Alleyn, Dalgliesh, and Linley, they do seem to have some notion of proper policing practices and taking a feet-on-the-ground sidekick with them at all times. \nJoolz Denby, Borrowed Light (2006). Re-read, as it surfaced during a recent tidy-up. Still good, if grim. \nOn the go \nCarla Kelly, Marrying the Royal Marine (2010), on the grounds that I was looking for something a bit fluffier after the Denby. However, I'm not sure I shall finish this - it is not a good sign when your hero and heroine are captured by the French in Portugal (this is the Napoleonic Wars) and you do not feel any great urge to read on and find out how they get out of that, and did he really shoot the nun/spy for the guerillas to save her from dishonour, or was that a cunning contrivance. \nRose Lerner, A Lily Among Thorns (2011): this is a lot more compelling, if almost too busy as regards plot. \nUp next \nThis week's episode of Tremontaine. \nDenby's Billie Morgan (2005) also surfaced, so I may reread that.

Both US political parties have long promised to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and Palestinian-aligned regional forces have long threatened violence against the US and Israel. Trump's announcement allows him to tick the box on another campaign promise with no input from Congress and only at the cost of antagonizing the Muslim world, which he seems ok with.  \nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday stirred the pot across the Muslim world on by announcing the US would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel .\nInflamed regional leaders didn't even wait for the announcement to become official before promising a violent response.\n\"He is declaring war in the Middle East, he is declaring war against 1.5 billion Muslims (and) hundreds of millions of Christians that are not going to accept the holy shrines to be totally under the hegemony of Israel,\" Manuel Hassassian, Palestinian general delegate to the UK,  told the BBC  on Wednesday.\nTurkey's deputy prime minister said the move \" will be a major catastrophe. \"  Turkish President  Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan termed the move  a \"red line\" for Muslims. \nHamas, a militant Palestinian Sunni Muslim group, used the occasion to call for another intifada, or uprising, against Israel.\nAn Iranian-backed militia operating in Iraq said the move would give some \" legitimate reason to target American forces.\" In response,  US embassies across the Middle East braced for violence .  \nTrump's announcement \"will change nothing on the ground\" Lior Mizrahi/Getty Images \nDespite the fury it provoked, \"the Trump announcement will change nothing on the ground itself,\" Michael Koplow, the Israel Policy Forum's policy director wrote at the Jewish Telegraph Agency .  \nIsrael considers Jerusalem its capital. The policy platforms of successive Democratic candidates have considered Jerusalem Israel's capital. The US has planned since 1995 to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nYet Hamas frequently calls for intifadas. Iranian-backed forces have several times attacked or imperiled US forces operating in the Middle East . Turkey and Israel had just normalized relations after a six years of difficult silence .  \nAbsent from Trump's speech was a timetable.  \n\u201cAs a practical matter, no embassy is constructed today anywhere in the world in shorter than three or four years \u2014 no embassy,\u201d a Trump administration official told the Washington Examiner .  \nThe US will first study sites, evaluate security concerns, and then begin a lengthy construction process that will likely stretch into the next US presidential administration. \nAs far as endangering the already dubious Palestinian-Israeli peace process, Trump made it clear that the US took no position on how the city should be divided between the two . \nWhat actually happens now that the US recognizes Jerusalem REUTERS/Suhaib Salem \nBesides inflaming an already inflamed Middle East, Trump's announcement makes a few material changes. \nAs Koplow points out, it will irk the US's Sunni Arab allies who support Palestine and don't want to be seen as siding with the US and Israel. \nDomestically, the move allows Trump to tick the box on another campaign promise completely unilaterally. \nThe president has total authority to conduct the type of foreign policy decision Trump made on Wednesday with no need for a lengthy legislative battle.  \n\"Some say [past presidents] lacked courage, but they made their best judgments based on facts as they understood them at the time,\" Trump said during the announcement.  \nIsrael is pleased by the decision. The Palestinian Authority, such as it is, protests it. Fundamentalist groups have called for violence against Israel and the US. Trump's Secretaries of State and Defense cautioned against the move out of security concerns , but Trump is the executive. \nPolitically at home, Trump has executed on a promise and again demonstrated that for his administration, antagonizing the Muslim world is an acceptable price to pay. \nNOW WATCH: What life is like on the $11 billion US military base right next to the North Korean border \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "michael koplow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koplow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdo\u011fan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manuel hassassian", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jewish telegraph agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel policy forum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington examiner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestinian authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:01.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dddf152082d9c9e1a3680a20093900d7a6ed03a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTUqzGXVH3SpkgJnLifDfsYV2gekHcoF6UkRXGKages7UYcqDOSZWZOBO6r4XiGrUMtg3ZVCuURW14iplCNTuIm_gKfH68J.hgsA17MKNh6nps6twF8ooAheIZVWIz6cYU-", "site_full": "currencyforextips.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://currencyforextips.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "JPYINR trading range for the day is 57.43-57.87 \u2013 Currency Forex Tips", "title": "JPYINR trading range for the day is 57.43-57.87", "title_full": "JPYINR trading range for the day is 57.43-57.87", "published": "2017-12-07T12:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dddf152082d9c9e1a3680a20093900d7a6ed03a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTUqzGXVH3SpkgJnLifDfsYV2gekHcoF6UkRXGKages7UYcqDOSZWZOBO6r4XiGrUMtg3ZVCuURW14iplCNTuIm_gKfH68J.hgsA17MKNh6nps6twF8ooAheIZVWIz6cYU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ways2capital", "published": "2017-12-07T12:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "JPYINR trading range for the day is 57.43-57.87", "text": "JPYINR trading range for the day is 57.43-57.87.

I decided to make 2 of these cuties, one for the girls and one for the boys! I love that these sets come with sentiments and accessories, so you can make so many different cards from the one set. On both of these cards I used some Copic Blender Solution \"0\" on the Kangeroo's to add some fun texture to their fur. The set comes with dies to cut the little accessories out and a little die to make an opening in the Kangeroo's stomach so you can insert a little image. I cut the main images with my Brother Cut N Scan machine.

As part of the new financing, Carol Gallagher , Pharm D, Partner at NEA, will join the company's board of directors. With the new financing, Metacrine has raised approximately $60M since it began operations in early 2015. \nOver the course of the past year, Metacrine has advanced its lead asset, MET409, an oral non-bile acid FXR agonist, into late stage IND-enabling studies. First-in-human studies of MET409 are planned to be initiated in the first half of 2018 and completed by year end. Based on extensive profiling and benchmarking against other FXR agonists in development, MET409 has been purposefully designed to have a differentiated profile to position it as best-in-class for efficacy and safety. FXR has been clinically validated to be a key target in hepatobiliary diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). \n\"We have had a keen interest in new therapeutics for patients with NASH. We look forward to working with the experienced management team at Metacrine to support their mission to discover and development innovative medicines,\" said Dr. Gallagher. \nIn addition to advancing MET409 into clinical development, the Series B proceeds will also be used to fund drug discovery efforts against novel targets in liver inflammation and fibrosis. Metacrine is also advancing a FGF1 program, a first-in-class insulin sensitizer, in collaboration with Novo Nordisk. \n\"We are thrilled to have NEA as a new investor along with the addition of Dr. Gallagher to our board,\" said Ken Song , MD, President and CEO of Metacrine. \"NASH represents one of the largest unmet medical needs in medicine today. We believe FXR is a compelling NASH target and that our program addresses the gaps in delivering a best-in-class molecule. In addition to NASH, we have outlined a strategy to pursue FXR in other clinical indications.\" \nAbout Metacrine \nMetacrine is a privately held biotechnology company headquartered in San Diego, CA.

Pediculosis capitis infect head, pediculosis pubis infect pubic area and pediculosis corporis lay nits in seams and folds of cloths. Pediculosis pubis is also referred as crabs. Prevalence of pediculosis is perpetually increasing globally. In many parts of the U.S., pediculosis infection to head in school children has reached epidemic proportions. Thus, rising prevalence of pediculosis coupled with lack of awareness about personal hygiene are some of the drivers for growth of the global pediculosis treatment market. In addition, increased use of human lice in forensic studies is fueling the growth of the global pediculosis treatment market. While on the other hand, lack of diagnostic tools and condition specific treatment are some of the major factors that are restraining the growth of the global pediculosis treatment market.For Specific and Customized requirements@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag... Presently, North America and Europe are leading the global pediculosis treatment market. Factors such as, exceptionally developed healthcare infrastructure, higher healthcare spending, reimbursement coverage and government support are driving the pediculosis market in North America and Europe. Asia Pacific is a lucrative market for pediculosis treatment. Factors such as rapidly developing healthcare infrastructure on the grounds of growing medical tourism industry, increasing awareness about pediculosis and related treatments, and rising literacy rate are fueling the growth of pediculosis treatment market in Asia Pacific region. India and China account for the largest population pool in the world. Therefore, India and China are anticipated to show fastest growth rate in the forecast period.In addition to India and China, Japan is also expected to grow at significant growth rate owing to increased focus of Japanese government on improving healthcare facilities in the country. Countries namely, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina in Rest of the World (RoW) are expected to show faster growth rate than rest of the countries in this region owing to availability of well structured regulatory framework and higher rate of awareness about pediculosis. African countries are expected to show slower growth rate in the forecast period owing to poorly developed healthcare infrastructure and poor economy.

But the recent elections saw big losses for the mainstream Christian Democrats and Social Democrats and gains for fringe parties of the left and right. The centrist parties will need to change if they want to hold off more extreme parties. \nGermany has the fourth-largest economy in the world and the largest in Europe.\nThis country has been the stable center of the European system for decades. Amid social and political tensions that have torn the European Union since 2008, Germany has been the solid rock on which Europe has rested.\n(I wrote about the origins of European geopolitical issues in my exclusive e-book,   The World Explained in Maps , which you can   download here )\nIt is not an overstatement to say that if Germany destabilizes, the EU won\u2019t survive. Germany has not yet destabilized, but it is wobbling.\nThe political ground in Germany has shifted One sign is the inability of German parties to form a new government since   elections in September .\nA reason for this is that Germany\u2019s political reality has shifted. Both the CDU and the SPD lost roughly 20% of their seats in parliament in the election. The Christian Social Union in Bavaria, the CDU\u2019s long-time partner, lost about the same. And the two left-wing parties, the Greens and the Left Party, gained hardly any.\nMeanwhile, the right-wing Alternative for Germany, or AfD, gained 93 seats to become the third-largest party in parliament, taking most of its votes from the CDU and the SPD.\nIn addition, the Free Democratic Party, a traditionally liberal party dedicated to free markets with a minority euroskeptic faction, became the fourth-largest party after failing to win any seats in the previous election.\nThis is not an earthquake, but the ground has shifted.\nThe CDU and the SPD can still form a grand coalition, but to date, they have been unable to do so. There are, as in all political matters, many reasons for this, but the deepest reason is that the CDU and the SPD have evolved into effectively the same party.\nThey have governed together, sharing the same Europhile ideology and holding similar views on the role of Germany and the manner in which German society should be run. The two major political parties have failed to provide the German public with different visions of the country\u2019s future, and different views on the matters that concern Germans, like the EU, immigration and social programs.\nThe emergence of new marginal parties As a result, other parties have emerged.\nThese parties are too small to expect to govern, and so they don\u2019t necessarily need to hold positions that have broad appeal. Instead, they have carved out niches with views designed to bring together fragments of German society.\nNone of these parties will rule, but together they constitute the only opposition to what are called the mainstream parties.\nThe problem is that the mainstream consists of many lesser streams, and the subtleties of even the governing coalition have been forgotten. This is one factor that has led to resentment toward this political hegemony.\nThe marginal parties attract not only fellow ideologues, but also those who are repelled by the decline in debate between the major parties. The SPD therefore is being very cautious in accepting a place in another coalition government.\nGermany needs mainstream parties that debate and disagree, not a hegemonic center that generates revolts from the margins.\nA looming political earthquake Politics is seldom interesting from a geopolitical perspective.\nWatching the personal ambitions of various political figures rarely reveals the underlying social realities. But we live in a time when politics in   the United States ,   the United Kingdom , Germany, and other countries reveal the deep social tensions that must be addressed.\nThe anger between factions is real, and bringing it to light is the only way to address it.\nGermany is not Angela Merkel, although she has skillfully built a political center that claims to speak for the whole country. But Merkel has also created an opposition that is now challenging the center on a range of issues.\nWhen a grand coalition ignores the dissenters or pretends that they are merely cranks, the ground under the coalition weakens. There is, in fact, a great debate in Germany over the country\u2019s future on issues from the role of German culture to the welfare state.\nA grand coalition brushes these matters aside, and the more it does that, the more the political system and social reality will diverge, until the earthquake inevitably arrives.\nGrab George Friedman's exclusive eBook,   The World Explained in Maps The World Explained in Maps   reveals the panorama of geopolitical landscapes influencing today's governments and global financial systems.

The development was one more sign of the Southeast Asian state\u2019s insistence on pursuing its declared war on illegal fishing, which has been made a key priority under Indonesian President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo. \nAs I have noted before in these pages, one of the most visible manifestations of Jokowi\u2019s emphasis on the maritime realm since coming to power in October 2014 has been clamping down on illegal fishing (See: \u201cExplaining Indonesia\u2019s Sink The Vessels Policy Under Jokowi\u201d). Jokowi himself has emphasized the sheer magnitude of the problem, saying that though Indonesia is the world\u2019s second largest fish producer, 5,000 ships operate illegally in Indonesian waters each year, making a mockery of Indonesian sovereignty and resulting in annual losses of over $20 billion. \nWhile Indonesian officials have been keen to emphasize that this war on illegal fishing consists of a range of important economic, legal, and diplomatic efforts that are being undertaken at home and abroad ranging from a moratorium on issuing business licenses to the setting up of local fisheries courts to addressing aspects of the issue through regional and international fora media attention unsurprisingly has overwhelmingly focused on the seizure and sinking of vessels. \nSo far, in 2017, the government has sunk 128 illegal fishing vessels, and, all in all, over 300 have been sunk since Jokowi came to office. Most of these vessels have come from neighbouring Southeast Asian states rather than China; Indonesian officials have tended to be more careful in how they address Chinese cases lest they complicate ties with Beijing more than they need to. And while there have been signs of moderation in some aspects, including how the vessels are sunk as well as select diplomatic efforts with concerned countries, the seizure and sinking of ships itself shows no sign of stopping. Indeed, as I noted last month, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries minister Susi Pudjiastuti has continued to play up the success of Indonesia\u2019s tough line on the issue, touting figures such as the doubling of fish production from 6 million tonnes to 12 million tonnes per year and indicating that sinking ceremonies continue to be planned out for the rest of 2017 (See: \u201cIndonesia\u2019s War on Illegal Fishing Continues with New Sinkings\u201d). \nOn Monday, in yet another development in this aspect of Indonesia\u2019s crackdown on illegal fishing, Susi told a press conference in Jakarta that Indonesia had seized Fu Yuan Yu 831, a 598-tonne Chinese fishing vessel that was one of the main foreign vessels suspected of engaging in illegal fishing in Indonesian waters. She said that the ship was seized by the ministry\u2019s Maritime and Fisheries Monitoring Task Force (PSDKP) patrol boat Hiu Macan 03 after it was spotted by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority and Indonesian fishermen. \nIndonesian authorities have confirmed that they arrested 21 crew members on board last Thursday evening, seized the catch (which included 35 tonnes of fish and protected tiger sharks), and subsequently took the ship to Kupang Port for further investigation. In the sort of deceptiveness typical in such instances, the Chinese fishing boat had flown the flag of Timor-Leste and had five other national flags on board those of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore an action that violates international law. The Fu Yuan Yu 831 is listed as being owned by Fuzhou Hongdong Pelagic Fishery Co. Ltd, which is based in Fuzhou, China. \nNo further details were provided by Indonesian officials as to the next steps that would be taken, with the investigation still pending in concert with others, including Timor-Leste. But the seizure illustrates that Indonesia\u2019s war on illegal fishing continues on, as it is likely to do into 2018.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "widodo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susi pudjiastuti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hiu macan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jokowi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fu yuan yu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "maritime", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian fisheries management authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fuzhou hongdong pelagic fishery co. ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maritime affairs and fisheries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fisheries monitoring task force", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jakarta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kupang port", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fuzhou", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:02.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e9220af97459fb4392d523d37d4ee0c972296cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TtNjGj9FMWIQeNCh192idgOpsXj4CXYZi9vyhwIAK0oTNjyLYq0LUiKFLiP7iPh6ZrXM7rMT1KbQhq8QEKdFTckU_f3GtYqy4-", "site_full": "a-new-hope4u.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://a-new-hope4u.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "new hope", "title": "Google Alert - web designs", "title_full": "Google Alert - web designs", "published": "2017-12-07T12:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0e9220af97459fb4392d523d37d4ee0c972296cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TtNjGj9FMWIQeNCh192idgOpsXj4CXYZi9vyhwIAK0oTNjyLYq0LUiKFLiP7iPh6ZrXM7rMT1KbQhq8QEKdFTckU_f3GtYqy4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Murali s (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google Alert - web designs", "text": "web designs As-it-happens update \u22c5 December 7, 2017 NEWS How to Improve Customer Loyalty through User Experience Designmodo (blog) Traditionally, the user experience has been bonded to website design .

Short for Eximbay Coin , this venture focuses specifically on tourists traveling between Korea, Japan , and China , but has the potential to enhance tourism all over the world. \nEBCoin seeks to address the expensive obstacles that tourists currently face when shopping abroad. Chief among these is consumption taxes. In theory, tourists can recoup the costs of these taxes through refunds, but the complexity and high cost of the refund system means that most travelers regain, at most, a fraction of the money they lost. Combined with the cost of exchanging currencies, this limits both the number of people who are willing to travel in the first place and the amount that those who do travel are willing to purchase. \nBy providing a decentralized platform for claiming tax refunds, EBCoin allows tourists to recoup most of the money they lose through consumption taxes. Releasing a new coin that can be exchanged for multiple other fiat and digital currencies, along with a decentralized exchange platform, further saves tourists money by reducing the cost of exchanging their money. These efforts should make it substantially easier for Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and other citizens to travel and shop across the globe. \nAddressing the Limits of Tax Refunds \nOne of the most important factors that affects how much tourists spend when visiting other countries is those countries' taxes. Consumption taxes often make up a large portion of national, provincial, and local government budgets. This is particularly true in European countries, where such taxes can account for upwards of 15 percent of the cost of retail goods. While consumption taxes are generally accepted as fair by citizens, who benefit directly from the services that they pay for, they are an unqualified loss to tourists. For this reason, many countries offer foreign visitors refunds on the consumption taxes they pay while in the country. \nWhile refunds have the potential to attract more tourists, in practice, they are of limited effectiveness. This is because the system for reimbursement is so difficult. To claim a refund, tourists must record their purchase histories and present them to customs authorities in airports and other designated locations. But because there are only so many of these locations, this tends to require waiting in long lines. Combined with the complexity of filling out the necessary paperwork and making sure that their refunds are the correct sizes, this leads many tourists not to bother to claim tax refunds. As a result, roughly USD $24 billion in refunds goes unclaimed. \nEven when tourists do claim their refunds, they often do not receive the full value that they deserve. The current system for processing refunds is highly expensive, consuming as much as 30 percent of the total value of tax reimbursements. This makes it less worthwhile for tourists to seek refunds in the first place. \nIn order to simplify refunds and lower administrative fees, EBCoin provides an app where tourists can enter all the relevant information on their own. Users must scan their passports and enter the information into the app; this confirms their identity and their country of citizenship. They can then scan the receipts from different items they buy during the trip, creating a reliable purchase history that can be used to calculate the total amount of consumption taxes they've paid. The platform uses this information to claim the user's refund, which it pays to them in its own digital currency. \nBecause the EBCoin platform is highly decentralized, there are no intermediaries who charge fees for processing refunds. There is also no need for users to stand in line at airports or go through a complicated process of recording and verifying their purchases. More users are thus likely to claim their rightful refunds, and in doing so, they will receive close to the total value of those refunds. This has the potential to put billions of dollars back in the pockets of tourists, giving them an incentive to travel more and make more purchases abroad. \nCurrency Exchange & the Eximbay Coin \nBesides allowing users to claim tax refunds, the EBCoin platform is releasing its own digital currency. These Eximbay coins (EBC) are backed by the Korean payment services firm KRP, which serves more than 6,000 businesses across Japan , China , Korea, and other parts of East and Southeast Asia . Many of these businesses are likely to begin accepting the coins for purchases, allowing tourists to use EBC rather than having to obtain the local currency. The EBCoin platform also allows users to exchange the coins for local currency, their home countries' money, or other national and digital currencies. \nAs with refund processing, EBCoin offers a decentralized means of exchanging its own and other currencies. This eliminates intermediary fees and other currency exchange charges, lowering the cost of traveling and shopping abroad. Releasing its own currency also provides EBCoin users a standard against which to measure the value of other currencies, making it easier for them to make sure they are getting a good deal on exchanges. \nEBCoin plans to create 1.5 billion of these coins, exactly half of which will be issued to the public through token sales. The platform will release 150 million of these coins during a pre-sale in December of 2017, and will then distribute 375 million during an ICO in January of 2018. The coins will initially be pegged at a value of 6,000 EBC for one ETH. This value will likely change as the platform grows in popularity and demand for Eximbay coins increases.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sha", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ebc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:03.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "84bad093725459153216e249ad7f35fed472d874", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmNKuSSMJvw75VVy.PPZC0DSqNpqxqn1Giac8H.fFsfudIsspoNQ8W", "site_full": "www.ozbargain.com.au", "site": "ozbargain.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.ozbargain.com.au/forum/38181", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Computing: Discussion Forum - OzBargain Forums", "title": "Accidentally Got The Wrong Video Card", "title_full": "Accidentally Got The Wrong Video Card - OzBargain Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T10:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.ozbargain.com.au/themes/ozbargain/logo-square.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10489, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "157c203665dfde220f006e50a3c6ef117e9f4b79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmNKuSSMJvw75VVy.PPZC0DSqNpqxqn1Giac8H.fFsfoqMJZa5NWxVmp6xoNbivb6URe5qec3Njw--", "ord_in_thread": 35, "author": "0blivion", "published": "2017-12-07T09:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I'm actually in the camp that thinks if you asked nicely and offered to cover shipping and any difference, the seller'd allow you to swap it for the card you wanted.\nIf you want to build around this, start a new thread and we'll see what we can do!

These authors share that visualizing strengthens one\u2019s inferential thinking. This is a strategy to note with students with ASD because, according to Harvey and Goudvis, when we visualize, we are inferring with images instead of words.\nUnfortunately, I have found through my work with many students that students with ASD are not always aware that there is supposed to be a picture in their head or if there is one, why it is there. Below, I will outline some strategies to support the teacher explicitly introducing their students to the need for and use of a picture in their mind\u2019s eye of what they are reading.\nAn initial routine that students can learn is to stop and jot method, with the jot being to draw a quick sketch. This can be done through the I Do, We Do, You Do method, especially if students initially do not know what to jot at first. It can then be extended to include writing, once the teacher formatively assesses that the students understand how to engage with that picture in their mind of what they are reading.\n\nStopping and jotting, or stopping, thinking, and jotting, allows students to realize that they do not always have to write what they are thinking. If it works for them to share that information visually, they can do so. This helps them understand how to act and interact with the visual that is already in their mind when they read.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goudvis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:04.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "46c5c44275e7853bafb1fffd8889f453ef937c81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYtspIH.jYLBd909gqCoPd3P3htTSDjEKsx_swHQkeH582pIEcPkyEn5wf4afyusgKw-", "site_full": "jysmax.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://jysmax.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "AMIS ET VISITEURS BIENVENUE (vieux port de bastia)", "title": "*", "title_full": "*", "published": "2017-12-04T17:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IS", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "46c5c44275e7853bafb1fffd8889f453ef937c81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYtspIH.jYLBd909gqCoPd3P3htTSDjEKsx_swHQkeH582pIEcPkyEn5wf4afyusgKw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jean-yves ou jys (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-04T17:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "*", "text": "\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:04.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f26720e277c2033c0089815839853e4b879c1c6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQkVc1Lfwc9Z9Y03SNieymUIeONpQW_kV8loEdBFsjQxQdhl7wAxoq5BNtlzHjGcd710a7y3JH11CyOZJU1iFHOi8nvDYIaEiTUDgHvTziD9w--", "site_full": "lascruces.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://lascruces.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "craigslist las cruces | personals search", "title": "Looking to be a Cock sucker!
