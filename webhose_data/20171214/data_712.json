As part of the new financing, Carol Gallagher , Pharm D, Partner at NEA, will join the company's board of directors.  With the new financing, Metacrine has raised approximately $60M since it began operations in early 2015.\nOver the course of the past year, Metacrine has advanced its lead asset, MET409, an oral non-bile acid FXR agonist, into late stage IND-enabling studies.  First-in-human studies of MET409 are planned to be initiated in the first half of 2018 and completed by year end.  Based on extensive profiling and benchmarking against other FXR agonists in development, MET409 has been purposefully designed to have a differentiated profile to position it as best-in-class for efficacy and safety.  FXR has been clinically validated to be a key target in hepatobiliary diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\n\"We have had a keen interest in new therapeutics for patients with NASH.  We look forward to working with the experienced management team at Metacrine to support their mission to discover and development innovative medicines,\" said Dr. Gallagher. \nIn addition to advancing MET409 into clinical development, the Series B proceeds will also be used to fund drug discovery efforts against novel targets in liver inflammation and fibrosis.  Metacrine is also advancing a FGF1 program, a first-in-class insulin sensitizer, in collaboration with Novo Nordisk.\n\"We are thrilled to have NEA as a new investor along with the addition of Dr. Gallagher to our board,\" said Ken Song , MD, President and CEO of Metacrine.  \"NASH represents one of the largest unmet medical needs in medicine today.  We believe FXR is a compelling NASH target and that our program addresses the gaps in delivering a best-in-class molecule.  In addition to NASH, we have outlined a strategy to pursue FXR in other clinical indications.\"\nAbout Metacrine\nMetacrine is a privately held biotechnology company headquartered in San Diego, CA. The company is focused on efficiently developing innovative drugs that materially benefit patients with metabolic disease.

Nina Muprhy and Mariah James contributed eight points each. \nTereaha Hall fired a game-high 31 points for Grace Davis and accounted for 23 of her team\u2019s 24 points in the first half.

(Vahala) Anderson. His mother had emigrated from Finland and Walt was very proud of his Finnish heritage. \nWalt grew up in Hamden, Conn., graduated from Hamden High School, where he played football and baseball, and then enrolled in Dartmouth College. While at Dartmouth, he played football and received the 1953 season\u2019s \u201cManners Maketh Man Award.\u201d He was a member of Sigma Chi and graduated in 1954 with an economics degree. \nA commissioned first lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, his three years of active service were spent in Germany and North Africa. \nHe then began a 40-year banking career and became a vice president, working 20 years with Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City and then 20 years with Summit Bank \u2014 now Bank of America \u2014 in New Jersey, until he retired in 1996. \nIn 1962, Walt married the love of his life, Eleanor \u201cEllie\u201d Kask Berg, and also adopted her son, Richard. The family first lived in Staten Island, N.Y., where son David was born, then came to Madison, where their third son, Erik, was born. \nIn 2005, after living for 40 years in New Jersey, they moved to Hilltop Place in New London, N.H., where they were delighted to participate in their grandchildren\u2019s lives. \nWalt was a loving and caring family man and cherished the opportunity to attend school events and games. He was particularly thrilled to attend almost all of his grandson\u2019s high school and college football games. \nAfter retirement, Walt became a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) in New Jersey. In 2001, he was honored by CASA and was a state delegate to the National Convention in Minneapolis. He continued his work with CASA for several years in New Hampshire as well. \nWhile in New Jersey, he also volunteered with Meals on Wheels, the Interfaith Food Pantry, the Homeless Network and a mentoring program for inner-city children at the United Methodist Church in Madison . In New London, he volunteered with the KLS Food Pantry and was a Council on Aging (COA) driver. \nHe was an active member of the First Baptist Church in New London and the Country Squires and was a former member and treasurer of the Hilltop Place Board of Directors. \nHe was always a \u201cloyal son of Dartmouth,\u201d and served as a class agent, interviewed prospective students and faithfully supported the athletic program. He was so proud that his grandson enrolled in a Dartmouth Graduate School program. As his ultimate gift, he donated his body to Dartmouth\u2019s Geisel Medical School for medical education and research. \nWalt was very sports-minded and enjoyed playing golf and tennis for many years. He was an avid TV sports watcher and a lifelong Red Sox fan. Throughout his life he attended as many Dartmouth football games as he could. \nHe and Ellie traveled extensively in the U.S. and Europe, particularly enjoying jazz fests and jazz cruises. They made a special trip to Finland in 1976 and met relatives from both of their families. \nThose he left behind, who will miss his caring, encouragement and that smile that could \u201clight up a room,\u201d are his loving wife of 55 years, Ellie; his sons and their wives, Richard and Margo of Morris Plains, David and Karla of South Sutton, N.H., and Erik and Noora of Exeter, N.H.; his beloved grandchildren, Emily and her husband, Patrick, Cody and his wife, Emily, and Sonja and her significant other, Alex; his cherished great-grandson, Wyatt; and also step-grandchildren Andrei and Sofia, and step-great-granddaughter Vera. \nA memorial celebration of Walt\u2019s life will be held at noon on Saturday, Dec. 9, at the First Baptist Church, 461 Main St., New London, N.H., with a reception to follow. The Rev. Charles Glidewell and the Rev. Cindy Johnson will officiate. All are welcome to join the family in celebrating Walt\u2019s life.

Should these be chrome or aluminium or how about stainless?\nOr what about looking for some Matchless ones, Part numbers?\nAny help would be really appreciated.\nOh and I'm not sure if I should have a sump guard also, some pictures of this model I've seen show one fitted and some don't.\nIf you can assist that would be great\nCheers,\nNick\n #712210 - 10/22/17 9:07 am Re: N15CS mudguard/fender supplier [ Re: Nick Law ] Joined: Jun 2002\nPosts: 9,366 Stuart\n Stuart\n Jun 2002\nPosts: 9,366\nScotland Hi Nick,\nAutocycle Engineering ?\nHth.\nRegards,\n#712260 - 10/22/17 5:30 pm Re: N15CS mudguard/fender supplier [ Re: Nick Law ] Joined: Jan 2008\nPosts: 299 57nortonmodel77\n 57nortonmodel77\n Jan 2008\nPosts: 299\nConcord Township, Ohio Hi Nick, My friend Anthony Curzon may have some, or will most likely know who does have them.

Last Updated: 07/12/17 1:01pm Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood are causing England ample Ashes problems Australia's pace-packed seam attack is causing England severe problems in the Ashes, writes Gideon Haigh, even if Steve Smith is still learning how to captain his fast-bowling trio... \nCan anyone or anything, strictly speaking, ever 'live up to the hype'? It is, after all, hype - and hyperbole, by definition, consists of 'exaggerated claims not meant to be taken literally'. Becoming literal, these cease to be hype. QED. \nPardon the pedantry: its relevance lies in reviewing the success in the first two Tests of Australia's three-prong pace attack - Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Patrick Cummins. \nBefore the series, they were heavily hyped. Ryan Harris even thought them superior to the trio he formed four years earlier with Mitchell Johnson and Peter Siddle. \nGlenn McGrath anointed Starc 'the best bowler in the world'; his captain called him an 'absolute genius'; a video of him bouncing Usman Khawaja in the nets circulated like the work of a Russian electoral hacker. Cryptocurrencies have changed hands at fairer value. Starc claimed 5-88 as England were bundled out for 233 in their second innings in Adelaide \nIn fact, Starc, Hazlewood and Cummins have not had it all their own way since, being held at bay on the first day of the series, being checked under lights, at times searching a little hard for swing, at other times maybe straining for pace. \nBut now, let it be said, they're starting to click, in wickets and knots. The statistics tell a tale: Starc has 14 wickets at 18.7, Cummins and Hazlewood seven wickets each at 27.7 and 29.7 respectively. \nThe last day at Adelaide Oval dawned brightly for England, whose strength had hitherto been said to lie in their lower-middle echelons. In fact, the visitors lost seven for 64 in 147 deliveries - a testament to both lethality and parsimony. \nFor England, the conditions in Adelaide were meant to represent their greatest opportunity of the summer - pink ball, artificial illumination, benign weather. But what's sauce for the goose, eh? \nWhen Starc bowled the first over of England's reply, he wound the dial up on speed so effortlessly that it was almost like watching the main event after a curtain raiser. Jonny Bairstow was last man out, chopping Starc onto his stumps \nThe first ball of his first over was the fastest of the match, at 146kmh; then so was the last ball of his first over, breaking through 150kmh, and stirring a sonic boom of appreciation from the crowd, some of whom might have cast their mind back to four years earlier, when another Mitch was sustaining similar velocities. \nHow to deploy such resources? Skipper Smith is still learning. In Adelaide it coloured his captaincy. Scorning to enforce the follow-on was all about easing his precious pace bowlers' workloads and sparing them until after darkness's fall, even if his batsmen did not receive the memo, and lasted only 58 overs. \nSmith also remains surprisingly slow to post short catchers to leg, behind and in front of square. The trio did the job on the fifth day anyway, Hazlewood breaking the game open, Starc closing the game out, and Cummins excellent throughout. \nIn fact, for all that he has taken half as many series wickets as Starc and has played a fifth as many Tests as Hazlewood, it has been Cummins who has really impressed this summer, with spells of unremitting economy, allowing fewer than 2.5 an over in his auxiliary role, and unflagging speed, routinely clocking in the high 140s. \nWhen he hit tailender Craig Overton on the last day, it seemed for a moment like the ball would have to be pulled out from between the young Englishman's ribs. Cummins rattled England debutant Craig Overton on the rib cage \nAbove all, Cummins has demonstrated a striking maturity for a player who has played only 10 first-class matches other than his seven Tests. He understands game moments. As Australia zeroed in on victory on Wednesday, for example, he concluded an over to Jonny Bairstow with a bouncer so that Starc could have his chance at Stuart Broad, gratefully accepted. \nHe contributes above and beyond: his partnerships of 66 with Smith in Brisbane and of 99 with Marsh in Adelaide have been integral to Australia's building first-innings scores beyond their rivals. Having been a showcase for Australia's strength and conditioning capacities over the preceding five years, Cummins has this year proven a fine advertisement for its high-performance group, its coaches and selectors. \nWhat is really making the configuration work, however, is Nathan Lyon, whose 109 overs have cost only 2.29 runs each, yielded 11 wickets at 22.7, but just as importantly afforded opportunities for the pace trio to regain their wind and to return refreshed. On a slow wicket in Brisbane, Lyon was a patient foil for his faster team-mates; in Adelaide, he showed hometown nous. \nLyon's English counterpart Moeen Ali, by contrast, has been able to get through 63 overs for two wickets, leaving Joe Root with no choice but to turn back to James Anderson again and again. Nathan Lyon has taken a leading 57 Test wickets in 2017 \nEngland will now surely be worried about Anderson's thirty-five-year-old physique, particularly if he wants to continue bowling round the wicket - which is how he strained his side and missed the last two and a half Ashes Tests of 2015. Were history to repeat itself in Perth, the Melbourne and Sydney Tests would be services in communal English rain prayer. \nAttacks cannot operate at one pace alone. Even in the summer of 1974-75, synonymous with the speed of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, more Australian overs were delivered by medium-pacer Max Walker and the slow bowlers Ashley Mallett and Terry Jenner, while part-timers Doug Walters and Ian Chappell provided in excess of 100 deliveries per Test. \nIt is one thing to have a hot attack; quite another to make it work. Assuming it's possible to live up to hype, it can surely never happen without help. \nGideon Haigh will be writing for Sky Sports throughout the Ashes series.

Let me rephrase, I love good tattoos. I have a few myself. I think that they are a great expression of the person. I don\u2019t however like the classic spider web on the face, or the badly drawn anchor with \u2018MUM\u2019 scrawled underneath it. For me, my tattoos are personal, therefore there are only a few that can be seen day to day, and they are in fairly discreet places, but I do love to see good artwork which people have chosen to adorn themselves with \u2013 it can be so eye catching and telling about the person you are viewing.\nRockwell\u2019s picture is a cheeky look in to the tattoo culture of the service men of the time. Painted in 1944, this appeared as the cover of \u201cThe Saturday Evening Post\u201d, and had alternative titles of \u2018Only Skin Deep\u2019 or \u2018The Tattooist\u2019.\nRockwell\u2019s humour shines through in this painting with the sailor getting his latest loves name tattooed on his arm. Lucky Betty to be at the end of that long list, but it does beg a couple of questions, such as, what happened to the others? and why was such a large gap left on the sailors are when the rest is already covered in tattoos? Regardless, Betty\u2019s name has made it to the prestigious place of the sailors bicep.\nRockwell presented his views with the notion that tattoos are permanent, but the feelings that invoked getting the tattoo at that time are not, juxtaposing the two elements to create a timelessness of decision over the moment of feeling.\nThe pose of the tattoo artist and the sailor, draws the eye to where the work on the bicep is taking place.\nRockwell continues the tattoo theme in to the background of the painting, showing some of the popular designs of the day. These designs are close to those of \u2018Sailor Jerry\u2019, which makes this a topical piece of art still as these designs are still very much in style.\nI love the nonchalant look on the sailors face as he gets tattooed in this piece, it\u2019s almost as if he is duty bound to get Betty\u2019s name tattooed on his arm, rather than it being an act of emotion, as he has very much moved past wearing his heart on his sleeve, where as now he just has his latest \u2018squeeze\u2019 on his arm.\nWhat do you think?

Alex Wong / Getty Images \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied   including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Stzrok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order.

View Research, Inc. The global angina pectoris market is collectively driven by demand for disease-modifying and targeted treatments, increased expenditure on healthcare and availability of effective treatment methods across the emerging markets.\n     (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160524/371361LOGO )\n\nAdditionally, the rising prevalence and incidence of angina pectoris is anticipated to fuel the market growth. Chronic stable angina pectoris has a prevalence of 2.0-4.0% in developed markets such as the U.S., the U.K., Germany , France , Italy , Spain and Japan . The prevalence of angina pectoris rises sharply with age in both genders, ranging from 2.0- 5.0% in men aged 45-54 to 10.0-20.0% in men aged 65-74, and from 0.1-1.0% in women aged 45-54 to 10.0-15.0% in women aged 65-74. The disease symptoms can be managed by following a healthy lifestyle.\nBrowse full research report with TOC on \" Angina Pectoris Drugs Market Analysis, By Therapeutic Class (Beta Blockers, Calcium Antagonists, Nitrates, Anticoagulants, ACE inhibitors, Ranolazine), By Major Markets , And Segment Forecasts, 2016 - 2022 \" at: https://www.grand v iewresearch.com/industry-analysis/angina-pectoris-market \nFurther Key Findings From the Report Suggest:  \nThe U.S. dominated this space by accounting for more than 33.0% of the market share in 2016 due to increasing incidence of cardiac disorders and presence of key manufacturers in the U.S. The angina pectoris drug market is commercially meaningful, however branded sales are in decline as generics dominate a larger portion of prescriptions. Though the market is fragmented, key players such as Sanofi, Gilead, AstraZeneca and Pfizer hold significant market positions Biosimilar development is emerging as a promising market opportunity in angina pectoris therapeutics. Multiple biosimilars have gained approvals in the U.S., European and Indian markets China offers strong opportunity for market expansion due to removal of price caps on all medicine categories, the ongoing Healthy China 2020 healthcare reform and supportive 12th Five-Year Plan measure, which targets biotechnology as the key development sector Changing regulatory scenario in the U.S. presents favorable environment for disruptive technologies in healthcare. In the EU, the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU No. 536/2014) will impact clinical trials of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products. Industry concerns regarding ROIs on novel therapies remains a challenge to drug development.

Short for Eximbay Coin , this venture focuses specifically on tourists traveling between Korea, Japan , and China , but has the potential to enhance tourism all over the world.\nEBCoin seeks to address the expensive obstacles that tourists currently face when shopping abroad. Chief among these is consumption taxes. In theory, tourists can recoup the costs of these taxes through refunds, but the complexity and high cost of the refund system means that most travelers regain, at most,  a fraction of the money they lost. Combined with the cost of exchanging currencies, this limits both the number of people who are willing to travel in the first place and the amount that those who do travel are willing to purchase.\nBy providing a decentralized platform for claiming tax refunds, EBCoin allows tourists to recoup most of the money they lose through consumption taxes. Releasing a new coin that can be exchanged for multiple other fiat and digital currencies, along with a decentralized exchange platform, further saves tourists money by reducing the cost of exchanging their money. These efforts should make it substantially easier for Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and other citizens to travel and shop across the globe.\nAddressing the Limits of Tax Refunds \nOne of the most important factors that affects how much tourists spend when visiting other countries is those countries' taxes. Consumption taxes often make up a large portion of national, provincial, and local government budgets. This is particularly true in European countries, where such taxes can account for upwards of 15 percent of the cost of retail goods. While consumption taxes are generally accepted as fair by citizens, who benefit directly from the services that they pay for, they are an unqualified loss to tourists. For this reason, many countries offer foreign visitors refunds on the consumption taxes they pay while in the country.\nWhile refunds have the potential to attract more tourists, in practice, they are of limited effectiveness. This is because the system for reimbursement is so difficult. To claim a refund, tourists must record their purchase histories and present them to customs authorities in airports and other designated locations. But because there are only so many of these locations, this tends to require waiting in long lines. Combined with the complexity of filling out the necessary paperwork and making sure that their refunds are the correct sizes, this leads many tourists not to bother to claim tax refunds. As a result, roughly USD $24 billion in refunds goes unclaimed.\nEven when tourists do claim their refunds, they often do not receive the full value that they deserve. The current system for processing refunds is highly expensive, consuming as much as 30 percent of the total value of tax reimbursements. This makes it less worthwhile for tourists to seek refunds in the first place.\nIn order to simplify refunds and lower administrative fees, EBCoin provides an app where tourists can enter all the relevant information on their own. Users must scan their passports and enter the information into the app; this confirms their identity and their country of citizenship. They can then scan the receipts from different items they buy during the trip, creating a reliable purchase history that can be used to calculate the total amount of consumption taxes they've paid. The platform uses this information to claim the user's refund, which it pays to them in its own digital currency.\nBecause the EBCoin platform is highly decentralized, there are no intermediaries who charge fees for processing refunds. There is also no need for users to stand in line at airports or go through a complicated process of recording and verifying their purchases. More users are thus likely to claim their rightful refunds, and in doing so, they will receive close to the total value of those refunds. This has the potential to put billions of dollars back in the pockets of tourists, giving them an incentive to travel more and make more purchases abroad.\nCurrency Exchange & the Eximbay Coin \nBesides allowing users to claim tax refunds, the EBCoin platform is releasing its own digital currency. These Eximbay coins (EBC) are backed by the Korean payment services firm KRP, which serves more than 6,000 businesses across Japan , China , Korea, and other parts of East and Southeast Asia . Many of these businesses are likely to begin accepting the coins for purchases, allowing tourists to use EBC rather than having to obtain the local currency. The EBCoin platform also allows users to exchange the coins for local currency, their home countries' money, or other national and digital currencies.\nAs with refund processing, EBCoin offers a decentralized means of exchanging its own and other currencies. This eliminates intermediary fees and other currency exchange charges, lowering the cost of traveling and shopping abroad. Releasing its own currency also provides EBCoin users a standard against which to measure the value of other currencies, making it easier for them to make sure they are getting a good deal on exchanges.\nEBCoin plans to create 1.5 billion of these coins, exactly half of which will be issued to the public through token sales. The platform will release 150 million of these coins during a pre-sale in December of 2017, and will then distribute 375 million during an ICO in January of 2018. The coins will initially be pegged at a value of 6,000 EBC for one ETH. This value will likely change as the platform grows in popularity and demand for Eximbay coins increases.\n \nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/taking-care-of-tourists-ebcoin-aims-to-enhance-international-shopping-300567673.html \nSOURCE EBCoin\nRelated Links \nhttp://ebcoin.io/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ebc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:16.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b3bf6e300fe0c857780c652b9f595fa2c571b4b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqb2fOxsoDj4KOC6wnpYD0ivz9vVVgMUm1hBUYauHWE0bOzDoqlNkEx0PA19wzy.qdsXKlJJuHYJY60_ofgKTNk0O2m3w0s6_m8PjceF5mC7f09xCJWIYmz", "site_full": "bostonherald.com", "site": "bostonherald.com", "site_section": "http://bostonherald.com/news/us_politics", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "U.S. Politics | Boston Herald", "title": "Elizabeth Warren calls on Al Franken to resign", "title_full": "Elizabeth Warren calls on Al Franken to resign | Boston Herald", "published": "2017-12-07T05:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 55, "participants_count": 37, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "http://www.bostonherald.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/media/2017/12/04/120417warrennl04.jpg?itok=71tk-BVJ", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8876, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ac8684df4a89bdc9dd5bd685c7b61c26f687c24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqb2fOxsoDj4KOC6wnpYD0ivz9vVVgMUm1hBUYauHWE0bOzDoqlNkEx0PA19wzy.qdsXKlJJuHYJY60_ofgKTNk0O2m3w0s6_m8PjceF5mC7dvTto3dClnkUspvC35BJMc-", "ord_in_thread": 38, "author": "Paula Gockel", "published": "2017-12-07T02:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "For some odd reason my husband's comments are being posted under my name...how can that be removed?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:16.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b3bf6e300fe0c857780c652b9f595fa2c571b4b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqb2fOxsoDj4KOC6wnpYD0ivz9vVVgMUm1hBUYauHWE0bOzDoqlNkEx0PA19wzy.qdsXKlJJuHYJY60_ofgKTNk0O2m3w0s6_m8PjceF5mC7f09xCJWIYmz", "site_full": "bostonherald.com", "site": "bostonherald.com", "site_section": "http://bostonherald.com/news/us_politics", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "U.S. Politics | Boston Herald", "title": "Elizabeth Warren calls on Al Franken to resign", "title_full": "Elizabeth Warren calls on Al Franken to resign | Boston Herald", "published": "2017-12-07T05:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 55, "participants_count": 37, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "http://www.bostonherald.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/media/2017/12/04/120417warrennl04.jpg?itok=71tk-BVJ", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8876, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8e2540689a645472daa0cf08cb1584815aeefd7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqb2fOxsoDj4KOC6wnpYD0ivz9vVVgMUm1hBUYauHWE0bOzDoqlNkEx0PA19wzy.qdsXKlJJuHYJY60_ofgKTNk0O2m3w0s6_m8PjceF5mC7dvTto3dClnkNmPRIQ1t1RU-", "ord_in_thread": 49, "author": "Jordan Lewis Ring", "published": "2017-12-07T04:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "FORGIVE ME....I SEE HER FACE AND WANT TO VOMIT....HOW THE HELL DO WE AS AMERICAS 'THE LAND WHERE OUR FATHERS DIED'....PERMIT THIS FRAUD INDIAN IN THE SENATE?
