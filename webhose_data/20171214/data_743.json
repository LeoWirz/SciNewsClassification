I made a new stock and decided to have the pancake cheek piece found on the '48 period Super Grade. It was pointed out to me that the standard grade did not have such a scope cheek piece till later in the 50's and was not true to the restoration. None the less, since I had already formed it and was in the process of fitting it to the barrel and receiver, I went ahead and finished it.\nThough I had planned on re-blueing it, after considering the forum advice on leaving the blueing on the rifle as-is and not do a re-blue, I decided to leave it as it was. All things considered, it worked out pretty well.\nThe result was very satisfying and if I do say so, not a bad job. So much so that I'm paranoid now about taking out and shooting lest I somehow damage untold months of work.\nSo, I thought I'd ask the experts if you know of a drop-in stock for a transition model 70? I checked with boyd's and they have a pre-war II stock but cannot be sure it would fit a '48 transition. I thought I'd poll you all to see if anyone has found a composite or artificial material stock that was a drop in for a transition model with the dolls head tang?\nI'd like for a drop in 'cause I've already got two major projects I'm 30% into and I need another fit and finish job like rocks in my head.\nAdvice and wisdom is appreciated.\nKen\nCMG 300 BP\n#12447273 - Yesterday at 02:09 PM Re: Restored 1948 Transition Model 70 [ Re: TCRken ] Joined: Jan 2013\nPosts: 551 GuideGun\nCampfire Regular GuideGun\nCampfire Regular\nJoined: Jan 2013\nPosts: 551\nMaine Keep your eye on Ebay, maybe Gunbroker as well.\n-Matt\n\"The proof of the whisky is in the drinking, the proof of the rifle is in the shooting.\"\n#12447417 - Yesterday at 03:04 PM Re: Restored 1948 Transition Model 70 [ Re: TCRken ] Joined: Jan 2015\nPosts: 20 aggiecubpilot\nMember aggiecubpilot\nMember\nJoined: Jan 2015\nPosts: 20 I should probably be beaten for doing so, but my go-to \u2018ol reliable deer gun is a 47 transition super grade I bought at a show in very worn condition.

The gap around the tang was filled with bedding compound and blended to the rest of the stock.

Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic and belongs to the group of anti-cancer medication known as antineoplastic and is made from the natural product produced by bacterium Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius. It is used for the treatment of different types of cancer including breast, stomach, ovary, bone, testicles, bladder, lung, soft tissue, osteogenic sarcoma, Wilms\u2019 tumor, and Hodgkin\u2019s and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas. It is also used less commonly in the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Vagina and cervix, refractory multiple myeloma, and neuroblastoma. Doxorubicin inhibits and or slows the rate of proliferation of cancerous cells by intercalating between the base pairs in the DNA helix, thereby preventing DNA replication and inhibiting protein synthesis. This medication is available in injection solution and lyophilized powder form and is administered intravenously either through peripheral inserted central line catheters (PICC) or central venous catheters (CVC). The dosage of this medication depends on the type and severity of cancer, and type of other medication used during treatments and is most commonly scheduled at 21 days of every dosage. \nReport Overview and TOC @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/doxorubicin-market.html \nThe global doxorubicin market is anticipated to expand at a higher growth rate owing to increasing prevalence of cancer patients worldwide. According to the WHO, cancer is the leading cause of death globally, accounting 8.8 million deaths in 2015. The number of new cases is expected to increase by 70% in the next two decades. The global market for this drug is also expected to be driven by increasing use in the treatment of HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma. HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma has markedly increased in countries in Africa and the West in the last two decades. On the other hand, doxorubicin medication can cause life threatening conditions such as heart failure during therapy or sometimes after months or years after treatment. Additionally, it can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and reddish urine after one to two days of treatment. These side effects, specifically cardio toxicity, imposes a limitation on the use of doxorubicin and creates an opportunity for development of lipid based (liposome) formulations with improved therapeutic index of conventional doxorubicin. \nRequest brochure @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag\u2026 \nThe global doxorubicin drug market has been segmented based on drug formulation, type of cancer, distribution channel, and region.

Long Trade \nGo long following a bullish price action reversal on the H1 time frame immediately upon the next touch of 1.1774. \nPlace the stop loss 1 pip below the local swing low. \nMove the stop loss to break even once the trade is 20 pips in profit. \nRemove 50% of the position as profit when the price reaches 20 pips in profit and leave the remainder of the position to run. Short Trade \nGo short following a bearish price action reversal on the H1 time frame immediately upon the next touch of 1.1848. \nPlace the stop loss 1 pip above the local swing high. \nMove the stop loss to break even once the trade is 20 pips in profit. \nRemove 50% of the position as profit when the price reaches 20 pips in profit and leave the remainder of the position to run. \nThe best method to identify a classic \u201cprice action reversal\u201d is for an hourly candle to close, such as a pin bar, a doji, an outside or even just an engulfing candle with a higher close. You can exploit these levels or zones by watching the price action that occurs at the given levels. EUR/USD Analysis \nI wrote yesterday that this the pair is now in a medium-term bearish trend, with no long-term trend in the price at all. This situation has continued and even accelerated, with the price being held down over the short-term by a steeper bearish trend line shown in the chart below. It looks increasingly likely that the nearest support level at 1.1774 is going to be tested. This will probably give some amount of bullish bounce as it is confluent with the key lower channel trend line. \nThere is nothing important due today concerning the EUR. Regarding the USD, there will be a release of Unemployment Claims data at 1:30pm London time.

Michael was extremely helpful over the sales period and continued to show us a high level of customer service. Once we moved into the admin side of things we were appointed Jessica Thurlow as our CRC. Jessica is very attentive and is always happy to answer any questions we may have or provide any documents we need.

She continues to provide a high level of service and we look forward to working with her for the remainder of our builder. We are now beginning the lock up stage and so far we have been impressed with the quality of work as well as the timely manner of things being completed.

Our CRC Maria Lozano is wonderful lady who keep us updated with each and everything time to time and also answering our heaps of questions and amending plans of our dream house to our demand without any annoyance. Our Gallery appointment was enjoyable with lovely ladies Rita, Kelly and Jaz who helped us in whole selection of colour scheme, flooring and lightnings.

When it all cleared, Donner opened his eyes to see Warlock standing beside Dasher, he wolf yelping as it ran back into the forest. \nSick with worry, Donner leapt quickly forward towards his two friends, stumbling once or twice in the snow as he went. \u201cDasher!\u201d He cried, whinnying nervously. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d \nDasher was breathing heavily, steam rising off his sides because of the heat. He snorted tiredly in reply. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d \n\u201cWe need to get out of this forest,\u201d Warlock muttered, thankful that Dasher hadn\u2019t gotten hurt. It was clear that the wolves were ravenous, and a flighty reindeer, a reindeer who\u2019d gotten himself stuck in a tree previously and a magically drained unicorn would be easy picking. \nDonner and Dasher both nodded eagerly in agreement, the three continuing through the woods. The scent of fire, wolf and sweat still lingered in Warlock\u2019s nostrils, a combination of scents that made him uncomfortable. \nExhausted of his magic, Warlock didn\u2019t know which way they were going. If they kept walking, they should reach the edge of the forest at some point, but Warlock was scared of what danger they might face if they wandered deeper into the woods. He didn\u2019t want another run in with those wolves, and by the way Dasher was glancing around nervously for any sight of those golden eyes, he didn\u2019t either. \nDonner looked tired, icy blue eyes weary in the darkness. Warlock was beginning to feel tired himself, and knew that if he hadn\u2019t found these two reindeer he\u2019d be fast asleep in a little hollow somewhere, safe, but these two would be wolf fodder. He\u2019d much rather save the lives of two young, mysterious and confusing reindeer unicorn creatures than get a full night\u2019s rest. \nAnd so they plodded on. Warlock\u2019s legs felt like they were made out of lead, heavy and limp with the snow dragging them down further. The two reindeer seemed to have a bit more agility in the snow, lucky for them. \nIt was about an hour later when Warlock saw the edge of the forest up ahead, and the snowy, grassy plain he knew in front. He gave a happy whinny of joy at seeing the area, charging forward. The two reindeer neighed joyously as well, plunging after their unicorn friend and out of the trees. \nThe plain was a beautiful place at night. The moon hung high in the sky, shining brightly when not obscured by the grey clouds that drifted across, sprinkling the ground with snow as they went. The sky was a darkened blue, stars scattered across it like glitter, the light of the moon illuminating the space. It was empty apart from the three steeds, no signs of other life at all. \nThe once grassy plain was a place Warlock knew well. Herds dwelled here often for its sweet grass and open space, herds which Warlock would sometimes converse with on his travels. He knew most of the good hiding spots and ones that would be safe for the night. \nThe side of a mountain bordered the plain, the base of it surrounded by bushes and other undergrowth. Warlock knew that there was a small cavern there that should be safe to shelter in for the night. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a cavern in those bushes over there, we can stay there,\u201d Warlock explained to his tired friends, who gave nods of happiness at the thought of being able to finally rest. \nTogether they journeyed over, taking it slower this time. When they finally got there, Warlock lit a flame to guide their way into the otherwise empty tunnel. \nIt was cold, but enclosed and had a roof. The floor was made out of a damp limestone, their hooves clopping on it as they entered. Warlock had to duck his head slightly to avoid clipping his horn on the roof. \nThe two reindeer collapsed as soon as they were inside, huddled up against each other for warmth. Donner looked over to Warlock, nickering and tossing his head in an invitation. Warlock lay down beside them, thankful for their warmth. \nIt wasn\u2019t long before exhaustion crept over the three, and they drifted off into a deep sleep.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warlock", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "warlock", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:40.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "efb1bef4804632e1de7e55ab88551134ad086d76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZiiNf9GYOe1c5bH1WKRVZoH2wEXGi2aAkX", "site_full": "www.beyondblue.org.au", "site": "beyondblue.org.au", "site_section": "http://www.beyondblue.org.au/connect-with-others/online-forums/long-term-support-over-the-journey", "site_categories": ["health", "panic_anxiety_disorders", "depression"], "section_title": "Long term support over the journey ", "title": "relationship breakup", "title_full": "relationship breakup", "published": "2017-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.beyondblue.org.au/App_Themes/standard/images/BB_FB_logo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "80859e05cf31ec3b6321ce1aaa42c5ecbf78d670", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZiiNf9GYOe1c5bH1WKRVZoHyyWXeK1w33tCwLoLAqMwbhJOSWcbhav2sa3TqkCvLJg", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "randomx", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hi simon n monkey.\nI must admit last time l dropped in l wondered how you were coping seeing someone else i your state.mate.

He is def snakebit at MC.\nI'm not the type to give up but at 10-4 there's a lot of writing on the wall and fat ladies clearing their throats and curtains about to drop, I do believe.\nWe have all played in league or tourneys and got beatdowns from opponents who played extremely well and to them we should tip our hats but when we are given many opptys and we give a really poor account of ourselves it makes losing triple frustrating.\nShane's 91 yo grandpa, Gary Bloomberg, came down to give him an attaboy when he went up 4-1 on Jayson.
