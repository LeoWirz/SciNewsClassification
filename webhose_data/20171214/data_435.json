All Rights Reserved. Follow Story 'Little Angels': Asheboro Conjoined Twins Pass Away ASHEBORO, N.C. -- It's the hardest decision Grayson and Candice McNeill had to make. Author: Erica Stapleton Published: 10:45 PM EST December 5, 2017 \nASHEBORO, N.C. -- It's the hardest decision Grayson and Candice McNeill had to make. \n\"They were perfect, they were beautiful,\" says Candice. \nHer babies, Emily and Sophie, were born conjoined twins. They each had their own heart, spine and head but they shared a body. An unimaginable pregnancy, but a miracle nonetheless. \n\"They'd always grab on to your inner index and hold your finger very tight,\" Candice tells. \nThe McNeill's say they found out they were going to have conjoined twins 15 weeks into the pregnancy. When asked if they wanted to terminate the pregnancy, they said it wasn't an option. \n\"We knew from the beginning it was right to give them the chance at life.\" \nThe twins were born on October 26, 2017 at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where Candice and Grayson had to go for specialized care. \nCandice stayed in Ohio for 70 days, staying at the Ronald McDonald House and spending time in the NICU whenever she could with her daughters. \n\"It was hard because at the NICU you had to sign in to see your baby, you had to get permission if you wanted to hold your baby,\" Candice explains. \nGrayson went back and forth tending to their house and their three other girls at home in Asheboro. The twins had complications from the beginning. There were problems with breathing and organs not working. \n\"Sometimes bad things happen to good people and that's okay,\" says Grayson. \"The Lord never removes suffering but he always takes us through it.\" \nThey hit a point where their girls weren't going to get better. Their options were wait for them to suffer cardiac arrest or take them off life-support. \n\"To me it wasn't even choice,\" Candice explains. \"You did the best for your children because you love them.\" \n\"We just decided this is enough, they're not going to make it,\" Grayson adds. \"We prayed together and made the decision to take the vents out. It was definitely the hardest thing I've ever done.\" \nAfter 5 weeks and 3 days with Emily and Sophie, they let go. \n\"This was the first death I experienced and it was my own children and it was beautiful.\" \nSome solace after weeks of dread, wondering what could happen, what could go wrong. They came to terms there was a bigger plan for their babies. \n\"Two beautiful little angels that were borrowed to us for a certain time. They were just like little angels, they really were.\" \nCommunities in both Asheboro and Ohio helped the family during their entire journey. Several fundraisers were held for the family. There was even a donated Christmas tree ready for them when they came home from the hospital Monday. \n\"When things like this happen, bills keep coming,\" Grayson tells. \"Life goes on and through people giving we didn't have to worry about anything.\" \nThe family will be holding services for Emily and Sophie Friday, December 8, 2017. Services will be held at Bailey's Grove Baptist Church in Asheboro. Visitation will be from 9:30-10:45 in the morning, with a service starting at 11 a.m. Copyright 2017 WFMY ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "emily", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sophie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "candice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcneill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erica stapleton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "candice mcneill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grayson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "asheboro conjoined twins pass awa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "asheboro conjoined twins", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ronald mcdonald house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "asheboro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bailey's grove baptist church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cincinnati children's hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asheboro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.c.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:09.050+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "854109291fc4bd5a54bf4cf9857827b486980817", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pCoxWmXjUMLkEBeRZjJ7B6g2qCtbGFdJ8", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/gif/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/gif/ - Adult GIF - 4chan", "title": "stockings or knee socks", "title_full": "/gif/ - stockings or knee socks - Adult GIF - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T02:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 26, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.161, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5faedb95f0c75b0f89c731e73ae7b917d0b155c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pCoxWmXjUMLkEBeRZjJ7B6mojgu8TBlMUOWlqr92qMmo-", "ord_in_thread": 25, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>11745610\nI ask the same question about elbow-length gloves.\nI wish I knew the answer.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:09.053+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6848397bdbf5edbe6d2268ab635dc9b95d1628f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRUS4ohrDQOjlmntXgyuXjM9hCRzJkrY4HF9VykkxXv5y2Hx61jnlc32.8Ve6ifmsfG0U3ybZNXA7U0o1YspHQW_eVuM9b5lInMsehmSR_NL4NY3CJxNTivz5Bz8oE2xRVZ5gmax0WScko5pRwlkfIY", "site_full": "studydaddy.com", "site": "studydaddy.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["education", "studying_business"], "section_title": "", "title": "a car cost $22,565.00 including the 7% sales tax.

Faces Wildfires The Day After Taking Office By editor \u2022 12 hours ago Listen Originally published on December 6, 2017 6:56 pm   \nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: \nWe've been tracking this massive wildfire in Ventura, Calif., which has consumed more than 50,000 acres - thousands of homes. At one point, the flames came within blocks of Ventura City Hall, which is where Neal Andrews just got a new office. He was sworn in as the new mayor of Ventura just about three hours after the fire broke out on Monday night. And he is on the line now from Ventura. Hi, Mayor Andrews. \nNEAL ANDREWS: Hello. \nKELLY: What a week you are having. \nANDREWS: (Laughter) Yes, it was just remarkable. I got sworn in. As I walked out of City Hall, all the lights of the city went out. And that was the first indication that we had a real crisis happening. \nKELLY: Did you know that there was a fire at all. I mean, did you know what was causing it? \nANDREWS: I was aware that there was a fire. We were under the impression it was far east of us and that it was only about 2,000 acres. But it just - the flames were driven by the wind. The flames and smoke was horizontal. And it was just amazing the speed with which that fire spread. \nKELLY: Can you smell it? Can you see it where you are now? \nANDREWS: At this point, no. On Monday night as I went home, and I could see the red glow. And next thing I know, I looked out the window, and literally the flames were coming across the ridge right down towards my house. \nKELLY: You've had to evacuate your house since. Is that right? \nANDREWS: I did. I have not been able to get back since. \nKELLY: Now where are we speaking to you from right now? \nANDREWS: You're speaking to me from the emergency operations center. We actually literally have kind of a mini city hall set up here. All of the emergency services that we need are here running the operations that are necessary to deal with this crisis. \nKELLY: And what is the current situation? How close are the flames? How quickly is it continuing to spread from what you can see? \nANDREWS: Well, we've lost 150 to 200 structures at a minimum. But we know it's an underestimate. We know that one whole community, in the hillsides, has not really been countered effectively. And it could be as high as 250 more houses up there. And we don't know exactly how they're counting these structures. For example, we had a 74-unit apartment building that burned to the ground. Do we call that 74 living structures? Or do we call that one structure? We're still working on things like that. \nKELLY: Thousands of people have evacuated. Where are you sending them? \nANDREWS: Well, we have several sites that we're sending them to. Principally, our main site is at the Ventura County fairgrounds. And two neighboring cities have shelters open. And we still have room for more evacuees if we need it. \nKELLY: Well, Mayor Andrews, we wish you luck. Before I let you go, what happened to your house? \nANDREWS: Well, as far as I know, it's still there. The thing about it is the wind drives the embers and so forth. They can skip from one house a couple of blocks to the next house and skip over houses and stuff like that. So we just have to keep our fingers crossed. \nKELLY: Well, Mayer Andrews, we wish you luck.

Her intervention in this school with the provision of a block of six classrooms, five toilets, 24 fans complimented by the supply of 150 dual students\u2019 furniture and six sets of teachers\u2019 furniture speaks volume about her passion for the development of education and production of skilled manpower to help the growth of the economy of Lagos State and Nigeria,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Deputy Governor, who was represented by Mrs. Adebunmi Adekoya, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education, said that the state government was committed to providing new structures and rehabilitating existing ones across educational institutions in the state to ensure that quality education is accessible to all students irrespective of their locations.\n\nIn his remarks, the Corporate Affairs Adviser of Nigerian Breweries Plc, Kufre Ekanem said that the donation was a demonstration of its unwavering commitment to the developmental aspirations of the people of Lagos State. He also explained that the company\u2019s interests in the state and Nigeria goes beyond doing business and making profits to adding value and touching lives in critical sectors of the economy.\n\n\u201cAs a responsible corporate citizen, our interest in Lagos State and Nigeria goes beyond the pursuit of business or profit. We believe that the right investment in the education of our children will secure a bright future for our nation. And in line with our corporate philosophy of Winning with Nigeria, we are resolutely committed to this going into the future,\u201d he stated.\n\nEkanem further urged the school authority and students to use the facility to the good and progress of the state and Nigeria.\n\nThe latest donation adds to the increasing number of schools that have benefitted from similar projects in Lagos State under the Nigerian Breweries-Felix Ohiwerei Education Trust Fund. These include Obele Primary School, Surulere; Okesuna High School, Lagos Island; and Igbobi College, Yaba. Others are: Adisa Bashua Primary School, Dedeke Memorial Girls Primary School and Randle Avenue Primary School in Surulere.\n\nOther guests at the commissioning included Chief (Mrs.) Adedoja Otedola, widow of former Lagos State Governor, Sir Michael Otedola; Mr. Adeniyi Saliu, Executive Chairman of Eredo Local Council Development Area; and Mr. Adebayo Ibiyeye, Director of Science and Technology at the state Ministry of Education.\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "adebayo ibiyeye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idiat oluranti adebule", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adedoja otedola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adebunmi adekoya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kufre ekanem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael otedola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adeniyi saliu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lagos state government", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "breweries plc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lagos govt commends nigerian breweries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eredo local council development area", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corporate affairs adviser of nigerian breweries plc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "igbobi college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obele primary school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dedeke memorial girls primary school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of education", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "science and technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "breweries-felix ohiwerei education trust fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adisa bashua primary school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "okesuna high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. patrick grammar school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "randle avenue primary school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lagos state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surulere", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lagos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lagos island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yaba", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:13.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "94aee8341bcf52d2cce7b756c94580fcf079447a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqAY0p_pThMNXYjTfiRMt4Wa_4D_DSKPLtU9Ci03CvQcmKT4Fogr_lPraxrtvm1sE2bkR9a2JFAg--", "site_full": "www.avforums.com", "site": "avforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.avforums.com/forums/sky-digital-tv-forum.547/", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Sky Digital TV Forum | AVForums", "title": "Question - Should upgrade to Q ?", "title_full": "Question - Should upgrade to Q ?

"Important news for the heavy lifting sector Video: Ninian Southern platform: Full evacuation ordered ahead of dangerous storm \nFollowing earlier reports that CNR International would evacuate around 70 workers from its Ninian Southern platform ahead of the Storm Caroline, this has now turned into a full evacuation. \n7 Dec. 2017 \nThe company had early on Wednesday said it would leave around 90 people aboard the offshore unit, however, in an afternoon update it said that due to an adverse weather forecast during the coming days, \u201ca down-man of personnel from its Ninian Southern platform continues.\u201d \n\u201cThis is in accordance with existing procedures developed to safely manage the structural integrity of the Ninian Southern jacket, in conjunction with support from industry specialist consultants.\u201d \nCNR International has been carrying out remedial work on the platform\u2019s jacket structure through the summer after a defect was identified during routine monitoring and inspection, and assurance activities are currently ongoing to confirm their effectiveness. \n\u201cIn order to ensure the safety of all personnel on board, as storm conditions are forecast for the coming days, the company has taken the proactive decision to shut down production this morning and fully down-man Ninian Southern today as a precaution,\u201d CNR International said in its update on Wednesday afternoon. \nNinian Southern is located 240 miles from Aberdeen in the northern North Sea. There were 54 personnel remaining on board the installation at the time of the release of CNR International\u2019s last update. \n90mph gusts expected \nAs previously reported, a developing area of low-pressure, which will bring gales to parts of northern and western Scotland on Thursday morning, has been named as Storm Caroline. \nA Met Office Amber National Severe Weather Warning for wind has been issued for the far north of Scotland with gusts widely expected of around 70-80mph and 90mph in more exposed areas. \nMeanwhile a Yellow warning has also been issued for wind covering parts of central and southern Scotland and the extreme north of Northern Ireland with wind gusts of 60-70mph expected quite widely across the warning area and up to 80mph in the more exposed north-facing coastal locations. \nThe warnings area which extends from 8am on Thursday until midnight includes most of the Western Isles, the Northern Isles and the majority of mainland Scotland from Oban to Aberdeen. \nWatch the video below: \nMet Office Chief Meteorologist Steve Ramsdale said: \u201cThe strongest winds will reach the northwest of Scotland early on Thursday, extending to northeast Scotland and the Northern Isles in the afternoon. During Thursday winds will start to ease in the west with the strongest of the winds becoming confined to the Northern Isles in the evening.\u201d Read More Liked this post?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve ramsdale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caroline", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "met office amber national severe weather warning", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnr international", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "storm caroline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ninian southern", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "northern isles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western isles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:15.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ee51bc68c51cd5a78b208236827c22fc567e2db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUUC4XTyMkcesIPeThDqTe6fQz4WqtlAzPPA3fgy4HkWkmSRpE74vHLoEKevMNfDAvBRf0LjNT5wAh1Uw20NfkrJ90YLTTHFEa5IIve9rZTG", "site_full": "www.expedia.com", "site": "expedia.com", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com/Neptune-Beach-Hotels.d8913.Travel-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Top 10 Neptune Beach, FL Hotels $97 | Hotel Deals on Expedia", "title": "One Ocean Resort & Spa:", "title_full": "One Ocean Resort & Spa: 2017 Room Prices, Deals & Reviews | Expedia", "published": "2017-08-27T01:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 416, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7090891db1894ee4d620a5dd9aa12dec5c74168b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUUC4XTyMkcesIPeThDqTe6fQz4WqtlAzPPA3fgy4HkWkmSRpE74vHLoEKevMNfDAvBRf0LjNT5wAh1Uw20NfkrJ90YLTTHFESeFNb5j3gP97YHHDBz3L13u2EKJWGcTCEYZswmjnYSB", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-07T09:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "From the quick check in with Catherine Ann to the room visit with Tyler we could not have felt more welcome .

The bag itself and personal papers were found strewn across Tunstall Lane. \nThe victim of the next burglary, on June 24 in Preston Road, was alerted when another stolen card had been used to spend \u00a3164 on gambling website 888, as well as a string of shop purchases. \nA resident of Mount Crescent, in Orrell, received a similar notification from the Halifax after a break-in on July 7. \nSeveral frauds were also carried out via a number of online gambling sites, including Pocket Win Casino, MFortune Casino and In Touch Games. \nThis all stemmed from a burglary in Poolstock Lane, which saw a handbag taken from the kitchen area. The total losses amounted to \u00a3360. \nPolice issued an appeal for Simpson\u2019s whereabouts in July, prior to his arrest. \nSimpson, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to burglary, fraud by false representation and handling stolen goods offences and was sentenced at Bolton Crown Court.
