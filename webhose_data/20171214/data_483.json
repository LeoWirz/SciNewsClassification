Armed with four years\u2019\u00adexperience working for PepsiCo on its Super Bowl halftime shows, Kim McConnie took over the Twenty20 competitions two months ago and wants to amp up Australia\u2019s shortest form of cricket. Leading into Saturday\u2019s opening round, where four games will be played across the weekend at North Sydney Oval, and two in Adelaide, McConnie declared she wants to make the Women\u2019s Big Bash League the best women\u2019s sport in the world. She said off-field entertainment was firmly in her sights. \u201cSport and entertainment are merging, and that\u2019s what people want,\u201d McConnie said. \u201c(You\u2019re) wanting to make sure that when they pay money to come to your event, you really are keeping them glued to their seat. Part of that is great competition, and I think we\u2019re delivering that. media_camera Big Bash chief Kim McConnie says entertainment has a big role to play in Australia\u2019s T20 leagues. Picture: Jay Town \u201cAnother part of that is making sure you\u2019re keeping them entertained when the cricketers aren\u2019t out there, and that I think has huge head room. I\u2019m not sure about this year, these type of things take a while in the planning, but I\u2019d love to see some musical acts be integrated more. \u201cI\u2019d love to see a different type of entertainment be built more into the WBBL. We were talking about maybe it\u2019s even movies or TV shows, maybe previewing new episodes and making it more of an open-air cinema-type feel. It could be music, it could be movies, \u00adentertainment in other forms.\u201d McConnie said Cricket Australia would continue to explore Christmas Day Big Bash and expansion of the competition. \u201cI see Christmas Day as an opportunity for afternoon-evening (games),\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure when it\u2019ll happen ... but definitely one of the things I\u2019ve thought is Christmas Day is about celebrating with friends and family, and so is BBL, so I can see some \u00adnatural synergy to at some point, maybe play cricket on Christmas Day.\u201d media_camera The women\u2019s Big Bash can do with more exposure. Picture: Getty Images McConnie can see massive upside in the women\u2019s game and the potential to play more festival-style rounds similar to the opening weekend. \u201cOnly 30 per cent of Australians are actually aware that the WBBL exists,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the best women cricketers in the world playing in the WBBL. We need to make sure that more and more people are aware of it.\u201d Brisbane-born McConnie started her career as a sales rep for Smith\u2019s Snack Foods fresh out of university. She quickly rose up the corporate ranks to win a posting at PepsiCo\u2019s head office in New York as head of sports marketing. One of her most memorable experiences was working with Coldplay on the Super Bowl halftime show in 2016. McConnie is keen to use lessons learnt in the US to \u00adimprove the viewing experience for people at games and on the couch. \u201cThe T-shirt toss ... they \u00adactually amended that for TV through augmented reality, and people were able to experience the T-shirt toss from home,\u201d she said.

However, for Papadopoulos and the Roar the matter has dragged on.\nTwo days after the incident, the match review panel decided to refer the matter to an independent disciplinary and ethics committee.\nPapadopoulos faced the committee in Sydney last Friday and expected to discover the length of his ban at the end of the hearing.\nSPORT CONFIDENTIAL: Cahill\u2019s big payout to escape City\nACL: Roar schedule takes its toll\nmedia_camera The incident still hasn\u2019t been finalised. (AAP Image/Craig Golding)\nHowever, with the former Greek international receiving an automatic one-game for being shown a red card, the committee didn\u2019t feel the need to rush the decision and \u201creserved their determination\u201d.\nFootball Federation Australia and the Roar had expected the length of the ban to be decided on Monday, but the committee has failed to deliver.\nIt\u2019s understood that with committee chairman John Marshall having volunteered his time, other commitments have led to a delay in settling on the ban length.\nWhile the Roar knew Papadopoulos was not going to be available for Saturday\u2019s clash against Wellington Phoenix at Gold Coast venue Cbus Super Stadium due to the regulation punishment for spitting at a player being six weeks, both the club and player are unhappy about being left in limbo.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating for Avraam,\u201d Roar coach John Aloisi said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s disappointed, he\u2019s embarrassed (for) what he ended up doing, and he just wants to move on from that.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t move on when they haven\u2019t handed out the amount of games he\u2019s going to get.\n\u201cWe know that he made a mistake, but we\u2019ve got his back,\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great person, great player and he\u2019s got a future still here at this football club.\u201d\nmedia_camera Fahid Ben Khalfallah will be back to face Wellington. (AAP Image/Darren England)\nThe Roar\u2019s defensive stocks will again be stretched on Saturday, with centre-back Jade North set to miss another week with a groin injury.\nIt\u2019s likely that makeshift defender Jacob Pepper will again be paired with Daniel Bowles in the heart of Brisbane\u2019s backline.\nThe pair worked well together last Saturday in the Roar\u2019s 2-0 away win over Western Sydney Wanderers, with Bowles making a triumphant A-League return from a serious knee injury that had sidelined him since February.\nFit-again Fahid Ben Khalfallah was named in an extended Roar squad for Saturday\u2019s clash, but playmaker Brett Holman will miss another week with a calf injury.\nGold Coast-raised Nick D\u2019Agostino is hoping for another starting opportunity in the ongoing absence of Holman.\nFIFA set to assist FFA 1:35 Football: FIFA will be assisting the FFA rather than taking over control.\nDecember 7th 2017 5 FIFA set to assist FFA \u201cI haven\u2019t actually played at this stadium, so this will be my first time if I play and I\u2019m definitely looking forward to it,\u201d the 19-year-old D\u2019Agostino said.\n\u201cHopefully a lot of family will be here and hopefully I get some minutes.\nMeanwhile, FFA will announce next week whether they will aid the Roar\u2019s AFC Champions League campaign by postponing their January 27 A-League clash with Central Coast Mariners, currently scheduled just three days before a likely game in China against Tainjin Quanjin.\nShould the Roar survive their Champions League playoff campaign, they will be in Group E with Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors (South Korea), Kitchee SC (Hong Kong) and one other yet-to-be-determined opponent.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "avraam papadopoulos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "marco monteverde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "d\u2019agostino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bowles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "golding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel bowles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "papadopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john marshall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jade north", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt simon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacob pepper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tainjin quanjin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fahid ben khalfallah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick d\u2019agostino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brett holman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "brisbane roar", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sydney fc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ffa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central coast mariners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeonbuk hyundai motors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wellington phoenix at gold coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kitchee sc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western sydney wanderers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brisbane roar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "football federation australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wellington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:25.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4cdfabee588797a588d44ca29d0dff4300539de4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTaVuehfv1I7bzrCdTrj_8g8YZSrJCneM3AnwhJsD70MPibajacEgSZwGXn.Wv1FG3Gd8com0kweDZPEz5GbD9lY.lJu4hzia9a9rGXRhPeLpB07N9yyPdXX02oEhq911w-", "site_full": "www.cbsnews.com", "site": "cbsnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.cbsnews.com/feeds/rss/main.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Home -

The drugs you've been put on are beyond belief if the timetable is as it seems. First, wellbutrin isn't an anxiety remedy, it's for depression. It's the most stimulating of all antidepressants, not a good thing for anyone with anxiety as a first resort but particularly not for someone who got anxiety from taking speedy drugs. Then, you say you go stomach problems and instead of changing your diet and trying gentle remedies and relaxation techniques you got put on another drug that just makes things worse if you take it for a lengthy period of time and then, you got put on ibuprofen, which is very hard on the stomach! After that, your doctor told you it was okey dokey to just quit taking the wellbutrin when you should have tapered off of it and got put on the hardest of all the antidepressants to take and stop taking, Paxil, and then apparently were told it was fine to quit that abruptly despite virtually everyone who takes it suffers from bad withdrawal symptoms. You are in medical hell, and you have to get out of it. Again, if this timetable is accurate, you are suffering from being put on the wrong meds, withdrawal from being taken off of them contrary to protocol, and have a doctor who sounds completely incompetent. You badly need a psychpharmacologist to see if you can't get back to some kind of balance, and you absolutely must stop using recreational drugs -- you've made that option go away. And you're taking speedy ones to boot. You need a complete reboot and then you need to get into therapy with someone who specializes in anxiety who can teach you ways of perhaps controlling the fallout from your bad drug experience so you can get off this medication and drug merry-go-round.

We present the first study addressing molecular effects of fractional non-sequential ultrapulsed CO 2 laser treatment using a 3D skin model that allows standardized investigations of time-dependent molecular changes ex vivo. While histological examination was performed to assess morphological changes, we utilized gene expression profiling using microarray and qRT-PCR analyses to identify molecular effects of laser treatment. Irradiated models exhibited dose-dependent morphological changes resulting in an almost complete recovery of the epidermis 5 days after irradiation. On day 5 after laser injury with a laser fluence of 100 mJ/cm 2 , gene array analysis identified an upregulation of genes associated with tissue remodeling and wound healing (e.g., COL12A1 and FGF7), genes that are involved in the immune response (e.g., CXCL12 and CCL8) as well as members of the heat shock protein family (e.g., HSPB3). On the other hand, we detected a downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., MMP3), differentiation markers (e.g., LOR and S100A7), and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1\u03b1.\nOverall, our findings substantiate the understanding of time-dependent molecular changes after CO 2 laser treatment. The utilized 3D skin model system proved to be a reliable, accurate, and reproducible tool to explore the effects of various laser settings both on skin morphology and gene expression during wound healing.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2AzlrSw", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "co", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:26.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c82c9e2554a4da1af1fb97282b9245fd7485e4f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg831AWISPIMWJr06qEVFnLq87TXJCNvZzqNc0f1MUzwiNMnbnh3oOI9wGnET2Cm7aIHuq04Zl2X8jndk_XKw8GIGXUN.3Iy0exBfLN3vl4O6A--", "site_full": "www.baby-kingdom.com", "site": "baby-kingdom.com", "site_section": "http://www.baby-kingdom.com/forum.php?mod=forumdisplay&fid=297", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "\u99ac\u4f86\u897f\u4e9e\u5abd\u5abd\u6703 - Baby Kingdom - \u89aa\u5b50\u738b\u570b \u9999\u6e2f \u8a0e\u8ad6\u5340 ", "title": "\u99ac\u4f86\u897f\u4e9e\u5abd\u5abd\u5728\u9999\u6e2f\u63ee\u63ee\u624b", "title_full": "\u99ac\u4f86\u897f\u4e9e\u5abd\u5abd\u5728\u9999\u6e2f\u63ee\u63ee\u624b - \u99ac\u4f86\u897f\u4e9e\u5abd\u5abd\u6703 - Baby Kingdom - \u89aa\u5b50\u738b\u570b \u9999\u6e2f \u8a0e\u8ad6\u5340", "published": "2015-05-25T17:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "HK", "spam_score": 0.01, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15021, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a3be8dc8e3124435f1f4f701942bde9bf3cee081", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg831AWISPIMWJr06qEVFnLq87TXJCNvZzqNc0f1MUzwiNMnbnh3oOI9wGnET2Cm7aIHuq04Zl2X8jndk_XKw8GIGXUN.3Iy0exj8Mt1aWaSvANgfAtkAjBM", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "Harrods1009", "published": "2017-12-07T10:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hello, I'm From Kl", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:26.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "884337545e66da80b8a9bf819284f6913a736103", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pbFYoehwzvjAKh9uocSIbMA.iQ5kNlOB4", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/h/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/h/ - Hentai - 4chan", "title": ">Have you ever been caught watching hentai /h/?", "title_full": "/h/ - >Have you ever been caught watching hentai /h/?

The British singer-songwriter, who was announced as the most streamed artist on Spotify just days ago, has also topped Apple's list as the most listened-to artist in Australia on iTunes and Apple Music for 2017. Apple released its annual list of the most popular music in Australia for 2017 on Thursday and revealed that Sheeran's multi-platinum third record / (Divide) which he released in March, is its most listened-to album. He also had the top two songs of the year with Shape of You and Castle on the Hill, which both feature on that album. Taylor Swift made an impressive leap to third spot on the year's charts just a few weeks after the release of her sixth album, reputation. Local artists were a bit further down the list with Melbourne hip-hop artist Illy the first Australian entry on Apple's album charts at 22 with his record Two Degrees, while Peking Duk are the first local artists on the song charts at 19 with their song Stranger.

The Bible has and always will be nothing more than a description of how a person is suppose to act - not a group of people nor a government. For instance, the Ten Commandments are a set of laws on how one is suppose to act in order to be a Christian and not how you are suppose to FORCE someone to act.\nI posted this one another thread and this passage comes to mind when I think of the Far Right, Roy Moore and the so called evangelicals and this passage came about because one of Jesus' disciples asked Jesus which of the commandments was the greatest and Jesus answered him by saying to \"Love thy father with all thy heart and to love one another as I have loved you\" and for me, this is how a Christian should act. Not by condemning them or forcing them to switch to your religion, etc. but accept them as they are but at the same time, not becoming one of them. As an example of this, someone posted that God destroyed Gomorrah and yes, God did in fact destroy Gomorrah according to the Bible but Lot and his family escaped. Why? Because even though they were living in Gomorrah, they still followed God's laws. Did they try to force the other people in this city to change?

Throughout the life of a construction project, drone technology has not only made certain aspects easier to do and more economical, but it has also made them more accurate as well. Monetary advantages Among the many benefits of drone technology in the construction industry is their use for inspections. Drones are far more cost effective than using a manned aircraft. They can also complete their work in far less time than a human surveyor. Drones can also collect more data more often. All of this makes using drones easy to use in the progress of a construction project, especially when it comes to evaluating progress and costs. Precise assessments Drones have become the method of choice when it comes to evaluating the progress of most construction projects. Drone photography can be sent to engineers and those in other departments such as accounting to provide inspections during complicated construction projects. Drones eliminate the problem of scheduling an aircraft and a pilot. It can also get exceedingly close to an object. And not only can a drone carry a visual camera, but it can also carry an infrared camera if the need calls for it. All of this allows decision makers to evaluate problem spots and make any needed adjustments in a project. Numerous projects If you think that hiring an aircraft and a pilot can be difficult for one project, try doing the same thing for several construction sites. With a drone, however, these issues become a thing of the past. Not only that, but associated higher costs for insurance and other related matters become non-issues with drones. And on-site representatives don't need to be notified using a drone. Using this machine is much cheaper and more efficient than hiring an aircraft. Just make sure to use a qualified and experienced pilot to handle the machine. About the Author: If you are searching for information about drone photography , come to our web pages today.

The Labor leader has outmanoeuvred Turnbull on tactics for most of this year, leaving the PM trailing in his wake. But Shorten\u2019s political advantage came to a crash in the final week of Parliament. Camera Icon National Political Editor Sharri Markson. Picture: Supplied Astonishingly, the year ended with a reversal of \u00adfortunes. The PM\u2019s stocks are up. And Shorten\u2019s are down. Turnbull, who should have harboured concerns over the fate of his leadership just a fortnight ago, has resuscitated his authority. This week, he showed renewed vigour and an energised command over his team. Even his darkest rivals thumped their desks and cheered along with Turnbull as he slayed Shorten in Question Time over his deception on dual citizenship. Rival leadership aspirants have, for now at least, packed away their knives. Unless the government suffers a defeat in Bennelong, Turnbull is no longer heading into a summer of discontent and trepidation. The turnaround is not due to one singular factor. It\u2019s the size of Barnaby Joyce\u2019s victory in New Eng\u00adland, with a sizeable near-12 per cent swing towards him.

It\u2019s the improved standing in Newspoll (bearing in mind the result would still be a crushing electoral loss). It\u2019s knocking down the rogue \u00adNationals. It\u2019s last night finally legislating gay marriage and \u00adremoving it as a divisive issue in the thorn of the government\u2019s side. It\u2019s being on the front-foot attacking senator Sam Dastyari\u2019s links to Chinese donors . It\u2019s the pay-off of being upfront on dual citizens, with Labor only now sending its potential dual nationals to the High Court. The parliamentary year ends with momentum firmly in the government\u2019s favour and Shorten\u2019s credibility seriously dented. Shorten was successful in persuading the public that his own team had no questions to answer on citizenship. The press gallery swallowed his message, defending Labor figures like Katy Gallagher , when we at The Daily Telegraph revealed she was a likely both a British and Ecuadorean citizen. Camera Icon Opposition Leader Bill Shorten. Picture: AAP Picture: AAP Shorten has a proven ability to cut through that will stand him in good stead through his political career. However, one of his messages that cut through was how watertight Labor\u2019s vetting processes are. Voters couldn\u2019t miss the point, delivered day after day after day, that Labor had better vetting processes than the Liberals. Recall the intimidation tactics by staff when I investigated Katy Gallagher\u2019s citizenship and that of other Labor MPs in a front-page story. I was told my story was \u201cwrong and embarrassing\u201d, \u201cfanciful\u201d and fed the line \u201cthis is so f\u2026ing stupid\u201d. This isn\u2019t simply a case of hypocrisy. This will have rocked voters\u2019 trust in Shorten. Perhaps even decimated it. His behaviour was supercilious and against the advice of some within his shadow cabinet. Never mind journalists \u2014 voters\u2019 trust in a politician is highly fragile, particularly in our current era of distaste for authority. Camera Icon Senator Katy Gallagher. Picture: Kym Smith Picture: News Corp Australia Shorten\u2019s loss of authenticity comes in stark contrast to Turnbull\u2019s declaration that he\u2019s never broken a promise to voters, which he is reiterating in the context of having \u00addelivered a same-sex marriage postal plebiscite. Turnbull will for the foreseeable months continue to attack Shorten over his misleading protection racket of foreign MPs in his ranks. Already, Turnbull has privately made the point to colleagues that \u00adeither Shorten lied to voters by saying Labor\u2019s vetting processes were bulletproof when he knew they weren\u2019t, or, if their vetting processes were proper, he lied about David Feeney\u2019s citizenship. Turnbull\u2019s point: either way, Shorten lied. Shorten will need to work hard to regain the faith he has lost with \u00advoters. A full-blown mea culpa would have helped this week. Instead, he continued to protect his MPs from the scrutiny of the High Court. Camera Icon David Feeney. Picture: Kym Smith Picture: News Corp Australia Turnbull can breathe easy at least until the Bennelong by-election, buoyed by his delivery of gay marriage through the Parliament yesterday \u2014 a remarkable achievement for a conservative government \u2014 as his attention turns to a reshuffle and creation of a Home Affairs portfolio. The past week in Canberra shows politics is impossible to predict and can change course faster than a twisting tornado. It also shows that for all the skills and experience a politician might bring to the job, it is ultimately \u00adinstinct that gets you through. And this week, Shorten\u2019s was shown to be sorely lacking.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sharri markson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bill shorten", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bill short", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barnaby joyce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john howard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kym smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katy gallagher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam dastyari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david feeney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "daily telegraph", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "news corp australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "news corp australia shorten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bennelong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new eng\u00adland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:26.064+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af79b93f938382ad2169b86d381de7ec42342f94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTaVuehfv1I7bzrCdTrj_8gJxcP9eMLx0P6C2uUUAFjxjY16V55uYyrauXYN9pFXgHUjkmz._4NQ0E8knanhP3jMHehHsEweS2xbHY0FyNOtDTka.EDyFRc", "site_full": "www.cbsnews.com", "site": "cbsnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.cbsnews.com/feeds/rss/main.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Home - CBSNews.com", "title": "Fact check: Did an Alabama church compare Roy Moore to Jesus?", "title_full": "Fact check: Did an Alabama church compare Roy Moore to Jesus? - CBS News", "published": "2017-12-07T10:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/11/28/62cf6267-8c22-4d50-92b5-6609eb169c0e/roy-moore-gettyimages-880611838.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 584, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9b2552150b92a9fe29ddd7355eb210e6dd0f2e22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTaVuehfv1I7bzrCdTrj_8gJxcP9eMLx0P6C2uUUAFjxjY16V55uYyrauXYN9pFXgHUjkmz._4NQ0E8knanhP3jMHehHsEweS2xbHY0FyNOtFTBaBB1nSdxWJ2jh0Yub2w-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Random thought", "published": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "You seem to know exactly what is meant by being a true Christian.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:27.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4cdfabee588797a588d44ca29d0dff4300539de4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTaVuehfv1I7bzrCdTrj_8g8YZSrJCneM3AnwhJsD70MPibajacEgSZwGXn.Wv1FG3Gd8com0kweDZPEz5GbD9lY.lJu4hzia9a9rGXRhPeLpB07N9yyPdXX02oEhq911w-", "site_full": "www.cbsnews.com", "site": "cbsnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.cbsnews.com/feeds/rss/main.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Home - CBSNews.com", "title": "Winds fueling Southern California wildfires expected to kick up again overnight", "title_full": "Winds fueling Southern California wildfires expected to kick up again overnight - CBS News", "published": "2017-12-07T02:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 42, "participants_count": 24, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/12/07/6f1017b1-82be-4beb-a603-6b65d6dd323c/evans-california-wildfires-3-2017-12-6.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 584, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4b4bf5d5cb7fbb1205ef8a11222fa62484c94d4e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTaVuehfv1I7bzrCdTrj_8g8YZSrJCneM3AnwhJsD70MPibajacEgSZwGXn.Wv1FG3Gd8com0kweDZPEz5GbD9lY.lJu4hzia9a9rGXRhPeLpB07N9yyPdXy0Xp.h19Bj9DCr1YKtzHww--", "ord_in_thread": 36, "author": "Jayjaybe", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Northern CA has gotten rains in those wildfire areas but CA is a huge state.

Simply left them standing at Canterbury midweeks when she raced away for one of the easiest juvenile wins we\u2019ve seen this season. What was the quality of the runners behind her? Well, third placegetter Perfect Pitch then came out and won strongly at Rosehill last weekend. Still only has 2kg over the limit and looks just too good, despite a slightly awkward draw. Expect a big improvement from Countercurrent, who looked good on debut at Queanbeyan before going south and fighting on behind La Pomme De Pin in the clockwise race at Ballarat. She\u2019s got the ability to stretch these. SPEED MAP: Gongs should cross to take up the running, as she did on debut. Carnina will kick up from the rails as she led in her latest trial. Tempo should be OK. DID YOU KNOW: Reagan is a grandson of the Golden Slipper winner Merlene. SUGGESTED BET: Gongs to win. Take 1 as a standout in trifecta with 2,3,4,6,8 in placings MARKET MOVERS: Gongs $2.30-$2.15 ($500 @ $2.30, $1,000 @ $2.20, $400 @ $2.20) RACE 2: #ATTHERACES PLATE (1400m) 1.15pm OVERVIEW: This will be a big battle of tactics. Reckon Star Sensation can cross and lead here. If she gets the cheap sectionals before the turn, she can sprint and hold on. Big threat. It was impossible to miss the run of Heliosphere on resuming when he charged home for third to Pretty Fast. He was a second-up winner over 1600m last campaign but that was on a heavy track. He will get back in the small field but I don\u2019t think Kerrin McEvoy will let the leaders get too big a break on him. Will be storming home. Poetic Charmer is racing in great heart. Up Trumpz (a little unlucky last start) and Sparky Lad (back to 1400m) have sound claims. SPEED MAP: Star Sensation can cross to lead here as she sat on pace when narrowly beaten last start and this is devoid of a natural leader. Speed could be moderate. DID YOU KNOW: Heliosphere produced a cracking last 200m sectional time of 11.20sec last time out, one of the best of the day. SUGGESTED BET: Quinella 2,4 MARKET MOVERS: No bets or movements of note media_camera Volpe\u2019s last-start win has him well placed to be in contention again. RACE 3: TAB HIGHWAY HCP (1400m) 1.50pm OVERVIEW: I don\u2019t think there will be a lot between Volpe and O\u2019Lordy at the finish. Slight leaning to the latter, especially at better odds. She was very good in storming home to win a Highway here two runs back, admittedly getting all the favours nearer the fence. But then she turned in a gallant effort at Goulburn last-start when trapped wide throughout, very wide on the turn and still running on to be beaten only a length at the finish. Down 2kg here, right at her top and hard to beat. Lot to like about Volpe\u2019s win last start. Would have been a certainty beaten if he hadn\u2019t got the run at the 200m mark and then exploded away here last week. I respect the stable\u2019s decision to bring Divine Unicorn here. SPEED MAP: Gitan, Ribs, Magic Choir and Call The Captain are likely to push forward. Magic Choir can lead from good draw as he found winning form leading last start. Volpe and O\u2019Lordy will get back. DID YOU KNOW: Magic Choir was backed from $5.50 to $3.90 at Scone last start. SUGGESTED BET: Quinella 2,3,4 MARKET MOVERS: Divine Unicorn $3.50-$2.90-$3.10 ($400 @ $3.50, $200 @ $3.20, $360 @ $3) RACE 4: ATC OWNERS BENEFIT CARD HCP (1400m) 2.25pm OVERVIEW: Really liked the way Noire hit the line at Canterbury on resuming. Sat near the tail of the field until the home corner and then charged late to win running away. Is up in class here but also up to an even more favourable trip. Has form around the likes of Savapinski, Test The World and Slow Burn. That\u2019s good enough to win this. Drawn perfectly too. There was no fluke in the win of Positive Problems here a fortnight ago. Did all the work in front and they just couldn\u2019t run her down. Queen Misty was a little unlucky on resuming at Canterbury. SPEED MAP: Positive Problems will take up the running again. Expect Noire and Miss Ballantine to sit a little closer. Pace OK. DID YOU KNOW: Positive Problems (winner) and Miss Ballantine (2nd) were both at $41 last start. SUGGESTED BET: Noire to win MARKET MOVERS: Overstep $11-$6.50 ($200 @ $11 TWICE); Deductions: Star Sensation 23c Win, Diapason 4c Win RACE 5: NATIONAL JOCKEYS TRUST HCP (2000m) 3pm OVERVIEW: Impavido deserves one more chance. Forced to take the field up to the tearaway leader last start and he still looked a winning hope 200m out before finally the effort told. Still only beaten two lengths. Very honest and reckon he will be ridden more patiently this time and saved for one last crack in the straight. Carzoff finished third in the same race after coming home strongly. Rock-hard fit now. Mornington drops in grade. At his top now. SPEED MAP: Lead Choreographer is likely to run to the front but don\u2019t expect the same tearaway tactics. DID YOU KNOW: Gambler\u2019s Blues has only won three of 31 but has finished second 12 times. SUGGESTED BET: Boxed trifecta 2,5,6,10 MARKET MOVERS: Mornington $8-$6.50 ($400 @ $8) media_camera Firsthand looks hard to beat on Saturday. RACE 6: BEANIE FOR BRAIN CANCER HCP (1400m) 3.40pm OVERVIEW: Firsthand is racing in great touch and will appreciate a drop in grade here. Kept chasing right to the line when second to Cabeza De Vaca here three weeks ago. Impressive winning at Randwick before that when he toughed it out right to the wire again. The claim helps him here and drawn to get the nice run off the speed. Flow goes up in class but down in weight and was very good last time. All the better for the effort and drawn to get all the favours. SPEED MAP: Flow looks like leading by default from the inside barrier. Firsthand won\u2019t be away, nor will New Universe, Time To Torque and Voilier. Invinzabeel, Liapari and Savoureux will get back. DID YOU KNOW: Savoureux hasn\u2019t won since January 2016. SUGGESTED BET: Firsthand to win MARKET MOVERS: Firsthand $4.60-$4; Flow $4.60-$3.40-$3.50 ($450 @ $4.60, $333 @ $4.40, $750 @ $4.20, $1,000 @ $4, $1,200 @ $3.80, $1,000 @ $3.60, $270 @ $3.40) Deductions: Zumbelina 13c Win Single Bullet is expected to go forward on Saturday. Picture: AAP RACE 7: MARL HUGHES FOUNDATION HCP (1100m) 4.20pm OVERVIEW: Pretty keen on Guard Of Honour. Always had a stack of ability and ready to show it this preparation. Only beaten a length by Tactical Advantage first-up last campaign and was narrowly beaten by Man From Uncle in G3 grade at Randwick. Has trialled brilliantly for his return and will give this a big shake. Single Bullet is an above-average three-year-old taking on the older horses but will relish the drop in weight, especially after the claim. SPEED MAP: Princefamous will go forward, as will Test The World, Single Bullet and Bon Amis. Speed genuine. DID YOU KNOW: Guard Of Honour broke 33sec for his last 600m in a trial at Beaumont. SUGGESTED BET: 8 to win, saver on 12 MARKET MOVERS: To Excess $11-$9.50 ($5,000 @ $11, $600 e/w @ $11/$3.25); Guard Of Honour $8-$6 ($700 @ $8, $10,000 @ $7) RACE 8: ATC MEMBERSHIP HCP (1200m) 5pm OVERVIEW: Thought the effort of Pipeline first-up was very good. The race developed into a sprint home and he was still able to make up ground on the winner after being slowly away. Slight concern that he stays at 1200m second-up but looks to be enough speed on to see him storming home again. Brave Song is a very smart three-year-old who trialled well at Randwick for his return here. . SPEED MAP: The Hipster likely to roll to the front. Star Reflection will go forward and Balmain Boy will kick up from good draw. DID YOU KNOW: Waitaadwatch has won five of seven on good ground. SUGGESTED BET: 9 to win, save on 15. MARKET MOVERS: No bets or movements of note RACE 9: tab.com.au HCP (1500m) 5.40pm OVERVIEW: Prepared to gamble on Invicta. Got to the centre of the track and ran on strongly to win on the post at Cessnock last start. Warwick Farm winner beating Fortensky when last in work. Right at his top and distance suits. King Darci should get a little give in the ground tomorrow, which will help his chances. SPEED MAP: Carluca likely to take up the running from inside draw. King Darci will be handy and Invicta will get back. DID YOU KNOW: King Darci has had six tries on his home track for only two placings. SUGGESTED BET: Boxed trifecta 1,5,7,13. MARKET MOVERS: No bets or movements of note SMASH HIT FOR CHARITY THE Australian Turf Club, together with Australian Bloodstock, will present a major donation to the Mark Hughes Foundation at Rosheill on Friday courtesy of Japanese import Brave Smash\u2019s third placing in the inaugural $10 million ATC The Everest (1200m) at Randwick on October 14. A cheque for $33,060 will be handed over in between the ATC Beanie For Brain Cancer handicap and the ATC Mark Hughes Foundation Handicap. The figure amounts to 5 per cent of the $800,000 prizemoney earned by Brave Smash in the world\u2019s richest turf race. Meanwhile, patrons at Rosehill Gardens on Saturday will have the chance to receive a free ticket to next year\u2019s Longines Golden Slipper simply by being on course. A special code word will be published in the racebook and displayed on the infield superscreen which allows redemption of one free ticket to the world\u2019s richest race for two-year-olds. McEVOY, AVDULLA JOIN FORCES FOR GOOD CAUSE EVEREST-winning jockey Kerrin McEvoy and Brenton \u2018The Gun\u2019 Avdulla will fill the void left by the Hong Kong-based Tommy Berry this Christmas when Racing NSW makes it annual hospital visits. McEvoy and Avdulla will visit the Sydney Children\u2019s Hospital at Westmead and at Randwick distributing gifts purchased with the generous and ongoing support of Racing NSW. JONES BEGINS THE LONG JOURNEY BACK GOOD news coming out of the north this week with injured Lismore Jockey Club secretary manager Scott Jones out of an induced coma and out of intensive care. Scott was reported to be sitting up in bed earlier in the week and actually requested his laptop. It will be a long and challenging road ahead for Scott and everyone in the industry sends their best wishes to him and his family. Let\u2019s hope Garry Kirkup can make a full and speed recovery from his injuries and all the best to his beloved Highly Geared at Rosehill on Saturday. MARE RAISES THE BAR IN EUROPE MARSHA, a one of the best sprinting mares in Europe in recent years, set a new record price for a horse sold at a European auction this week knocked down to Coolmore for $6 million guineas of approximately $AU11.1 million. \u201cShe is really something special,\u2019\u2019 Coolmore\u2019s MV Magnier said.

This was a cross-sectional observational study by means of a quantitative survey of 1,000 general practitioners registered in Ireland exploring the frequency of diagnosis, methods of treatment and cost of AHZ and PHN in primary care. We recorded an 18% response rate ( n =\u2009184) with an 83% completion rate ( n =\u2009152/184). 80% of cases of AHZ occurred in patients aged 50 years or more with 81% of study participants encountering cases at a rate of 1\u20133 patients per month. Famciclovir (37%) and valaciclovir (36%) were the most commonly prescribed antiviral agents. Mild opioids (32%) were the most common analgesic agents used for first line AHZ pain, and pregabalin (37%) the most commonly prescribed analgesic agent for second line AHZ pain. Pregabalin was also the most commonly prescribed analgesic for both first and second line PHN pain (29% and 24%, respectively). The mean per-case direct cost (medication and GP visits) of treating AHZ and PHN in primary care was \u20ac195 (range \u20ac153\u2013\u20ac236) and \u20ac201 (range \u20ac140\u2013\u20ac313), respectively. Based on national sentinel data the estimated annual direct costs of treating AHZ and PHN in primary care is \u20ac2,278,196 (range \u20ac1,793,399\u2013\u20ac2, 763,445). The treatment of AHZ and PHN represents both a significant care and cost burden on primary care resources in Ireland in keeping with other European based studies.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2AEd7yV", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ahz", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pregabalin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:29.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5296f5adadfd44f5533cbb5c24c5719586e7c9d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuYQ9wS2Ww9NvIvV5X4m0JZMlRU2vcagmuMDxqfhHqZJu4BsTchGLFZ2fyep3oVap2yNHAtcRpGJke.VvwDLHOc", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html?page=3&sort=newest&pagesize=15&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'html' Questions - Page 3 - Stack Overflow", "title": "javascript - how the event bubbling and phases occurred in html", "title_full": "javascript - how the event bubbling and phases occurred in html - Stack Overflow", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.215, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2ff891308049f9c6fbd5b12ca9f0c7d42b8f656", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuYQ9wS2Ww9NvIvV5X4m0JZMlRU2vcagmuMDxqfhHqZJu4BsTchGLFZ2fyep3oVap2yNHAtcRpGJgLNlA1Inbl38d.84DwV5Xk-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "mac", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Basic Example in HTML, elements are nested inside other elements like so\n<div id=\"outer\"> <h1 id=\"inner\">Inner<h1> </div>\nwhen an event on an inner element is triggered it affects every outer element as you might have read in the post you linked.

You can do anything with it that apt can do, at a lower level. You can search, obtain information, view the files, extract, install, remove, configure, etc. with it.\ndselect \ndselect is a curses (terminal gui) frontend for dpkg.\napt \nApt is the Advanced Packaging Tool. With it you can automate a number of steps you would need to do by hand to obtain the results with dpkg. Apt works with the *.deb packages found in repositories to the point that you may not even know the files are there.\naptitude \naptitude is a curses (terminal gui) frontend for apt-*.\nsynaptic \nsynaptic is a gtk+ (desktop gui) frontend apt-*.\nNotable usage for dpkg : \ndpkg -c - Shows the contents of a deb package.\ndpkg -i - Installs a deb package.\ndpkg -s - Shows information about the installed package.\ndpkg --reconfigure - Runs the configuration dialogs that you saw when installing the package.\nNotable usage for apt-get : \napt-get install - Installs a package from your configured repositories.\napt-get remove - Uninstalls a package.\napt-get update - Updates your cache of packages within your repositories.\napt-get upgrade - Upgrades your installed packages if applicable.\napt-get dist-upgrade - Used to migrate to the latest distribution release.\napt-get autoremove - Uninstalls packages that were not explicitly installed and are not needed.\nNotable usage for apt-cache : \napt-cache search - Searches to see if a specified package is available in your repositories.\napt-cache stats - Gives statistics on repositories in cache.\n\nSolution:2\napt and dpkg perform different but orthogonal tasks. dpkg keeps track of what packages are currently installed, and can install or remove them. apt keeps track of what packages are available and can do things like download a package ( and its dependencies ) and hand them to dpkg to install, or check if there are newer versions of the packages you have installed, download them, and hand them to dpkg to install.\nIn other words, dpkg handles the low level package management, and apt builds on top of it by adding the concept of an archive that contains packages that you may want to download and install.\n\nSolution:3\nAFAIK, apt can't be used to install a package from a .deb file; you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to use dpkg -i for that. \nOtherwise, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry about it. If you know your way around apt , by all means use that. If you run into limitations of apt , at least you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll already know to look into dpkg . :-)\n\nNote:If u also have question or solution just comment us below or mail us on toontricks1994@gmail.com ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ubuntu", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:29.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "039623c119f5f14be79a369b356b4dadf9c76ab9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT3.LaHO6F1Y3RziHj_cvlDGP3903Tk4_fSTH2UVMWTQt.jp2ulzt0bbXDscgPdeJUWBJZpu16tVrY7QoMw7XzH.ouI9cIFUfU-", "site_full": "www.thaivisa.com", "site": "thaivisa.com", "site_section": "https://www.thaivisa.com/forum/forum/114-diving-in-thailand/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Diving in Thailand - Thailand Visa Forum by Thai Visa | The Nation", "title": "free dive insurance with SSI", "title_full": "free dive insurance with SSI - Diving in Thailand - Thailand Visa Forum by Thai Visa | The Nation", "published": "2017-12-07T12:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11618, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "039623c119f5f14be79a369b356b4dadf9c76ab9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT3.LaHO6F1Y3RziHj_cvlDGP3903Tk4_fSTH2UVMWTQt.jp2ulzt0bbXDscgPdeJUWBJZpu16tVrY7QoMw7XzH.ouI9cIFUfU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "stevenl", "published": "2017-12-07T12:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "free dive insurance with SSI", "text": "Scuba Schools International, SSI, is offering free dive insurance for all beginner courses in cooperation with DiveAssure.
