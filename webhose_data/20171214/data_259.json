Sadly it is now just a paid for referral site treating its members as \"cash fodder\" . There are many good deals to be found on here but also many pitfalls if you aren't exactly the sharpest knife in the box .\nHUKD - would it really hurt you so much to point out which deals are from Chinese sellers ? and avoid potential misery for many of your members ?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:09.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "60ccedee9e0546e0280c854d6db5efca12b9ed4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9CfQdOMC17n5k03E7sIqpw4UxRv5VECeq65gS3jYMM2hCQDdIhJX.MZfMlzkG_ADk05ZQ8nbmBB0ze31MTF..sNkRknu8KmE8-", "site_full": "www.kulanpost.com", "site": "kulanpost.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Raila Odinga responds to US on his swearing-in |", "title_full": "Raila Odinga responds to US on his swearing-in |", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.kulanpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/nasa_leaders_13.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "60ccedee9e0546e0280c854d6db5efca12b9ed4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9CfQdOMC17n5k03E7sIqpw4UxRv5VECeq65gS3jYMM2hCQDdIhJX.MZfMlzkG_ADk05ZQ8nbmBB0ze31MTF..sNkRknu8KmE8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "December", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "Raila Odinga responds to US on his swearing-in |", "text": "December 7, 2017 Nasa leaders in a previous meeting led by Raila Odinga ( Courtesy) \nNAIROBI\u2014National Super Alliance (Nasa) leader Raila Odinga has rebuked western countries that are opposing his swearing-in as the the \u2018people\u2019s president\u2019. \nOn Thursday, Mr Odinga said the US and other countries that have advised against the December 12 inauguration should know that \u201cthe will of the people cannot be stopped\u201d. \n\u201cWe thought we had friends but we were wrong and now we know they are enemies.

Alex Wong / Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 7:54 am \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Strzok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate.

Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 4:50 am \nUpdated at 5:50 a.m. ET \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nMarriage in Australia is now defined as \"the union of two people\" instead of \"union of a man and a woman.\" \nLawmakers had tried and failed some two dozen times in the past to make the change. \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of the 80 percent of registered voters who cast ballots, ensuring that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott barbour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george brandis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "parliament approves same-sex marriage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images members of parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the sydney morning herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "federation square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images  australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:09.056+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e92531141625721fbfebd097cb97f46bcb42bab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_StcUp8dvfp7Xmu2.AFjVd7rYTFg8QaoQ9peV.VoeVjMJSCE4qfpF96W9p51QfOZxZV8qDpNS4Bjz6oD9MpB5.1qpjaQOVLNqjHadKVhUBA--", "site_full": "www.bikeforums.net", "site": "bikeforums.net", "site_section": "https://www.bikeforums.net/advocacy-safety/", "site_categories": ["bicycling", "sports"], "section_title": "Advocacy &amp; Safety - Bike Forums", "title": "Homeless vs. bicyclists - Page 5", "title_full": "Homeless vs. bicyclists - Page 5 - Bike Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T05:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 18862, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "92360b6673f34311039aec835ec6edd60c81e58b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_StcUp8dvfp7Xmu2.AFjVd7rYTFg8QaoQ9peV.VoeVjMJSCE4qfpF96W9p51QfOZxZV8qDpNS4Bjz6oD9MpB5.1qpjaQOVLMJvIDPD_AiMQ--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "McBTC", "published": "2017-12-07T07:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Sometimes there's a happy ending ( beginning ?)-- e.g., Ted Williams (the man with the golden voice) made a comeback, is still sober and lives in his own home...\n?The Man With the Golden Voice?: Where Is Ted Williams Now?

Tauseef Mustafa / AFP/Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 7:34 am \nMonths after a tense standoff between China and India along their Himalayan border, Beijing on Thursday expressed anger over what it says was an Indian drone that crashed inside its territory. \n\"This action by India violated China's territorial sovereignty. We express strong dissatisfaction and opposition,\" Xinhua cited Zhang Shuili, a senior military official in China's western battle zone command, as saying. \nChina said the drone crashed in \"recent days\" but didn't say where. Zhang said his country would defend its national sovereignty against such intrusions. \nHe said China's border defense forces conducted \"an inspection of the device,\" but didn't elaborate. \nIndia has not responded to the charge. \nAlthough the two countries have made moves toward warmer relations in recent years, they also have a long history of border tensions. In 1962, they fought a brief, but inconclusive border conflict. They have also had ongoing disputes over sovereignty in other border areas, notably Aksai Chin, a Himalayan region that straddles their territorial demarcation in the west. \nThe two countries have also long been at odds over India's hosting of Tibet's government-in-exile and their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, considered by China to be subversive because of his calls for Tibetan independence. \nStarting in June this year, tensions flared again over a disputed region called the Doklam Plateau that borders China, Bhutan and the Indian state of Sikkim. \nAs NPR's Julie McCarthy reported from New Delhi in July , the problems stemmed from China's construction of a road in Doklam Plateau. \"Not far from the plateau lies the narrow passage that connects India's northeast states with the rest of the country \u2014 a strategic link called the Siliguri Corridor but more commonly known as the \"Chicken's Neck. \" Any possibility of China being able to sever that \"neck\" unnerves India. \nAs late as August, India had rushed troops to Doklam Plateau and although an immediate conflict was avoided, heated rhetoric on both sides has soured relations. \nIn September, India's army chief said that his country \"could not afford to be complacent and must be prepared for war,\" according to The Hindustan Times. \nAnd in November, China took umbrage at Indian President Ram Nath Kovind's visit to the remote state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China also claims, Reuters reports.

The delegation, led by Bashar al-Ja\u2018afari, walked out last week and returned to Damascus. Negotiations resumed on Wednesday without the Syrian government delegation. The talks began last week and after a few days with little apparent progress, the U.N. mediator Staffan de Mistura said that the government delegation was returning to Damascus to \u201cconsult and refresh\u201d. The government delegation blamed its departure on the opposition\u2019s uncompromising stance on Assad\u2019s future. Last month, the opposition drew up a statement in a meeting in Riyadh that rejected any future role for Assad in Syria. During last week\u2019s sessions, de Mistura shuttled between the representatives of the two warring sides, who did not meet face-to-face. He had planned to continue the round until Dec. 15. The opposition negotiating team arrived at the U.N. offices in Geneva on Wednesday morning to resume talks with de Mistura.

There are many parts of the program that you need to know about. *How to transition from your current eating to intermittent fasting slowly. *Understanding what keto really is (low carb, mod. protein and higher fat) *Adding fat at the meal to go longer and not being hungry. *Adding greens (salad), which are nutrient-dense providing all sorts of nutrients, esp. potassium to rid hunger and help heal insulin resistance. *Insulin resistance (high insulin) is behind most health problems, esp. your waist. *Constipation can come up if you are not used to certain types of vegetables like kale so be aware of this and switch it up. It could also be that you need more potassium. *Fatigue could come from low salt. On a low carb diet, you need to increase your salt (sea salt) to 1 teaspoon. *Other effects from keto can be easily remedied by adding more minerals (potassium) and B-vitamins (nutritional yeast). *If you cheat on this program, you will notice the next day will be off in a way you are hungrier and craving more \u2013 just get back on the wagon. When you start going to 2 meals and then 1 meal, some people really stuff themselves, and overload the digestive system, esp. with too much fat and they end up with right shoulder pain and bloating \u2013 this is too much for the gallbladder. *Also add lemon juice and apple cider vinegar to your liquid to help prevent the build up of uric acid (gout, kidney stones) for those who are susceptible. *It is not true that your thyroid needs carbs. In fact, you body will be more efficient on this plan and the need for thyroid hormones will be less \u2013 this is normal. *Your cholesterol may go up temporarily because your fat cells release it \u2013 this is what we want. Just stick with it and things will come down eventually. *Lastly, when you eventually get into autophagy (cellular recycling), you\u2019re cognitive function, memory, skin, weight, heart will all greatly benefit and plus \u2013 YOU\u2019LL BE SAVING MONEY \u2013 from not eating so frequency \u2013 these are all the reasons WHY it\u2019s worth it. \nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio: Dr. Berg, 52 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in weight loss through nutritional and natural methods.
