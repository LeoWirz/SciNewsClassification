Perhaps it has made me lazy!\nThere are 3 pictures from Images of Grace by Jacqui Grace, which I have coloured.\nPs. 78: Asaph reminds the people of God\u2019s dealings with their ancestors who rebelled. Also how he chose David from the tribe of Judah.\nPs. 79: Asaph prays that God will show his power against those who have destroyed the temple and city so that his people will praise God.\nPs.80: Asaph likens his nation to a cultivated vine. He asks God to hear, restore and to make His face shine upon them and save them.\nPs. 81: Asaph begins with a call to praise. A warning from God about not having other gods and a promise if they listen to God and follow him.\nPs. 82: Asaph speaks of God\u2019s judging of unjust rulers, of underdogs who need help and protection. He asks God to judge the earth and all the nations.\nPs. 83: Asaph asks God to act against the nations conspiring against God. Blow them away like chaff or thistledown. Let them know that you are Lord.\nPs. 84: The sons of Korah sing about God\u2019s dwelling place. Those who live with God, who trust in God and whose strength is in God are blessed.\nPsalm 84  \nPs. 85: The sons of Korah pray to God about their land and people. They move from complaint, to listening to God and end with hope. A way to pray!\n \nPs. 86: David recognises his need of the forgiving God. He praises him, requests an undivided heart. (Book title by @LucyMillsBooks ) He desires to go on learning God\u2019s way to live and that his enemies should notice God\u2019s goodness. #psalmtweets @JustCardsDirect \n \nPsalm 86 Ps. 87:The sons of Korah sing about Zion, the city of God, about other nations \u2013 those which acknowledge God are adopted as if they were born in Zion.\nPs. 88: This Psalm begins with a statement of faith, but goes on to list Heman the Ezrahite\u2019s troubles and feelings of abandonment.\n \nPs. 89: Ethan the Ezrahite ends Book 3 with praise to God for who He is and what He does, His covenant with David. (Who is the rejected anointed one? Saul?) ends with praise\n \nPsalm 92 Ps. 90: Moses prays about God\u2019s faithfulness, human mortality and sinfulness. He asks for wisdom to live well and to have God\u2019s blessing on \u2018the work of our hands\u2019.\n \nPs. 91: A psalm of promises. God\u2019s protection, faithfulness, guardian angels,deliverance, long life and salvation\n \nPs. 92: Praise and music proclaim God\u2019s love and faithfulness.

As a result, we have a higher rate of unintended pregnancy. We know that when women can plan their pregnancies the health outcomes are better for them and their families. That is why the continued funding for the effective Colorado program providing low-income women with access to long acting, effective methods of contraception is so important.\nLatinas are more likely to live in areas with poor access to family planning services. We are less likely to have health insurance or the financial resources to be able to afford to access contraception or see a reproductive health professional. There are also specific and significant limitations to the ability of immigrant Latinos to access health information and services.\nBy ensuring that care is both available and affordable, we are able to support women in Colorado. The Colorado Family Planning Initiative provides comprehensive contraceptive services, including hormonal implants and IUDs for those who may not be able to access them otherwise and helps to expand clinic hours and availability of care.\nThe number of young women facing unintended pregnancy fell 48 percent from 2009 to 2014. It is difficult to deal with an unplanned pregnancy at any age, but with the stigma and lack of support that many young parents face, it is that much harder for teens.\nFrom 2009 through 2016, the program provided 43,713 no- or low-cost IUDs or implants to women at 75 family planning clinics across Colorado. Between 40,000 and 50,000 women annually have received benefits through this program with clear improvements in public health. The ability to plan our families is an issue of reproductive health, but it is also one of financial stability.\nWe have worked hard to support continued funding, but we need to make sure that we do not advocate for contraception for young people in a way that judges or demonizes young parents. Young parents are not incapable. They are not more likely to hurt their children and poverty does not just happen to them. They are more likely to face huge obstacles to completing their education and getting the support and services they need to care for themselves and their children. They are more likely to struggle to find affordable childcare or to find a position that pays a living wage and provide workplace protections to help them juggle the needs of their job and their family thereby increasing the likelihood that they are stuck in a cycle of poverty. This does not just happen.\nWe should continue effective programs like the Colorado Family Planning Initiative that help to close gaps in access to healthcare while also working to break down systems of oppression that make it harder for young people when they face unintended pregnancy and challenge rhetoric about young people and young parents.\nWe need to support people in being able to become parents when they are ready, to ensure access to the reproductive health care that people need, and to support the health of women and families in our state. Continued funding for this program is an important step.\nKarla Gonzales Garc\u00eda is the Program and Policy Director for the Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights (COLOR).\nRead More Commentary: www.elsemanario.us", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "karla gonzales garc\u00eda", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "colorado organization for latina opportunity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado family planning initiative", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:40.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5761786144ebdf1290b0c93be656d090828a948c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmc894M.cu8xRydpLp.eybQ_rw0jA2CWuN.YeB2uJksXZPGy3f.WG1yBUB2e8NJ6E-", "site_full": "www.opptrends.com", "site": "opptrends.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/Opptrends\r", "site_categories": ["media", "buying_selling_cars", "vehicles"], "section_title": "Opptrends \u2013 News, Reviews and Rumors 2017", "title": "8 Best Christmas Movies!", "title_full": "8 Best Christmas Movies!", "published": "2017-12-07T10:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.opptrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/home-alone.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5761786144ebdf1290b0c93be656d090828a948c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmc894M.cu8xRydpLp.eybQ_rw0jA2CWuN.YeB2uJksXZPGy3f.WG1yBUB2e8NJ6E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Vuk Lazarevic", "published": "2017-12-07T10:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "8 Best Christmas Movies!", "text": "9 Best Christmas Movies Source:youtube \nChristmas is just around the corner, and we thought how it would be awesome to find top movies for this time of year!

Register Metformin may prevent multidrug-resistant breast cancer Published Fact checked by Jasmin Collier Research led by the University of Saskatchewan in Canada has discovered that the diabetes drug metformin might reduce the development of multidrug resistance in vitro in breast cancer cells and may reverse resistance once it has occurred. MDR could be delayed, prevented, or reversed using metformin. \nTerra Arnason, Ph.D. \u2014 an associate professor and clinician scientist in the Department and College of Medicine \u2014 and colleagues led the study. Their findings were published in the journal PLOS ONE . \nMultidrug resistance (MDR) occurs when several cancers develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs. MDR is a significant factor in the failure of many types of chemotherapy, and it is often a terminal event. It affects individuals with blood cancers and solid tumors, including those with breast cancer . \nHow and why cancer cells become resistant to drugs has remained an important question in cancer research. The answer would provide potential targets to prevent and reverse resistance to treatment. \nPeople who develop resistance to one agent frequently develop resistance to many, hence being known as \"multiple drug resistance.\" Antiproliferative effect on cancer cells \nArnason and team aimed to investigate the effect of metformin on MDR when used together with the primary treatment. \nMetformin is a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes when diet and exercise alone have not helped to control blood sugar levels. Metformin helps to lower blood sugar by improving the way the body manages insulin . \nIn previous research, metformin has been shown to have an antiproliferative effect on tumor cells, meaning that the drug inhibits the growth and spread of cancer cells. \nIn fact, people with type 2 diabetes and cancer who take metformin have been reported to have a 31 percent reduction in the occurrence of new cancers.

Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

They're selling well.\n\"The 'Up and Moving' is for joints and for pain,\" he explains. \"The 'Calm and Quiet' is for real anxious dogs, to take away that anxiety.\"\nPeople anxious to relieve suffering in their pets are increasingly turning to oils and powders that contain CBDs, a non-psychoactive component of marijuana. But there's little data on whether they work, or if they have harmful side effects.\nThat's because Washington has been standing in the way of clinical trials , veterinarians and researchers say. Now, a push is underway to have barriers removed, so both pets and people can benefit.\nThose barriers have had more than just a chilling effect.\nWhen the federal Drug Enforcement Administration announced last year that even marijuana extracts with CBD and little or no THC - marijuana's intoxicating component - are an illegal Schedule 1 drug, the University of Pennsylvania halted its clinical trials. Colorado State University is pushing ahead.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned companies that sell marijuana products online and via pet shops and animal hospitals that they're violating laws by offering \"unapproved new animal drugs.\" The FDA threatened legal action.\nBut, seeing potential benefits of CBDs, the American Veterinary Medical Association's policy-making body said last summer it wants the DEA to declassify marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug \"to facilitate research opportunities for veterinary and human medical uses.\" It asked the board of the national veterinarians' organization to investigate working with other stakeholders toward that goal. The board is awaiting a recommendation from two group councils.\n\"The concern our membership has is worry about people extrapolating their own dosages, looking to medicate their pets outside the realm of the medical professional,\" Board Chairman Michael Whitehair said in a telephone interview. \"This is an important reason for us to continue the research.\"\nUtah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a conservative Republican, became an unlikely champion of this push when he introduced a bill in September that would open the path for more clinical research. While Hatch said he opposes recreational marijuana use, he wants marijuana-based drugs, regulated by the FDA, produced for people with disorders.\n\"We lack the science to support use of medical marijuana products like CBD oils, not because researchers are unwilling to do the work, but because of bureaucratic red tape and over-regulation,\" Hatch said.\nDawn Boothe, of Auburn University's College of Veterinary Medicine, is waiting for federal approval to begin a study of marijuana's effects on dogs with epilepsy . The classification of marijuana products containing CBD as a Schedule 1 drug, the same category as heroin and LSD, creates a \"major, major, major, terrible roadblock\" for researchers, Boothe said in a phone interview.\nResearchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine were studying CBDs' effects on dogs with osteoarthritis and pruritis, or itchiness, until the DEA released its policy statement.\n\"The ambiguity in this process has really brought us to a screeching halt,\" said Michael DiGregorio, director of the university's clinical trials center. \"It is research that needs to be done, because there are a lot of CBD products out there.\"\nWhen it clarified that marijuana CBD extracts are Schedule 1 drugs, the DEA said it was assigning a code number to those substances to better track them and to comply with international drug control treaties.\nDiGregorio complained that researchers seeking federal approval to study CBD products are told to provide certain data, but that data isn't normally available until the study is done.\n\"If you don't have the data, you can't get the registration to do the work,\" he said.\nOn a recent morning, Maas took a break from seeing four-legged patients in the Bend Veterinary Clinic. A stethoscope dangling from his neck over green scrubs, Maas said his clients have reported CBDs help relieve pain, arthritis , anxiety, loss of appetite, epilepsy and inflammation in their pets.\n\"Unfortunately there's not a lot of research out there, especially on animals, on CBD compounds,\" Maas said. \"The research is really necessary to help us understand how to actually use these compounds on our pets.\"\nVeterinarian Janet Ladyga of the Blue Sky Veterinary Clinic, also in Bend, said she doesn't recommend marijuana products because of the unknowns.\n\"We don't have a lot of evidence right now, so we don't know the toxicity or the safety profile ... and we don't have any good evidence to show either if it's safe or efficacious,\" she said.\nThe study at Colorado State University aims to provide some data. The roughly two dozen dogs in the arthritis study and the 30 in the epilepsy tests are given either CBD oil or a placebo. For the arthritis study, activity monitors are attached to the animals' collars, to determine if they're more mobile when they're taking CBD.\nPrincipal investigator Stephanie McGrath said she hopes the results will be a stepping stone for longer and more diverse studies, and that they provide useful information for human medicine.\n\"Every medication we're taking has been given to a dog first,\" the University of Pennsylvania's DiGregorio noted.\nMeanwhile, Boothe said she had everything ready to start her study in January, and was waiting for a green light from federal officials.\n\"I don't know what's taking so long,\" she said.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFollow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky \n  Scientists call on US to allow research on pot meds for pets   Air

The deceased Singthong Wichai went round to his ex-wife's house in Non Thong sub-district where she was sleeping with her new husband Noi Baothonglor. Noona Inkong, 52, went out to confront him and attacked him about the head with a knife. Then Noi joined in and repeatedly wielded an axe at the victim until he was dead. A neighbor called Salat Mahaphrom who tried to intervene is in a serious condition after also being attacked. After the incident about 10pm on Monday night the wife and her new man quickly decided that she would take the rap alone so one of them could stay out of jail. They hid the axe. But the local constabulary didn't believe that she was capable of committing the murder alone. At 8 am in the morning her new husband broke down and admitted his involvement. Cops soon found the axe hidden under a bed at the house. They were taken on a reenactment back to their house later on Tuesday morning. The pair have been charged with the murder of Singthong and committing grievous bodily harm on the neighbor and have been detained.

He further added that the All Progressives Congress (APC) should be grateful to Atiku for not tearing the membership card of the party like former President Olusegun Obasanjo did to signal his exit from PDP. Jibrin declared that it is too late to micro- zone the position of the national chairman. Atiku who formally returned to the PDP last week had visited the party\u2019s national secretariat on Tuesday ahead of Saturday\u2019s national convention. Section 8 of the PDP constitution, which deals on procedure for rejoining the party states: \u201cA person who desires to rejoin the party after leaving it shall \u2013 (a) apply to his Ward Secretary for re-admission; and (b) unless given waiver by the National Working Committee, be placed on probation for a period of not less than one year. \u201c(9) Subject to the provision of Section 8(b), a member on probation shall have the right to attend all meetings of the Party, but shall not be entitled to vote at such meetings, nor shall he be eligible to contest for elective of ce on the platform of the Party\u201d. Asked whether Atiku is eligible to vote, the national publicity secretary of the party, Prince Dayo Adeyeye said, \u201cAll you need to do is pick up the constitution of the party and see whether Atiku is quali ed to vote or not\u201d. When pressed further, he said, \u201cFirst of all, I can tell you that we are happy with Atiku coming back to the PDP. It\u2019s very exciting for all of us. It\u2019s a good omen to everybody in the PDP. \u201cHe was one of the founding fathers, one of those who built this party and he\u2019s coming back home. His room was never occupied. So, we have opened it for him. \u201cHe will be part of this convention. He will even make a speech at the convention but he may not be voting at the convention\u201d. Adeyeye further alleged that some people serving under the President Muhammadu Buhari administration are trying to disrupt their convention. He added that those behind the plot know that if it is successful, their days in government will be numbered. Adeyeye who said they have no evidence of Buhari\u2019s involvement in the move however appealed to him to stop his aides. The PDP spokesman didn\u2019t reveal the individuals involved in the alleged move to disrupt the convention. He said, \u201cI want to draw your attention to an issue that bother us. We have credible information that some overzealous elements in the government are trying by any means to disrupt the convention of the PDP to make sure this convention does not hold successfully. \u201cThey have been trying every effort but we are happy that we have no information that it is coming from the very top. But some overzealous elements in the administration are bent\u2026It is a very credible information and they are doing everything possible to make sure that this convention is disrupted. \u201cThey are afraid that if the PDP should hold a successful convention, their days in government are numbered. By the time we hold this convention and our of officers are elected and they take office next year, there will be a floodgate of people even from APC to the PDP. \u201cThis is a credible information and that is why we are appealing to President Muhammadu Buhari to please rein in his aides. We have no evidence that the president is aware of this. \u201cIt is happening and we are calling on him to do his own investigation and to call those who are trying to cause this problem to desist because it is capable, not only of destroying this democracy, but also of destroying the country\u201d. On his part, chairman of PDP\u2019s BoT, Sen Walid Jibrin, said \u201cAs the party joyfully welcomes Atiku back to his home PDP, we are equally waiting to receive more members of the APC, including Sen. Kwankwaso, Senators, members of the House of Representatives, President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, APC governors who had earlier left PDP. Thereafter, all of us would unite to take power from APC come 2019\u201d. On Atiku\u2019s defection, Jibrin said, \u201cAPC should remain grateful to Atiku Abubakar, the Wazirin Adamawa, for peacefully resigning with respect without tearing their party membership card, unlike our former president, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, who after ruling Nigeria under the PDP for eight years and after serving as the chairman of the BoT for about Two (2) years, disgracefully tore his membership card\u201d. He added that it is too late to micro-zone the position of national chairman \u201cconsidering that after more than Eight (8) aspirants have purchased the forms and are right now about to be screened by the Special Screening Committee. \u201cThey should be allowed to test their fame through the primaries that is about to start on the 9th-10th December 2017. I want to assure our party members that whoever emerged the National Chairman, the BOT is ready to cooperate and work with him for the progress of the party. I wouldliketoreiterateour position that BOT has not anointed any candidates for now\u201d, he added. Meanwhile, the party has technically barred the states of Anambra and Osun from taking part in the convention because of internal squabbles within the party chapter of the two states. IBB Optimistic Of Rancour-free Election Meanwhile, former military president, Ibrahim Babangida, has expressed con dence that the Governor Ifeanyi Okowa- led national convention organising committee of the PDP will conduct a process that would be devoid of any rancor. He spoke when the convention committee chairman and Delta State governor led the chairman of the caretaker committee of the PDP, Ahmed Makar , and other top of cials of the party to pay him a visit at his hill top residence in Minna, Niger State. He said, \u201cI have here the chairman of the caretaker committee, former chairman of Kaduna State, the chairman of convention planning committee, the governor of Delta State with the offcials for the convention. \u201cI am glad they are working hard and I have seen that they want to make sure that the convention of the PDP is rancor-free, transparent and everybody will be given a level playing ground\u201d. The former Nigerian leader expressed hope that \u201cPDP will see one of the best convention like never before\u201d. On the return of former vice president Atiku Abubakar to the PDP, IBB said, \u201cHe is a Nigerian; he is allowed to go to any party and our constitution allows it. So, it is not new and there is nothing wrong for a politician to move from one party to another\u201d. Earlier, Makar disclosed that the visit was in line with the tradition of the PDP where elders and leaders of the party are consulted for the right decisions to be taken.
