Online court records don't show if he has a lawyer. \nWright's body was found in a swampy field in suburban Memphis on July 28, 2010, 10 days after the 34-year-old was reported missing. He was shot multiple times. The seven-year investigation into his death has been one of the Memphis Police Department's most high-profile unsolved cases. \nAuthorities haven't discussed details of the investigation. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Scientific innovations and sustained investment have been the most important weapons in this ongoing battle. \nNevertheless the epidemic retains a powerful grip \u2013 especially on people in Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa, 19.4 million are living with the virus. In 2016 an estimated 15, 000 new infections occurred every week in the region. \nTreatment and prevention of HIV are twin endeavours; they rely universally on two elements. The first is the interaction of HIV positive and negative people with HIV services. The second is the willingness of people to modify their risky behaviour and avoid negative health consequences. \nAdherence is the cornerstone of these processes: a commitment to taking medication or adopting a risk-reducing behaviour consistently over time. By adhering to their antiretroviral (ARV) regimens those living with the virus are able to lead long, healthy lives. They are able to eliminate the chance of passing on the virus to their partner(s). The concept of an undetectable virus is an untransmissable one is now acceptable. \nWith good adherence to an HIV prevention pill or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or consistent use of condoms, HIV negative people can protect themselves from infection. \nBut real and perceived stigma can undermine all these efforts. This is because stigma stops people from getting tested, stops them discussing their test results with intimate partners when they do test, and then staying on their treatment. Unless stigma is addressed, the aim of ending the AIDs epidemic by 2030 \u2013 one of the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals \u2013 is unlikely to become a reality. \nThe logic behind stigma \nStigma happens when disgrace and shame become associated with an attribute, such as being HIV positive. It results in the person with the attribute being discredited or socially renounced. When stigmatised beliefs are widely held in a community, hostility and discrimination towards stigmatised people becomes common. \nA stigmatised person can start to believe these views as well and develop a self-depreciating internal representation of themselves. This is known as internalised stigma. It can lead to diminished mental health and emotional distress. Both general and internalised HIV-related stigma can compromise a person\u2019s ability to seek and stay on treatment. And it can prevent people from taking steps to prevent infection. \nFor instance, a woman living with HIV could choose not to go back for more medication because she\u2019s scared someone from her community will see her and learn her status. \nConversely, a sexually active teenager might not ask a healthcare professional how she can prevent HIV if she is afraid of being judged for having sex. \nThere is evidence that these scenarios still play out. The HIV Stigma Index conducted in South Africa in 2014 found that about 45% of the respondents experienced internalised stigma. And 39% lived in fear of potential stigma. Young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were particularly affected by all types of stigma. \nStigma on top of stigma \nStigma has the negative psychological consequence of making it more difficult for people to cope and find social support. It also reduces their ability to overcome other barriers to adherence, such as unfriendly healthcare services or side effects from medication. \nThe research shows that people who do not experience internalised stigma tend to be more successful in adhering to treatment and more capable of overcoming other barriers to access treatment and prevention services. HIV stigma poses additional difficulties for positive people who already belong to stigmatised population groups, such as men who have sex with men transgender people, sex workers, and people who inject drugs. \nStigma against these groups already reduces access to healthcare services and social support. But disclosure of being HIV positive can result in people facing even more stigma, discrimination and hostility. \nThis is especially the case in African countries where homosexuality and sex work are criminalised. \nMoralistic support for criminalisation often interferes with public health initiatives. As a result, stigmatised populations are frequently made more vulnerable to HIV infection due to this discrimination and restricted access to healthcare services. \nChanging the tide \nThe good news is that stigma can be reduced if three basic interventions are put in place. \nFirstly, through the implementation of effective and sustained mass media campaigns and health promotion aimed at dispelling the common myths. These campaigns should involve HIV positive people as message bearers. \nSecondly, normalising and promoting the interaction with HIV prevention services.

Data from Phase II-equivalent study demonstrated improved survival and hematological recovery of non-human primates (NHP) exposed to high levels of radiation PLX-R18 cells are in late-stage development as a treatment for ARS, supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) HAIFA, Israel, Dec. 07, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pluristem Therapeutics Inc . (NASDAQ: PSTI ) (TASE: PSTI ), a leading developer of placenta-based cell therapy products, announced today the company will present data from its Phase II-equivalent study of PLX-R18 cells for the treatment of acute radiation syndrome (ARS) at the American Society of Hematology\u2019s (ASH) 59 th Annual Meeting to be held in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 9-12, 2017. The results of the study will be presented during Program Session 506: Hematopoiesis and Stem Cells: Microenvironment, Cell Adhesion, and Stromal Stem Cells. The poster, \u201cIntramuscular Administration of Placenta-Derived Stromal Cells Enhances Survival of Rhesus Macaque Monkeys Exposed to Total Body Irradiation,\u201d will describe data from a recently announced Phase II-equivalent study under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Animal Rule. The data demonstrate improved survival and hematological recovery of NHPs exposed to different levels of radiation. This study was conducted and funded by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the NIH. The poster abstract will be published online in the supplemental volume of Blood , a peer-reviewed medical journal published by ASH. \u201cWe are excited to present these promising data on our PLX-R18 cells in the treatment of ARS to the world\u2019s thought leaders in hematology at this year\u2019s ASH conference,\u201d said Yaky Yanay, president and Co-CEO of Pluristem. \u201cWe believe that there is a crucial need for a therapy capable of effectively treating populations in case of nuclear or radioactive incidents. These findings, which show recovery of the hematologic system, suggest that PLX-R18 has the potential to treat a large population exposed to different levels of radiation and might also be used for additional hematologic indications.\u201d About PLX-R18 PLX-R18 is Pluristem\u2019s second cell therapy product in development. It is designed to treat bone marrow that is unable to produce enough blood cells due to a variety of causes including ARS, certain cancers or cancer treatments, or immune-mediated bone marrow failure. Pluristem is currently enrolling patients in a U.S. Phase I trial of PLX-R18 in incomplete bone marrow recovery following hematopoietic cell transplantation. PLX-R18\u2019s first animal studies in ARS were performed in collaboration with Prof. Gorodetsky at Hadassah Medical Center. Further preclinical data from trials conducted by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Hadassah, the Charite in Berlin and other prominent research institutions, have shown that PLX-R18 cells secrete a range of specific proteins that trigger the regeneration of bone marrow hematopoietic cells, thereby supporting the recovery of blood cell production. With its capabilities, PLX-R18 could potentially treat a broad range of hematologic indications, which together constitute a substantial global market. About Pluristem Therapeutics Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. is a leading developer of placenta-based cell therapy products. The Company has reported robust clinical trial data in multiple indications for its patented PLX (PLacental eXpanded) cells, and is entering late-stage trials in several indications.

The innovative bearing has a simplified design, which enhances flexibility and lowers lifecycle costs. The design builds on the core competencies from W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4's existing line shaft bearing solutions, long standing experience on plain bearing design and thorough understanding of the present and future customer needs of marine and oil & gas operators. \nThe technology group W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 launches W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Linesafe at the Marintec China event in Shanghai in December 2017, and adds the solution to its comprehensive seals & bearings product portfolio. The simplified design of W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Linesafe enables short lead times as well as fast spare part delivery and service response. In addition, the updated bearing design offers enhanced flexibility within the standard design, which can allow customers to select different product configurations based on their needs. \n\"The new W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Linesafe is revolutionary. It's a major step forward in bearing design,\" says Laura Lois, Product Manager, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Seals & Bearings. \"The W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Linesafe is designed to address the needs of marine and offshore owners and operators. The bearing design addresses market requirements such as increased radial load capacity, allowable shaft slope as well as a reduced amount of oil necessary for operation. The modular design enables the W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Linesafe bearing to be tailored for use in various operating environments, and in customer-specific applications.\" \nFurther operational improvements of the W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Linesafe standard design include readiness to connect a pump when forced lubrication is required, water cooling availability, interchangeable upper and lower bearing shells, and self-aligning design. In addition, the system can be equipped with a 'safe return to port' functionality when in flooded conditions. \nSimplified design with improved functionality \nW\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Linesafe is a hydrodynamic bearing with a modular housing made of high quality cast iron. Its self-lubrication is enabled by a cast aluminium oil ring and oil scraper. The innovative new bearing design incorporates vast advantages offered by W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4's prior intermediate shaft bearing solutions.

These systems utilize a regulated device which assists in delivering accurate quantity of fuel into each cylinder for combustion. In industrial diesel engines and high performance vehicles, this process is performed by combining an electrically functioned sequence valve with a regulated outlet to match timed injection with precise flow. Practically, all fuel injected engines use a fuel injection system with continuous flow. \nThe key driving factors for the automotive injector nozzle market is growing demand for vehicles with fuel efficiency and increasing need to conserve conventional fuel. Fuel injection increases the fuel efficiency of engines and provides advanced fuel distribution, thereby reducing the fuel requirement for the same power output. In addition, accurate and precise fuel metering decreases the concentration of harmful combustion byproducts, which in turn results in cleaner exhaust emissions. Considering all these factors, the market for automotive injector nozzles is anticipated to witness potential growth during the forecast period. Currently, there has been an increasing adoption of cost-effective, environment friendly, and fuel-efficient vehicles among consumers worldwide. Moreover, owing to stringent emission norms imposed by various regulatory bodies, manufacturers are compelled to produce automobiles with lower carbon footprints. Different geographical drivers are also responsible for the growth of the market. \nRequest Report Brochure @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=21596 \nFactors such as increasing growth of the automotive sector in developing countries such as India, China, and Brazil is expected to create expansion opportunities for the automotive injector nozzle market in the future. However, growth of the market is likely to be hampered to some extent, owing to rising demand for electric vehicles as an excellent substitute for conventional fuel engines. Injector nozzles are mostly used in fuel engines and thus growing demand for electric vehicles is likely to act as a major restraining factor. \nThe global automotive injector nozzle market can be broadly classified on the basis of technology, vehicle, fuel, and geography. By type of technology, the market has been segmented into gasoline direct injection, gasoline port fuel injection, and diesel direct injection. On the basis of vehicle type, the market is classified into passenger cars, heavy commercial vehicles, and light commercial vehicles. In terms of type of fuel, the market has been further divided into gasoline and diesel. The gasoline segment is likely to account for the largest share of the market, primarily due to increasing usage of gasoline-fueled vehicles worldwide. However, the diesel segment is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. The major reason is attributed to high thermal energy of diesel, which in turn results in better fuel efficiency compared to gasoline. \nRequest For Customization@ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=CR&rep_id=21596 \nBy geography, the market for automotive injector nozzles has been classified into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and Latin America. In the present scenario, the market is dominated by Asia Pacific in terms of revenue, followed by North America and Europe. The major factor responsible for potential development of this market in Asia Pacific is immense growth of passenger cars with fuel efficiency. China held the dominant share of the market in this region, owing to increasing automotive production, government support, and cost advantages for manufacturers among others. The automotive injector nozzle market is also anticipated to grow at a stable rate in the Middle East & Africa, and Latin America owing to expanding automotive infrastructure in these regions. \nTop players in this market are Delphi Automotive PLC (U.K.), Continental AG (Germany), Denso Corporation (Japan), Infineon Technologies AG (Germany), Robert Bosch GmbH (Germany), Magneti Marelli S.p.A (Italy), and Keihin Corporation (Japan) among others.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert bosch gmbh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "continental ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "infineon technologies ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denso corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cagr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magneti marelli s.p.a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delphi automotive plc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keihin corporation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east & africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latin america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:14.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "295f7fa405111437d58aeda55989f42fd5ee7177", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ApQiAEWQSsNC4xs9vhPGBK8rlQyLrFaXqcEpdxoBYWfAqEZiQlZ8HqqOKSsWM3ec-", "site_full": "www.babycenter.ca", "site": "babycenter.ca", "site_section": "http://www.babycenter.ca/g25018573/december-2017?startIndex=80", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "December 2017 - Page 9 - BabyCenter Canada", "title": "Name opinions", "title_full": "Name opinions - December 2017 - BabyCenter Canada", "published": "2017-12-02T22:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.436, "main_image": "https://www.babycenter.ca/webassets/countries/en_CA/logo_200x200.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82588, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f985a0325d1dba530c033eef6894a0fc48997a75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ApQiAEWQSsNC4xs9vhPGBK8rlQyLrFaXqcEpdxoBYWfAqEZiQlZ8HDBF9RDwvF.59dSes5hU3mg--", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "LizLemur", "published": "2017-12-03T22:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Malcom Bradley has a nice ring to it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:14.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "295f7fa405111437d58aeda55989f42fd5ee7177", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ApQiAEWQSsNC4xs9vhPGBK8rlQyLrFaXqcEpdxoBYWfAqEZiQlZ8HqqOKSsWM3ec-", "site_full": "www.babycenter.ca", "site": "babycenter.ca", "site_section": "http://www.babycenter.ca/g25018573/december-2017?startIndex=80", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "December 2017 - Page 9 - BabyCenter Canada", "title": "Name opinions", "title_full": "Name opinions - December 2017 - BabyCenter Canada", "published": "2017-12-02T22:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.436, "main_image": "https://www.babycenter.ca/webassets/countries/en_CA/logo_200x200.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82588, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6b5412973b5a774155b2bd344f4289e702a25628", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ApQiAEWQSsNC4xs9vhPGBK8rlQyLrFaXqcEpdxoBYWfAqEZiQlZ8HDBF9RDwvF.4.BPV7MG3jaQ--", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "lovebaby1234", "published": "2017-12-03T22:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "mackenzie Bradley is better!I have a good mother and baby shop, if you are interested, look at it.

The radiology sites specialize, among other things, in detecting and characterising musculotendinous and mammary lesions, and diagnosing abdominal diseases with 14 radiologists who conduct all of the diagnostic and therapeutic exams. The centers involved are the Radiology Services at Clinique M\u00e9dip\u00f4le Garonne, specialists in sports medicine, and Clinique d'Occitanie (in Muret), the Radiology Centres in Rieux-Volvestre and Muret and the Comminges Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Hospital Centre (in Saint-Gaudens). Just three months after announcing the release of its new Aixplorer\u00ae Ultimate product, SuperSonic Imagine has confirmed strong market interest in its latest creation. Aixplorer\u00ae Ultimate, a versatile, comprehensive and ultra-fast ultrasound system The Aixplorer\u00ae ultrasound system and its exclusive ShearWave\u2122 Elastography (SWE\u2122) imaging mode have shown their worth during radiology treatment for multiple indications (musculoskeletal, liver, breast, prostate, etc.). The clinical benefits include screening support, better characterisation of lesions, biopsy support, therapeutic follow-ups and assessment of chronic liver disease. With Aixplorer\u00ae Ultimate, which also boasts over four times more computing power than previous models, SuperSonic Imagine has found a way to satisfy a wide range of clinical needs among radiologists and physicians to benefit their patients, positioning itself as a major player in multi-parameter ultrasound imaging. \u201cIt\u2019s important for our group of medical imaging experts to ensure our equipment is constantly at the forefront of innovation, therefore a best in class solution was a natural choice for us. SuperSonic Imagine incorporates ShearWave Elastography (SWE) as well as innovations such as Angio PL.U.S. and Needle PL.U.S.,\u201d explained Fran\u00e7ois Blain, radiologist for 'Occitanie-Garonne' Medical Imaging Group. \u201cThese new tools from SuperSonic Imagine are a great help to us in identifying, locating and characterising lesions before and after treatment. They also prove themselves to be very effective ultrasound guidance tools. This is important, among other things, for tracking injections of Platelet-Rich Plasma or corticosteroids in the case of tendinopathy,\u201d continued Philippe Adam, radiologist for 'Occitanie-Garonne' Medical Imaging Group. \u201cAs well as using innovative methods, we also use more conventional Aixplorer methods such as contrast imaging using micro-bubbles. This enables us to enhance the ultrasound signal in the blood vessels after injecting the contrast product. This technique enables us to study the different arterial vascular, portal and postoperative phases in real time during organ perfusion in order to characterise tumours,\u201d added Julien Auriol, radiologist for 'Occitanie-Garonne' Group. \u201cWe are very proud to supply Occitanie-Garonne Group with these six Aixplorer Ultimate systems. This purchase shows the performance of Aixplorer and its ShearWave technology in a variety of indications. The fusion and navigation module, which helps to combine ultrasound images in real time with the MRI, scanner, and PET, was also a decisive factor. For the breast, the ShearWave Elastography enhances the diagnostic performance of the ultrasound by improving the characterisation of mammary lesions. It also helps to reduce the number of negative biopsies. For the liver, it helps to assess the level of hepatic fibrosis by measuring the stiffness of the liver and, with the hepatorenal index, it helps to quantify alcoholic (ASH) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),\u201d stated Yves Tenaglia, Vice President for Europe, Middle East and Africa at SuperSonic Imagine. About SuperSonic Imagine Founded in 2005 and based in Aix-en-Provence (France), Supersonic Imagine is a company that specialises in medical imaging. The company designs, develops and markets a revolutionary ultrasound platform, Aixplorer\u00ae, which uses UltraFast\u2122 technology that can acquire images around 200 times faster than conventional ultrasound systems. In addition to providing exceptional image quality, this unique technology is the foundation of several innovations which have changed the paradigm of ultrasound imaging: ShearWave\u2122 Elastography (SWE\u2122), Angio PL.U.S \u2013 Planewave UltraSensitive\u2122 Imaging and, more recently, TriVu and Needle PL.US. ShearWave Elastography allows physicians to visualise and analyse the stiffness of tissue in real-time using a reliable, reproducible and non-invasive procedure. This is an important parameter in diagnosing potentially malignant lesions or other diseased tissue. As of today, over 300 publications have demonstrated the value of SWE in the care of patients with a wide range of diseases. The UltraFast Doppler combines colour flow imaging and pulsed wave Doppler into one simple test, providing physicians with the results of both simultaneously, therefore enhancing the efficiency. The latest innovation, Angio PL.U.S, provides a higher level of microvascular imaging through significantly improved colour sensitivity and spatial resolution, while maintaining exceptional 2D image quality. SuperSonic Imagine has been granted regulatory clearances for the commercialisation of Aixplorer\u00ae on the main markets. Since April 2014, the SuperSonic Imagine company has been listed on Euronext, symbol: SSI).

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) Kirsty Wigglesworth Save \nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Ireland expects the U.K. to make a new Brexit proposal by Friday as officials in London struggle to resolve issues surrounding the Irish border that are stalling talks over Britain's departure from the European Union. \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure to persuade EU leaders to declare that sufficient progress has been made on divorce issues with the EU, including the Irish border, when they meet next week in Brussels so talks can move on to trade and future relations between the two sides. Business leaders warn further delays will hurt companies as they plan for the future. \nIreland's prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said late Wednesday that he hopes May will submit a new offer \"tonight or tomorrow.\" Disagreements over rules governing the border between the Republic of Ireland, which is a member of the EU, and the U.K. province of Northern Ireland derailed an earlier proposal. \nExisting rules allow people and goods to pass freely between the Republic and Northern Ireland with no border checks. Ireland wants to preserve the current arrangement, which has eased tensions along the border. May is struggling to balance those demands against the concerns of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to support her government in Parliament. \nVaradkar said Wednesday that avoiding a hard border remains his \"absolute red line.\" \n\"We will not loosen our position,\" he told Ireland's Parliament, the Dail. \"We will stay very firm.\" \nThe British and Irish prime ministers discussed the Brexit impasse in a phone call Wednesday, but there was no sign of an imminent breakthrough. \nMay's office said she and Varadkar are \"working hard to find a specific solution to the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland,\" which have triggered a crisis in Britain's divorce negotiations. \nIn Brussels, the EU's executive Commission is talking with the British government to organize a visit by May by Sunday. \n\"We here in the commission are still in discussions with London and the whole EU 27, notably with Dublin. So far, no white smoke,\" said EU Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas. \nHe rejected British media speculation that May could be given until next week to demonstrate \"sufficient progress\" on the three key issues of the Brexit divorce. \n\"We stand ready to receive Prime Minister May at any moment in time when they are ready,\" Schinas said, but warned: \"This will have to have to happen this week.\" \n\"Every day lost makes this more difficult,\" he said. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

I've had a general anxiety disorder (GAD) most of my life with memories as early as 9yrs old, I've also experienced bouts of depression in my adult years. I have family members that have suffered with their mental health and unfortunatley the thing we all have in common is we suffered silently and ignorantly for far too long before understanding what we were experiencing and feeling. On top of that, finding the support with the cultural and religious sensitivity to help us navigate through these experiences was incredibly difficult.\nPersonally, I've seen a great deal of mental health advocacy, and I think it's incredible. It's becoming more of a conversation and moving in the right direction. However, I fail to see much diversity in representation when mental health is indiscriminatory. I sort counselling on a few occassions and found that most of my time was explaining my culture and faith and why seemingly social norms would be triggers of shame, guilt, and anxiety. This is why this multicultural experiences forum is something I'm excited to be a part of and look forward to engaging with people on their experiences and be able to relate through the lived experiences that come with our heritege.\nEmpathetically,\nHawraa", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:16.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42f1c3a8278c3336e8b34ad3dc6c1ff3c6dd482d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzqZpMjCUi_nSlTWmuh0h93MvABF4k7cJAvb8SP8ElVg8Q--", "site_full": "www.booking.com", "site": "booking.com", "site_section": "https://www.booking.com/hotel/ch/rutli.en-gb.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Sorell Hotel R\u00fctli, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland - Booking.com ", "title": "1252 Verified Hotel Reviews of Sorell Hotel R\u00fctli | Booking.com", "title_full": "1252 Verified Hotel Reviews of Sorell Hotel R\u00fctli | Booking.com", "published": "2017-01-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 68, "participants_count": 59, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "https://t-ec.bstatic.com/static/img/facebook-image-else/566c7081f1deeaca39957e96365c3908f83b95af.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 105, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9939711ddf8fe7a4815176d1f34b0048c4b061f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzqZpMjCUi_nSlTWmuh0h93MvABF4k7cJAtqTF3xFqpBlD.BWjZ3WlZfMSw_vVeKz6lQ3ePFRVchF2HfqQ.lNpCE", "ord_in_thread": 68, "author": "Kerry", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\"Great location before an early flight.\"", "text": "\ub209 Staff could have been friendlier but did assist when we requested a kettle and cups for our room.\n\ub207 Spacious room and comfy bed.

Charles Dickens\n27th Special Operations Wing Public Affairs\nDecember 04, 2017\nCANNON AIR FORCE BASE, N.M. \u2014 A C-130H Hercules arrived on the flightline of Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico on November 29, 2017 with no intention of leaving. The plane is being absorbed into the 16th Special Operations Squadron\u2019s repertoire to more easily manage pilot training proficiencies, in addition to other positives.\n\u201cThe purpose of gaining the C-130H is to facilitate aircrew training and free up our combat-coded aircraft to perform their primary missions,\u201d said Maj. Carrie Kerner, 27th Special Operations Aircraft Maintenance Squadron operations officer.\nCannon AFB has been managing missions and training using AC-130W Stinger IIs, which provide a similar experience, but with unnecessary complexity.\n\u201cThis is our first and only C-130H at Cannon,\u201d Kerner said. \u201cWe refer to this as a \u2018slick\u2019 C-130 because it doesn\u2019t have the additional capabilities and equipment that our AC-130Ws have been modified for, like the 105mm cannon and 30mm gun. The AC-130W is essentially a heavily-modified C-130H in high demand and short supply.\u201d\nWhile the AC-130W is an incredible gunship, using it to maintain training is not the best use of this aircraft, with millions of dollars in upgrades over the C-130H. These upgrades increase maximum combat capabilities, though are not necessary for maintaining pilot proficiencies.\n\u201cFrom a maintenance perspective, the C-130H is simpler and cheaper to maintain,\u201d Kerner said. \u201cPlus, when the C-130H is down for maintenance repairs, there is no impact to our alert commitment or deployment rotations.\u201d\nOverall, the addition of a C-130H Hercules to Cannon AFB will provide the base and the 16th SOS with a welcome increase in proficiency capabilities while also increasing mission strength and readiness.\n\u201cNothing spurs creativity and ingenuity more than seeing an idea go from the bottom up and gain traction so quickly,\u201d said Lt. Col. Adam Moore, 16th SOS Commander. \u201cWith this aircraft, we will be able to provide critical pilot proficiency to allow our mission AC-130W aircraft to focus on tactical training and ensure we have the squadron ready to execute the nation's most difficult missions at all times.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:17.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ccf533376f9d3bea75e9a78c6b013c1966f2744e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZi9883G6hNKaeeZBTabUWfI1lGS.Jpt_5E", "site_full": "www.beyondblue.org.au", "site": "beyondblue.org.au", "site_section": "http://www.beyondblue.org.au/connect-with-others/online-forums/multicultural-experiences", "site_categories": ["health", "panic_anxiety_disorders", "depression"], "section_title": "Multicultural experiences ", "title": "How culture related stress made me feel depressed", "title_full": "How culture related stress made me feel depressed", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.138, "main_image": "https://www.beyondblue.org.au/App_Themes/standard/images/BB_FB_logo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "80b1f94f56f1c309a4106983731ccfefa450f64c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZi9883G6hNKaeeZBTabUWfI0FhzxGsj34vwqBZalx6ijZMnW2omzgnuP4QuTJv3AF_", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "J.M.12345", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hi Spencer,\nI'm sorry to hear that you've passed through such a tough time. James gave plenty of great advice.\nI'm a migrant myself but migrated at a young age with my parents. Therefore, these pressures your deal with are also ones I have seen my parents undergo! The struggle of starting from scratch, buying a house, car etc. Finding your identity in a foreign country and gaining that sense of belonging and community, without forgetting your old home. And then there's missing family and friends and your childhood country! It's all so tough.\nIt sounds like you're doing the right thing though by visiting your GP and taking care of your mental health. Listen to the doctors, go to therapy, exercise, eat healthy, do all that it takes to stay mentally well! You've got heaps of hardships but a smooth sea never made a skilful sailor as they say.\nIn James' last post, he mentioned hobbies. I agree entirely that hobbies are a really good way to destress and take your mind off things. Joining a new activity like swimming or trying something like gardening can help you stop and smell the roses (literally!) and can go a long way in reducing that anxiety from all the hardships that surround you.\nWell done for speaking up though and volunteering. I'm sure many others will benefit from hearing your story and in a way, that is doing good for the world.\nCheers,\nJosette", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:18.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6493064c89526785546b809d5a22d452a4c0b9d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBIpEu4AXCvIlVc5odxwEYoUPAFiXZ9VkHrEyntynoBU9JxOAbb08q3oSabPg.6HuVRkp6SIf257Zp", "site_full": "www.lse.co.uk", "site": "lse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.lse.co.uk/share-chat.asp?page=140", "site_categories": ["united_kingdom", "travel", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Share Chat on London South East.

From my personal experience over the past few years, I find it is really hard to adapt myself to a new country and obtaining a permanent visa/citizenship is not an easy task. It is not like taking candy from a baby, in fact, I have overcome difficulties since the first day I arrived Australia.\nI was diagnosed with depression a few months after I quit my first office job in Australia. At that time, I felt so stressed because so many pressures had been exerted on me at the same time.\nFirst, while I was working, I had to spend nearly three hours on traveling between home and work every working day, indeed. I need to buy a car. But I have to get Australian driver\u2019s license after grant of permanent visa. Believe or not, I failed the road test three times even after I practiced more than 50 hours with a professional instructor. I was so frustrated and I couldn\u2019t believe I failed again and again.\nSecond, I was planning to get my accountant certificate, so I booked an exam, paid fees online and then study materials would be sent to me. However, they sent a parcel to the wrong place and did not arrange redelivery until one month later. This certainly distorted my entire plan and made me worried a lot. What was worse, the process of being a certified accountant in Australia is quite different from my home country. The job I was doing does not satisfy the requirement in Australia, so I questioned my ability and totally confused about my future.\nPerhaps family pressure was the last straw for me. In my culture, a man is supposed to be independent at the age of thirty, and it usually implies that I should possess a good and stable job, a vehicle and a house. My parents urged me to buy a house in Australia and they planned to sell their own house in order to help me pay for the deposit. Parental love is great, but it made me feel guilty.\nAll these things happened in three months and finally I exploded and quit my job. After being unemployed for a few months, I became depressed and attempted suicide. When I came back to life, I changed my mind. There are so many people living in poverty, illiteracy and war zones, and they still struggling to live no matter what happened to them. Maybe I was chosen to go through these difficulties, so all I need to do is to find the best way to cope with problems, build up my resistance to stress and carry on.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:11:18.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ccf533376f9d3bea75e9a78c6b013c1966f2744e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZi9883G6hNKaeeZBTabUWfI1lGS.Jpt_5E", "site_full": "www.beyondblue.org.au", "site": "beyondblue.org.au", "site_section": "http://www.beyondblue.org.au/connect-with-others/online-forums/multicultural-experiences", "site_categories": ["health", "panic_anxiety_disorders", "depression"], "section_title": "Multicultural experiences ", "title": "How culture related stress made me feel depressed", "title_full": "How culture related stress made me feel depressed", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.138, "main_image": "https://www.beyondblue.org.au/App_Themes/standard/images/BB_FB_logo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4a0c2e6ee3dce60646083f4efb7d76fa5c89df90", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZi9883G6hNKaeeZBTabUWfI0FhzxGsj34vWXNyLPpY3weUnqa8jxE6AYKIeqgomkzw", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "james1", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "hi spencerstriver,\noh you are chinese as well?

I took extra dose for another nine months and now I\u2019ve been stopped taking it for roughly two months.\nNo doubt that your father had similar experience during first few years in Australia. However, I was raised from a single child family, so nobody could share the responsibility with me for taking care of old parents. Think of your grandparents, are they well looked after by your uncles/aunts? Having siblings is actually a irreplacable advantage for immigrants.\nAnother thing concerned me a lot is that my parents are old now and their don\u2019t speak English at all. Even if I were able to bring them to Australia, they wouldn\u2019t feel happy. Once my father visited me and we were stepping out shopping centre and a guy drove past and threw eggs on us. This is an extreme case we encountered only once in our lives, but we\u2019ve seen cold voilences/verbal abuse many times in Australia.

It was great, until stuff started falling apart a few months later. The funnest part was when I grabbed the front brake lever and it did nothing but squirt brake fluid across my glove. I Flintstone-stopped it, dragging my boots on the pavement until the whole bike was just inside the intersection, then walked it back out of traffic. Luckily I was only doing about 20MPH before I started coming up to the intersection. I didn't get around to fixing that deathtrap before I had to move across the country (family stuff), though I sure as hell did get the brakes fixed within a few days. When I moved, I sold the bike to a friend with full \"this thing needs work, don't get yourself killed\" warnings for forty bucks.\nLast year, I traded a broken car for my second XJ650. It's a 1981 Maxim with a dented tank and non-operational turn signals. I got a relay (the , and tested it by bridging contacts with a screwdriver to get the lights blinking, but the switch in the left-side controls had disintegrated, so my next step is replacing that. I have some other changes in mind, including getting a different tank (the current tank is dented, and I want a Seca tank anyway) and different handlebars.\nI found this site by looking for information I'll need while working on my \"new\" Maxim. I used a DuckDuckGo web search to find it, and specifically searched for an XJ650-friendly forum because I have found that forums seem to be the places to go for communities that know about specific bike models.\nThose handlebars are twisted back because when they're upright I can't see past my shoulders in the mirrors.
