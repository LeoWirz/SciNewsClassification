Her silence is striking, highlighting the parallels between the singer and the president: their adept use of social media to foster a diehard support base; their solipsism; their laser focus on the bottom line; their support among the \u2018alt-right.\u2019\u201d \nThe paper went on to detail a raft of complaints about Swift. That her songs \u201cecho Mr Trump\u2019s obsession with petty score-settling in their repeated references to her celebrity feuds, or report in painstaking detail on her failed romantic relationships.\u201d How she has \u201cdirected her extraordinary self-promotional skills towards cultivating a dedicated and emotional army of followers.\u201d That her coterie of friends and hangers-on is \u201clargely thin, white and wealthy.\u201d \nSwift\u2019s suspicious reticence, the editorial concludes, must be \u201ca product of her inward gaze, perhaps, or her pettiness and refusal to concede to critics. Swift seems not simply a product of the age of Trump, but a musical envoy for the president\u2019s values.\u201d \nReally. \nAnd this was hardly the first time a news outlet had called out Swift, a superstar so famous that she has resorted to hiding behind umbrellas , propped up curtains and walking backwards to avoid being photographed.Her most recent album, Reputation, has already sold 1.6 million copies in just 3 weeks. Since last summer, when Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee, the Pennylvania-born and Tennessee-bred singer has been barraged by demands from liberals that she denounce him \u2014 despite the fact that she rarely voices a political opinion, let alone one about the world\u2019s most polarizing man. During the 2016 campaign, media outlets scrutinized Swift\u2019s social feeds for signs of her political leanings \u2014 and some writers demanded she denounce Trump after his \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape went public. At one point, Mashable even speculated that an Instagram post showing Swift with a bare shoulder was actually a secret sign that she was voting for Hillary Clinton. On Election Day, Taylor Swift was the top name for those searching for celebrities\u2019 voting preferences. \nSwift was the perfect front woman for this non-campaign campaign. \nBut why? Why does anyone care what this 27-year-old music artist who was so devoted to her craft that her parents moved to Nashville when she was 14, this singer who never attended a day of college, thinks about the president of the United States? \n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a knee-jerk thing,\u201d says Shaun Cullen, who teaches about contemporary culture and popular music at Middle Tennessee State University. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to signify your solidarity or opposition to whatever Trump is doing if you\u2019re in that tribe or to criticize the liberal media if you\u2019re in the other tribe.\u201d \nBut which tribe is Taylor Swift in? *** \nIn the course of her career, with few exceptions, Swift has always said she sticks to music, not politics. At a time when nearly every aspect of American culture is politicized \u2014 singers, actors, late-night hosts, TV networks and even car-sharing services are expected to align themselves with one side of the cultural divide or the other \u2014 it can come across as an odd idiosyncracy, not a principled stance. \nBut Swift has been impressively consistent on this front. Her polite side-stepping of thorny political questions dates back to 2008, when she participated in Lifetime Television\u2019s \u201cEvery Woman Counts,\u201d a bus tour aimed at boosting female participation in politics. The network described it as \u201cthe only public service campaign dedicated to encouraging women to speak out on the issues they care about most\u201d \u2014 but like most corporate-run events, the women were not really meant to speak out much at all. \nAnd Swift was the perfect front woman for this non-campaign campaign. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna sit here and go into my political views cause that\u2019s not what I chose to do. I chose to do music,\u201d she said when asked about her beliefs in an interview with the network. Her stance since then has remained more or less the same \u2014 though at times she\u2019s hinted at anodyne, mainstream views that could be interpreted as liberal. \nLater that year, for instance, Swift filmed a PSA for an LGBT organization following the death of a teenager from an anti-gay hate crime and told Seventeen magazine, \u201cMy parents taught me never to judge others based on whom they love, what color their skin is, or their religion.\u201d In 2009, after Barack Obama\u2019s election, she gave Rolling Stone an artfully worded non-endorsement of the results. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this country so happy about a political decision in my entire time of being alive,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so glad this was my first election.\u201d Swift, the writer observed, seemed \u201cconstantly worried about saying something that could be construed as offensive to her fans.\u201d \nSwift has spent time with the Kennedy family and spoke admiringly of Ethel Kennedy when she dated Ethel\u2019s grandson Conor in 2012. She called herself a \u201chuge fan\u201d of Michelle Obama\u2019s when the then-first lady presented her with an award for her philanthropic efforts. Yet when pressed on the election that year, she reiterated , \u201cI try to keep myself as educated and informed as possible. But I don\u2019t talk about politics because it might influence other people. And I don\u2019t think that I know enough yet in life to be telling people who to vote for.\u201d At the time, Swift was a 22-year-old woman who had already amassed a fortune in the tens of millions. \nShe has expressed support for feminism and gay marriage but only in recent years, once the cultural tide had firmly shifted. As the 2016 election approached, pressure mounted on Swift to endorse a candidate, with headlines reading \u201c Taylor Swift\u2019s Loud Election Silence \u201d and \u201c It\u2019s time for Taylor Swift to say something about Donald Trump .\u201d Her only comment was a picture of herself on Election Day with the caption, \u201cToday is the day. Go out and VOTE.\u201d taylor swift finally told u who she\u2019s voting for with a SWEATER. i\u2019m screaming pic.twitter.com/aqECzAkCOh \n\u2014 Kaitlyn Tiffany (@kait_tiffany) November 8, 2016 *** \nSwift is an anomaly in an industry in which most of her peers are eager to distance themselves from Trump, and thus many see her refusal to condemn him as a tacit approval. Even Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood \u2014 two country artists who are hardly known as political \u2014 mocked him at the Country Music Association awards last month. \n\u201cWhether pop stars like it or not, these days all culture has become politicized,\u201d says Cullen. \u201cAnd she\u2019s not a political artist, so she\u2019s gonna seem a little out of step with our current time.\u201d \nYet while major male artists have remained similarly tight-lipped about their opinions, none has received the same backlash, as Swift has complained in the past about a similar double standard regarding her music. \u201c You\u2019re gonna have people who gonna say \u2018Oh she just writes songs about her ex-boyfriends,\u2019 and I think frankly that\u2019s a very sexist angle to take,\u201d she told an Australian radio station. \u201cNo one says that about Ed Sheeran. No one says that about Bruno Mars. They\u2019re all writing songs about their exes, their current girlfriends, their love life, and no one raises a red flag there.\u201d \nIn recent interviews, she\u2019s lamented the way female celebrities are pitted against each other, and emphasized the importance of supporting other women by bringing out many of her famous friends during her performances. She now proudly calls herself a feminist, explaining that she didn\u2019t know what the word meant when she declined to do so earlier in her career. But her critics have zeroed in on one alleged blind spot: her approach to race. \nIn 2015, Swift got into a brief dustup with Nicki Minaj when the Trinidadian-American hip-hop star called out the Video Music Awards for snubbing women of color, which Swift initially misunderstood as a personal attack. \u201cIf your video celebrates women with very slim bodies, you will be nominated for vid of the year,\u201d Minaj tweeted, to which Swift responded, \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing but love & support you. It\u2019s unlike you to pit women against each other. Maybe one of the men took your slot.\u201d Two days later, she followed up: \u201cI thought I was being called out. I missed the point, I misunderstood, then misspoke. I\u2019m sorry, Nicki.\u201d Minaj accepted her apology and the two performed together at the VMAs that year.Last winter, when Swift expressed support for the Women\u2019s March on Twitter but did not attend herself, she ignited a firestorm of accusations for supposedly supporting a narrow, self-interested brand of white feminism. \n\u201cShe was using popular feminism as a way to rebrand, but at least in her public persona, she hasn\u2019t been a very political person,\u201d says Elizabeth Affuso, who studies celebrity and popular feminism at Pitzer College. \u201cBecause she had aligned herself with \u2018girl squad culture\u2019 \u2026 there was an expectation that she might participate, which she then didn\u2019t do.\u201d \nSwift has recently been vocal on the issue of sexual assault. She donated $250,000 to the pop singer Kesha in the midst of her lawsuit against a producer accused of drugging, raping and abusing her. She also took the witness stand for a sexual assault case this past summer, delivering blistering testimony against a radio host she said had groped her at a meet-and-greet event in 2013. On Wednesday she was featured as one of the \u201cSilence Breakers\u201d on the cover of Time magazine for her court battle, giving her first interview (in writing) in well over a year. U.S. President Donald Trump | Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images \nIn the past few months she has \u2018liked\u2019 several posts on the blogging platform Tumblr \u2014 one Swift\u2019s few methods of communication these days \u2014 that bemoan the comparisons between her and Trump. \nFor the most part, though, Swift has been studiously apolitical to a degree that\u2019s difficult in the Trump era \u2014 and critics assume her calculation is an economic one. Unlike most of her peers in pop, her roots are in country music, and many speculate she is fearful of alienating a large portion of her fan base who might support Trump. \n\u201c[Successful artists] have whole industries around them that they\u2019ve built to support them, and those people \u2014 generally speaking \u2014 they only have one interest and that\u2019s for the money to keep flowing,\u201d explains Howie Klein, former president of Reprise Records. \u201cI can imagine that someone like her is gonna be driven by almost her own little Taylor Swift industry around her doing quick calculations of cost-benefit analysis.\u201d \nBut Hilary Rosen, a Democratic communications strategist who served as chairman and CEO of the Recording Industry Association of America for 17 years, said in an email that if artists approach politics authentically like they do with their art, \u201cthey can both accomplish a lot and keep their fans.\u201d \nThe one exception, she acknowledges, is indeed country music, noting how the Dixie Chicks famously denounced President George W. Bush and the Iraq war in 2003 and were effectively exiled from the country music community. \u201cBut that is changing and there is a lot more diversity of thought,\u201d Rosen adds. \u201cI think that President Trump has actually pushed artists to be freer about their views because his divisiveness is as distasteful for many Republicans as it is for others.\u201d \nWith so much demand for Swift to reveal her preferences, many of her friends are bombarded with questions about her in interviews, providing some of the only clues to Swift\u2019s politics. \nSwift has had to break with her apolitical approach only a few times, as when she faced an uncomfortable outpouring of support among the alt-right. \n\u201cI just think everyone has to do it their way,\u201d Swift\u2019s famously liberal friend Lena Dunham, who campaigned for Hillary Clinton, told Rolling Stone . \u201cWhen I was lesser-known, I was like, \u2018Who could not share their opinion?\u2019 Then I found out that when you talk about politics, people straight up tweet you the floor plan of your house and say they\u2019re coming to your house. You have to fucking watch it because people are nuts.\u201d \n\u201cMany people have been tweeting me, \u2018She supports Trump! She probably voted for Trump!\u2019 They\u2019re making this huge assumption, when Taylor has never to my knowledge come out and said anything about her being pro-Trump,\u201d the singer and Broadway actor Todrick Hall told Yahoo! in an interview where he recalled discussing racism and watching the documentary \u201813 th \u2019 with Swift and her family at Thanksgiving dinner. \n\u201cMaybe one day, Taylor will start being super-political, and using her voice to do the things that people think that she should be doing. But even then, she will probably be ridiculed for not being vocal enough, or not being on the right side,\u201d Hall continued. \u201cI don\u2019t think that there is a way to win in this industry, so every person has to take their own journey at their own pace, at their own time, and do what they feel like is right.\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t think every entertainer has to tell you exactly how they voted,\u201d Joseph Kahn, who directed six of Swift\u2019s music videos, told Variety . \u201cBut I think you can imply by who they are and who they hang out with what they are.\u201d \nBy this logic there can be little doubt where Swift\u2019s loyalties lie: Nearly all of those in her close circle of friends regularly express disdain for Trump and support for liberal policies on social media. One of her closest friends, the supermodel Karlie Kloss \u2013 who is dating Jared Kushner\u2019s liberal brother, Joshua Kushner \u2013 has endorsed Hillary Clinton and criticized Trump . \nShe has had to break with her apolitical approach only a few times, as when she faced an uncomfortable outpouring of support among the alt-right, some of whom see the pale blonde singer as an \u201cAryan goddess\u201d and claim she is a secret Nazi. In October, her attorney sent a letter to the editor of the obscure culture blog PopFront demanding a retraction of a post accusing the singer of supporting white supremacy and threatening litigation. The letter said that Swift had \u201crepeatedly and consistently denounced white supremacy\u201d and provided evidence in the form of a different letter sent by Swift\u2019s lawyer and a Washington Post article that declared flatly, \u201cTaylor Swift is not a white supremacist.\u201d \nThe letter also provides one of the few public clues into Swift\u2019s apolitical reasoning. \u201cMs. Swift has no obligation to campaign for any particular political candidate or broadcast her political views, and the fact that her political views are not public enough for your taste does not give you the authority to presume what her political opinions may be,\u201d her attorney wrote. \u201cIndeed, through this story, you attempt to impose a duty upon Ms. Swift (and only Ms. Swift) to loudly state her views on whatever hot-button issue is circulating at any given time.\u201d \nOther than that, however, she\u2019s mostly kept her views to herself \u2014 to the chagrin of her critics. \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem that anyone in Taylor Swift\u2019s camp believes that they have an ethical obligation to pick a side,\u201d says Affuso. \u201cBy not ascribing to any value publicly she\u2019s allowed herself to be whatever anyone wants her to be.\u201d \nGenevieve Glatsky is an intern for Politico Magazine.

The connection between the Champ and Dink works really well and it\u2019s easy to believe that they are really father and son. Beery deservingly won an Oscar for best actor for this role because we really can feel the pain and difficulties that he constantly faces and tries to overcome.   Wallace Beery actually got one less vote than Fredric March in the 1931/1932 Academy Awards voting for best actor, but the rules at the time considered anyone with one or two votes less than the leader as being in a tie. So both got Academy Awards.

Restrictions were put on the use of fossil fuel and many subsidies and incentives were introduced to boost the adoption of renewable sources of energy. \nBut in one fell swoop last month, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order which began the demolition of a wide range of Barack Obama\u2019s policies on global warming and climate change. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. \n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 \nWhile the world is planning to reduce dependency on fossil fuels, US has rolled-back incentives that were powering the country\u2019s emerging renewable industry and now has lifted restrictions on the coal industry to create more mining jobs. \nDespite numerous benefits, such hostility towards renewables is understandable as there is a profit motive attached to it. \n\u201cLed by the oil and gas industry, the energy and natural resources sector regularly pumps the vast majority of its campaign contributions into Republican coffers,\u201d says opensecrets.org , an American website that keeps a track of federal campaign contributions and lobbying data. \n\u201cSince the 1990 election cycle, interests from this sector have contributed more than two-thirds of its campaign contributions to Republican candidates. Another big contributor in this sector \u2013 and another big GOP supporter \u2013 is the electric utilities industry. Less generous, but even more partisan, is the mining industry,\u201d it adds. \nFor the 2015-2016 US election cycle, the energy/natural resources space donated around USD 87 million to Republicans and President Trump received a donation of USD 1,576,360 from this sector. \nWhen such big money is brought in to the equation, it is understandable why Republicans turn a blind eye towards climate change and pass the buck on to the developing nations. \nA few days ago, Republican politician Rick Santorum again passed the blame on to India and China for the increasing level of CO2 emission. \nOn Real Time with Bill Maher, when Santorum was asked to defend Trump\u2019s decision on the roll-back of subsidies to renewable industries, he said, \u201cThe vast majority of the new CO2 emissions is not coming from the United states, it\u2019s coming from China, from India.\u201d \nWhen Bill Maher, host of the show, said that \u2018these countries get it\u2019 and acknowledge the threat of climate change, Santorum disagreed and said, \u201cNo, they don\u2019t. They are building coal power plants right now in China, they are building them in India.\u201d \nFact check \nIt is true that there is an increase in carbon emission by India and China due to homegrown consumption and lack of infrastructure. But let\u2019s keep in mind that India\u2019s carbon emissions per capita are still 10 times lower and China\u2019s is half of that compared to the US. \nAccording to the Climate Change Performance Index released this year, India\u2019s per capita emissions are still relatively low, but emis\u00adsions are rapidly increasing. \n\u201c25 percent of the growing energy supply is covered by renewables, but there still is room for improvements. National experts value that the Indian gov\u00adernment runs one of the largest renewable capacity expan\u00adsion programmes in the world, which leads to a good policy performance for the country,\u201d it said. \nThe report acknowledges China\u2019s efforts towards the adoption of renewable energy despite it being the largest CO2 emitter. \n\u201cChina\u2019s posi\u00adtive trend in the development of renewable energy \u2014which according to national energy experts is in line with the goal of a 20 percent share of its primary energy supply from re\u00adnewable sources \u2014 is reflected by an improvement of four places in this category. National experts are positive about the possibility of CO2 emissions peaking before 2030, that is, earlier as planned,\u201d the report said. \nThe United States lost some ground in almost every index category, landing on rank 43. \n\u201cNational experts have a differing opinion on their country\u2019s performance in international policy contexts. While most of them stress that under the Obama admin\u00adistration, the US played a key leadership role in reaching global climate agreements, coming forward with bilateral announcements with decisive partners such as China, India, Mexico and Brazil, some experts criticised their country for hindering ambition on loss and damage within the Paris Agreement,\u201d the report said. \n\u201cWith the results of the presidential elections of November 8, the future of recent progress in US climate policy is in real danger of regression,\u201d it added. \nAccordingly to India\u2019s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), the total renewable capacity including solar, wind, bio-mass and small hydro grew by around 11.2 GW in FY17, at par with thermal capacity addition, which registered a decline of 50 percent in the year. \nFigure \u2013 Renewable and thermal power capacity addition, MW \n\u201cThe country added 5,526 MW of new solar capacity (up 83 percent over FY 2015-16) and 5,400 MW of new wind capacity (up 63 percent) in the year. While these numbers are impressive, it is worth noting that the solar capacity addition including rooftop solar is almost 50 percent below the annual target of 12,000 MW. In contrast, wind capacity addition was +35 percent over the 4,000 MW target,\u201d Bridge to India reports. \nIn 2015, China had the biggest financial commitment to renewable energy, investing over USD 100 billion, an increase from USD 3 billion just over 10 years ago. \nKey data for top 5 CO2 emitters. Source: CCPI 2017 \n\u201cSince 2015, India has emerged as the leading country for renewable deals outside the US, accounting for nearly 8 percent of global deal share.

Al Franken (D-Minn.) after determining that they could no longer tolerate his presence in their midst as a growing number of women accused him of sexual harassment. \nThey turned on one of their party\u2019s most popular figures with stunning swiftness, led by the Senate\u2019s Democratic women, who were joined in short order by more than half of the Democratic caucus. \n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said at a news conference. \u201cWe need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is okay, none of it is acceptable. We as elected leaders should absolutely be held to a higher standard, not a lower standard, and we should fundamentally be valuing women. That is where this debate has to go.\u201d \nFranken\u2019s office said he would make an announcement about his future on Thursday. Minnesota Public Radio reported Wednesday afternoon that Franken planned to resign, but Franken\u2019s office quickly denied it on Twitter. \u201cNot accurate,\u201d the tweet stated. \u201cNo final decision has been made and the Senator is still talking with his family.\u201d \nIf he steps down soon, a replacement would be appointed by Minnesota\u2019s Democratic governor to serve until the 2018 election. \nThe drive to purge Franken, coming a day after Rep. John Con\u00adyers Jr. (D-Mich.) resigned under pressure in the House, was a dramatic indication of the political toxicity that has grown around the issue of sexual harassment in recent months. \nIt also stood as a stark \u2014 and deliberate \u2014 contrast with how the Republicans are handling a parallel situation in Alabama, where Roy Moore, their candidate for U.S. Senate in next week\u2019s special election, is accused by women of pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. \nAlthough most of the alleged actions took place before he was a senator, Franken was becoming a growing liability to his party, and Republicans had seized upon the allegations against him. \nAt Moore\u2019s Tuesday night rally, conservative pundit Gina Loudon declared that Republicans did not need lectures on morality from Democrats who had struggled with their own sex scandals, and cited both Conyers and Franken. \nPresident Trump, himself the target of multiple allegations of sexual assault, has enthusiastically endorsed Moore, and the Republican Party is once again pouring money into the race after pulling back. Leading Senate Republicans have also toned down their negative comments about Moore, saying his fate should be up to the voters of Alabama and \u2014 if he is elected \u2014 the Senate Ethics Committee. \n\u201cI\u2019m looking for where are the Republican voices? Where is their outrage?\u201d Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) said on CNN. \nRepublican leaders remained quiet amid the developments. \nAsked about Franken, Senate GOP Whip John Cornyn (Tex.) said he would \u201cleave it up to [Democrats] to deal with members of their own party.\u201d \nThe move by Senate Democrats to oust Franken marked a dramatic turnaround in the fortunes of the onetime \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star. The senator from Minnesota had emerged as one of the Trump administration\u2019s sharpest foils on Capitol Hill \u2014 and as a potential 2020 presidential contender. \nSen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) stood in front of journalists outside his Capitol Hill office on Nov. 27 to comment on the sexual harassment allegations against him. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) \nOver the past three weeks, more than a half-dozen women have accused Franken of unwanted advances and touching. He apologized, saying in some cases that he had not intended to give offense and in others that he did not recall events as the women did. \nThe latest allegation against Franken came in a report published Wednesday by Politico . A former congressional aide whose name was withheld by the publication claimed that Franken had tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006, two years before his election to the Senate. \nThe woman claimed that Franken had told her, \u201cIt\u2019s my right as an entertainer.\u201d \nFranken\u2019s alleged offenses were arguably less serious than those attributed to Moore, or to Conyers, the longest-serving member of Congress, who was accused of demanding sexual favors from the women who worked for him. Until late last week, it appeared that Franken\u2019s fellow Democrats would allow his case to work its way through the Senate Ethics Committee, a process that would take months and perhaps years to reach a resolution. \nAs recently as Nov. 26, Sen Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), the Senate\u2019s second-ranking Democrat, had argued on CNN: \u201cAl Franken has acknowledged what he did was wrong, and it was wrong. He has also submitted his whole case to the Senate Ethics Committee. I think that was the right thing to do. Let\u2019s have a hearing, an investigation. Let\u2019s let this really reach whatever conclusion it is going to reach, but through a due process.\u201d \nBut on Wednesday, Durbin expressed no such forbearance. \u201cSenator Franken\u2019s conduct was wrong. He has admitted to it. And he should resign from the Senate.\u201d \nEven as Senate Democrats expressed support publicly for leaving Franken\u2019s fate in the hands of the Ethics Committee, his female colleagues were increasingly unsettled as new accusers went public. \n\u201cPeople were at the edge of their patience with this. They\u2019d had enough. One more allegation was going to be it,\u201d said one senior aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations. \nAnother said female Democratic senators had been discussing it among themselves \u201con the Senate floor, even in the ladies\u2019 room.\u201d \n\u201cMany people have been talking about this for some time,\u201d Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t coordinated. It just happened.\u201d \nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who has served in the Senate longer than most of her female colleagues, said it was \u201csignificant that the women on his side of the aisle led the way\u201d and added that she believed the latest allegation was \u201cin some ways the final straw for people.\u201d \nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), joined at left by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), meets reporters following a closed-door strategy session on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. (J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press) \nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who had stood by his friend in the wake of the allegations, called Franken after the Politico story broke early Wednesday and told him directly he had to resign, according to a person familiar with the call , who added that this came before other senators began calling for him to step down . \nSchumer also met with Franken and his wife at the leader\u2019s apartment early afternoon to discuss resigning. The session ended without a firm commitment from Franken to do so, said the source, who was granted anonymity to speak frankly about the private exchange. \nIn recent days \u2014 before Wednesday\u2019s report \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has known Franken for nearly two decades, had also told Franken he needed to step down, aides familiar with their discussions said. On Wednesday, Warren issued a short public statement, saying, \u201cI think he should resign.\u201d \nFranken had staved off public calls for his ouster last week, according to a person who has been in touch with the senator and his staff in recent days. \nThere was a \u201cmad rush\u201d last week to call on Franken to resign when more allegations surfaced, said the person, who was granted anonymity to speak frankly about private discussions. \u201cI think that people were talked off the ledge at that point and wanted to recollect and figure out if the Senate Ethics investigation should just move forward.\u201d \nBut, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that Al should have known that if there was another story that came out that there\u2019d be a mass exodus away from him.\u201d \nOutside the chamber, growing numbers of Democrats had been making the case that it was untenable for Franken to remain in the Senate if their party hoped to maintain the high ground on the issue. \nAmong those calling for Franken to step down was Doug Jones, Moore\u2019s Democratic opponent in Alabama. \nAnd though she did not mention Franken by name, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had declared a policy of \u201czero tolerance\u201d when she called last week for Conyers to leave the House. On Wednesday, Pelosi declared that she was \u201cvery proud of the fact that people are taking this matter head on and are trusting women who come forward, what they have to say.\u201d \nMore and more lawmakers are saying their concern over sexual harassment allegations should not be overridden by politics, or by the respect they have for each other\u2019s records and their shared positions on important policy matters. \nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) noted on Tuesday that her own efforts as a civil rights and immigration rights activist could not have succeeded without the early work of Conyers. \nDespite that legacy, \u201cI also hope that we can be clear about what our standard is for sexual harassment and make it very, very clear to every woman who is out there that you do not have to put up with this. It is not right, and most of us as women \u2014 I can tell you \u2014 know exactly what this has all been about,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been through various forms of this and I think it\u2019s essential that if people come to work in this body that they know that they have a safe environment. We have to be clear about that, whether it\u2019s a Republican, a Democrat, someone we love or someone we find distasteful.\u201d \nRep.

I\u2019ve always loved Ming Xi\u2019s sense of style. She knows how to perfectly mix classy and sexy, street style and girly, and a lot of other looks and vibes that only a true fashionista could and would pull off. Here are some of her best looks yet. \nStreet Style Boudoir \nAll that denim suggests that this look would be perfect for the streets but the dainty body chains and the lingerie-ish top adds a nice but subtle hint of sexiness to it that makes it just a teeny bit boudoir. Modern Classic \nHere\u2019s Ming Xi at the 120 Beats Per Minute Premiere at 70th Annual Cannes Film Festival earlier this year. She\u2019s wearing a very sexy but also very classy blue dress that features a wrap around style and a very high slit. She accessorized the look with a trendy statement choker and bold drop earrings to give the ensemble a modern touch. Retro Athleisure \nThe retro look is something we love to see every now and then but to see it mixed with a more contemporary vibe like athleisure is rare. Check out Ming Xi\u2019s combo of a turtleneck top and bell bottom pants finished off with sneakers and a leather backpack. Basic Luxe \nBasic pieces like t-shirts and jeans are always reliable when you need something quick and fail-safe, but why keep it basic when you can give it an upgrade by pairing it with the right accessories? Take a page out of Ming Xi\u2019s lookbook and see how she gave the basic tee-and-jeans combo a luxe upgrade by wearing it with a designer purse and chic boots. Sexy and Cozy \nA nice furry sweater is always a good idea if you want something warm and cozy, not if you want something hot and sexy. For Ming Xi, though, mixing sexy and cozy is never a problem. Case in point: this red hot sweater she styled with one shoulder off and finished with thigh high boots and a mini. Black and White \nIt takes courage and boldness to wear more than one piece of overwhelming clothing at the same time and that\u2019s exactly what Ming Xi did in this outfit. Stripes often scare us because of its tendency to make us look bigger and the same is true for bubble jackets but Ming Xi confidently and stylishly mixed the two to come up with this bold black and white look. \nHere are more outfits by Ming Xi to get inspired by:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anjelina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ming xi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "secret angels", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "shanghai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:09.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d69d8b35536d44910c6a29438e7921a988edaa6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZeQ6FfIkhdBW3ok1fxDBLtMFrdTIPWgSy3S9vUREhX7ndxwDwKcvWX2MB_ow8gUF_CnSmQvh8Hk2LebKiOnmZI", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money", "title": "BTC chain clogging up. 100,000+ unconfirmed transactions in mempool.", "title_full": "BTC chain clogging up. 100,000+ unconfirmed transactions in mempool. : btc", "published": "2017-12-07T08:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 56, "participants_count": 75, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1af959d6704b1459d48f3aef5498c772dee1de0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZeQ6FfIkhdBW3ok1fxDBLtMFrdTIPWgSy3S9vUREhX7ndxwDwKcvWX2MB_ow8gUF_CnSmQvh8Hk3EMxwtWXlJzJ28OHAmYZCtjaCnQMF2X9TOCsik6uc6h", "ord_in_thread": 45, "author": "kurzdump", "published": "2017-12-07T15:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "grabs popcorn", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:09.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10073d9f387ded15647560ca79ee6e1f46c16cb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8gMxCaIWAiBhy_q32r8Dp3LGBJHPavJdzfqAMlzeJImt0LDb7lC.5.nmXqCL5eMo0p3U3mh8jKPQVLnzF_1ZcoIQXRhRfqjobkTs.HEZq67iK4WKG7L7CRIfiNpXkQ9wBcg25c1q8f4Iprw8igYYDkIET7._juZduu03_OqfCqAKj6ZMpPtIVUApER8Tm.35AOZ.umqrJmNw1Vm3s4SrDNDgkH4wKfb_s-", "site_full": "www.news.com.au", "site": "news.com.au", "site_section": "http://feeds.news.com.au/public/rss/2.0/news_top_stories_48.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RSS news.com.au \u2014 Australia\u2019s #1 news site | 6b4763d854a2308e2a767518cb5372b7", "title": "Shocking secret behind top eatery", "title_full": "Shocking secret behind top eatery", "published": "2017-12-07T12:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/11263eedfc5027e0a76220748337066a", "performance_score": 6, "domain_rank": 1340, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 608, "comments": 0, "shares": 608}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 40}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10073d9f387ded15647560ca79ee6e1f46c16cb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8gMxCaIWAiBhy_q32r8Dp3LGBJHPavJdzfqAMlzeJImt0LDb7lC.5.nmXqCL5eMo0p3U3mh8jKPQVLnzF_1ZcoIQXRhRfqjobkTs.HEZq67iK4WKG7L7CRIfiNpXkQ9wBcg25c1q8f4Iprw8igYYDkIET7._juZduu03_OqfCqAKj6ZMpPtIVUApER8Tm.35AOZ.umqrJmNw1Vm3s4SrDNDgkH4wKfb_s-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "Shocking secret behind top eatery", "text": "Cute owl advert from Trip Advisor 0:29 \nCheck out the latest advert from Trip Advisor with their cute owl. November 10th 2017 a month ago /display/newscorpaustralia.com/Web/NewsNetwork/Entertainment - syndicated/Television/ Oobah Butler turned an imaginary restaurant into London\u2019s most exclusive dining experience on Trip Advisor without serving a single customer. Picture: Theo McInnes Source:Supplied A BRITISH journalist has turned an imaginary restaurant in his backyard into London\u2019s most sought-after dining experience by writing fake reviews on Trip Advisor. \nOobah Butler, who specialises in blagging his way into situations and then writing about it, wanted to expose the epidemic of fakery on the internet\u2019s most trusted review site. \nButler had experienced the power of the site first-hand, having once earned a healthy living writing positive reviews for restaurant owners at \u00a310 (AUD17) a pop. \n\u201cOver time, I became obsessed with monitoring the ratings of these businesses. Their fortunes would genuinely turn, and I was the catalyst,\u201d he wrote in an article for VICE . \n\u201dOne day, sitting in the shed I live in, I had a revelation: within the current climate of misinformation, and society\u2019s willingness to believe absolute bullshit, maybe a fake restaurant is possible? Maybe it\u2019s exactly the kind of place that could be a hit? \n\u201cIn that moment, it became my mission. With the help of fake reviews, mystique and nonsense, I was going to do it: turn my shed into London\u2019s top-rated restaurant on TripAdvisor .\u201d \nAnd so the \u201cThe Shed at Dulwich\u201d was born, an exclusive eatery with just a street name for an address, that was almost always fully booked when you rang to make a reservation. Oobah Butler turned his garden shed into London\u2019s best-rated restaurant on Trip Advisor. Picture: Theo McInnes Source:Supplied A screenshot of the menu from the fake website Oobah Butler set up for The Shed. Picture: Theo McInnes Source:Supplied \nButler set up an elegant website and filled it with pretentious descriptions of dishes and pictures of fake but incredibly realistic food crafted mainly from household domestic products. \nIn a photograph of what appears to be a plate of bacon and eggs, Butler\u2019s foot makes a cameo as the meat but you would never know it. \nHe registered The Shed on TripAdvisor in May this year, adding a steady stream of reviews from friends rhapsodising about \u201cLondon\u2019s best kept secret\u201d. \nSlowly but surely, word of this mysterious but clearly amazing restaurant spread and The Shed saw it\u2019s ranking rise from 18,149 to inside the top 1500 in a matter of months. \n\u201cI realise what it is: the appointments, lack of address and general exclusivity of this place is so alluring that people can\u2019t see sense,\u201d Butler observed in a series of videos he made documenting the experiment. \n\u201cThey\u2019re looking at photos of the sole of my foot, drooling. Over the coming months, The Shed\u2019s phone rings incessantly.\u201d That hint of what could be a bit of bacon or some ham behind the egg is actually Oobah Butler\u2019s foot. Picture: Theo McInnes Source:Supplied Behold, Oobah Butler\u2019s foot. Picture: Theo McInnes Source:Supplied \nButler even tricked food critics, including The Guardian\u2019s Jay Raynor, into endorsing The Shed without any of them having set foot inside. \n\u201cAt last: a restaurant that recognises food is all about mood. Of all the shed-based eating experiences out there this one sounds like the best,\u201d Raynor tweeted. \nPowered only by hype and mystique, The Shed continued to rise up the ranks of Trip Advisor. On November 1, something incredible happened: Butler\u2019s bogus establishment had been crowned London\u2019s number one restaurant one the site \u2014 without ever having had a paying customer.

Where would a US Embassy in Jerusalem actually go? December 7, 2017 \nShapiro, who is now senior fellow with the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv and has advocated for moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel under certain circumstances, said he suspects that the move would take five to 10 years.\nIn theory, there is land in Jerusalem set aside for a new U.S. Embassy. On President Ronald Reagan\u2019s last day in office in 1989, then-U.S. Ambassador to Israel William Brown signed a contract for a patch of land in West Jerusalem for $1 a year on a 99-year lease. This space was later zoned for \u201cdiplomatic purposes\u201d by the Israeli government with the intention of building a U.S. Embassy there. \nNowadays, this land sits in an increasingly desirable part of Jerusalem on the edge of the Talpiot neighborhood by Baka. \u201cIt\u2019s a great area,\u201d said David Makovsky, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who was an adviser to Secretary of State John F. Kerry on the Middle East peace process. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of apartment buildings built around there in anticipation of a U.S. Embassy.\u201d \nThe earmarked land still sits uninhabited and forlorn. A reporter from the Times of Israel described seeing \u201cpieces of an old shoe, broken Heineken bottles, the rusty innersprings of an old mattress that somebody forgot here years ago,\u201d when he visited last year. And despite the Trump administration\u2019s decision to move the embassy, this land may be unlikely to see a brighter future. \nAlthough it was initially hoped during the 1990s that a U.S. Embassy could sit here, after the al-Qaeda bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998, new safety standards were put in place that required embassies to be set back 100 feet from any adjacent roads due to the risk of car bombs and other attacks. \u201cWith the new rules, that land is not big enough,\u201d Shapiro said. For context, the space in Talpiot is seven to 14 acres, according to different sources, while the new U.S. Embassy in Lebanon sits on 43 acres. \nThere is another potential option: The United States could use a building it already has in Jerusalem. The State Department operates a number of consulate buildings in Jerusalem that provide services to the city as well as the Palestinian territories and which could theoretically be repurposed as an embassy. The oldest is the U.S. Consulate General building, built in 1912, which sits at 18 Agron Rd., close to Jerusalem\u2019s Old City. \nAnother, newer U.S. Consular Section facility is in Jerusalem\u2019s Arnona neighborhood, not far from the leased land in Talpiot. Unlike the Agron Road building and the Talpiot land, which lie well within the \u201cgreen line\u201d that designates the parts of Jerusalem that were under Israeli control before the 1967 war, the Arnona facility straddles the 1967 border between Israeli control and what was then a demilitarized zone after the 1949 armistice agreement. \nThere has been widespread speculation that rather than build an entirely new facility to serve as an U.S. Embassy to Israel in Jerusalem, the State Department would commandeer one of the consulate buildings \u2014 an easier and quicker option in several ways. Most speculation has centered on the newer building in Arnona, which is considerably bigger than the Consulate General building on Agron Road and may be able to house more staffers if the embassy moved from Tel Aviv. \nIsraeli newspaper Haaretz reported last year that Jerusalem officials stated the building was specifically designed so it could one day be an embassy. \nAlthough a State Department spokeswoman declined to say how many people worked in the Arnona complex, reports from the State Department\u2019s Office of the Inspector General said that there were 582 U.S. consulate staff spread across Jerusalem in 2017, compared to 960 staff at the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv. \nShapiro said moving the ambassador to a consulate was possible, although it would probably only be on a temporary basis while a new embassy is built, and would require the bending of such rules. However, he added that the language being used by the Trump administration suggested that such a move was unlikely. Makovsky said that the White House had told him Tuesday that the U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, would not be moving to a consulate. \nInstead, Makovsky said, the White House told him that it was looking into buying plots of land. Exactly where is unconfirmed, and it is unclear whether land adjacent to a consulate or near the Talpiot land could be purchased. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many parcels there are in such a choice location,\u201d Makovsky said of Talpiot. \u201cI wonder if they will have to go looking in areas they haven\u2019t looked before.\u201d \nThe State Department did not respond to a query about the Talpiot land or the time frame of the move, but in comments to reporters Wednesday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seemed to concede that the move won\u2019t be easy and that the process of finding a new plot of land would begin immediately. \u201cObviously, there\u2019s a lot of planning that goes into it,\u201d Tillerson told reporters at a U.S. air base in Ramstein, Germany. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time.\u201d \nIn the end, it\u2019s possible that any new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem may end up a little closer to Tel Aviv than many would expect. \u201cI\u2019m sure the Israeli government will work very hard to find a new property\u201d for a new U.S. Embassy, Shapiro said. However, he added, \u201creal estate in Jerusalem is complicated. It\u2019s a compressed city. It\u2019s possible that the embassy could end up some distance away from the city center.\u201d \nMore on WorldViews", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

wind pattern\u2019 More evacuations ordered in Thomas fire as crews fight to protect Ojai amid \u2018weird wind pattern\u2019 December 7, 2017 \nCrews battling a massive wildfire that has caused tens of thousands of Ventura County residents to flee are bracing themselves for a day of heavy winds Thursday, when forecasters predict fire-stoking gusts of up to 80 mph. \nBy Wednesday evening, the Thomas fire had scorched about 90,000 acres and carved a path of destruction that stretches more than 10 miles from Santa Paula to the Pacific Ocean. \nAs flames raged toward neighborhoods in Ojai, Carpenteria and Fillmore late Wednesday, officials issued new evacuation orders in Ojai Valley, notifying residents with an emergency cellphone alert. Authorities said they were helping residents of five assisted-living facilities evacuate, while people at Ojai Hospital were advised to shelter in place. \n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely moving,\u201d Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Capt. Garo Kuredjian said of the fire. \u201cForecasters were correct in terms of the wind forecast for tonight \u2014 it\u2019s much windier than it was yesterday.\u201d \nThe fire is burning on the north and east side of Highway 150 and on the west side of Highway 33. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a weird wind pattern,\u201d Kuredjian said. \nAuthorities had already expanded mandatory evacuation orders hours earlier in east Ojai after flames rolled down slopes about four miles north of downtown. Residents crowded street corners and gas stations downtown to watch the flames, wondering if they were going to be forced to leave. \n\u201cIt looks pretty bad up there, but as of right now we have not lost any structures in the city of Ojai,\u201d said Rudy Livingston, the city\u2019s finance director. He said that officials have four 15-passenger vans and three vintage trolleys available to help evacuate residents. \nAbout half an hour after that, residents in Carpinteria east of Bailard Avenue \u2014 along the west flank of the fire \u2014 were advised to evacuate in an emergency cellphone alert. \nThe Thomas fire was 5% contained, mostly along the southeast flank in the Santa Paula area. Forecasters say strong Santa Ana winds, coupled with low humidity, could offer \u201ca recipe for explosive fire growth.\u201d \n\u201cWe stand a good chance of a challenging night and day tomorrow,\u201d California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Tim Chavez said, adding that there\u2019s potential for fire growth on the northwest side and a high probability of spot fires. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a difficult night and day.\u201d \nThe focus Wednesday, officials said, was keeping the fire out of the Ojai Valley while assessing the devastation in the cities of Ventura and Santa Paula. \nThe hot Santa Ana winds that drove the fire at remarkable speed on Tuesday had lessened greatly Wednesday. However, they were predicted to increase again on Thursday. \n\u201cWe are in the beginning of a protracted wind event,\u201d said state fire chief Ken Pimlott. \n\u201cThere will be no ability to fight fire in these kinds of winds,\u201d Pimlott said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we need everyone in the public to listen and pay attention. This is not \u2018watch the news and go about your day.\u2019 This is pay attention minute-by-minute \u2026 keep your head on a swivel.\u201d \nAmong those residents who took Pimlott\u2019s words to heart were Kristy Cantrall, who left a garden hose poised on the roof of her Santa Paula townhome, just in case. \nOnly a day earlier, the Thomas fire was a half-mile away from her cul-de-sac neighborhood on Vela Court, prompting neighbors to climb up to their roofs and spray their homes with water. \nHelicopters hovered overhead, dropping buckets of fire retardant on eucalyptus trees that had caught fire just north of the neighborhood. \nCantrall\u2019s son Colin drove from Simi Valley to water down his mother\u2019s home Tuesday night. \u201cOnce we saw copters come down, we knew we had to water,\u201d he said. \nHe planned to do the same Wednesday if the fire flared up. Meanwhile, they just kept an eye on the news. \nState fire officials say about 12,000 homes remain threatened by flames, while 50,000 people have been forced to flee. Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency, as approximately 1,100 personnel continued to battle the blaze. At least one firefighter has been injured. \nFire officials said that the area they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cbranch one,\u201d which includes Ojai, the bucolic mountain town known as a haven for spiritual seekers, health enthusiasts and celebrities, is one of their priorities. Firefighters are putting together a plan to protect Ojai and have expressed concern that winds could push the flames toward the city. \n\u201cThe fire is here and wrapped around the community,\u201d said Shane Lauderdale, a Cal Fire branch director, as he huddled with other officials in a downtown parking lot. \nWith a map of the Ojai Valley spread over the hood of a crew vehicle and ashes falling around him, Lauderdale said that more equipment and firefighters are being rushed to areas south and east of the town. \n\u201cWe\u2019re taking advantage of the current calm to concentrate resources along a defensive line,\u201d he said. \nFirefighters are moving heavy equipment to meet the blaze on the edge of town, while hand crews are cutting fire breaks. \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get a lot more work done today,\u201d Lauderdale said. \nThe fire threat is considered dire until Friday, when punishing Santa Ana winds are predicted to abate. However, Ojai city manager Steve McClary said, \u201cUntil we have fog drifting in from the west and light rain, we won\u2019t feel like this thing is behind us.\u201d \nOfficials said the southeast area of the Thomas fire was one of their highest priorities because of the \u201ctremendous volume of fire\u201d in that area. \nThey reiterated a message spread this morning \u2014 to put out even small bushes on fire along roads and extinguish the smallest embers on the way to bigger blazes because \u201cthat\u2019s how it\u2019s spreading from house to house.\u201d \nThe fire was the worst of several major blazes across Southern California, including one in Bel-Air that closed the 405 Freeway on Wednesday, one in the Angeles National Forest near Sylmar and another in the Santa Clarita Valley. \nAt least 150 structures \u2014 including one large apartment complex and the Vista Del Mar Hospital, a psychiatric facility \u2014 were consumed by flames. But Cal Fire suspects the true number is hundreds more; firefighters just haven\u2019t been able to get into some areas to know for sure. \nGeoff Marcus walked past the charred remains of his Dodge Ram in the driveway of his Ventura home and surveyed the rubble that was left behind. \nThe raging Thomas fire chewed through the five-bedroom house he grew up in and his family has owned for 60 years.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lauderdale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pimlott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristy cantrall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vela court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garo kuredjian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shane lauderdale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken pimlott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim chavez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve mcclary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuredjian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rudy livingston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geoff marcus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cal fire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angeles national forest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california department of forestry and fire protection", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ojai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ojai hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sylmar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa ana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ojai valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cantrall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vista del mar hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa paula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bailard avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa clarita valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simi valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carpinteria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bel-air", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura county sheriff", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:09.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d69d8b35536d44910c6a29438e7921a988edaa6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZeQ6FfIkhdBW3ok1fxDBLtMFrdTIPWgSy3S9vUREhX7ndxwDwKcvWX2MB_ow8gUF_CnSmQvh8Hk2LebKiOnmZI", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -
