Play Hard? The Fitbit Ionic may be the wearable solution for you", "text": "Finding the perfect balance of smartwatch features is hard when you want to do it all. Compromise is common, and we find ourselves settling for second best. But now with the launch of the Fitbit Ionic there's a real answer to the problem. A testament to premium smartwatch features and styling for daily life alongside 24/7 fitness tracking firepower.\nFitbit has built an incredible reputation. From the early days of clip-on trackers to the power and style of wrist wearables, Fitbit set the standard and remains at the pinnacle of the fitness tracking scene.\nFitbit Ionic is fit for any occasion with a range of accessory bands\nAll Fitbit products are underpinned with its excellent cloud data synchronisation and apps for all platforms, making it easy to track your activities and then learn how to perform better by looking deep into the data.\nWith the smartwatch revolution well underway, many users have been waiting for the new ideal wrist wearable that offers real added lifestyle benefits without reducing the core exercise tracking experience.\nLife Unleashed\nBy putting everything you expect from a Fitbit alongside features like contactless payments, built-in GPS, apps and onboard music, you get a true balance of life and fitness needs.\nContactless payments on Fitbit Ionic are supported by all four of the major banks (Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, NAB and Westpac), covering a large majority of Australian users.\nOnce you setup your desired cards through the Fitbit app, the Ionic's NFC chip makes it easy to pay at all the usual terminals without needing your wallet with you. A big win whether your hands are full on a busy day or you're stopping by the store after a session at the gym or the beach.\nAlongside all the app notifications you expect when you're hooked into your smartphone, there's also built-in apps, like support for storing over 300 songs so you can pump things up without needing your phone to get involved.\nThe Fitbit Ionic styling is also ready for work or play. Interchangeable straps let you shift from Horween leather bands for serious work meetings to a breathable elastomer design when you know you're about to sweat. There's also a range of watch face styles, from the elegant to the fun and the fit-centric. Whatever your personal style, you'll find a way to make your Fitbit Ionic look just right.\nUnparalleled Fitness Features\nStep counts, floors climbed, calories burned and duration, the Fitbit Ionic does it all!\nIf you haven't had the Fitbit experience before, you're in for a treat. You can expect the Fitbit Ionic to deliver step counts, floors climbed, calories burned, how many minutes you've been active through the day and also sleep insights. It features heart rate tracking, including resting heart rate, which is an important measure of your overall fitness level and how that baseline is improving over time.\nWhen you're tracking exercises, you can specify what kind of activity you're undertaking through Multi-Sport Mode. There's a big difference between running outdoors and running a treadmill, and Fitbit can track those differences to give you an accurate picture of your performance. Whether you're cycling or lifting weights, you're covered by the modal tracking options.\nSwim tracking is another mode on offer, as the Fitbit Ionic is also water resistant to 50m, so you have nothing to fear in the pool. Plus there's an interval timer when you're getting serious with your circuit training routine.\nIf you're looking for extra guidance, Fitbit Ionic also includes dynamic personal coaching right there on the watch. Sessions like a 10-minute abs, or a 7-minute workout, complete with visual cues and timers so you know what your virtual coach wants you to do.\nMulti-Sport Mode can track what activity you are doing based on your movement.\nWhere Fitbit really shines is the fact you don't even need to worry about setting up an exercise session if you don't want to (or just forget). Fitbit's SmartTrack will pick up on the style of movement you're currently performing and give you credit for the exercise you're doing. So that quick game of lunch football or a brisk walk from the office to a meeting a few blocks away will also get you exercise credit without even thinking about it.\nIf you're really looking to get the total package, add a Fitbit Aria 2 Wi-Fi smart scale to your home and you'll feed weight loss and body fat data into your Fitbit dashboard for an even more complete picture of your fitness progress.\nFive Days of Freedom\nBest of all, when you can deliver battery life of up to five days like the Fitbit Ionic, you ensure access to a complete 24/7 fitness data assessment. So many smartwatches demand daily charging, which means sleep tracking is simply not possible.\nAnyone chasing a true 'quantified self' experience knows you need to regularly track your full 24/7 lifecycle in order to look at what's happening to your body and how your routines are changing.\nGetting this kind of battery life, alongside this level of fitness tracking, and in a smartwatch with these kinds of features? Fitbit Ionic sets a standard all its own.\nIf the Fitbit Ionic sounds like the solution for you, it is available for purchase here through the Fitbit store.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/vmahMP4bAF74wyNIgBLMj-HvbHU=/fit-in/370x0/2017/11/30/d8ae53c7-fbca-4351-b337-a79cd5775913/ionic-lifestyle-bikehandle-980x550.png", "https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/kNjJUWY_Kt16oKQ4ucu2zFwPi5E=/fit-in/x/2017/11/30/e3e7d8ca-fde0-49f0-bfd1-f9447b101b01/ionic-family-shot-980x550.png", "https://www.fitbit.com/au/ionic", "https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/bSIpzN42hT3h5Ri3VaWzkp_vGLs=/fit-in/370x0/2017/11/30/87b374f3-ea02-4506-9e2d-87e590a77ccd/ionic-lifestyle-groupworkout-980x550.png"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "horween", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fitbit", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "smarttrack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westpac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fitbit ionic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commonwealth bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anz", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "fitbit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:22.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e0a68f7a06b05e4a8ae960ef592fbf6185066649", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1prUf3ZSQykc5qcigqVi8R8C4rWWySd43I", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/bant/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/bant/ -

Sign up for the free BN newsletter(s) here \n\u2018Superfight is just a mirage\u2019 wrote Harry Mullan, in this, our original fight report from Leonard-Duran III on December 7, 1989 in Las Vegas. \nTHE decade went out with a whimper rather than a bang as the third super fight between Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran became the most disappointing major match-up since Muhammad Ali flopped against Larry Holmes in 1980. \nLeonard won a landslide unanimous points decision, but will not look back on it with any great satisfaction. The pair earned a fortune \u2013 Leonard was guaranteed $17.6m, Duran $7.5m \u2013 but forfeited their reputations in the process. \nDuran, once the embodiment of macho fighting qualities, fought like a bored old survivor whose sole aim was to get through the night\u2019s work with the minimum inconvenience or embarrassment so that he could go home and count his pay. Leonard was quite happy to go along with Duran\u2019s policy of non-aggression, and spent most of the 12 rounds retreating briskly around the ring while the 38-year-old Panamanian plodded aimlessly after him. \nThe result was a dreadfully uninspiring encounter, a super fight turned superbore, and as early as the third round the crowd of more than 16,000, who paid an all time gate receipts record of $9m, broke into whistles and jeers of derision. Chants of \u201cbullshit, bullshit\u201d continued throughout the later rounds, and long before the end of this desultory affair people were streaming away from the arena in hundreds. It was a case of one man no longer having the ability to fight, and the other no longer having the desire to do so. But it is the loss of Duran\u2019s reputation, more than Leonard\u2019s, which diminishes the sport. \nHe has held centre-stage for almost 20 years, having won the first of his four world titles at lightweight in 1972, and his own extraordinary brand of snarling, swaggering brawling made him the most loved and feared fighting man of his time. His hold on public affection was such that he was even able to recover from the shame of the \u201cNo Mas\u201d surrender against Leonard nine years ago . Only Duran, alone amongst his contemporaries, could have lived down a humiliation of that magnitude. \nInterestingly, too, he was the crowd\u2019s favourite, despite America\u2019s currently strained relations with Panama. He was accorded the sort of ecstatic reception which Leonard, once the all-American hero, used to enjoy. Times have changed: Leonard\u2019s arrogant, calculating manipulation of his sport and his cavalier treatment of some of the most long-serving and loyal members of his team have alienated his public, and this cynically effective display will have done nothing to regain their affection. \nIt was unquestionably a technical masterpiece, a highly skilled exercise in evasion and frustration, but for $17.6m \u2013 which a bonus percentage deal will probably push over the $20m mark \u2013 he might reasonably have been expected to offer some entertainment as well. Merely winning is not enough at this level, or for that sort of money. \nDuran\u2019s performance will be forgiven: even Macho men get old, and he is now 38. The old warhorse has given the public so much over 20 years that he will not be remembered for this tame workout. Leonard, though, will not be so readily forgiven for his decision literally to take the money and run. \nLeonard justified his strategy on the grounds that, on the one occasion when he did try to please the crowd (in the 11th round) Duran hit him with a right which inflicted a horrible cut on the left eyebrow, one of three facial wounds which later required 60 microstitches. \nViewed from a purely professional standpoint he is of course right: the job of a boxer ideally is to hit without getting hit himself, but to take that attitude to the limits to which Leonard stretched is to ignore his responsibility to his public, who had paid him handsomely to fight. \nThere is a distinction to be made between what Leonard did last week and what Herol Graham did against Rod Douglas in October. Graham gave a masterly display of evasive boxing, but all the time he was looking to land those strength-sapping counters, whereas Leonard appeared to be set on an inflexible course of least risk and minimum discomfort. \nThe fight was officially only for Leonard\u2019s WBC super middleweight title although Leonard, the supreme egotist, had dictated that the match be made at 162lbs, a full six pounds below the championship limit. The WBC had, as ever, meekly agreed to this perversion of their own rules to accommodate him, just as they did when Donny Lalonde was obliged to come in seven pounds below his championship weight to defend the light-heavyweight title against Leonard, and when Thomas Hearns reportedly had to scale below 11st 10lbs for his super-middleweight challenge against him in June. \nDuran\u2019s WBC middleweight title was not at stake, but as Leonard scaled exactly the middleweight limit of 11st 6lbs with Duran two pounds lighter, and since the match was fought under full championship conditions, Duran\u2019s title should surely either be awarded to Leonard or declared vacant. The WBC, though, have no plans to take either course, which will surprise nobody. \nBut whether his championship future is decided in the ring or in a committee room, Duran\u2019s day as a top-flight performer is numbered. The first decent middleweight he meets will almost certainly dethrone him, and that could mean either of Britain\u2019s two hopes in the division, Herol Graham or Nigel Benn, whose one round win over Jose Quinones a few days earlier had caused a considerable stir in Vegas fighting circles. \nDuran certainly will box again. Even this huge payday will have served only to clear existing tax bills and support his extravagant lifestyle for a few months. It seems, sadly, that his super win over Iran Barkley in February was the last hurrah for old \u2018Hands of Stone\u2019. Leonard refused to be drawn on his future, but after this result it is likely that he, too, will be tempted back into the ring. \nWhatever weaknesses Hearns exposed in his chin last June, Leonard\u2019s legs and tactical brain remain almost as good as ever and the temptation for him to pick up another $20m or so \u2013 possibly in a third match with Hearns \u2013 will be hard to resist. \nThe fight was a colossal financial success for promoter Bob Arum and for the owners of the new Mirage hotel, who paid a site fee of $8m in an effort to establish themselves as serious rivals to the Hilton and Ceasars Palace as a major venue. The gross was expected to be somewhere between $60m and $70m, but whatever the balance books show, the history books will record it is a flop of heroic proportions. \nIt was almost totally devoid of action highlights, with round following boring round in the same unvarying pattern: Leonard skittering around the ring, winding up a Bolo (\u201cI did it to remind him of New Orleans\u201d) while the bearded, slightly podgy middleweight champion walked after him in half-hearted pursuit. \nI doubt if Duran landed a worthwhile punch in the first half of the fight, although he did succeed in drawing blood from Leonard\u2019s lip with a butt in the fourth. Leonard scored with jabs when he could, but generally remained on the ring perimeter while Duran\u2019s tentative jabs fell far short of their target. \nThe crowd were prepared to tolerate such tactics for a couple of rounds, but when by the third round there was still no signs of the pair getting down to serious business, whistles and boos were heard from all around the high-tiered arena. The jeers intensified late in the round when Leonard popped Duran in the face with two fast jabs, and then stood still and wound up a right hand bolo before walking away without throwing it. \nHe was clearly trying to confuse and intimidate Duran, as he did on that memorable night in New Orleans, and the signs were that it was working \u2013 although even Leonard could not have expected that Duran would repeat that notorious \u201cNo Mas\u201d walkout. \nDuran has always had trouble with movers, a fact which Mickey Duff appreciated earlier than most of us when he matched Kirkland Laing with him, and against all expectations bar Duff\u2019s, Laing pulled off a stunning points win. Leonard was aware of Duran\u2019s problems in coping with that kind of style. \nAs the rounds drifted by, so Duran\u2019s frustration and confusion mounted, and his commitment waned. The pride was still there, though, even if the fire was not, it was pride which kept him upright in the sixth round when Leonard at last went to work. A left hook followed by a series of stunning rights to the head had Duran reeling in a corner and along the ropes, and he was badly hurt as the round ended. \nIt was the one stage in the fight when an inside-schedule finish was on the cards, but surprisingly Leonard did not pursue his advantage in the seventh and instead went back to his evasive, don\u2019t-get-involved routine and allowed Duran to recover his composure. \nAnd that was the way it remained, apart from a brief flurry from Duran, which earned him a share of the eighth on my card. Even then Leonard ostentatiously directed him to his corner. \nBy the 10th the chants of \u201cBullshit, Bullshit\u201d were deafening, and it must have been galling for two men who between them have won nine world titles to hear themselves subjected to the ultimate insult which the American boxing fan has to offer. These were once the two finest fighters of their generation, but on this night they were more like two middle-aged businessmen intent on getting the maximum return for the minimum pain, and the punters who had paid up to $800 were understandably angry and resentful. \nThere was still one last, improbable chance left for Duran. Late in the 11th round, blood gushed from an ugly cut above Leonard\u2019s left eye. Had it occurred earlier in the fight, it is unlikely that he could have survived. \nHis cornermen were unable to staunch the flow during the final one-minute interval, and sent him out for the 12th with blood seeping from around and under the blob of grease on the cut. Now, surely, was the moment for one last death or glory attack by Duran. \nHe must have known that he was far behind on points, despite his absurd post-fight claim to have done enough to win. The worst that could have happened to him was to have been knocked out, while on the plus side there was still a real chance that, even this late in the fight, referee Richard Steele might have been forced to intervene, especially given Leonard\u2019s history of eye problems. \nBut instead, the Lion went out like a lamb. The Duran who had spat glorious defiance at Marvin Hagler in the last round of their memorable encounter or had marched grimly towards Thomas Hearns in the cold certain knowledge that he was about to be knocked out is only a memory.

Yes, we will actually be seeing Dublin on the way back. Certainly, if you have any specific Dublin *must see* suggestions I would appreciate those as well. But in Dublin, I am not so worried about getting around because of public transportation. In the west, on the other hand, I would prefer to book 1 or 2 tours because it takes longer to get from place to place.\nI am curious why you do not like my idea of saving a whole day and taking a tour from Dublin? If we were to take a bus on our own to Galway to Dublin it would cost about the same as taking a tour bus from Dublin to Galway, but we would also get the tour. Also, we would waste a day because by the time we get to Galway and try to book a tour the day would be half gone, so we could only sightsee in town.\nI do understand about the limited daylight, but unfortunately, due to circumstances, this was the only time we could come. So as per my original question - I would appreciate advice on which tours I could take from Dublin to the west as day trips and then if I stay in the west for an additional 2 days, which other times or places would be good to visit during December 14-17.\nThanks!\nEdited: yesterday, 10:56", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:22.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0f3ede510cce9e5b6fd1e7da155d7f419bf7d3ad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Rk8AjjCHn8rIpU366Vea53MNSp6VhKpZYxQr1FJWgd3LdvpQlJZubtttSc1VKsol3fXNqOe4Y0VUIPQDOVj9vxo6PgSJPbQnO6pusueuk3Q--", "site_full": "www.boxingnewsonline.net", "site": "boxingnewsonline.net", "site_section": "http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/feed", "site_categories": ["boxing", "sports"], "section_title": "Boxing News", "title": "VIDEO James DeGale on his rivalry with George Groves", "title_full": "VIDEO James DeGale on his rivalry with George Groves", "published": "2017-12-07T08:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-04T131338Z_566378110_RC121DF8CE40_RTRMADP_3_BOXING-SUPERMIDDLEWEIGHT-DEGALE-TRUAX.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 90811, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0f3ede510cce9e5b6fd1e7da155d7f419bf7d3ad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Rk8AjjCHn8rIpU366Vea53MNSp6VhKpZYxQr1FJWgd3LdvpQlJZubtttSc1VKsol3fXNqOe4Y0VUIPQDOVj9vxo6PgSJPbQnO6pusueuk3Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BN Staff", "published": "2017-12-07T08:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "VIDEO James DeGale on his rivalry with George Groves", "text": "December 7, 2017 BN Staff VIDEO James DeGale on his rivalry with George Groves \nThe long-running hostility between George Groves and James DeGale remains VIDEO James DeGale on his rivalry with George Groves \nThe long-running hostility between George Groves and James DeGale remains Read more articles by", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "james degale", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "george groves", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:22.032+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e79fc50d5845353c9689aea25daa2f21c29e69b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90J5ryLRQGLz93i16UGrqdveADnGCND97zid8zkSgJue9zsLWdlE1BcCZStWidjXfs4xq5uWRLPCXCHeNsTs60bOzmo_adIEZ2UeTOVGxau9RHp7UsYBczmVU5L44taH5PZRETUGajWw--", "site_full": "www.topix.net", "site": "topix.net", "site_section": "http://www.topix.net/rss/olympics/summer.xml", "site_categories": ["entertainment"], "section_title": "Summer Olympics News", "title": "Biles ready for new role at 2020 Tokyo Olympics", "title_full": "Biles ready for new role at 2020 Tokyo Olympics", "published": "2017-12-04T14:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://picproxy.topixcdn.com/pics/up-", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e79fc50d5845353c9689aea25daa2f21c29e69b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90J5ryLRQGLz93i16UGrqdveADnGCND97zid8zkSgJue9zsLWdlE1BcCZStWidjXfs4xq5uWRLPCXCHeNsTs60bOzmo_adIEZ2UeTOVGxau9RHp7UsYBczmVU5L44taH5PZRETUGajWw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-04T14:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "Biles ready for new role at 2020 Tokyo Olympics", "text": "  Biles ready for new role at 2020 Toky...

It\u2019s time for the second part. This time \u2013 you will notice \u2013 without longish intro or too many attempted jokes. It\u2019s serious now, the subject is: usage of interfaces. \nBy \u201cinterface\u201d I mean that specific keyword in Java language. I believe the subject is more serious, because with each new project and new team the same discussion about interfaces seems to be repeated. My opinion during that discussion is always the same: \nEvery time a layer exposes some behaviour to other layers it should be done via an interface. \nAs evidenced by HTML tags above \u2013 my opinion is strong. I find it surprising that many people don\u2019t agree, some will even claim that programming to interfaces is an anti-pattern. Let me first explain why I defend the usage of interfaces so strongly and then I\u2019ll address few assorted arguments against them. Why? \nThe reason for my belief is simple: clean separation . You don\u2019t need very complex business logic to have multiple classes implementing it. Only selected classes in your layer are supposed to be used by other layers. You can achieve some separation with access modifiers, but even then \u2013 inside your publicly visible class \u2013 not all public methods might really be meant for an outside world (some of them could be just implementation details meant for classes in the same layer). An example \nYou have a service class, creatively named Service. It\u2019s meant to provide information about events to other layers, so your service has getEvents() method. Let\u2019s say the simplest way to collect events in that situation would be for Service to implement a version of an observer pattern. It now has registerEvent() method. Both methods are public, but registerEvent() is only meant to be used by other classes in the same layer. With an interface: Without an interface: public interface Service { List<Event> getEvents(); } public class ServiceImpl implements Service { public List<Event> getEvents() { // ... } public void registerEvent(Event event) { // ... } } public class Service { public List<Event> getEvents() { // ... } public void registerEvent(Event event) { // ... } } \nWith an interface it\u2019s clear what is visible to an outside world, no one will call your registerEvent() by mistake. Without interfaces the relation to your classes other layers will have is just too intimate. \nI believe clean separation is the only argument I need to convince anyone to my views. There are additional perks of having interfaces: pure Java proxies, clearly defined contracts allow two people to work on one feature at the same time (one person implements the contract, other just writes client code) and so on. But let\u2019s see what people have to say against this approach. Why not? YAGNI \n\u201cYou ain\u2019t gonna need it\u201d they\u2019ll say, meaning that creating an interface is additional work that has no benefits. I agree there will be more typing (see the example above, there\u2019s more code in the left column). The additional code is there not because you expect another implementation in the future. You need the interface now. \nNumber of implementations you\u2019ll have is a valid consideration for abstract classes, but interfaces have completely different purpose: they\u2019re used to define behaviours. You shouldn\u2019t care how many classes will provide the behaviour. I\u2019d say it\u2019s good to forget about implementations for a second when creating an interface, it will force you to focus on responsibilities of your layer. \nAnd finally, it is correct you don\u2019t need interfaces for your code to compile and run. The same could be said about unit tests. You also don\u2019t need meaningful names for your classes and variables, everything would work with names like \u201ca1\u201d, \u201ca2\u2033\u2026 But we\u2019re talking about creating a quality software that will possibly be maintained by many people for years to come. But my class has only methods visible to other layers \nIt may have now, when you\u2019re gone from the project someone will change it and forget to \u201cextract an interface\u201d. Please, just focus on defining the contract that your layer will fulfil, incidentally the interface keyword is a great way to describe Java contracts. I don\u2019t like the \u201cImpl\u201d suffix \nFair enough. Would you accept DefaultService instead of ServiceImpl ? I personally don\u2019t mind uglier names for implementations, because they are only referenced in unit tests, all other classes just use the pretty name of an interface and implementations come from IoC container. But it feels wrong to do it for every class \nBecause it is wrong to do it for every class. First of all, some layers don\u2019t expose behaviours, creating interfaces for data (with getters and setters only) is insane. Second, not all layers are meant to be called by others in your code (Spring MVC controllers are exposed as HTTP endpoints, a Java interface will not describe their contract properly). Adam Bien\u2019s article \nThis one. Yes, the whole article thrown as an argument. I guess people like to think that a bit of Cialdini\u2019s \u201cprinciple of authority\u201d won\u2019t harm their case. \nFirst of all, doing Service service = new ServiceImpl(); \nis indeed poor code. But not because of Impl \u2013 it\u2019s the new part that\u2019s ugly. Use an IoC container, depend only on the interface \u2013 someone will inject you an implementation and it\u2019s not your business what name it might have. But let\u2019s get to the actual arguments from Bien: \u201cImagine you get another implementation (that\u2019s the whole point of an interface) \u2013 how would you name it?\u201d \nThat depends on how the new implementation is different from the original one. DAO now allows to store data on disc instead of relational DB? There you go: HardDriveDaoImpl . Also, the whole point of having an interface is to define a contract, number of implementations has nothing to do with it. \u201cIt doubles the amount of artifacts \u2013 and significantly increases the \u00abcomplexity\u00bb\u201d \nDoubling the amount assumes that an interface is created for every class. That\u2019s not the right way. The complexity of the code that calls your classes is simpler. Having a clearly defined interface helps to keep it simple in the long run as well: it\u2019s really easy to see when your interface grows too big, it\u2019s harder to catch that when you have a bare class. \u201cIt is really funny to read the javadocs on the interface and the impl \u2013 another redundancy\u201d \nIf you are into masochistic practices of writing javadocs, then you should know there is {@inheritDoc} tag . \u201cThe navigation in the IDE is less fluent\u201d \nThis is just desperation. My IDE shows me all implementing classes with one keyboard short-cut. Navigating from class to corresponding unit test is more cumbersome. Or even better, Java packages make it really painful to navigate in IDE, should we drop them as well? Martin Fowler\u2019s article \nThis one. Another well respected name to disagree with. Actually, no. Fowler is talking about pairing every class with an interface. I agree this is not a good idea. Robert C. Martin\u2019s article \nThis one. It seems I can\u2019t have a blog post without referencing Uncle Bob. At least this time I have a chance to disagree. Not really though. The article is about how Java interfaces are harmful, but in context of multiple inheritance. Sure, it would be nice to have mixins in Java, but it has nothing to do with the discussion about defining contracts for layers. Interfaces as descriptions of contracts are not going anywhere. \nJust look at languages that don\u2019t have interfaces and tell me how it\u2019s better there. You might think it\u2019s swearing, while in reality it\u2019s just an Angular\u2019s private method.

collapses into administration A view over Liverpool, home of the Epstein Theatre (PA) 0 comments \nLiverpool\u2019s famous Epstein Theatre has collapsed into administration, but the company has insisted the show will go on over Christmas. \nThe historic playhouse, which first opened its doors in 1913 as Cranes Music Hall, has appointed FRP Advisory as administrator after falling behind on its rent payments. \nFRP will continue to trade the theatre as normal, retaining all 30 staff, while a restructuring takes place. \nLila Thomas, partner at FRP, said: \u201cThe Epstein Theatre doors remain open for the entirety of the Christmas season and beyond. \n\u201cTalks are at an advanced stage with key stakeholders for a financial restructure ensuring operations continue as normal for all current bookings, planned future shows and to place the theatre within a more sustainable structure to allow for another generation of successful performances across the spectrum of entertainment.\u201d \nLiverpool Council owns the freehold to the building, but the ownership structure is complicated by the presence of a long leaseholder, Hanover Estate Management. \nLiverpool Council awarded David and Rebekah Pichilingi an 18-year contract to run the theatre in 2012, but it is understood to have racked up losses for several years. \nThe 380-capacity, Grade II listed theatre was refurbished in 2011 and is named in memory of Beatles manager Brian Epstein. \nFRP\u2019s financial restructuring is aimed at making the council the primary leaseholder of the property. \nThe Peter Pan Christmas pantomime, due to open on December 8, will go ahead with an unchanged performance schedule. \nMs Thomas added: \u201cAll theatre staff are being retained and paid as normal while a solution is finalised, and all existing contracts are being maintained for bookings, to ensure the show will go on for both theatre-goers and performers over the coming weeks while a transition to a new holding structure is agreed.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "epstein",

That's daft. It's not a big country and you can visit anywhere you want without driving long distances. Don't distinguish between Northern Ireland and the Republic, as the little differences is what makes a trip memorable.\nYour itinerary looks a bit too busy and you'll probably have a better time if you move less and relax a bit more. I don't think Ireland is hugely exciting so unless you want to go on a glorified pub crawl every evening, it will definitely pay to have something planned to do in each place you visit and I'd recommend a few day trips that you can switch off and listen rather than drive in circles looking for a rock in a field.\nIreland has a good road network. The motorways (beginning with M) and Nationals roads (beginning with N) are easiest to drive on.

Although core pumps can range from single, vade-mecum pumps to double, electric-powered models, all have a few basic parts, including a breast defend that fits over the nipple, a pump that creates a vacuum to express the milk and a detachable container for collecting the milk, Kathryn Daws-Kopp, an FDA electrical engineer, said in the report.

Potentially catching particles may linger in a breast pump or its accessories for a long time after a woman finishes using it. \n\nThese germs can infect the babe in arms or the next woman who uses that pump, said Dr Michael Cummings, an obstetrician and gynecologist with the FDA.

Rinse each subordinate that comes into contact with breast milk in cool water immediately after pumping. \n\nWash each accessory independently using liquid dishwashing soap and warm water, and rinse each piece in hot water for 10 to 15 seconds. Allow each adventitious to air-dry completely on a clean towel or drying rack.

The Republican-led House passed a bill to make it easier for gun owners to legally carry concealed weapons across state lines. J. Scott Applewhite / AP \nThe House approved a bill on Wednesday that would ease legal restrictions for carrying concealed firearms across state lines \u2013 a move pushed by the National Rifle Association that comes just weeks after mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas. \nOn a mostly party-line vote, the measure easily passed, 231-198, although 14 Republicans voted no. Six Democrats voted for the so-called reciprocity measure, which would allow a gun owner with the proper permit in any state to carry a concealed firearm to another state where it is also legal. \nThe bill now goes to the Senate, where it is likely to encounter a much tougher battle. \nIn the House version, GOP lawmakers added a measure aimed at strengthening tracking in the national background-check database of legal and mental health records that might prevent some gun purchases. Just last month it was revealed that Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., legally purchase firearms used in the attack despite a record of domestic assault in the Air Force that should have disqualified him. \nHowever, as The New York Times reports: \"... the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions.\" \nThe bill angered many Democrats who argued that following mass shootings that have killed 80 people, the times called for stricter, not looser gun measures. \nConnecticut Democrat Rep. Elizabeth Esty \u2014 who represents Newtown, Conn., where 20 first-graders and six teachers and staff were killed in a 2012 mass shooting \u2013 said the bill would undermine states' rights, \"hamstring law enforcement and allow dangerous criminals to walk around with hidden guns anywhere and at any time. It's unspeakable that this is Congress' response to the worst gun tragedies in American history,\" according to The Associated Press. \nThe NRA's executive director, Chris Cox, is quoted in the Times as saying Thursday's vote is a \"watershed\" for Second Amendment rights and that the bill would ensure \"all law-abiding citizens in our great country can protect themselves in the manner they see fit without accidentally running afoul of the law.\" \nIn the Senate, supporters would likely need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster by Democrats.

Nearly 1,800 firefighters and a fleet of aircraft are fighting the flames but the blaze is only 5% contained and an estimated 12,000 buildings are in danger. \nEarlier a wildfire in a wealthy western area of Los Angeles reached an estate and winery owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch. \n#SantaAnaWinds will continue to elevate fire danger in Southern CA with expectant winds reaching 80 mph on Thursday.

I think sitting in a jet plane. December again. Wow! \nDo you always count the days up to the next legal holidays without being on duty? Or do you start as early as September longing for Christmas? And do you wish the weeks or months hopefully pass by like an assault up to the next possible salary increase? \nMany times, we are really too much in a hurry while feeling uncomfortable if we noticed how time flies. We have no time for someone or something or even for ourselves. \nWhen I was still a teenager, I was longing for the time being an adult already. Later, I enjoyed listening to my grandmother's stories such as \"Once upon a time\" or \"When I was young\" from her \"yesterday's life\"... . \nAfter a couple of years, especially while observing that time really flies like a racket to the moon, I also got the same question in mind: Are the present hours and days less valuable? \nOf course, each day has its own set of happiness and trials. But it also holds very high possibilities of we take the initiative to do or to move something, if... ! \nThe luring term IF let us look into the future with an over \"glistening\" eye: IF I will finish my studies, IF my children have become adults, IF I might become rich because I win in the lottery, yes IF? And then? \nThe next turn of the year is almost around the corner. Sorry, almost. For most of us, it's the time to come to our senses.  \nThe future prospects smile at us already. I was looking already for the 2018-calendar. Setting appointments for January and February. Amazing.  Is life in future easier, nicer, more charming and being more fulfilled compared to the present? The thoughts fill me with horror, because tragicomic future visions can easily blur away our present day. \nMany of us retreat into the past and forget their present existence. A possible topsy-turvy world of a golden youth tries to et us forget that also the past have had its share of disappointments, pains, tears, darkness, tricky as well as desperate days... yes, lost days, irretrievable time... . \nWithout having achieved anything to do, we dream our impossible dreams from last to future and vice versus. We forget that between yesterday and tomorrow is our valuable present. Well, now well then - if we know just how to fulfill this period. ENJOY READING! VIEL SPASS BEIM LESEN!

Trump\u2019s vanishing act: a metaphor for the US in Asia? \nThe controversy surrounds McFarland\u2019s testimony to Congress that she was \u201cnot aware\u201d of communications between Flynn and Sergei Kislyak , the former Russian ambassador in Washington. \nThat contradicted a New York Times report on Monday, which quoted a December 2016 email from McFarland indicating she was aware of contact between Flynn and Kislyak. \nCamille Dawson, a spokeswoman for the US embassy in Singapore, told This Week in Asia there was no timeline for McFarland\u2019s appointment, and that charges d\u2019affaires Stephanie Syptak-Ramnath would continue to lead the mission. \nDawson said ties had remained \u201cexcellent\u201d despite the vacant ambassadorship. \n\u201cThe recent visit of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to Washington and President Donald Trump\u2019s trip to Asia are clear signals that President Trump and his administration are committed to our continued engagement in Singapore and the region,\u201d she said. \nDELAY \u2018FAR FROM IDEAL\u2019 \nBut some US-Singapore watchers said the delay had stymied efforts by Washington to assuage concerns that the Trump administration was committed to Asia despite the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d mantra. \n\u201cAgainst the background of doubts about US strategy in the Asia Pacific \u2013 in particular the lack of a credible economic strategy \u2013 I do think it\u2019s important for the Trump administration to get ambassadors out to key posts like Singapore as soon as possible,\u201d said Matthew Goodman, a former Barack Obama foreign policy adviser now at the CSIS think tank in Washington. \n\u201cThe current nominee does have some baggage in connection with the Russia issue, and that probably is slowing things down \u2026 it\u2019s not clear to me if the administration has a Plan B at the moment,\u201d Goodman said. Brexit Britain is missing an Asia policy \nHugo Brennan, a Singapore-based political risk analyst with Verisk Maplecroft, said while ties between the two countries were solid \u2013 the tiny Lion City is the second largest Asian investor in the US \u2013 the lack of a permanent US envoy was \u201cfar from ideal for either side\u201d. \n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s failure to fill the post will fuel a narrative of wavering US commitment to the region, particularly since Singapore holds the Asean chair in 2018,\u201d Brennan said, referring to the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations. \nDavid Adelman, who served as the ambassador to Singapore from 2010 to 2013, was less downcast. \nThe former diplomat, now a partner with US law firm Reed Smith, said \u201cdelayed arrival of newly appointed ambassadors is not uncommon when control of the White House changes from one political party to another\u201d. \nSteven Okun, a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore, echoed this point, saying Adelman \u2013 an Obama appointee \u2013 took up his position 14 months after the former president was inaugurated. \nThere was a similar gap when Bill Clinton took over from his Republican presidential predecessor George H.W. Bush in 1993. Why Singaporeans are anxious to know who will replace Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong \nThe placement of political appointees as ambassador to Singapore \u2013 as opposed to career diplomats \u2013 puts the republic on the same diplomatic footing as Washington\u2019s formal allies in Asia such as Japan and South Korea. \n\u201cThe US business community works very closely with [the embassy] to continue increasing trade and investment between the two countries,\u201d said Okun, a senior adviser at consulting firm McLarty Associates. \u201cWhile a senate-confirmed ambassador can play a different role than one that is not so, there is no handicap for the business community due to a lack of a confirmed one.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

champion pet slimmer Alfie Alfie the beagle shed a whopping 10kg to be named Pet Fit Club champion 0 comments \nA beagle who used to stop halfway up the stairs because he was too fat has been named as Britain\u2019s biggest loser in a pet slimming competition. \nAlfie lost more than a third of his weight in just six months, going from a whopping 4st 10lb (30kg) down to just over 3st (20kg). \nHis new slim figure means Alfie has much more energy and is constantly wagging his tail, owner Emily Simcox, 25, from Middlesbrough, said. \nAlfie won the Pet Fit Club competition run by the PDSA vets charity, beating Lola the rabbit, from Derby, who lost almost a quarter of her body weight. \nMs Simcox took Alfie to her local PDSA for help because he looked sad at being overweight. \nHe was fat when she adopted him five years ago and she admitted giving him treats to show she loved him, adding: \u201cThose eyes are hard to resist.\u201d \nShe said: \u201cBefore, he was sluggish, tired and looked sad a lot of the time. Alfie used to need a rest half way up the stairs before he lost weight (PDSA/PA) \n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t even walk up the stairs; he\u2019d struggle halfway up and then had to stop for a rest before getting to the top. \n\u201cOn walks, he would sluggishly walk towards a ball we\u2019d thrown and often wouldn\u2019t bother even trying to bring it back. \n\u201cBut since being on the diet his tail hasn\u2019t stopped wagging. \n\u201cHe leaps and bounds, and is so full of energy.\u201d Alfie\u2019s owner Emily Simcox asked for help from the PDSA in getting his weight down (PDSA/PA) \nAlfie\u2019s transformation came by sticking to a strict diet and his owner showing tough love by learning to say no when he demanded food. \nNot that it all went smoothly, Ms Simcox said. \n\u201cI was making a cheese sandwich and left it on the kitchen counter,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI walked back in the room to find Alfie licking his lips, and the cheese sandwich gone.\u201d \nShe urged other pet owners to seek help if their animal is overweight. \nShe said: \u201cAlfie is proof that change is possible \u2013 we\u2019ll never look back.\u201d Lola the rabbit from Derby was also a big loser, shedding a quater of her weight (PDSA/PA) \nAlfie\u2019s weight loss was supervised by PDSA vet nurse Steph Williams, from Middlesbrough PDSA Pet Hospital. \nShe said: \u201cHe is unrecognisable from the dog that waddled into our hospital for his first weigh-in six months ago. \n\u201cHe\u2019s much healthier and will be able to enjoy a much happier life.\u201d \nPDSA vet nurse Katy Orton, who helped to judge the competition, said up to 40% of cats and dogs in the UK are fat, but help is available.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alfie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alfie alfie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emily simcox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steph williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simcox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katy orton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "middlesbrough", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pdsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middlesbrough pdsa pet hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "derby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:29.032+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba53da19617e0d19e76852e71dca4f792be77719", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_StcUp8dvfp7Xmu2.AFjVlcbDtRvSBQwi5v7aIRHi5pdyDTlALDKHjgX44bWQV42GUGf.8F.Hi1xwQGKRMCh.q.ojMdoUgFPoY6rPPbjcTA--", "site_full": "www.bikeforums.net", "site": "bikeforums.net", "site_section": "https://www.bikeforums.net/introductions/", "site_categories": ["bicycling", "sports"], "section_title": "Introductions -

After opening the trading day at 147.95, shares of Inox Wind Limited traded in a close range. Inox Wind Limited currently has a total float of 221.92M shares and on average sees 557,664 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 104.6 and high of 209.5.\nIndian Economy\u2019s 2 Giants\nThe Indian stock market is one of the fastest growing equity markets in the world today. While it currently makes up only 12% to 14% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP)\u2019 far from the 70% corporate sector making up the entire GDP of the US, India\u2019s corporate sector is rampantly thriving to become one of Asia\u2019s leaders.\nAs of this month, nearly 8,000 companies are listed on the Indian equity market. More than half of these are listed on the two main stock exchanges in India combined\u2019 the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE), representing about 4% of the country\u2019s GDP.\nRegular session on both the BSE and the MSE starts at 9:15 a.m. and concludes at 3:30 p.m.\nThe BSE The BSE, having been established in 1875, is the first stock exchange in Asia. It is also the first to acquire a permanent recognition under India\u2019s Securities Contract Regulation Act of 1956.\nPresently, the BSE is the 11th biggest stock exchange in the world with a total market capitalization of $1.70 trillion as of January 23, 2015. Moreover, it is also considered as one of the fastest stock exchanges in the world with a speed of six microseconds.\nThe BSE first touched its four-digit figure on July 25, 1990; the 5,000 mark on October 11, 1999; the 10,000 mark on February 6, 2006; the 20,000 mark on December 11, 2007; and the 30,000 mark on March 4, 2015, an event that was driven by the efforts of the Reserve Bank of India. Inox Wind Limited is a stock traded on the Indian stock exchange.\nThe biggest declines on the BSE happened during the onslaught of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and when the Chinese central bank had suddenly moved to devalue the yuan. On January 21 and 22, 2008, the BSE has lost more than 2,000 points while on August 24, 2015, it has dropped over 1,700 points.\nThe SENSEX 30 is the free-float index that measures the 30 most active stocks on the BSE. It weighs stocks based on liquidity, market capitalization, floating-stock-adjustment depth, and other factors.\nThe NSE The NSE was founded in 1992 as the 1st demutualized electronic stock exchange in the country. Presently, it supports about 230,000 terminals throughout India. The NSE is owned and operated by the Indian Index Services and Products (IISP).\nThe NIFTY is the index that measures the 50 most active stocks across 24 industries on the NSE. Consequently, it covers a broader portion of India\u2019s corporate sector than the SENSEX 30. Inox Wind Limited has relatively good liquidity.\nThe NIFTY has a base value of 1,000 and its base date is 1995. Like the SENSEX 30, it comprehensively weighs stocks based on liquidity, market capitalization, among others.\nInvesting in BSE and NSE stocks is strongly recommended for investors today. As the Indian economy continues to grow and become one of Asia\u2019s biggest, it only makes sense to start betting on its equity market as early as now. Professional analysts might be interested how this will affect Inox Wind Limited.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://quicksense.net/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "inox wi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "inox wind limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global financial crisis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reserve bank of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "index services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sensex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national stock exchange of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bombay stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:30.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "38a2323bf701c65c137c91548529d3ef817d583e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vICvFC2R3yo5rYLKcsHvc4YxkSLJkokbcspO0OvBF_GL1IFnfAfbPGG7Zv8dspuO0Sh09uWy.OMKZZBDN74hI6XXKbixKbfELRIaunvLUquKI8wXQxrlrjLWlsK9i4eV7c.Ryj3FB1Rn0G1L1Moo_qCltgJPeRHsw7V1M8oE15qVlnUjsjT8V", "site_full": "www.wiltsglosstandard.co.uk", "site": "wiltsglosstandard.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.wiltsglosstandard.co.uk/uk_national_news/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "business", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard | National News", "title": "Praise, caution and concern: How newspapers reacted to Trump\u2019s Jerusalem move", "title_full": "Praise, caution and concern: How newspapers reacted to Trump\u2019s Jerusalem move", "published": "2017-12-07T10:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.wiltsglosstandard.co.uk/resources/images/7151352/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "38a2323bf701c65c137c91548529d3ef817d583e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vICvFC2R3yo5rYLKcsHvc4YxkSLJkokbcspO0OvBF_GL1IFnfAfbPGG7Zv8dspuO0Sh09uWy.OMKZZBDN74hI6XXKbixKbfELRIaunvLUquKI8wXQxrlrjLWlsK9i4eV7c.Ryj3FB1Rn0G1L1Moo_qCltgJPeRHsw7V1M8oE15qVlnUjsjT8V", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "Praise, caution and concern: How newspapers reacted to Trump\u2019s Jerusalem move", "text": "Praise, caution and concern: How newspapers reacted to Trump\u2019s Jerusalem move Jerusalem 0 comments \nThe news of Donald Trump\u2019s decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel made headlines around the world. \nAs leaders across the globe made their opinions on the shock move clearly known, so too did the newspapers which carried the story. \nFor Israel\u2019s media outlets, the announcement marked an historic day in a decades-long conflict. \nThe Jerusalem Post declares the news on its front page, reporting that \u201cafter 70 years\u201d, the US has \u201crecognised Israeli sovereignty\u201d. \nHistoric front page of today's @Jerusalem_Post , with announcement on Jerusalem by @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/YEYpCPRdmG \n\u2014 Gil Hoffman (@Gil_Hoffman) December 7, 2017 \nIn an analysis piece, the paper says Mr Trump\u2019s decision went \u201cbeyond righting a historical wrong in denying the Jews the right to determine where their capital is\u201d, and gave the diplomatic process a \u201cbadly needed jolt\u201d by forcing people to \u201crethink long-held assumptions that have led nowhere\u201d. \n\u2014 Paul Hirschson (@paulhirschson) December 7, 2017 \nThe author writes: \u201cOver the last 24 years, since the beginning of the Oslo peace process, certain tenets have come to be accepted as truths: that the only solution is a two-state solution; that there can be no long-term interim agreements; that dozens of settlements will have to be removed; that a future Palestinian state must be free of Jews; and that Washington cannot recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital until there is a final peace deal. \n\u201cMany will bewail \u2018the impact this move will have on the peace process\u2019 \u2013 except that the peace process has been stuck for years.
