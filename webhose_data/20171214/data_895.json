She won a big round of applause from the audience, most of them Chinese descendants. Happy\u2019s sister Baby Bee, then five years old, did equally well, singing nursery rhymes in Chinese.\n\nWhile it is not uncommon for young Chinese language learners to recite ancient poems, Happy spoke in classical Chinese with a fluency that could make even some native Chinese speakers envious, according to a report in Guangzhou Daily.\n\nAnd recently, during US President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to China, his granddaughter Arabella\u2019s recital of Chinese poems went viral online, making her a \u201cpopular figure\u201d among Chinese audiences.\n\nThere is a long list of foreign celebrities and their children learning Chinese, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019 four children and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his daughter. Even Prince William, media reports say, studied Chinese in school.\n\nThe increasing popularity of the Chinese language has led to the introduction of various programmes and classes worldwide. It is estimated that more than 100 million people outside China, including overseas Chinese, are studying the language, as many believe it can be used as a tool to gain access to conveniences in not only China but also some other countries.\n\nThe growing enthusiasm of people in other countries to learn Chinese can be attributed to their love for Chinese culture.\n\nIt perhaps explains why traditional Chinese cultural elements, from kung fu films to ancient works such as The Analects of Confucius and Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War, have won so many global diehard fans. Many foreigners even believe that Chinese characters are an expression of aesthetic appreciation \u2013 maybe that\u2019s why many famous personalities including former soccer star David Beckham have got Chinese characters tattooed on their body.\n\nChina\u2019s economic and social development is another important factor for the growing interest in the language and culture. As the world\u2019s most populous country and the second-largest economy, China for years has accounted for the largest number of students studying in other countries, which might also have made people overseas interested in the language.\n\nAs Jim Rogers said, whether you like or not, the 21st century will belong to China. He always tells people that if they have children, they shall encourage them to learn Chinese, \u201cbecause Chinese will be the most important language\u201d. For foreign companies intending to do business in China, they can have a huge advantage over their competitors if they can master the language.\n\nAnd with the Belt and Road Initiative progressing smoothly, a number of Chinese enterprises will venture into countries along the ancient trade routes for business, which means a higher demand for Chinese speakers. \n\nSource: China Daily/Asia News Network\n\nChina rising, but English is still king   \nAsia News Network and The Star recently published an article \u201cSway of the Chinese language\u201d, detailing the rising popularity of learning Chinese as posted above.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, US President Donald Trump\u2019s granddaughter and billionaire investor Jim Rogers\u2019 daughter are among some of the famous people or their family members brushing up on their Chinese language skills.\n\nTourists from China are splashing their cash all over the world (in some countries such as Thailand and Malaysia, the Chinese can also go cashless by making their purchases through Alipay).\n\nMeanwhile, economists predict that the GDP of China, currently the world\u2019s second largest, would surpass the United States\u2019 within 10 years. As the economic value of the Chinese language grows, it will unseat English to become the world\u2019s leading language. Or so we are told....\n\nBut if history is a clue, this may not happen so soon.\n\nIn the heyday of the Roman Empire, as the great Julius Caesar and his successors conquered the Mediterranean, Latin became the dominant language of the European continent. The Roman Empire began to disintegrate in the fifth century. Latin, however, remained relevant for many centuries to come. (The Eastern Roman Empire, also known as Byzantine Empire, survived into 15th century, but its capital was in Constantinople, and its official language was Greek.)\n\nIn year 1215, the unpopular King John of England, pressured by rebel barons, issued Magna Carta. The document established for the first time the principle that everybody, including the king, was subject to the law. It is considered one of the first steps taken in England towards establishing parliamentary democracy. The Magna Carta was initially written in Latin.\n\nIn year 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published three papers which were collectively known as Principia Mathematica. These works form the foundation of classical mechanics. Principia Mathematica, like the Magna Carta, was written in Latin. That was more than 12 centuries after the demise of the Roman Empire.\n\nIn ancient times, Malay language was the lingua franca of the Malay Archipelago. Then the Western powers came, created the modern states of Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and Indonesia. Post-independence, Javanese, who make up 40% of Indonesia\u2019s population, dominate the republic\u2019s politics and economy. Somehow, Bahasa Indonesia is based on Malay rather than Javanese.\n\nBy 2050, China will become the world\u2019s largest economy. The US will drop to second place. In the third spot, as economists believe, will be India. Like Malaysia, India was a British territory. And like our country, English, the language of the former colonial master, is still widely spoken.\n\nBy mid-century, the combined GDP of English-speaking and English-as-second-language nations, which include US, India, Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia, will likely be larger than that of China.\n\nI do not doubt that Chinese language will get more important every year, and I encourage everyone to learn it if conditions allow. However, it would be foolish if we, in the advent of \u201cChina\u2019s Century\u201d, neglect English.\n\nBy CHEW KHENG SIONG Kuala Lumpur\n\nRelated posts: \n\nChinese are the unsung heroes of South East Asia, Robert Kuok Memoirs https://youtu.be/oU0tz-3Uzeg They are the most amazing economic ants on Earth, \u2018Sugar King\u2019 writes in memoir  Good Chinese ... \nUS has to accept China\u2019s rise: expert said in 7th Xiangshan Security Forum    Singapore warns US on anti-China rhetoric!

Put simply, this is the idea that as a society, we are kept in a state of arrested development by dominant forces in order to keep us more pliant. We are made passionate about the things that occupied us as children as a means of drawing our attentions away from the things we really should be invested in, inequality, corruption, economic injustice etc. It makes sense that when faced with the awfulness of the world, the harsh realities that surround us, our instinct is to seek comfort, and where else were the majority of us most comfortable than our youth? A time when we were shielded from painful truths by our recreational passions, the toys we played with, the games we played, the comics we read. There was probably more discussion on Twitter about the The Force Awakens and the Batman vs Superman trailers than there was about the Nepalese earthquake or the British general election.\nThe \u2018dumbing down\u2019 comment came off as a huge generalisation by an A-grade asshorn.

(AP) - Kentucky State Police have charged a third person in connection with the discovery of a body inside a toolbox that was floating in a creek. \nPolice said 29-year-old Marcus Branden Boyken of Greenville was arrested Wednesday and charged with tampering with physical evidence. Boyken is incarcerated at the Kentucky State Reformatory at La Grange on unrelated charges. \nTwo other men face murder charges in the 2016 death of 29-year-old Tromain Mackall of Ohio County. The toolbox containing Mackall's body was found floating in Spring Fork Creek in Grayson County. \nLast week, police said 33-year-old Christopher S. Hill of Owensboro was charged with murder, kidnapping and tampering with physical evidence. Police had previously charged 48-year-old William E.

Kohli\u2019s double ton was followed by a 50 in the second innings as he finished with 610 runs in the series, which India won 1-0 after the first and third Test ended in draws in Kolkata and New Delhi. Kohli, who slammed back-to-back double-centuries and recorded three-figure scores in three consecutive matches, started the series in sixth position but has leapfrogged David Warner, Cheteshwar Pujara, Kane Williamson and Joe Root after the stupendous run which saw him average 152.50. Though 45 points separate him from Australia captain Steve Smith, Kohli would be eyeing the chance of reaching the zenith in all three formats since he is the current No. 1 in ODIs and T20Is, the ICC said in a statement. Smith though has been in a different league and last week reached 941 points, the joint fifth-highest in terms of the highest points tally in batting history in Tests. Smith is now on 938 points while Kohli is on 893 points. Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting is the only batsman to have been at the top in all three formats at the same time \u2013 in December-January 2005-06, while his compatriot Matthew Hayden is the other batsman to have topped all three formats. Though Smith enjoys a substantial lead over Kohli, the competition for second to fifth positions remains intense. Before this Test, only 11 points separated second-ranked Pujara from fifth-ranked Kohli. Following the latest performances, the gap has increased slightly with 28 points now separating second-ranked Kohli from fifth-ranked Williamson. Among other Indians, opener Murali Vijay (up three places to 25th) and middle-order batsman Rohit Sharma (up six places to 40th) are the other batsmen to move up. Pujara slipped two places to the fourth spot, while Ravindra jadeja slumped to the third position after losing a place in the bolwers ranking. R Ashwin was steady at the fourth spot. In the allrounder list, Jadeja was at the second spot, while Ashwin lost a place to be at the fourth position. For Sri Lanka, captain Dinesh Chandimal has gained eight places to take ninth position after finishing the series with 366 runs, the first time he has moved into the top 10.

Currently, there are no known cultivars of dry bean with complete resistance to white mold. For more than 20 years, bean breeders have been using white mold screening nurseries (wmn) with natural populations of S. sclerotiorum to screen new cultivars for resistance. It is thus important to know if the genetic diversity in populations of S. sclerotiorum within these nurseries (a) reflect the genetic diversity of the populations in the surrounding region and (b) are stable over time. Furthermore, previous studies have investigated the correlation between mycelial compatibility groups (MCG) and multilocus haplotypes (MLH), but none have formally tested these patterns. We genotyped 366 isolates of S. sclerotiorum from producer fields and wmn surveyed over 10 years in 2003\u20132012 representing 11 states in the United States of America, Australia, France, and Mexico at 11 microsatellite loci resulting in 165 MLHs. Populations were loosely structured over space and time based on analysis of molecular variance and discriminant analysis of principal components, but not by cultivar, aggressiveness, or field source. Of all the regions tested, only Mexico (n = 18) shared no MLHs with any other region. Using a bipartite network-based approach, we found no evidence that the MCGs accurately represent MLHs. Our study suggests that breeders should continue to test dry bean lines in several wmn across the United States to account for both the phenotypic and genotypic variation that exists across regions.\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2BbowcF\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "mcg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:26.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db90284c14a1bf39d2c51496c92ca182ca9f5707", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9QCjJMm01ny0hSGaU8FgAEjOotfg_dAVLcppZyiQ8gNWaO_6VbCnLAZcroY2jgCBw0raKr6BI_bDqf3jEPkQsr", "site_full": "www.politicaljack.com", "site": "politicaljack.com", "site_section": "http://www.politicaljack.com/forums/latest-political-news-and-current-events.2/", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "Latest Political News and Current Events | PoliticalJack.com", "title": "Al throws in the towel", "title_full": "Al throws in the towel | PoliticalJack.com", "published": "2017-12-06T16:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.politicaljack.com/data/avatars/m/8/8062.jpg?1453285128", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9b86b1eff9b560f9d39b87e4c7e3f7ae787cc8da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9QCjJMm01ny0hSGaU8FgAEjOotfg_dAVLcppZyiQ8gNWaO_6VbCnLAZcroY2jgCBw0raKr6BI_bEPgWR8VcATIgK1RZozwnJk-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Capitalist", "published": "2017-12-06T19:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "justoffal said: \u2191 https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/12/06/senator-al-franken-to-resign\nI'm not sure how I feel about it really.\nI want Franken to go away but not like this.\nSo he's an obnoxious socialite...that's a far cry from rape or even from Conyers.\nIn fact I wonder how much of Franken's decision was based on the fact that Conyers was pushed out fearing that the race card would be pulled out by the uber left?\nI would've preferred to see him try his luck at reelection.\nJo Click to expand...

Now picture the state of affairs in the Grand Duchy of Finland at the fag-end of the 19th century, when Tsarist Russia decided to water down the modest degree of Finnish autonomy still further and impose massive restrictions on the freedom of the press. What could you do as a young artist if you were no longer prepared to bow to the forces of oppression? Sakari Oramo \u00a9 Benjamin Ealovega https://bachtrack.com/files/72599-sakari-oramo-benjamin-ealovega.jpg 510 340 \nJean Sibelius knew what he could and had to do. He composed a new work and organised a concert in November 1899, using the revenue from ticket sales to bolster the benevolent fund for journalists who had been deprived of their livelihood. The piece in question stretches to forty minutes and delights in the original title of Musiikkia Sanomalehdist\u00f6n p\u00e4ivien juhlan\u00e4yt\u00e4nt\u00f6\u00f6n . Never heard of it? Nor had I, not even in the English translation of Press Celebrations Music, though the last of the six tableaux is better known as a precursor to the composer\u2019s most popular piece, Finlandia . \nFull marks to Sakari Oramo and the BBC Symphony Orchestra for introducing us in this astonishingly late UK premi\u00e8re to the protean germs of musical ideas from which the later symphonies developed. There was already more than a hint of the composer\u2019s signature statements in the chirpy woodwind melodies and confident brass flourishes of the prelude. His individuality was equally present in the deep, earthy sounds and rhetorical flourishes of the second tableau (\u201cThe Finns are Baptised\u201d), with striking dissonances and elements of chromaticism reminiscent of his contemporary Scriabin, as well as in the muted horns that conjured up a desolate landscape early in the fourth tableau (\u201cThe Finns in the Thirty Years War\u201d). More surprising perhaps was the Spanish flavour evident in the third tableau (\u201cScene from Duke John\u2019s Court\u201d), to which in his sensitive shaping of these cosmopolitan influences Oramo added an unmistakeably Viennese lilt. The grounding of Sibelius in the German tradition found particular expression in the Wagner-like rumblings from the lower strings that built to a ferocious operatic climax in the fourth tableau and also in the mighty Brucknerian blasts of heavy brass in the following tableau (\u201cThe Great Hostility\u201d). \nThroughout Oramo conducted with palpable passion and commitment and he was rewarded with incisive and assured playing from the BBCSO. However, it is a work in which the composer\u2019s teeming ideas do not yet emerge fully-formed, and given that in the Barbican the sound can easily acquire a slightly strident edge there was occasionally an uncomfortable over-presence of the brass. Oramo has been winning plaudits from many quarters for the quality of the playing in his current Sibelius cycle and this concert underlined that achievement, most apparent to me in the depth and tonal richness of the strings. If I do have a slight niggle, it was the failure to achieve a hushed but full pianissimo in those passages that cry out for such contrasts, for instance in the lyrical intermezzo of the final tableau (\u201cFinland Awakes\u201d) as well as in the slow movement of the First Symphony that occupied the second half. \nBefore that we had the two short lyrical interludes for cello and reduced orchestra (no oboes or trumpets) that form the Two Serious Melodies , the first (\u201cCantique\u201d) pastoral in mood and the second (\u201cDevotion\u201d) more ruminative, played with elegant poise by Guy Johnston. \nI have heard more atmospheric beginnings to the E minor First Symphony, with the clarinet solo less pronounced than it was here, but there was no doubting when the second violins made their entry, buzzing with pent-up anticipation, that this was going to be a full-blooded account. Here was a young man\u2019s heart beating vigorously and purposefully, the electron-charged waves of energy carrying right through to the scherzo, where the brass had plenty of bite, the strings flexed their collective muscles and the timpani commanded absolute attention. After the gloriously full unison string statement at the outset of the finale, Oramo pressed on with all the impetuosity of youth, taking the Allegro molto marking much closer to furioso . This was high-octane stuff, but it came very close to the heart of what the composer surely intended, expressed in his own words: \u201cRomanticism is the innermost essence of music. What is Romantic is imperishable.\u201d \nExactly one hundred years ago, in the midst of revolutionary turmoil in Russia, Finland gained its independence and reasserted its cultural identity. Looking at the impressive list of fine composers, instrumentalists, singers and conductors to come from a country of just over five million people, nobody need ever doubt its musical credentials.

We believe this should significantly reduce the time and investment necessary for Decibel to sustainably discover and develop meaningful new medications for hearing loss and tinnitus, increase our probability of success, and enable us to build the world\u2019s leading hearing therapeutics company.\u201d \n\nThe collaboration has an innovative structure where Regeneron will provide Decibel with broad access to its proprietary suite of technologies to support Decibel\u2019s goal of discovering important new medicines for hearing. Regeneron will also directly participate in and provide financial support for Decibel\u2019s research and development efforts, both through R&D funding payments and a strategic equity investment in Decibel. Decibel retains worldwide development and commercialisation rights to any products discovered in the collaboration and will pay Regeneron tiered royalties based on net sales. \n\n\u201cRegeneron is committed to following the science as broadly as possible, and we\u2019re excited to invest in new discoveries coming not only from our labs but also from young biotechnology companies with whom we believe we can synergize. We see these kinds of creative collaborations as a promising way to extend the impact of our technology and medicines to even more patients in need,\u201d said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. \u201cDecibel is an ideal example in the area of hearing problems \u2013 a condition where new and earlier interventions could truly change the course of a person\u2019s entire life.\u201d \n\n\u201cThis stands out as one of the most unique collaborations that I have seen in my 30-plus years in biotech,\u201d said Kevin Starr, Co-Founder and Partner at Third Rock Ventures and Chairman of Decibel. \u201cThe scope of the collaboration in research and discovery, as well as the retention by the younger biotechnology company to all commercial rights worldwide, are unprecedented in my experience. It positions Decibel to lead the way in developing meaningful therapeutics for hearing.\u201d Related Now Trending", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kevin starr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "decibel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george d. yancopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven h. holtzman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "regeneron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "decibel therapeutics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "decibel therapeutics, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "decibel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "regeneron pharmaceuticals, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "third rock ventures", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:26.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5866b5c3bef8f8e3f55e5c079f382b66551f60e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IXKuwN6dJRcyBJ7mV3QyAy01slE29NnfqdwR7fad_ddWtEMx4pdpXFj6zGvJ2cQ43e4KI9VtpEDvW006lQ_h2P", "site_full": "enews24.tving.com", "site": "tving.com", "site_section": "http://enews24.tving.com/public/news/list_more.asp?pageNum=1&pageSize=100&listType=L&/news/?cateType=0103", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "[e\u00ed\u008f\u0179\u00ed\u0086 ] \u0119\u0142 \u011b\u009b\u0090\u00ed\u009d\u0179, \u011b\u009d\u0098\u011b\u0083\u0081\u011b\u009d\u00b4 \u00eb\u0084\u0088\u00eb\u0179\u00b4 \u0119\u0142\u017a\u00ed\u0096\u0088\u00eb\u0082\u0098?", "title_full": "[e\u00ed\u008f\u0179\u00ed\u0086 ] \u0119\u0142 \u011b\u009b\u0090\u00ed\u009d\u0179, \u011b\u009d\u0098\u011b\u0083\u0081\u011b\u009d\u00b4 \u00eb\u0084\u0088\u00eb\u0179\u00b4 \u0119\u0142\u017a\u00ed\u0096\u0088\u00eb\u0082\u0098?

There is increasing evidence that high UPF consumption is indicative of poor diet and is associated with obesity and metabolic disorders. This study sought to examine the relationship between percent of energy intake from ultra-processed foods (PEI-UPF) during pregnancy and maternal gestational weight gain, maternal lipids and glycemia, and neonatal body composition. We also compared the PEI-UPF indicator against the US government's Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010). Methods Data were used from a longitudinal study performed in 2013\u20132014 at the Women's Health Center and Obstetrics & Gynecology Clinic in St. Louis, MO, USA. Subjects were pregnant women in the normal and obese weight ranges, as well as their newborns (n = 45). PEI-UPF and the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) were calculated for each subject from a one-month food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Multiple regression (ANCOVA-like) analysis was used to analyze the relationship between PEI-UPF or HEI-2010 and various clinical outcomes. The ability of these dietary indices to predict clinical outcomes was also compared with the predictive abilities of total energy intake and total fat intake. Results An average of 54.4 \u00b1 13.2% of energy intake was derived from UPFs. A 1%-point increase in PEI-UPF was associated with a 1.33 kg increase in gestational weight gain (p = 0.016). Similarly, a 1%-point increase in PEI-UPF was associated with a 0.22 mm increase in thigh skinfold (p = 0.045), 0.14 mm in subscapular skinfold (p = 0.026), and 0.62 percentage points of total body adiposity (p = 0.037) in the neonate. Discussion PEI-UPF (percent of energy intake from ultra-processed foods) was associated with and may be a useful predictor of increased gestational weight gain and neonatal body fat. PEI-UPF was a better predictor of all tested outcomes than either total energy or fat intake, and a better predictor of the three infant body fat measures than HEI-2010. UPF consumption should be limited during pregnancy and diet quality should be maximized in order to improve maternal and neonatal health.\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2Ai0ug7\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "women's health center and obstetrics & gynecology clinic", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. louis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:27.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c80a98bbb8799a0883671b4f2286e88b1e69eab4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRfBTJDgZ3haFglhBvQxR22JYt47sLJTKLUdM7zQQjZpJJgvXWKeHBKrabIdg1e.PXprIhY7DegCrguf.S4EVDs", "site_full": "www.petforums.co.uk", "site": "petforums.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.petforums.co.uk/forums/general-chat.13/", "site_categories": ["dogs", "pets"], "section_title": "General Chat | Pet Forums Community ", "title": "New Netflix discovery | Page 8", "title_full": "New Netflix discovery | Page 8 | Pet Forums Community", "published": "2017-12-06T13:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.petforums.co.uk/data/avatars/m/1429/1429345.jpg?1482252056", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "977eae999b91793888f5d5b5be4388bfaecc7a1c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRfBTJDgZ3haFglhBvQxR22JYt47sLJTKLUdM7zQQjZpJJgvXWKeHBKrabIdg1e.PXprIhY7DegCinHSEgvVKTU6PhxvY1Cg1g-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "PawsOnMe", "published": "2017-12-06T13:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "MiffyMoo said: \u2191 Ooh, I didn\u2019t know you could do that.

(\u201cAntares\u201d) (NASDAQ: ATRS) securities between December 21, 2016 and October 12, 2017 . \nClick here to learn about the case: http://www.wongesq.com/pslra-sb/antares-pharma-inc?wire=1 . There is no cost or obligation to you. \nAccording to the complaint, throughout the Class Period, the Company issued materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Antares had provided insufficient data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in connection with its New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d) for Xyosted; (2) accordingly, Antares had overstated the approval prospects for Xyosted; and (3) consequently, Antares\u2019 public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. \nOn October 11, 2017, the Company received a letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration stating that the agency had \u201cidentified deficiencies that preclude the continuation of the discussion of labeling and post marketing requirements/commitments\u201d for its product candidate Xyosted. Then on October 20, 2017, Antares announced receipt of a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding the New Drug Application for Xyosted. The Company stated that the FDA could not approve the NDA in its present form due to concerns that Xyosted \u201ccould cause a clinically meaningful increase in blood pressure\u201d and also noted the FDA\u2019s concerns \u201cregarding the occurrence of depression and suicidality.\u201d \nIf you suffered a loss in Antares, you have until December 22, 2017 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn\u2019t require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Here we introduce key concepts and definitions of epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNA, review the current understanding of epigenetics in both fish and shellfish, and propose key areas of aquaculture where epigenetics could be applied. The first key area is environmental manipulation, where the intention is to induce an 'epigenetic memory' either within or between generations to produce a desired phenotype. The second key area is epigenetic selection, which, alone or combined with genetic selection, may increase the reliability of producing animals with desired phenotypes. Based on aspects of life history and husbandry practices in aquaculture species, the application of epigenetic knowledge could significantly affect the productivity and sustainability of aquaculture practices. Conversely, clarifying the role of epigenetic mechanisms in aquaculture species may upend traditional assumptions about selection practices. Ultimately, there are still many unanswered questions regarding how epigenetic mechanisms might be leveraged in aquaculture.\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2BaWgXl\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:28.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6fa9c30c1215b26b6e273f9aed43efb2b2b039a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR.dBAALDPVoLDK7UIzzNUkMFGE8L29Pva7G5PZW1UhwY4V0H7JmDWy.QAT_oU5w89rQt5UTsGcmFbAGwBLItr.oOILe9UlikVxgZ1_LyvNogVz0n3XTVCsHl4.QJo5xEE-", "site_full": "www.autopia.org", "site": "autopia.org", "site_section": "https://www.autopia.org/forums/forum198/", "site_categories": ["tennis", "sports"], "section_title": "SPONSORED FORUMS", "title": "FINALLY! 20% Off Gift Certificates!", "title_full": "FINALLY! 20% Off Gift Certificates!", "published": "2017-12-06T12:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "473d0c30e2e4713f77b1db1c5e4183ec70be9f02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR.dBAALDPVoLDK7UIzzNUkMFGE8L29Pva7G5PZW1UhwY4V0H7JmDWy.QAT_oU5w89rQt5UTsGcmFbAGwBLItr.oOILe9UlikVxgZ1_LyvNogVz0n3XTVCsqQzMHuWenvTx1vhEGto64vRPdoJbU5._C8zBmcaAKEc-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "LEDetailng", "published": "2017-12-06T20:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Thanks!

Cocoa trees grow in hot and humid climates near the equator. Traditionally, these trees are raised together in mixed groves with other types of trees and plants that can cool the air and provide vital shade. The system, called agroforestry, provides a low-stress environment, increases nutrients in the soil and helps maintain ground water levels. However, to gain higher yields, growers sometimes plant cocoa trees in solitary, \u201cmonocultural,\u201d groves, in which the trees are exposed to stressful conditions. In response to the stress, trees produce antioxidants that can potentially counteract the damage, but these compounds also could change the quality characteristics of the beans. Scientists from Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) in Switzerland wanted to find out whether differing growing methods can influence the chemical composition, and potentially the flavor, of cocoa beans. They harvested beans from five cocoa tree farms in Bolivia at the beginning and end of the dry season, which runs from April to September. The trees were raised in full-sun monocultural groves or in agroforest settings. The beans were fermented and dried, then analysed. The research team detected only minor differences in the chemical composition among the beans harvested from the farms during the same weather conditions. Slightly more phenols and other antioxidant compounds were detected in beans taken from monoculturally grown trees than those that came from trees grown with agroforest methods, but the differences were not significant, according to the researchers. The larger contribution to chemical composition was the weather. Overall, the antioxidant content increased and fat content of the beans decreased during the dry season as temperatures rose and soil moisture dropped. The researchers say these differences could contribute to variability in cocoa bean flavor.

She secretly hopes a marriage to this stranger will lead to love. \nTo honor his father, Devon reluctantly agrees to marry Emma, but determines to keep her at arm\u2019s length. A marriage of convenience is satisfactory to the earl who wants no emotional ties. He needs an heir, but he refuses to bow to the whims and demands of a wife. He would prefer simply to provide a home and a generous allowance for her, but continue to enjoy his freedom. \nEmma\u2019s straightforward and unpretentious manner draws Devon\u2019s admiration.

The partnership will leverage Honda's vehicle control system with SenseTime's AI algorithms to jointly create an autonomous driving solution. The two companies also announced they will work together to develop robot technology.\nRooted in computer vision technologies , au tonomous driving solutions can be deployed even in the absence of high-resolution maps, allowing them to cover an even wider array of driving conditions. When a vehicle is driving without a detailed map covering its trajectory, for example, it will still be able to use the self-driving function. This autonomous driving solution offers great advantages to a variety of passenger vehicle scenarios and will also lower transducer manufacturing costs. \nSenseTime Japan CEO Lao Shihong said, \"Safety is the  utmost priority when it comes to driving, and it also constitutes the core of our autonomous driving solution. By combining SenseTime's strengths in computer vision technologies with Honda's superior vehicle control technologies, we will together enable a safe and pleasant autonomous driving experience.

We pray for winter travelers/ and ask blessings for those who help to keep us safe./ For firefighters in California/ and any who are in harms way./ We pray to the Lord. We pray for those who struggle with life-threatening illness./ For doctors,/ nurses,/ researchers and technicians./ For those who have no access to health care/ or who are burdened with medical expenses./ We pray to the Lord.
