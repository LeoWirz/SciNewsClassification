While a rain shell or puffy jacket may never come out of our pack on a summer hike or climb, we almost invariably wear every article of clothing we carry when backcountry, Nordic, or downhill skiing, snowshoeing, climbing, or trail running in winter.\nEvery winter, I test out new clothing layers doing all of those activities frequently. Here are the best shell and insulated jackets, base layers, and pants I\u2019ve found for being active in winter, grouped into two categories: high-exertion and moderate-exertion activities. \nIn my story \u201c How to Dress in Layers for Winter in the Backcountry ,\u201d I offer advice\u2014based on three decades of Nordic and backcountry skiing, snowshoeing, climbing, camping, and trail running in winter\u2014on how to choose a specific, personalized layering system for different exertion levels and body types in backcountry in temperatures near or below freezing. Use the tips in that story, along with this review, to help you make the best choices in winter outdoor apparel for your activities and your body.\nPlease share your experiences with any of these products in the comments section at the bottom of this review.

Wick moisture off your skin quickly.\n2. Provide at least the minimum amount of warmth you need for the conditions and your body.\nArc\u2019teryx Satoro AR Zip Neck LS.\nThe best base-layer tops I\u2019ve found for any activity in winter conditions are:\nArc\u2019teryx Satoro AR Zip Neck LS \u2014men\u2019s version at backcountry.com or moosejaw.com , women\u2019s at backcountry.com or moosejaw.com .\nIbex Woolies 1 Crew long-sleeve \u2014men\u2019s and women\u2019s at backcountry.com or moosejaw.com .\nPatagonia Capilene Midweight Zip-Neck \u2014men\u2019s and women\u2019s at backcountry.com , moosejaw.com , and rei.com .\nREI Screeline Half-Zip Long-Sleeve \u2014men\u2019s and women\u2019s at rei.com .\nThe North Face Warm Long-Sleeve Zip Neck \u2014men\u2019s and women\u2019s at backcountry.com or moosejaw.com .\n \nSee more in my \u201c Review: The Best Base Layers and Shorts for the Outdoors and Training .\u201d  \nWestcomb Recon Cargo Pant.\nPants for the Backcountry in Winter We generally wear one or two bottom layers and do not change them while outside in winter, so they must be chosen specifically for the activity and conditions. Here are my favorites for three different types of activity and levels of exertion.\nFor trail running, when I prefer highly breathable, fast-wicking tights with some warmth, I like compression tights, and wear the CW-X Stabilyx \u00be Tights quite a lot (find the men\u2019s and women\u2019s versions at backcountry.com ). I\u2019ll also wear them under ski pants in the backcountry or at resorts, to add a little warmth and the benefits of compression.\nWhen Nordic skiing, I favor lightweight soft-shell pants that breathe well, block some wind (for skiing downhill), and offer a bit more warmth than tights.\n \nHi, I\u2019m Michael Lanza, the creator of The Big Outside, recognized as a top outdoors blog by USA Today and others.

The 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act, which called for the U.S. Embassy to be moved to Jerusalem, passed by a large bipartisan margin and was strongly supported by Jewish-American groups. \n\"It's been the consensus mainline view for decades,\" said Nathan Diament, executive director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, \"because Jerusalem is the capital city for Israel and the Jewish people. ... The United States puts its embassies in capital cities, and it's unjust and discriminatory to say we're going to single out Israel as the one country where we don't put our embassy [in the capital].\" \nWhen President Trump on Wednesday ordered the State Department to begin preparations to move the embassy to Jerusalem, several Jewish-American groups welcomed the move. \n\"By stating the truth of Jerusalem's status as the capital of the State of Israel, President Trump has asserted U.S. global leadership towards ending a longstanding, senseless anomaly,\" said David Harris, chief executive officer of the American Jewish Committee. \nThe Anti-Defamation League, while urging a \"rapid resumption\" of peace negotiations, called the move a \"significant step,\" coming at a time \"when international organizations and other detractors delegitimize the Jewish state and deny any Jewish connection to the holy city.\" \nBut there were also misgivings from some Jewish-American groups. The Reform Jewish Movement, representing nearly 900 congregations, noted that it has long supported the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital but also believed that moving the U.S. Embassy there should happen only \"at the right time.\" Without a comprehensive peace plan, the movement said it cannot support the president's decision to move the embassy now. \nConservative evangelical Christian leaders had fewer qualms. \n\"This decision will be met by political praise and theological conviction,\" said Johnnie Moore, an informal spokesman for Trump's evangelical advisory group. \"Evangelicals in every corner of the United States will be ecstatic,\" he said. \nEvangelicals feel a special kinship with Jerusalem as the city where they believe Jesus Christ was crucified and rose again. Some sects even take an eschatological view, arguing that Jesus will return to Earth in Jerusalem, once all Jews are reunited there. \nFor Trump's evangelical advisory group, said Moore, the only issue more important than the status of Jerusalem is the question of who will be appointed as federal judges. \n\"In our various meetings with the White House, this issue has always come up,\" Moore said. \"And it has always been an extended discussion around the table. I mean, at the heart of the relationship between the United States and Israel has been the friendship between evangelical Christians and the Jewish people.\" \nSome evangelical leaders who generally support the president's Jerusalem decision, however, fear the repercussions for their own Palestinian Christian followers. Muslim leaders in the Palestinian territories have warned there will be a reaction there to the president's announcement. The governments of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Turkey all expressed alarm at Trump's decision, as did Muslim leaders in the U.S. \n\"The reality is that Palestinians have existed for generations on the land of Palestine [and] in Jerusalem,\" said Osama Abuirshaid, a board member of the American Muslims for Palestine, at a news conference near the White House. \"[Trump] cannot deny this reality,\" Abuirshaid said. \"He spoke about the Jewish connection to Jerusalem while negating the Christian and Muslim connection to the land and to the holy city.\" \nPope Francis advised against \"adding new elements of tension in a world already shaken and scarred by many cruel conflicts.\" The heads of several Christian churches in Jerusalem, in a joint letter to Trump, said a unilateral change in the status of Jerusalem by the U.S. government \"will yield increased hatred, conflict, violence, and suffering in Jerusalem and the Holy Land ... [and] cause irreparable harm.\" \nA similar warning came from Elizabeth Eaton, the presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the largest Lutheran group in the U.S. \n\"This announcement,\" Eaton said, \"has a high probability of leading to violence and bloodshed and not ... getting any closer to having the two parties come to the table again.\" \nEaton spoke following a meeting in Geneva with fellow Lutheran chuch leaders from around the world, including those in Jordan and other Arab countries.

So it's not surprising that religious leaders from all those traditions have strong feelings about President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. NPR's Tom Gjelten reports. \nTOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: Jewish organizations were solidly behind a 1995 law that called for moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Nathan Diament, executive director of the Orthodox Union of Judaism, says it's long been a consensus Jewish position. \nNATHAN DIAMENT: Because Jerusalem is the capital city for Israel and the Jewish people, because the United States puts its embassies in the capital cities, and it's unjust and discriminatory to say we're going to single out Israel as the one country where we're not going to put our embassy. \nGJELTEN: When President Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and ordered preparations to move the embassy there, several Jewish organizations welcomed the move, among them the American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation League. But there were also misgivings. The Reform Jewish movement noted it has long said that Jerusalem is Israel's eternal capital and that the U.S. embassy should be moved there but only at the right time. Absent a comprehensive peace plan, the movement said it cannot support moving the embassy now. No such qualms from the most conservative evangelical Christian leaders. Johnnie Moore is a member of President Trump's evangelical advisory group. \nJOHNNIE MOORE: This decision will be met by political praise and by theological conviction, and evangelicals in every corner of the United States will be ecstatic. \nGJELTEN: Ecstatic - evangelicals feel a special kinship with Jerusalem as the city where Christ was crucified and rose again. Moore says for his advisory group, the only issue more important than Jerusalem has been who gets appointed as federal judges. \nMOORE: In our various meetings with the White House, the listening sessions, this issue has always come up. And not only has it always come up, but it has always been an extended discussion around the table. I mean, at the heart of the relationship between the United States and Israel is the friendship between evangelical Christians and the Jewish people. \nGJELTEN: But some evangelical leaders who generally support the president's Jerusalem decision fear the repercussions for their own Palestinian Christian followers. Muslim leaders in the Palestinian territories warn there will be a reaction there to the president's announcement. Osama Abu Irshaid, representing American Muslims for Palestine, says Trump failed to recognize Jerusalem's multifaith heritage. \n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) \nOSAMA ABU IRSHAID: He spoke about the Jewish connection to Jerusalem while negating the Christian and the Muslim connection to the land, too, and to the holy city. \nGJELTEN: Pope Francis warned against adding new elements of tension in a world already shaken and scarred by many cruel conflicts. The heads of Eastern Orthodox churches in Jerusalem say Trump is causing irreparable harm to the prospects for peace. And from a mainline Protestant leader, this statement by Bishop Elizabeth Eaton, representing the largest U.S. Lutheran group. \nELIZABETH EATON: Making this announcement I feel has the high probability of leading to violence and bloodshed and does not have an immediate possibility with getting any closer to having the two parties come to the table again. \nGJELTEN: Eaton made that statement having just met in Geneva with fellow Lutheran leaders from around the world. \nTom Gjelten, NPR News. \n(SOUNDBITE OF KOLOTO'S \"PRIMER\") Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. \u00a9 2017 KUER 90.1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom gjelten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus christ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eaton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmad gharabli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nathan diament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "osama abuirshaid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elizabeth eaton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pope francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abuirshaid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnnie moore", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american jewish committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evangelical lutheran church in america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "union of orthodox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anti-defamation league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american muslims for palestine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american embassy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "old city of jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:50.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "294c37c860bfc086a64d0504601886ee8e2adacf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSNhmZEbhKAgfcMOrqlCc5UP3K0l00eQOI2Y.417rKXYy6IKofm.GYK6ZGORI5D4xIjvXityQnrFnfj_ijcdr_LZqFDwNzFda6bBYsAQfpdIml2jSaYeakS", "site_full": "www.thetvdb.com", "site": "thetvdb.com", "site_section": "http://thetvdb.com/rss/newtoday.php", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "TheTVDB.com Today's New Episodes", "title": "Gotham: A Dark Knight: Queen Takes Knight", "title_full": "Gotham: A Dark Knight: Queen Takes Knight", "published": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15420, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "294c37c860bfc086a64d0504601886ee8e2adacf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSNhmZEbhKAgfcMOrqlCc5UP3K0l00eQOI2Y.417rKXYy6IKofm.GYK6ZGORI5D4xIjvXityQnrFnfj_ijcdr_LZqFDwNzFda6bBYsAQfpdIml2jSaYeakS", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "Gotham: A Dark Knight: Queen Takes Knight", "text": "Production Code: Overview: Things get complicated for Gordon, Sophia and Penguin when Carmine Falcone (guest star John Doman) comes to town.

And the bills would do so without repealing the so-called \"stepped-up basis\" provision. \nOrdinarily, people have to pay taxes when they sell off assets that have appreciated in value, like shares of stock or real estate. But heirs are exempted from that tax. That's because they already pay the estate tax. \nThe bills approved by Congress recently would eliminate or reduce the estate tax, while leaving the exemption in place. \nIn other words, you would be able to pass on assets that have gained a lot in value \u2014 like those Apple shares you bought years ago \u2014 and, unlike everyone else, your heirs never have to pay tax on the appreciation. \nTo put it another way: Someone could inherit her grandfather's large beachfront mansion without paying estate tax, and sell it off right away without paying any capital gains tax. \nIt's a much more generous policy than previous tax overhauls, says Lily Batchelder, a professor of law and public policy at New York University Law School. \n\"We've never seen a proposal like this,\" she says. \"I don't recall ever seeing a proposal that would both fully repeal the estate tax and fully exempt from tax all the accrued gains on these giant estates.\" \nThe bill passed by the Senate early Saturday would double the exemption on large estates, allowing people to pass on estates worth $11 million to their heirs tax-free. \nThe exemption for married couples would be $22 million. The House bill would gradually reduce the estate tax and then scrap it altogether in 2023. \nHouse and Senate leaders are now trying to reconcile the two versions of the tax overhaul, with a vote expected by the end of the month. \nThe estate tax has long been the bane of conservatives. Congress briefly eliminated the tax in 2010, but it came back the following year and remains in place today. \n\"We just think it's unfair. Death should not be a taxable event. And we should not be stopping people from being able to pass their life's work on to their kids,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told Fox News recently. \nThe estate tax brings in a relatively small amount of money to the federal Treasury, about $19 billion a year, even as it hurts the large economy, says Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation. \nBecause of the tax, people end up pouring money into tax shelters and paying hefty bills to tax lawyers, he says. \nThe tax is especially onerous for assets that may be worth a lot on paper but are cash poor, such as certain kinds of businesses, Hodge says. In some cases, heirs have to break up or sell businesses to pay taxes, he says. \nPeople who want to keep the tax say such cases are extremely rare. They also say that at a time of growing income inequality, the estate tax plays an important role in making the economy fair. \n\"The estate tax is basically a way of partially leveling the playing field, so that these heirs of massive estates don't have quite as gigantic a leg up in life,\" Batchelder says.

The House and Senate have passed bills that would eliminate or reduce the tax that people pay when they inherit large estates - larger than $5.5 million. It's part of the massive tax overhaul legislation that is in its final stages in Congress right now. And even though Republicans have tried for years to scale back this tax, NPR's Jim Zarroli says this effort goes further. \nJIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The last time the estate tax was repealed, the move was temporary. During the George W. Bush administration, Congress gradually reduced the tax and then ended it altogether in 2010. But the tax came back the next year and remains in place today. Now Republicans are pushing a permanent repeal. Here was House Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News recently. \n(SOUNDBITE OF FOX NEWS BROADCAST) \nPAUL RYAN: We just think it's unfair. Death should not be a taxable event, and we should not be stopping people from being able to pass their life's work onto their kids. \nZARROLI: This time, Republicans could get their way. The bill approved by the Senate would double the estate tax exemption, which means many fewer people would have to pay it. The House version would reduce the tax and then scrap it in 2023. And these bills would be more generous to heirs than previous repeal attempts because of a provision in the tax code. That provision means, if you have an asset that's climbed a lot in value over the years, like your Apple stock or a Warhol print, you can leave it to your heirs, and they don't have to pay taxes on the appreciation. New York University law professor Lily Batchelder says this goes beyond previous repeal bills. \nLILY BATCHELDER: It would really mean that these giant estates - a lot of them would have never been taxed under the income tax, and then there no longer would be an estate tax. \nZARROLI: Critics of the estate tax, like Scott Hodge of the Tax Foundation, point out that it only raises about $19 billion for the Treasury each year, but it hurts the economy. \nSCOTT HODGE: Its effect on the economy is outsized, in terms of what it does to change people's decision-making, in terms of the kind of investments they make, how they set up their affairs and other things. And so it can have a pretty serious consequence on economic growth. \nZARROLI: Hodge says the estate tax encourages people to spend money on tax lawyers and tax shelters. He says it can be really burdensome for people who inherit assets that are worth a lot but are cash poor, like certain kinds of businesses, so people who inherit them may be forced to break them up or sell them off. But people who want to keep the estate tax point out that such cases are really rare. NYU's Lily Batchelder says the estate tax has an important function. \nBATCHELDER: The estate tax is basically a way of partially leveling the playing field so that these heirs of massive estates don't have quite as gigantic a leg up in life. \nZARROLI: That's important, she says, at a time of growing inequality. But if the repeal effort fails, it could be less about the wealth gap than the budget deficit. Numerous analysts say the tax overhaul will increase government debt. That means Republicans could once again be forced to reduce the estate tax but not eliminate it altogether.

K-12 \nLet's start with K-12. There, Republicans from both sides of Congress generally agree on two big changes. \nSaving for private school \nTaxpayers can currently save money for college through a 529 plan, where earnings grow tax-free. Many states also offer deductions for contributions. In the proposals, Republicans want to let taxpayers use 529s to pay for K-12 tuition at private and religious schools, too. Families can already do that with a different plan \u2014 Coverdell Education Savings Accounts \u2014 but these have low contribution limits and aren't open to high-income Americans. The move to expand the 529 would dramatically increase who could use these plans and the money they could save. \n\"I think the only taxpayers who will be in a position to benefit from the 529 change are very rich people,\" says Nora Gordon, an economist and associate professor at Georgetown University. She says using these accounts to save for elementary or high school won't help much unless you can afford to set aside a lot of money early on. No wonder, when the Government Accountability Office studied 529s and Coverdells a few years ago, it found \"families with these accounts had about 25 times the median financial assets\" of those who didn't use them and \"about three times the median income.\" \nWhile the proposed expansion of 529 plans would largely help affluent parents who use private schools, Republicans are proposing another change that could hurt funding for the nation's public schools. \nThe SALT (state and local taxes) deduction \nUp to now, taxpayers who itemize their deductions \u2014 generally high-earners who make up about a third of households in the U.S. \u2014 have gotten a break from the federal government for paying state and local taxes. \nThink of it as a kind of rebate \u2014 courtesy of Washington \u2014 that ultimately helps state and local governments pay for important things, like schools, among other things. \nRepublicans now want to cut that discount, getting rid of the income and sales tax deductions and putting a $10,000 cap on the deduction for property taxes. \n\"This bill is going to make it more painful for residents to increase local property taxes to pay for public schools,\" says John Friedman, an associate professor of economics at Brown University. \nOn average, nearly half of public schools' funding (45 percent) comes from local taxes, often property taxes. In the past, when locals hiked these taxes to help pay for their schools, the federal government made the hike hurt less with that SALT deduction. So imagine, if Congress caps the property tax deduction, for high earners who already pay a lot \u2014 in places like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, even Texas \u2014 a new hike would hurt more than it used to. \n\"This is a really big deal for some states and no deal at all for other states. And the states that it's a really big deal for are blue states,\" says Nora Gordon of Georgetown. \"They're states with higher cost of living, higher property values and states that spend more on their state and local government.\" \nWhile local taxes provide nearly half of public school dollars, state taxes account for much of the rest (46 percent). Kim Rueben of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says states often use these sales and income taxes to help their poorest schools. \n\"The money from the state ends up helping to prop up school districts that have less ability to raise money from the property tax,\" she says. Getting rid of these deductions, Rueben says, will make state-level taxes more painful for some and, again, could make it harder to raise money for schools in the future. \nImportant context: All this is happening with many school districts still reeling from the Great Recession. According to a recent analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, after adjusting for inflation, \"twenty-nine states provided less overall state funding per student in the 2015 school year than in the 2008 school year, before the recession took hold.\" Higher education \nThe two tax bills are farther apart when it comes to higher education. \nIn the House: fewer tuition benefits \nWe've heard a lot about graduate students' reaction to the proposal to tax their tuition waivers as income. \nAs Ariana Figueroa reported for NPR: \n\"Many grad students \u2014 especially in Ph.D. programs \u2014 receive tuition waivers in exchange for teaching classes or doing research. Under current law, that money isn't taxed as income. But the House bill calls for those tuition waivers to be counted as income and subjected to income taxes. \nThat means graduate students would be paying taxes on money they never receive.\" \nThe House bill also cuts or reduces other higher education tax benefits: The Hope Scholarship Credit The Lifetime Learning Credit and tuition deduction The deduction on interest for those repaying student loans The American Opportunity Tax Credit, which students and families can use to offset college tuition payments, is limited to exclude part-time and graduate students, although it is also extended for a fifth year. \nTogether, the axed benefits are worth about $6.5 billion a year to students and families, according to the American Council on Education. \nThe Senate bill doesn't include any of the above. \nState funding for public higher education may also be in jeopardy, for the same reasons we discussed above \u2014 a consequence of getting rid of the deductions for SALT. Scaling back, or cutting federal discounts to taxpayers may cause a squeeze on funding for state universities and colleges. \nPrivate college penalties \nBoth public and private colleges have expressed concern that fewer people are going to be taking the charitable deduction, because of the increase in the standard deduction. They're worried this will lead, in turn, to less money in donations. The American Council on Education estimates about $100 billion less a year in donations across all nonprofits. \nThere are also some provisions in the House and Senate bills that target private colleges specifically. One provision would levy a tax on investment gains for a small group of private colleges that have very large endowments on a per-student basis. Currently, this money grows tax-free thanks to the colleges' nonprofit status. \nThis affects about 65 private colleges with extremely large endowments. But even more colleges are worried about it, says Terry Hartle of the American Council on Education. \n\"Even though public universities are not affected by the endowment tax, they are very much opposed to it, for fear it would set a precedent that would be applied to them in the future.\" \nCulture war? \nThe tax plans, which passed on party lines in both the House and Senate, are aligned with a broader Republican agenda. On the K-12 side, cuts that impact the source of public school funding are coming hand in hand with special tax benefits for families with means to put aside money for private school tuition. \nOn the higher education side, Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and adviser to the Trump campaign, told Bloomberg that Republicans are going after university endowments because \"universities have become playpens of the left.\" Amplifying that point, a recent Pew Research Center poll showed there is a sharply rising partisan gap on higher education, with 58 percent of Republicans saying colleges have a negative effect on the country, while 72 percent of Democrats say they have a positive impact.

They do seem to agree - Republicans, anyway - on two changes that affect America's schools. NPR's Cory Turner reports. \nCORY TURNER, BYLINE: The first change has to do with something called a 529. That's a plan taxpayers can use to save money for college, where the earnings grow tax-free. Now Republicans want to let taxpayers use 529s to pay for K-12 tuition at private and religious schools. Now, families can already do that with a different plan, but that one has low contribution limits, and it isn't open to high-income Americans. This move would expand both. \nNORA GORDON: I think the only taxpayers who will be in a position to benefit from the 529 change are very rich people. \nTURNER: Nora Gordon is an economist and associate professor at Georgetown University. She says using these accounts to save for K-12 schooling won't help much unless you can afford to set aside a lot of money early on. When the Government Accountability Office studied these plans a few years ago, it found families who use them had about 25 times the median financial assets of those who don't. \nWhile that change would help largely affluent parents who use private schools, change No. 2 could hurt funding for public schools. And this one is all about SALT - state and local taxes. Up to now, taxpayers who itemize their deductions - generally, high earners - have gotten a break from the federal government for paying state and local taxes. Think of it as a discount, courtesy of Washington, that ultimately helps state and local governments pay for important things like schools. Now Republicans want to limit or get rid of those discounts. \nJOHN FRIEDMAN: This bill is going to make it more painful for residents to increase local property taxes to pay for public schools. \nTURNER: John Friedman is an associate professor of economics at Brown University. He says, on average, nearly half of public schools' funding comes from local taxes, usually property taxes. In the past, when locals hiked property taxes to help pay for their schools, the federal government made it hurt less with that SALT deduction. But limit the deduction, and some voters and politicians might even call for tax cuts instead. \nGORDON: This is a really big deal for some states and no deal at all for other states. And the states that it's a really big deal for are blue states. \nTURNER: States like New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, says Georgetown's Nora Gordon. \nGORDON: They are states with higher cost of living, higher property values and states that spend more on their state and local government. \nTURNER: In addition to wanting to limit the deduction on local property taxes, Republicans in the House and Senate may also get rid of the deductions for state-level sales and income taxes, which are just as important to schools. Kim Rueben of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says states have been using these taxes to fund some of their poorest schools. \nKIM RUEBEN: The money from the state ends up helping to prop up school districts that have less ability to raise money from the property tax. \nTURNER: Getting rid of these discounts, Rueben says, will make state-level taxes more painful, and that could make voters less likely to approve new money for schools. And all of this is happening with many of America's public schools still reeling from the Great Recession. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, after adjusting for inflation, 29 states provided less overall state funding per student in 2015 than they did back in 2008. \nCory Turner, NPR News, Washington. \n(SOUNDBITE OF RUSS LIQUID'S \"OPUS ONE\") Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. \u00a9 2017 KUER 90.1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "martin elfman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anya kamenetz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim rueben", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rueben", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ariana figueroa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nora gordon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john friedman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terry hartle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "npr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brown university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american opportunity tax credit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "government accountability office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetown university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center on budget and policy priorities", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american council on education", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetown", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:50.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc78302841d1f4bffe810d1fb505746cd8160d01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRuG9RMfv91dTii_6RX6qPPsOLQa_8dKJgrRJCfQYuAqjUSIJh3hlrOEdt9h88Zz3P6OCkFkakgLmdKt1QDlxV5wNvAKM2tz2bRVuXOWaXxWtd9gXAEJn1Z4kHioCrPNtJ5NrWPr71wqIdQiTd3vGB9FANsC.fuAGo-", "site_full": "europeandtheeveryday.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://europeandtheeveryday.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "EUEve Academics participate in discussion on federalism in Myanmar \u2013 Europe and the Everyday", "title": "EUEve Academics participate in discussion on federalism in Myanmar", "title_full": "EUEve Academics participate in discussion on federalism in Myanmar", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc78302841d1f4bffe810d1fb505746cd8160d01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRuG9RMfv91dTii_6RX6qPPsOLQa_8dKJgrRJCfQYuAqjUSIJh3hlrOEdt9h88Zz3P6OCkFkakgLmdKt1QDlxV5wNvAKM2tz2bRVuXOWaXxWtd9gXAEJn1Z4kHioCrPNtJ5NrWPr71wqIdQiTd3vGB9FANsC.fuAGo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "europeandtheeveryday", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "EUEve Academics participate in discussion on federalism in Myanmar", "text": "Two members of the Europe and Everyday CRN \u2013 Dr Soeren Keil and Paul Anderson, both of Canterbury Christ Church University\u2019s Politics and International Relations department, \u2013 in collaboration with UN Women , the Hanns Seidel Foundation \u2013 Myanmar and the Centre for Development and Ethnic Studies , have recently been involved in discussions about the democratisation, peace-building and federalisation process in Myanmar/Burma.\n\nDr Soeren Keil, Reader in Politics and IR and co-organiser of the EUEve CRN was the Academic Lead for a new Myanmar Federalism Leadership Programme (MFLP), a 10-day programme to prepare activists from civil society, the administration, ethnic armed organisations and political parties for the future discussions on federalism in the country.

Speaking before the council at Beverly Hills City Hall, West Hollywood Councilwoman Lauren Meister said there is \u201cno direct documentation\u201d to justify the surcharge. \nBeverly Hills Mayor Lili Bosse cast one of the dissenting votes, saying it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d that West Hollywood officials did not receive information they had requested regarding the surcharge until the day before the Beverly Hills City Council originally planned to vote on the rate increases last month. After the meeting ran longer than anticipated, the council agreed to postpone the public hearing and vote to Dec. 5. West Hollywood Councilwoman Lauren Meister questioned Beverly Hills council members about a 25 percent surcharge levied to West Hollywood residents who get their water from Beverly Hills. (photo courtesy of the city of Beverly Hills) \n\u201cThe way we are addressing our neighbor is not appropriate,\u201d Bosse said. \nA city of Beverly Hills cost allocation study states that a \u201cshare of certain costs that have historically been funded from the general fund\u201d are issued to West Hollywood\u2019s Beverly Hills customers. Three cost allocation areas the study addresses are public safety, governmental facilities and right-of-way maintenance. \n\u201cEach of these areas represents a service provided for the benefit of the enterprise by the general fund and for which the enterprise should provide reimbursement,\u201d the report reads. \nThe general fund covers reimbursements from the water enterprise only for ratepayers in Beverly Hills, according to the report. Without the 25 percent surcharge, \u201cBeverly Hills residents would be subsidizing outside city customers,\u201d Shana Epstein, Beverly Hills director of Public Works, has said. \nEpstein said in a previous interview that the city \u201c[has not] done a good job explaining all that.\u201d Bosse also said she wanted better outreach to the city\u2019s water customers about the water quality, reliability and infrastructure projects that the increased rates will support. \nUnder the proposed increase, and based on average water usage, a single-family residential customer will pay an additional $5.50 to $6.50 on each bimonthly bill over the next five years, according to the Beverly Hills Public Works Department. The increase would amount to a $29.52 increase on each bimonthly bill at the end of the five-year period. The rates are set to take effect on Jan. 1 each year from 2018 to 2022. Stormwater, solid waste and wastewater rates will not increase, but they might be subject to future increases. \nWest Hollywood residents sent 88 letters of protest to the rate increases prior to the vote, compared to seven from Beverly Hills residents. \nCouncilman John Mirisch, who cast the other dissenting vote, said the council has a tendency to \u201cspend like drunken sailors\u201d and then \u201cact like puritan bankers.\u201d \n\u201cWe waste money, we spend money, we give money away, and sometimes like it\u2019s going out of style,\u201d Mirisch said, mentioning funding the council recently allocated for holiday decorations. \nHe implied a double standard between the proliferation of unfunded pension liabilities \u2013 which the council discussed at its study session on Tuesday afternoon, and has been a statewide issue \u2013 while meticulously raising water rates to match rising costs. \n\u201cWhen it comes to our residents, we are not shy to stick it to them, and we are not shy to stick it to West Hollywood residents,\u201d the councilman said. \nA few residents from West Hollywood addressed the council during public comment. \n\u201cIt is almost like the surcharge is a subsidy on the Beverly Hills lawn,\u201d said Patrick Shandrick, of the West Hollywood West Residents Association. \nWest Hollywood West\u2019s secretary, Kimberly Winick, said she doesn\u2019t think the surcharge is appropriate. \n\u201cThis certainly feels like taxation without representation,\u201d she said. \nCouncilman Robert Wunderlich said there is a \u201csound conceptual basis\u201d to levy the surcharge on Beverly Hills\u2019 West Hollywood customers, but figuring out a dollar amount instead of a percent surcharge could be a more palatable arrangement. \nVice Mayor Julian Gold said that Beverly Hills should have a \u201crobust conversation\u201d with West Hollywood about the surcharge. \n\u201cIt may well be there are creative solutions that would obviate the need for this surcharge,\u201d he said.

Alex Wong / Getty Images \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Stzrok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets.

The Republican-led House passed a bill to make it easier for gun owners to legally carry concealed weapons across state lines. J. Scott Applewhite / AP \nThe House approved a bill on Wednesday that would ease legal restrictions for carrying concealed firearms across state lines \u2013 a move pushed by the National Rifle Association that comes just weeks after mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas. \nOn a mostly party-line vote, the measure easily passed, 231-198, although 14 Republicans voted no. Six Democrats voted for the so-called reciprocity measure, which would allow a gun owner with the proper permit in any state to carry a concealed firearm to another state where it is also legal. \nThe bill now goes to the Senate, where it is likely to encounter a much tougher battle. \nIn the House version, GOP lawmakers added a measure aimed at strengthening tracking in the national background-check database of legal and mental health records that might prevent some gun purchases. Just last month it was revealed that Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., legally purchase firearms used in the attack despite a record of domestic assault in the Air Force that should have disqualified him. \nHowever, as The New York Times reports: \"... the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions.\" \nThe bill angered many Democrats who argued that following mass shootings that have killed 80 people, the times called for stricter, not looser gun measures. \nConnecticut Democrat Rep. Elizabeth Esty \u2014 who represents Newtown, Conn., where 20 first-graders and six teachers and staff were killed in a 2012 mass shooting \u2013 said the bill would undermine states' rights, \"hamstring law enforcement and allow dangerous criminals to walk around with hidden guns anywhere and at any time. It's unspeakable that this is Congress' response to the worst gun tragedies in American history,\" according to The Associated Press. \nThe NRA's executive director, Chris Cox, is quoted in the Times as saying Thursday's vote is a \"watershed\" for Second Amendment rights and that the bill would ensure \"all law-abiding citizens in our great country can protect themselves in the manner they see fit without accidentally running afoul of the law.\" \nIn the Senate, supporters would likely need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster by Democrats.

Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of registered voters and ensured that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott barbour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george brandis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "parliament approves same-sex marriage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images members of parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the sydney morning herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "federation square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images  australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:51.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4803158dc78e0ba0b50d0da026aedbdf224ecb2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKzDbKpciiQPRWiYLkGA1yXF5Soq_ADdcZBekmZjKBolVzfcBHUlgShJ4H.Hc5b15Ox9bUZrP3CJNoLmDBU6XoGbKGH23kKDnI5.xPQFY35yM", "site_full": "community.ebay.com", "site": "ebay.com", "site_section": "https://community.ebay.com/t5/Mobile-App-iOS/bd-p/iosapp/page/1", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Mobile App -

Tauseef Mustafa / AFP/Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 1:27 am \nMonths after a tense standoff between China and India along their Himalayan border, Beijing on Thursday expressed anger at an Indian drone that crashed inside its territory. \n\"This action by India violated China's territorial sovereignty. We express strong dissatisfaction and opposition,\" Xinhua cited Zhang Shuili, a senior military official in China's western battle zone command, as saying. \nChina said the drone crashed in \"recent days\" but didn't say where. Zhang said his country would defend its national sovereignty against such intrusions. \nHe said China's border defense forces conducted \"an inspection of the device,\" but didn't elaborate. \nIndia has not responded to the charge. \nAlthough the two countries have made moves toward warmer relations in recent years, they also have a long history of border tensions. In 1962, they fought a brief, but inconclusive border conflict. They have also had ongoing disputes over sovereignty in other border areas, notably Aksai Chin, a Himalayan region that straddles their territorial demarcation in the west. \nThe two countries have also long been at odds over India's hosting of Tibet's government-in-exile and their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, considered by China to be subversive because of his calls for Tibetan independence. \nStarting in June this year, tensions flared again over a disputed region called the Doklam Plateau that borders China, Bhutan and the Indian state of Sikkim. \nAs NPR's Julie McCarthy reported from New Delhi in July , the problems stemmed from China's construction of a road in Doklam Plateau. \"Not far from the plateau lies the narrow passage that connects India's northeast states with the rest of the country \u2014 a strategic link called the Siliguri Corridor but more commonly known as the \"Chicken's Neck. \" Any possibility of China being able to sever that \"neck\" unnerves India. \nAs late as August, India had rushed troops to Doklam Plateau and although an immediate conflict was avoided, heated rhetoric on both sides has soured relations. \nIn September, India's army chief said that his country \"could not afford to be complacent and must be prepared for war,\" according to The Hindustan Times. \nAnd in November, China took umbrage at Indian President Ram Nath Kovind's visit to the remote state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China also claims, Reuters reports.

The Saudi index was 0.2 percent higher at 7,038 points after 45 minutes, rebounding from near strong technical support around 7,000 points, where the peaks in late October and November roughly coincide with the 200-day average, now at 7,015 points. The most heavily traded stock, real estate firm Dar Al Arkan , climbed 4.1 percent to 12.38 riyals, continuing an uptrend. It has rocketed from around 7.50 riyals in mid-November, when MSCI said it was adding the stock to its Saudi Arabia Index. Amiantit jumped 4.0 percent in unusually heavy trade after saying a 50 percent owned affiliate had won a five-year, 100 million riyal ($26.7 million) contract to manage water utility services in Jeddah. In Dubai, the index rose 0.3 percent on the back of GFH Financial, which gained 3.7 pecent, and builder Drake & Scull, which added 2.0 percent in heavy trade. DSI has risen strongly in the past week as investors hope for major improvement in its fourth-quarter results after a big loss in the third quarter. Emaar Properties DU> rebounded 1.6 percent but its unit Emaar Development continued to slide, falling 2.0 percent to a record low of 5.44 dirhams, compared to last month\u2019s initial public offer price of 6.03 dirhams. Qatar\u2019s index dropped 0.4 percent after sinking 1.5 percent on Wednesday. Real estate firm Ezdan Holding, which had been rebounding strongly in recent days, fell back 4.9 percent. The Qatari market surged early this week on hopes for progress in resolving Qatar\u2019s diplomatic dispute with four other Arab states. But those hopes were dashed when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, in an apparent snub of Qatar, did not send their heads of state to this week\u2019s regional summit in Kuwait.

Stiglitz] The globalization of our discontent", "text": "Fifteen years ago, I published Globalization and Its Discontents, a book that sought to explain why there was so much dissatisfaction with globalization within the developing countries. Quite simply, many believed that the system was \u201crigged\u201d against them, and global trade agreements were singled out for being particularly unfair.\nNow discontent with globalization has fueled a wave of populism in the United States and other advanced economies, led by politicians who claim that the system is unfair to their countries. In the US, President Donald Trump insists that America\u2019s trade negotiators were snookered by those from Mexico and China.\nSo how could something that was supposed to benefit all, in developed and developing countries alike, now be reviled? How can a trade agreement be unfair to all parties?\nTo those in developing countries, Trump\u2019s claims are laughable. The US basically wrote the rules and created the institutions of globalization. In some of these institutions -- for example, the International Monetary Fund -- the US still has veto power, despite America\u2019s diminished role in the global economy.\nTo someone like me, who has watched trade negotiations closely for more than a quarter-century, it is clear that US trade negotiators got most of what they wanted. The problem was with what they wanted. Their agenda was set, behind closed doors, by corporations. It was an agenda written by and for large multinational companies, at the expense of workers and ordinary citizens.\nIndeed, it often seems that workers, who have seen their wages fall and jobs disappear, are just collateral damage. But there is another interpretation of what has happened: one of the objectives of globalization was to weaken workers\u2019 bargaining power. What corporations wanted was cheaper labor.\nThis interpretation helps explain some puzzling aspects of trade agreements. Why is it, for example, that advanced countries gave away one of their biggest advantages, the rule of law? Indeed, provisions embedded in most recent trade agreements give foreign investors more rights than are provided to investors in the US. They are compensated, for example, should the government adopt a regulation that hurts their bottom line, no matter how desirable the regulation or how great the harm caused by the corporation in its absence.\nThere are three responses to globalized discontent with globalization. The first -- call it the Las Vegas strategy -- is to double down on the bet on globalization as it has been managed for the past quarter-century. This bet, like all bets on proven policy failures, is based on the hope that somehow it will succeed in the future.\nThe second response is Trumpism: cut oneself off from globalization, in the hope that doing so will somehow bring back a bygone world. But protectionism won\u2019t work. Globally, manufacturing jobs are on the decline, simply because productivity growth has outpaced growth in demand.\nEven if manufacturing were to come back, the jobs won\u2019t. Advanced manufacturing technology, including robots, means that the few jobs created will require higher skills and will be placed at different locations than the jobs that were lost. Like doubling down, this approach is doomed to fail.\nTrump will fail even in his proclaimed goal of reducing the trade deficit, which is determined by the disparity between domestic savings and investment. Now that the Republicans have gotten their way and enacted a tax cut for billionaires, national savings will fall and the trade deficit will rise, owing to an increase in the value of the dollar. (Fiscal deficits and trade deficits normally move so closely together that they are called \u201ctwin\u201d deficits.) Trump may not like it, but as he is slowly finding out, there are some things that even a person in the most powerful position in the world cannot control.\nThere is a third approach: social protection without protectionism, the kind of approach that the small Nordic countries took. They knew that as small countries they had to remain open. But they also knew that remaining open would expose workers to risk. Thus, they had to have a social contract that helped workers move from old jobs to new and provide some help in the interim.\nThe Nordic countries are deeply democratic societies, so they knew that unless most workers regarded globalization as benefiting them, it wouldn\u2019t be sustained. And the wealthy in these countries recognized that if globalization worked as it should, there would be enough benefits to go around.\nAmerican capitalism in recent years has been marked by unbridled greed -- the 2008 financial crisis provides ample confirmation of that. But a market economy can take forms that temper the excesses of both capitalism and globalization, and deliver more sustainable growth and higher standards of living for most citizens.\nWe can learn from such successes what to do, just as we can learn from past mistakes what not to do. As has become evident, if we do not manage globalization so that it benefits all, the backlash is at risk of intensifying.\nBy Joseph E. Stiglitz\nJoseph E.

authorities suspended the pharmaceutical giant\u2019s anti-dengue vaccine in response to the company warning the drug could lead to severe infections in some cases, the health secretary said on Thursday. Regulators froze the Philippines\u2019 world-first public dengue immunisation programme last week and suspended all sales of the vaccine on Monday after Sanofi said Dengvaxia could worsen symptoms for vaccinated people who contracted the disease for the first time. \u201cEventually it\u2019s the court of law that is going to decide in so far as the liability of Sanofi is concerned,\u201d Health Secretary Francisco Duque said on ABS-CBN television. The previous administration of president Benigno Aquino launched the vaccination programme last year, making the Philippines the first nation to use Dengvaxia on a mass scale. About 830,000 schoolchildren had received at least one dose of the vaccine, Duque said on Thursday. Previously the government said more than 733,000 people had been vaccinated. Sanofi\u2019s announcement last week caused great concern in the Philippines \u2014 where the mosquito-born disease is extremely prevalent. The French company on Monday sought to allay concerns, saying Dengvaxia would not cause anyone who was immunised to die and would not cause a dengue infection. However, Duque said on Thursday Sanofi\u2019s recent statements on Dengvaxia were \u201cconfusing.\u201d Duque said he may ask Sanofi to refund 1.4 billion pesos ($27.6 million) worth of unused Dengvaxia supplies. He added the government might also demand Sanofi set up an \u201cindemnity fund\u201d to cover the hospitalisation cost for children vaccinated under the public programme who would fall ill.
