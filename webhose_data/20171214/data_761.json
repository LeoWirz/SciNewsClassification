Cardinal Raymond Burke has condemned the Alpha Program now used in thousands of Catholic parishes in 70 countries as a tool for evangelization and catechesis. \nAs the international director of the Marian Catechist Apostolate , Cdl. Burke was asked in December of 2015 to review the Alpha program for its possible use by Catholics. After doing so, the cardinal issued this sobering warning: \"Having studied the program, both from the perspective of doctrine and methodology, I must make it clear that the program may not be used, in any form, in the Marian Catechist Apostolate and that Marian Catechists are not to become involved with it.\" WATCH FULL EPISODE \nCardinal Burke, former head of the Apostolic Signatura, added that gimmicks and new-fangled programs aren't what's needed in drawing souls to Christ. \"While, like so many similar programs,\" said the cardinal, \"Alpha may seem to offer a more attractive and effective form of evangelization and catechesis, it does not have the doctrinal and methodological foundations required for the teaching of the Catholic Faith.\" He also recalled that Pope St. John Paul II had warned against trying to make converts or reverts by using new programs that don't rely on the inspiring power of Christ's teachings. \nThe cardinal was referring to the 2001 Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte in which John Paul II wrote , \"We are certainly not seduced by the naive expectation that, faced with the great challenges of our time, we shall find some magic formula. No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person and the assurance which he gives us: I am with you! \" The sainted pope added: It is not, therefore, a matter of inventing a \"new programme\". The programme already exists: it is the plan found in the Gospel and in the living Tradition, it is the same as ever. Ultimately, it has its centre in Christ himself, who is to be known, loved and imitated, so that in Him we may live the life of the Trinity and with him transform history until its fulfilment in the heavenly Jerusalem. This is a programme which does not change with shifts of times and cultures ...

But we stopped them this year.\" \nBut in 2018, \"The fight begins again,\" he said, adding \"They have billions of dollars to fight us.\" \nOn Wednesday, Church Militant spoke with Ruse about the challenges looming in the year ahead. Austin Ruse \n\"The spring brings up what I call 'Commission Season',\" he said, \"where the various commissions meet to negotiate documents later approved by the General Assembly,\" including the Commission on the Status of Women, the Commission on Population and Development, the Commission on Social Development and others. \n\"U.N. radicals are busy throughout the year,\" Ruse explained. \"It is nonstop. And each meeting is a threat to life, faith and family.\" \nRuse noted that \"the very radical bureaucracy ... the various agencies ... the various treaty monitoring bodies ... and powerful NGOs ... all work together, and they are all a threat.\" \nWell-funded non-governmental organizations (NGOs) like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and George Soros' Open Society Foundations \"spend boatloads of money at the U.N. to bend the bureaucracy to their will, which is easy and to force governments to accept radical social policy.\" \n\"Their biggest threat, however, is on the ground around the world where they spend most of their money targeting poor countries,\" added Ruse. \nComparing developments at the U.N. under the Trump Administration with what he saw under Obama, Ruse observed, \"Obama was fully on board with the most radical ideas at the U.N. including abortion as a global human right and the imposition of the homosexual agenda. Trump is exponentially better on the life issues but not much better on questions of LGBT, sadly.\" C-Fam has played a central role for twenty years in blocking a global right to abortion, stopping a redefinition of the family, even creating a decent definition of gender in international law. \nMonitoring and impacting the social policy debate at the United Nations and other international institutions since 1997, Ruse and his team have dedicated themselves to reestablishing a proper understanding of international law, protecting national sovereignty and the dignity of the human person. \nTo achieve this aim, they work to discredit socially radical policies by publishing and promoting scholarship, showing such policies harm a true understanding of international law and in the process undermine the family and other institutions man requires for a just, free and happy life. \nRegularly interfacing with diplomats, policymakers, academics, activists and office holders from around the world, C-Fam personnel have participated in every major U.N. social policy debate over the past 20 years, including the Rome Statutes of the International Criminal Court, the Convention on Disabilities, Cairo+5, Beijing+5 and dozens of others. \nFor its unyielding defense of Christian principles at the U.N. level, C-Fam has been branded an \" anti-LGBT hate group \" by the leftist Southern Poverty Law Center. Human Rights Campaign headquarters \nC-Fam operates on a shoestring annual budget of $1.5 million. Ironically, just steps from its Washington office looms the headquarters of gay advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), where activists lavish $50 million per year on radical initiatives to overthrow Christian morality. \nBankrolled by billionaires, HRC works \"to utterly upend Western Civilization in the name of sexual freedom,\" Ruse warns. \n\"They force school districts to teach homosexuality and transgenderism to children as young as five,\" he adds. \nIn his recent letter, Ruse noted that \"The homosexual establishment has burrowed deep into the U.N. bureaucracy.\" \nSadly, C-Fam stands virtually alone in its fight against radical anti-Christian agendas inside the United Nations. \nAccording to Ruse, \"There are very few pro-family groups who will stand against this. So many of them are weary of the fight and just want to be liked. We are willing to be hated because He was hated first and they hate us because of Him.\" \nIn a 2006 address to students at Christendom College, Ruse described C-Fam's battle \u2014 every Christian's battle: \nMy friends, we are in a war. Not a hot war with soldiers or a cold war with spies. At least for now, this war is fought exclusively in quiet and carpeted rooms at international fora in Rome, Istanbul, Cairo, Beijing, Rio and New York. ... There exists a small, rag-tag band of resisters who attend all U.N. meetings. You do not know their names. Their names will be lost to history. But they are there every day, protecting you and your family, your Church and your country. \nWednesday, Ruse told Church Militant, \"C-Fam has played a central role for 20 years in blocking a global right to abortion, stopping a redefinition of the family, even creating a decent definition of gender in international law.\" \n\"We have been here every day,\" he added, \"and have really become the institutional memory of the U.N. pro-life movement.\" \n\"The fight goes on every single day.\" \nTo contribute to this fight, click here . --- Campaign 32075 ---", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephen wynne", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ruse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george soros", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin ruse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "catholic institute battles foes of life", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bill & melinda gates foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for family and human rights", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christendom college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rome statutes of the international criminal court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "church militant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hrc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission on social development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "human rights campaign", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.n.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern poverty law center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cairo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:28.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3b75d678d6f7179d68bc0dbf97a9ec85a02b3959", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8T0J6x4GWll9HrT98pEJ4Or34YYxo29k8d1bURgoOr4Y23Akog3fwy68qtiH3qPsfwSC3JurSpNKRG7jFcRfntzh70QbYQ_zVQrK82kt5WDgRgRpfNhz4Y8V4i40pBbrILuUa.h.Y6kpSCLsgZOq9L75vpx8FSU6vVnnEN_0_xFA--", "site_full": "www.barristerng.com", "site": "barristerng.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "NBA ELECTION 2018: Paul Usoro goes back to school for \"finance program critical for running NBA\" - BarristerNG.com", "title_full": "NBA ELECTION 2018: Paul Usoro goes back to school for \"finance program critical for running NBA\" - BarristerNG.com", "published": "2017-12-07T10:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "BG", "spam_score": 0.553, "main_image": "http://www.barristerNG.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/paul-usoro-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3b75d678d6f7179d68bc0dbf97a9ec85a02b3959", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8T0J6x4GWll9HrT98pEJ4Or34YYxo29k8d1bURgoOr4Y23Akog3fwy68qtiH3qPsfwSC3JurSpNKRG7jFcRfntzh70QbYQ_zVQrK82kt5WDgRgRpfNhz4Y8V4i40pBbrILuUa.h.Y6kpSCLsgZOq9L75vpx8FSU6vVnnEN_0_xFA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bridget Edokwe", "published": "2017-12-07T10:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "NBA ELECTION 2018: Paul Usoro goes back to school for \"finance program critical for running NBA\" - BarristerNG.com", "text": "SHARES Paul Usoro SAN \nThe Nigerian Bar Association NBA Presidential hopeful Mr Paul Usoro SAN has gone back to school to learn finances critical to managing NBA. \nIn a Facebook post the senior advocate of Nigerian posted that he is currently at Columbia University, New York, running an executive finance program. \nBelow is the post shared by Paul Usoro SAN. \n\u201d Currently I am attending an executive finance program at Columbia Business School, Columbia University, New York.

( ChurchMilitant.com ) - A Michigan Catholic high school is standing up for the nation's flag. \nOn Tuesday, Lansing Catholic High School president Tom Maloney, along with two other school staff members, sent a letter by email to parents, notifying them that athletes who kneel at a game during the national anthem will not participate in the game. \nThe school addressed the source of the media frenzy over the anthem concerning racial injustice while also defending the mission of Lansing Catholic to shape students spiritually, intellectually and socially into disciples of Jesus Christ, according to the letter. WATCH MORE LIKE THIS \nThe school's decision to institute the policy happened after four high school footall players were benched after kneeling during the anthem at a game in October. The school issued a statement after the game that any player who knelt during the anthem wiykd be disciplined by Lansing Catholic. In a letter, Maloney clarified the school's initial position: \nAfter much prayer and reflection; in consultation with our Board of Trustees, with the Superintendent of the Diocese, with administrators at other Catholic schools, and with law enforcement, we will continue to hold our student-athletes to the expectation that they stand for our National Anthem. ... Any student-athlete who chooses not to stand will receive consequences. As always, this will be handled with Christian Charity, with the goal of growth in virtue. \nLansing Catholic admitted the right of groups to peacefully protest but justified the school's stance that protesting at school sporting events is not an appropropriate venue. The letter stressed that student safety is a priority. \nIn another letter from October, Maloney stated that the coaches will make any further decisions regarding the playing time for athletes: \"All other decisions about playing times are at the discretion of our coaches. As always, our coaches base those decisions on performance in practices and past games and game time situations.\" \nThe four players wrote a letter in response to the school's position and requested a number of short-term and long-term suggestions, including a formal apology from the school for \"the disrespect shown to us and the unprofessional handling\" of the disciplinary measure issued to the players, clarificaiton of future disciplinary consequences for the four players who knelt during the anthem, and a zero-tolerance policy for racism that allows for students to report discriminatory issues, diversity training for faculty, staff and students. \nLansing Catholic responded to the letter in an email, which Moore sent October 28, that requested the students to form a \"multicultural diversity student group.\" Moore stated that the goal of the group is to \"create a safe space for students to talk about issues of race and ethnicity and build bridges of unity and respect.\" He continued in his email, \"Racism is real, it affects all of us in different ways. And how do we respond to it \u2014 ignore it, fight it, change it?\" \nThe school's current policy, issued Tuesday, for winter athletes promises to continue the discussion. Another Lansing Catholic school, Immaculate Heart of Mary-St. Casimir School, enacted a similar policy regarding students refusing to stand during the Pledge of Allegiance. The Catholic elementary and middle school will send a child home for the day for not standing for the pledge. If it happens again, the child will be sent home for the week.

GRAVES AP Sports Writer December 07, 2017 01:35 AM UPDATED 6 HOURS 43 MINUTES AGO LOUISVILLE, Ky. \nDesi Rodriguez scored most every time he had the ball against No. 17 Louisville, so it wasn't shocking for the Seton Hall senior guard to convert a final opportunity with the game on the line. \nOther than the degree of difficulty in firing a winning shot over Cardinals 7-footer Anas Mahmoud, that is. \n\"I just wanted to be aggressive,\" Rodriguez said after his off-balance banker with 8 seconds remaining gave Seton Hall a hard-fought 79-77 victory \"I knew I had to make a strong move, and I was just happy and excited that I finished strong.\" \nRodriguez had a season-high 29 points on 12-of-18 shooting with two 3-pointers. His basket was the last of seven consecutive for the Pirates (7-1), who overcame a 59-52 deficit with 11:33 left to cap a thrilling finish featuring three ties and four lead changes in the final 5:21.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nThat set the stage for the final possession where Rodriguez delivered in the reunion of former Big East Conference rivals. \nAfter Deng Adel's leaner tied it at 77 with 29 seconds left, the Pirates ran the clock down before Rodriguez got the ball and dribbled left. He fired a hard shot off the glass for the lead, though the Cardinals (4-2) had one final chance. \nQuentin Snider's 3-point attempt for the winner missed with 4 seconds left, Rodriguez grabbed his eighth rebound and the Pirates happily celebrated their second straight win over a ranked opponent. \n\"Last week against Rhode Island (a 75-74 loss), I didn't put it in his (Rodriguez's) hands,\" said Seton Hall coach Kevin Willard, a former Louisville assistant under Rick Pitino from 2001-07. \"I made sure the rest of the year it would get in his hands at the end of the game.\" \nSeton Hall's victory adds to an impressive start featuring victories over Power Five conference schools such as Indiana (Big Ten), Vanderbilt (Southeastern) and No. 22 Texas Tech (Big 12) on Thursday. \nKhadeen Carrington had 18 points, Myles Powell had 13 including a key 3-pointer with 1:40 left and Angel Delgado had 10 points and 13 rebounds for the Pirates. \nAdel had 20 points and Snider 15 for Louisville, which committed 16 turnovers and lost its second straight. \n\"We've just got to take better care of the basketball,\" Cardinals interim coach David Padgett said. \"Sixteen turnovers is too many for us. ... We've got to turn this around.\" \nBIG PICTURE \nSeton Hall: The Pirates won by showing poise down the stretch. Timely plays on both ends helped and Rodriguez didn't have to do it himself as teammates contributed. The Pirates finished nearly even with Louisville on the boards (36-35), shot 46 percent and most importantly, outscored the taller Cardinals 40-26 inside. \n\"That's our DNA,\" Willard added. \"We're going to scrap, we're going to fight. ... They're not physically imposing, but they're long. We weren't going to change the fact that we're going to attack the rim.\" \nLouisville: The Cardinals overcame a slow start and seemed to be in gear behind a 20-7 run for a 59-52 lead before faltering. Lazy passes led to turnovers and easy Seton Hall baskets, and they had no answer defensively for Rodriguez.

Tony Gutierrez AP Photo Mayfield, Jackson, Love are Heisman Trophy finalists By RALPH D. RUSSO AP College Football Writer December 07, 2017 01:35 AM UPDATED 11 HOURS 25 MINUTES AGO \nOklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield made Heisman Trophy history just by being selected as a finalist. \nMayfield, reigning Heisman winner Lamar Jackson of Louisville and Stanford running back Bryce Love were chosen as finalists for the 83rd Heisman Trophy on Monday night. \nThe award for most outstanding college football player will be given out Saturday night in New York. \nMayfield and Jackson are finalists for the second straight year, and Jackson is trying to become the second player to win two Heismans, joining former Ohio State star Archie Griffin.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nMayfield, though, will come to Manhattan as the clear favorite. He finished fourth in the Heisman voting in 2015, but was not invited to New York. Last year, he was one of five finalists and finished third behind Jackson and Clemson's Deshaun Watson. \nMayfield is the seventh player to finish in the top five of Heisman voting three times , joining Glenn Davis and Doc Blanchard of Army, Doak Walker of SMU, Griffin, Herschel Walker of Georgia and Tim Tebow of Florida. \nThe Heisman has been naming finalists and bringing them to New York for the presentation since 1982. Mayfield is the ninth Oklahoma player to be selected as a finalist, matching Miami for the most from one school. \nMayfield is trying to become the sixth Heisman winner from Oklahoma and third Sooners quarterback (Jason White and Sam Bradford) to win since 2003. \nThis season, Mayfield has led the No. 2 Sooners (12-1) to the Big 12 championship and the College Football Playoff. Oklahoma plays Georgia (12-1) in the Rose Bowl semifinal on Jan. 1. Mayfield leads the nation in efficiency rating at 203.76 and has thrown for 4,340 yards and 41 touchdowns. \nJackson's numbers have been better than last season in some categories, but Louisville (8-4) has not had the big wins to go with it. With little fanfare, the quarterback is averaging 411 total yards \u2014 up from 393 last season\u2014 and accounted for 42 touchdowns. \n\"I'm honored to be chosen as a finalist with these two outstanding players,\" Jackson said in a statement. \"They both had great seasons and deserve this tremendous honor. I want to thank all my teammates and coaches for achieving this honor together.\" \nGriffin won back-to-back Heisman trophies for Ohio State in 1974 and '75. \nLove is second in the nation in rushing at 164.42 yards per game and is averaging 8.32 yards per carry for the 15th-ranked Cardinal. An ankle injury slowed Love the last month of the season, but he still led the nation in rushes of at least 50 yards with 12. He also scored 17 touchdowns. \nNot making that cut was a couple of talented running backs. \nPenn State's Saquon Barkley is second in the nation in all-purpose yards (179.5) and is fifth with 21 touchdowns, including two kickoff return touchdowns for the No. 9 Nittany Lions. He was also 2 for 2 passing with a touchdown. He was considered the favorite heading into the final month of the season, but the Nittany Lions lost twice, and his production fell off until a late surge. \nSan Diego State's Rashaad Penny leads the nation in rushing (168.9) and all-purpose yards (224.8). Against Nevada three weeks ago, he scored on a rush, a kickoff return and a punt return. Penny had big games against Pac-12 teams Stanford and Arizona State early in the season but was held in check by San Diego State's top Mountain West rivals, Fresno State and Boise State. \n___", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mayfield", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jackson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "baker mayfield", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "heisman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herschel walker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saquon barkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony gutierrez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryce love", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doak walker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph d. russo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim tebow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam bradford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deshaun watson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "archie griffin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason white", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "griffin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glenn davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lamar jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ross blacklock", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tcu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "heisman trophy finalists mobile & apps oklahoma", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boise state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penn state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heisman trophy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nittany lions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap photo oklahoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clemson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ncaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sooners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fresno state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap college football", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doc blanchard of army", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arlington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heismans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rashaad penny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:30.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0c047e8e1093f3532a022cd086b6ae06301f0e2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR0ZrJXIh..SnsxLLLDLesrFmYmGnbIR99z6sb4KCObs1cLDKDzlB6QGcq1iBs2NZd7o5NdkpR2cqE0WXQ6g3kg", "site_full": "nashville.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://nashville.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist nashville | for sale search", "title": "Bissell Vacuum (Murfreesboro) $20", "title_full": "Bissell Vacuum (Murfreesboro) $20", "published": "2017-12-07T10:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00909_c4YbRyR0I49_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0c047e8e1093f3532a022cd086b6ae06301f0e2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR0ZrJXIh..SnsxLLLDLesrFmYmGnbIR99z6sb4KCObs1cLDKDzlB6QGcq1iBs2NZd7o5NdkpR2cqE0WXQ6g3kg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "Bissell Vacuum (Murfreesboro) $20", "text": "make / manufacturer: Bissell QR Code Link to This Post About 1-2 years old works perfectly!

Concrete, and steel in some cases, is generally used in precast construction. These structures are manufactured beforehand in a plant, which is located away from the actual construction site. These precast construction components are then transported and later assembled mechanically with the help of anchor bolts at the actual construction site. High early strength cement is cured with the help of steam curing and casts can be formed within a duration of 24 hours. \nBuildings can be constructed faster and at a much cheaper rates through precast construction. Components used for precast construction are generally standardized. This helps in providing better quality to structures as compared to site-cast concrete, as they are manufactured in a controlled condition. Precast construction components are more durable and hence can also be reused later. Controlled conditions while manufacturing precast allows better control of surface finishes. Compared to site-cast, precast construction components can be erected faster and are affected less by adverse weather conditions, making it comparatively safer. \nPrecast components in construction are used for residential as well as nonresidential complexes. Among nonresidential complexes, these components are useful in the construction of stadiums, parking lots of shopping complexes, bridges, etc. \nPrecast Construction: Market Trends \nPrecast construction components are used for structures such as walls, staircases, girders, lintels, floors & roofs, beams & columns, and paving slabs. The use of precast components in beams and columns is increasing due to the change in the preferences of builders and contractors. \nThe use of precast construction components in the non-residential sector is expected to rise in the near future. The precast construction market is expected to expand at a rapid pace due to the increasing demand for new construction across the globe. During the recent times, there has been an increase in the investments in public and the private infrastructure sectors in major economies. This is expected to drive the market for precast construction in the next few years. \nThe ease associated with the use of precast components, its advantages over onsite components and rapid rate of urbanization and industrialization at the global level are the major factors augmenting the precast construction market. \nRequest For Customization@ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=CR&rep_id=20921 \nPrecast Construction Market: Region-wise Outlook \nThe market for precast construction is well established in the region of Asia Pacific due to high rate of urbanization and industrialization. The lifestyle of the population in the region has been improving. This has resulted in higher investments in housing plans. In turn, this is boosting the market for precast construction. \nNorth America and Europe follow Asia Pacific in the precast construction market. The precast construction market in Asia Pacific has been expanding significantly due to the increase in construction activities in mature and developed countries such as China, Russia, Japan, India, and South Africa. \nThe precast construction market is in the developmental stage in Middle East & Africa.

The other interesting factoid was that the original Resident Evil was planned to be released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. \nApparently, it wasn\u2019t until the hugely successful release of the PlayStation One (which was probably code-named \u2018magical game box\u2019), that the management at Capcom decided to transfer the development of the game away from to the new console, allowing for the Resident Evil we all know today. Oda cited the more powerful specs of the PlayStation One as the being the catalyst for the change. This is noteworthy as Resident Evil wasn\u2019t the only significant franchise to transfer development from the SNES to the PlayStation, as Square Enix also began the development of \u2018Japanese Role Playing Game VII\u2019 for SNES as well.

That's almost as much as UCLA's $13.6 million tab for athletic scholarships in the 2015-16 fiscal year, according to the U.S. Department of Education's Equity in Athletics report. \nThe news release announcing Mora's firing didn't note the lucrative going-away gift.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"It's insane by any standard,\" said Ramogi Huma, a former UCLA football player who is president of the reform-minded College Athletes Players Association. \"Just when you think you've got your head wrapped about the numbers, something like this happens. It reminds you that by no means is this amateur athletics.\" \nBut Mora's eight-figure payout isn't unusual. In recent weeks, Arizona State paid Todd Graham $12.1 million to leave, Arkansas gave Bret Bielema $11.8 million and former Texas A&M coach Kevin Sumlin got $10.4 million. \nThe reported buyouts for some coaches who remain employed are even bigger. They include Utah's Kyle Whittingham ($12.3 million), Iowa's Kirk Ferentz ($22.5 million), Alabama's Nick Saban ($26.9 million) and, what is believed the be the largest figure in college football, Clemson's Dabo Swinney ($40 million). \n\"Over time there has been compensation creep, which nowadays is almost compensation leaps,\" said Raymond D. Cotton, a Washington-based lawyer and executive compensation expert who has represented more than 350 higher-education and nonprofit institutions. \"These levels of income, in my opinion, are way beyond what's reasonable.\" \nMora's buyout \u2013 which Chancellor Gene Block had a say in exercising \u2013 provides a window into an often-overlooked part of college football's financial arms race. The buyout works out to about $260,000 for each of the 46 games Mora won in six seasons at UCLA. \n\"It's really interesting,\" UCLA athletic director Dan Guerrero said last month when asked about the buyout's size. \"When you talk about where UCLA athletics was in 2002 when I first got here and where we are now, certainly that wouldn't have been an option back in the day. But we've really built our support base, our financial resource base over the years.\" \nGuerrero expects to bring in additional revenue from a spike in season-ticket sales after hiring Chip Kelly to replace Mora. \nOr, as Michigan sports economist and professor of sports management Rodney Fort put it, \"This signals an incredibly healthy state for college football.\" \nMora's contract contains offset language, meaning the buyout would be reduced if he accepts another coaching job. UCLA has the option to reduce the amount due to Mora if it determines he declined a \"reasonable offer of employment\" or showed a \"lack of diligence in seeking employment.\" The buyout will be paid over the life of the contract, which ran through 2021, rather than in a lump sum. \nA UCLA spokeswoman said of the amount: \"There are some variables.\" \nHad Mora left UCLA on his own for another job this year, he would have owed the school $1.7 million. \n\"The contracts are doing exactly what the coaches intended them to do,\" Fort said. \nThe school will finance the buyout using funds generated by the athletic department from ticket sales, sponsorships, donations and broadcast rights fees. That revenue includes the record 15-year, $280 million apparel deal with Under Armour. The contract called for the company to pay the school a $15-million signing bonus over the summer in addition to a $9 million annual rights fee. \nThat deal fits the pattern of big money flowing through the Football Bowl Subdivision. The median total revenue for each school in the sport's top level of college competition was $63.7 million in 2015-16. UCLA's athletic department pulled in $98.9 million during the same time against similar expenses. \nThe school expects expenses to surpass $100 million in the current fiscal year. \n\"Personally, and I emphasize personally,\" said David Teplow, a UCLA neurology professor and president of the school's chapter of the American Association of University Professors, \"it is my feeling that there is something quite bizarre about athletic coaches being paid millions of dollars in salary each year while those whose jobs are to educate young men and women, and in my case, to make breakthroughs in medicine and science, must struggle to run our laboratories and to pay our salaries.\" \nThe chair of UCLA's faculty-run Academic Senate and the chair of the Senate's Intercollegiate Athletics Committee both declined comment on the buyout. \nHuma would like to see the buyout money instead directed to help injured athletes after their college careers end or to improve academic options for current athletes. \nB. David Ridpath, a former college athletic department administrator and professor of sports administration at Ohio University, doesn't see the need for the sizable expenditures to attract coaches at public schools. \n\"When higher education is struggling for money and most college athletic programs are hemorrhaging money, it is insane to keep this up,\" Ridpath said. \"Any of the perceived benefits of college sports would happen regardless of this. ... We can spend millions less for the same outcomes, yet we spend more thinking something magical will happen when 99 percent of the time it doesn't work out or change a thing.\" \nBut one big-money buyout didn't stop UCLA from agreeing to a similar clause in Kelly's five-year, $23.3 million contract. \nIf the much-hyped match doesn't work out, the school owes the coach $9 million.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nathan fenno los angeles ti", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ramogi huma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bret bielema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin sumlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gene block", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirk ferentz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fort", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chip kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim mora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raymond d. cotton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan guerrero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ridpath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "todd graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dabo swinney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "armour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "b. david ridpath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodney fort", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david teplow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyle whittingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick saban", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "texas a&m", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intercollegiate athletics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "college athletes players association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american association of university professors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of education's equity in athletics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clemson", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guerrero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arkansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:31.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f329f11f34d50f5ea2c65e4c3363061ac9923d30", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR0ZrJXIh..SnsxLLLDLesrFmYmGnbIR9_EVuTftKOgJBcidSPIt0Us7J5__jz43z8QNn3hphargV5s6eH4K8paRpnQGDRHDFs-", "site_full": "nashville.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://nashville.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist nashville | for sale search", "title": "Vintage suitcases (Murfreesboro) $20", "title_full": "Vintage suitcases (Murfreesboro) $20", "published": "2017-12-07T10:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_fFLQh3cbMkT_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f329f11f34d50f5ea2c65e4c3363061ac9923d30", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR0ZrJXIh..SnsxLLLDLesrFmYmGnbIR9_EVuTftKOgJBcidSPIt0Us7J5__jz43z8QNn3hphargV5s6eH4K8paRpnQGDRHDFs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "Vintage suitcases (Murfreesboro) $20", "text": "Also have a tan suitcase- $20 Or all four $75 Lmk if you'd like to see some more pics.

It\u2019s VERY difficult to actually scare me, so when something accomplishes it, I love it forever. Resident Evil has always been my favorite, ever since I was a little kid, but I\u2019m perfectly happy to spend time with Silent Hill, Fatal Frame and many other games. Tweet \nOnly 6 more days, true survivors! \nSo, as per custom, all of Resident Evil 7 \u2018s DLC achievements have leaked early, thanks to Steam. Surprisingly, (although perhaps out of foreknowledge that this would probably happen) the achievements are almost completely spoiler free. In fact, there aren\u2019t any story spoilers here at all, closest to anything I can think is that it reveals a difficulty settings we hadn\u2019t known about. So, if you\u2019re fine with all of that, let\u2019s cut to the chase! \nNot A Hero \nBeing a free ad-on, there\u2019s only two achievements. This isn\u2019t a huge surprise, although it is pretty shocking that both of them are simply for beating the story. \nMission Accomplished \nComplete Not a Hero on Easy or Normal difficulty. \nYou\u2019re the Hero Now \nComplete Not a Hero on Professional difficulty. \nCute that they\u2019re bringing back \u201cProfessional\u201d difficulty for this DLC, as it was only ever a setting for the \u201caction era\u201d games ( RE4-6 , the Revelations games, etc). Not A Hero isn\u2019t going full blown RE6 action of course, but it will be a lot more action-focused than that of the main campaign. Like I said, it isn\u2019t really a surprise that Not A Hero has so few achievements, but I am a little surprised that there aren\u2019t any that are story related. Perhaps it\u2019s to keep it\u2019s surprises a secret, especially seeing as so much information has already leaked about it. \nEnd of Zoe \nThis list gives us a little more, but not by much. Again, no story related achievements aside from simply beating the game, although we do get to find out about this ad-on\u2019s hard difficulty because of them. \nPromise Kept \nComplete End of Zoe on Easy or Normal. \nKing of the Swamp \nComplete End of Zoe on Joe Must Die. \nSo, yeah. Easy and Normal are a given, but Joe Must Die ? Woah. Previously, in the Banned Footage Vol. 1 DLC, we got a special mode called Ethan Must Die . It is extremely difficult, pitting a minimum level Ethan up against waves of Molded as you explore the Baker estate for the key to access the greenhouse and fight Marguerite in her boss form. All in one shot, no saves. And randomly generated item and weapon pick ups. It\u2019s a god damn nightmare, and while I did manage to complete it, its pretty much the furthest thing from \u2018fun\u2019 I can imagine. So\u2026 what does this mean for End of Zoe ? \nThere\u2019s two possibilities, it\u2019s a separate mode that works like Ethan Must Die , but with End of Zoe \u2018s map, combat, and unique monsters, or that it\u2019s the maximum difficulty that works similarly to Ethan Must Die. That could mean possibly a no-saves difficulty? Ugh. Guess we\u2019ll find out on the 12th. The other achievements are a little more bread n butter. \nThe Only Guns You Need \nComplete End of Zoe on Normal or Joe Must Die using no weapons. \nFastest Man in the Swamp \nComplete an Extreme Challenge in End of Zoe. \nQueensberry Rules \nPerform a 4-hit combo with your bare fists in End of Zoe. \nSwamp Warfare \nStealth kill 5 enemies in End of Zoe. \nI can\u2019t help but read some of these in a Shrek voice. So it looks like barefisting it (uh, like, punching, you degenerate) is possibly a pretty viable option. Probably thanks to Not A Hero already implementing a \u201cpunching\u201d system, although I imagine it\u2019ll work a lot differently here (Chris has to stun the enemy first, then deliver a follow up \u2013 Joe simply has his fists be bound to the shoulder buttons on your controller). So getting through End of Zoe using just your fists is totally doable, considering there\u2019s an achievement for it. \nI\u2019m curious about what an \u201cExtreme Challenge\u201d is. Are there just a few challenges you can complete during normal play (similar to the medals you can earn in Revelations 2 ), or will there be a challenge mode?

Indeed we salute the wisdom in not releasing the students to go home under the circumstances and even administering an antibiotic as an initial response as such students are observed in confinement. \nReleasing the students to go home under the pressure of parents could have led to the spread of whatever is the causative agent in Kumasi and transforming it into a national challenge. \nFor now confining it to the four walls of the school and stopping day students from coming for classes until the challenge is identified and eliminated warrant commendation. \nThe relevant authorities should move the notch above two levels because we are still groping in the dark yet and coming into direct contact with infected persons. The picture of a teacher carrying an infected student on his shoulder speaks volumes about the risks being taken. \nWe pray that direct contact with infected persons is not a means of transmission otherwise we should be ready for an escalation of the health challenge. \nIt is heartwarming that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has moved in to assist in ascertaining what is happening. \nConsidering the state of the health challenge, we must go beyond the Noguchi Memorial Institute For Scientific Research (NMISR) where so far nothing has emerged in the direction of the cause of death. \nIn the face of a close to a dozen deaths occasioned by an unknown disease, there is no reason we should not be worried. \nIn as much as our health authorities have done their best to establish the cause of death to no avail, it is our position that they should have applied a Plan B option which for us is taking one of the victims to South Africa or elsewhere for a more detailed examination of the situation or even samples of the necessary body fluids of the victims. \nOur reaction when the second, third and even fourth person died leaves much to be desired given the Sierra Leonean experience. The spirituality of our being is very important and we would be the last persons to marginalize the importance of prayers. We however state that under the current circumstances, a scientific approach is all we need to unearth what is happening and to apply the necessary responses. All-night prayers can only support these time-tested approaches to such health emergencies. \nWe might be having a very dangerous situation in our hand. Should the cause of the infection and deaths be virus-related, are we not being reckless in the way we are handling the infected persons and even the dead from the unknown disease? \nWe have heard about the symptoms of the yet-to-be-established disease and are unable to suppress the fear of a lurking killer virus on the loose. \nUntil we are certain about what is killing the students, caution should be the watchword in the manner we are handling suspected cases of the disease. \nIn 1908, Accra was struck by a bubonic plague which killed so many people. Those who touched corpses of victims of the plague and even partook in their burials died soon after. The response from the colonial authorities was swift as they quickly established the cause of the epidemic. Residents in some parts of Accra, archival records indicate, were barred from going beyond their areas as a response. Eventually the disease which started with an unusual death of mice around the Christiansborg Castle was brought under control.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "kumasi academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noguchi memorial institute for scientific research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organisation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christiansborg castle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "accra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kumasi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:32.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "910689d082139efd306fe7578b964ce0bd87f42a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8B8Z4TVo8OnOXQAGloEo7NasA5zO_mWLQJVFxK8GZjX8oO9WLmbNHrumfjobYXBjzNweodnISq0yd821YUx_R0NHI9f0ToaqU-", "site_full": "www.kcci.com", "site": "kcci.com", "site_section": "http://www.kcci.com/9358060?format=rss_2.0&view=feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Stories", "title": "Australia legalizes same-sex marriage", "title_full": "Australia legalizes same-sex marriage", "published": "2017-12-07T11:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://hips.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/same-sex-marriage-1512640379.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.836xh;0,0.0145xh&amp;resize=1200:*", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 22815, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "910689d082139efd306fe7578b964ce0bd87f42a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8B8Z4TVo8OnOXQAGloEo7NasA5zO_mWLQJVFxK8GZjX8oO9WLmbNHrumfjobYXBjzNweodnISq0yd821YUx_R0NHI9f0ToaqU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "Australia legalizes same-sex marriage", "text": "  3:54 AM CST Dec 7, 2017 Australia legalizes same-sex marriage   3:54 AM CST Dec 7, 2017 CANBERRA, Australia (CNN) \u2014 \nAustralia's parliament voted to legalize same-sex marriage Thursday after years of political jockeying and fierce public debate. \nCheers and applause broke out as ministers voted in favor of the bill following hours of debate and emotional speeches at Parliament House in Canberra. Advertisement \n\"This is Australia: Fair, diverse, loving and filled for respect for everyone,\" said an effusive Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, as he introduced the bill for a final vote. \n\"This is a great day, it belongs to every Australian.\" \nThe move follows a two-month national postal survey that showed 61% of more than 12 million respondents were in favor of marriage equality. \nThe country is now the 24th in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry, according to Pew Research. \nAustralia's first same-sex weddings will not take place until at least January, however, due to a longstanding requirement for all Australian couples to provide a full month's notice of their intention to get married. \nHistoric moment \nMarriage equality campaigners have fought for years for Thursday's vote. Though the bill was expected to pass into law without significant opposition, the lengthy legislative process was excruciatingly slow for the hundreds of advocates watching from the public gallery. \nAmong them was Christine Forster, the gay sister of Tony Abbott, the former Australian Prime Minister who has long been seen as the face of the \"no\" campaign. \nForster was joined in the public gallery by her partner, Virginia Edwards. They plan to marry next year, and Abbott has said he'll attend despite his personal views. \nAbbott and other conservatives proposed amendments to the bill to include further religious protections, all of which were voted down. \n\"These amendments are important and I stress they are not against same-sex marriage, they are simply in favor of the rights of religious organizations to keep doing what their doing,\" Abbott said. \nOpponents of the changes argued they would legalize discrimination against the gay community. The 500 or so people in the gallery were vocal in their disapproval of the amendments. They were warned multiple times that parliamentary rules prohibit them making noise and even applauding. \nAn emotional week \nAfter the bill passed the Senate last week, House proceedings kicked off with fireworks Monday when Liberal MP Tim Wilson surprised his colleagues by proposing to his long-time partner Ryan Bolger. \nThe next day, Liberal MP Andrew Wallace, who is a devout Catholic, shared with his colleagues how his gay daughter helped change his position on same-sex marriage. \n\"She said: Dad, in the years to come, my generation will look back and judge your generation about how you deal with the issue of homosexuality in the same way that your generation considered your parents' generation in the way that they dealt with our Indigenous people,\" Wallace said. \nFighting back tears, Liberal MP Sarah Henderson told the story Wednesday night of a close gay friend of hers who died months ago and who, in one of their last conversations, asked her to continue to push for same-sex marriage. \nSurvey says yes \nThursday's vote comes three weeks after Australia voted overwhelmingly to legalize same-sex marriage as part of a national postal survey lasting two months. \nUnder political pressure to find a solution, the ruling Liberal National Coalition government announced the non-compulsory survey in August, saying if the result was \"yes\" they would allow a free vote in Parliament. \nIn the end, 61.6% of Australia voted in favor of allowing same-sex marriage, with 38.4% saying \"no.\" \nAbout 12.7 million people participated in the survey, which had a response rate of nearly 80% -- which is considered very high. \nAustralians have long been in favor of same-sex marriage, with polling from as long as 10 years ago showing a majority support for legalizing marriage equality.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine forster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia edwards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah henderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan bolger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pew research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal national coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:32.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "41af8ab6ea3c3170264734aefbfcb2b3e30f409f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFqmLQ5GiuNXw4OjbmAc7K6nzFpfyLEihCCFAUi_zZZFTs0ift831QmjZZL_joRTP3ePH.1KyUvX_l1PZ9Q5_mRqqu69szGaf9TB8p_JdvzDKg--", "site_full": "gardiner1.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://gardiner1.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "gardiner", "title": "[gardiner] [gardiner] [gardiner] [gardiner] [gardiner] [gardiner] [gardiner] [gardiner] [gardiner] [gardiner] [gardiner] [gardiner] [gardiner] [gardiner] \ud83c\udfc3 Hurry!

But unexpected events come along, disrupt daily operations, and send those carefully considered plans right out the window. \nAs part of i4cp\u2019s ongoing research on organizational agility , we recently conducted a brief pulse survey of 115 HR leaders to evaluate how they and their organizations respond to these disruptors\u2014from proposed travel bans and public protests to natural disasters and terrorist attacks. \nDealing with the devastating human toll taken by such events is certainly an organization\u2019s primary concern. But there are also practical, business-related implications to consider. Consider that 56% of the leaders surveyed said their organizations have experienced a loss of productivity due to a natural disaster in the last 12 months. Meanwhile, 24% said they\u2019ve seen productivity dip due to immigration-related actions such as the so-called travel ban proposed by the Trump administration. Taking fast action \nIf the results of our poll are any indication, organizations are responding quickly and emphatically when faced with such extraordinary circumstances. On the other hand, there remains room to improve, namely in terms of who gets involved in the response effort. For example: More than half of respondents (59%) reported that their organizations respond effectively to crises to a very high or high extent, with 32% saying their efforts are successful to a moderate extent. Overall, 35% of those polled said their organizations have created formal structures to deal with social and political issues or crises. Another 25% reported that they\u2019ve created guidelines and at least a loose structure to handle out-of-the-ordinary events like those mentioned above. \nOf the organizations that have rapid response protocols in place, what do those responses entail? And what can your organization learn from them? Based on the answers we received, i4cp has a handful of recommendations: Release an official statement from the CEO or another executive team member directly referencing the incident or taking a stand on an issue. When asked what external activities their organization has engaged in to address a disruptive social or political issue or crisis in the last 12 months, 38% of respondents said their organization takes this step. Provide support (financial or otherwise) to external stakeholders affected by the incident. Another 37% indicate they\u2019ve done as much in the past year. Release an official statement from the CEO or other executive team member reaffirming organizational values relating to the incident, without specifically mentioning it; an approach taken by 35% of respondents. Join with other organizations \u2014within the same industry or geography, for example\u2014in a solidarity statement or effort related to an issue; 29% of survey participants say their companies form such partnerships in these instances. Get the right people in the right places \nHow companies respond when a crisis occurs is obviously paramount. Timeliness is equally crucial. \nMost survey respondents said the response of their organizations is indeed rapid. Among those with a formal rapid response system in place, 67% said their organizations act within 24 hours of becoming aware of an issue or event. Another 25% do so within two to three days of the event or issue surfacing. \nHow and when the organization crafts its response, it must ensure that the right people are included. According to our findings, management team members\u2014including those from HR\u2014are leading the effort at most companies. Among those with static or ad-hoc crisis response teams, 74% feature members of the executive team, 71% incorporate the chief HR officer, 65% bring in the CEO, and 62% involve the chief communication officer. \nAmong its many roles, HR is often seen as a key conduit between the organization\u2019s leadership team and its employees. As such, the CHRO should be playing an instrumental part in determining how and when the company reacts in a defining moment. It\u2019s heartening to see that many HR leaders already are. \nIt\u2019s surprising, however, that our survey doesn\u2019t find more organizations also giving customer-facing employees prominent roles in crafting or carrying out rapid response strategies. Overall, just 31% of those polled indicate that customer service/client-facing representatives are part of their response teams. \nWithout a doubt, the HR team should be among those who are front and center representing the organization (both externally and internally) in a time of crisis. But wouldn\u2019t it make sense to have these employees\u2014who interact with your external stakeholders daily\u2014standing beside them? \ni4cp members: download the survey results for more detail.

Time praised those who have given \"voice to open secrets, for moving whisper networks onto social networks, for pushing us all to stop accepting the unacceptable.\" The magazine's cover features Ashley Judd, Taylor Swift, Susan Fowler and others who say they have been harassed.\nTime's announcement was made Wednesday on NBC's \"Today\" show, where longtime host Matt Lauer was fired last week amid harassment allegations. \"Today\" host Savannah Guthrie acknowledged Wednesday that this year's winner hits \"close to home\" and mentioned Lauer by name.\nWomen who spoke out, initially against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and then others, helped to spawn the #MeToo movement, with millions of people telling stories of sexual misconduct on social media.\nThe tweets, Instagram and Facebook posts began after actress-activist Alyssa Milano followed on a suggestion from a friend of a friend on Facebook and tweeted: \"If you've been sexually harassed or assaulted write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet.\" The hashtag was tweeted nearly a million times in 48 hours. #MeToo was actually founded by activist Tarana Burke a decade ago to raise awareness about sexual violence. Milano has said she wasn't aware of Burke's contributions when she made her initial tweet and has since publicly credited her.\nMilano and Burke appeared together Wednesday on the \"Today\" show.\n\"This is just the start. I've been saying from the beginning it's not just a moment, it's a movement,\" Burke said. \"Now the work really begins.\"\n\"As women, we have to support each other and stand together and say, 'That's it. We're done. No more,'\" Milano said. \"It's vital to me that we really set in some actionable things that we can do to continue this momentum.\"\nWednesday's winner differed slightly from how it was described the shortlist of finalists, which mentioned only the #MeToo movement. Time has made such changes before. The 2014 winner, \"The Ebola Fighters,\" was listed as \"Ebola Caregivers\" in the shortlist.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, Time's 2015 Person of the Year, said through a spokesman that this year's winners should be thanked for \"having the courage to break the silence on sexual assaults and for the worldwide discussion that they have launched.\"\nThe two runners-up for Person of the Year were Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump, himself accused of sexual misconduct by numerous women. He has denied any wrongdoing.\nTrump, Person of the Year in 2016, tweeted recently that the magazine had told him he \"probably\" would be named again if he agreed to an interview and photo shoot. Trump added that he \"took a pass.\" Time has disputed his account.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show that Time magazine's Person of the Year is the silence breakers.
