Advertisement \n\"This is Australia: Fair, diverse, loving and filled for respect for everyone,\" said an effusive Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, as he introduced the bill for a final vote. \n\"This is a great day, it belongs to every Australian.\" \nThe move follows a two-month national postal survey that showed 61% of more than 12 million respondents were in favor of marriage equality. \nThe country is now the 24th in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry, according to Pew Research. \nAustralia's first same-sex weddings will not take place until at least January, however, due to a longstanding requirement for all Australian couples to provide a full month's notice of their intention to get married. \nHistoric moment \nMarriage equality campaigners have fought for years for Thursday's vote. Though the bill was expected to pass into law without significant opposition, the lengthy legislative process was excruciatingly slow for the hundreds of advocates watching from the public gallery. \nAmong them was Christine Forster, the gay sister of Tony Abbott, the former Australian Prime Minister who has long been seen as the face of the \"no\" campaign. \nForster was joined in the public gallery by her partner, Virginia Edwards. They plan to marry next year, and Abbott has said he'll attend despite his personal views. \nAbbott and other conservatives proposed amendments to the bill to include further religious protections, all of which were voted down. \n\"These amendments are important and I stress they are not against same-sex marriage, they are simply in favor of the rights of religious organizations to keep doing what their doing,\" Abbott said. \nOpponents of the changes argued they would legalize discrimination against the gay community. The 500 or so people in the gallery were vocal in their disapproval of the amendments. They were warned multiple times that parliamentary rules prohibit them making noise and even applauding. \nAn emotional week \nAfter the bill passed the Senate last week, House proceedings kicked off with fireworks Monday when Liberal MP Tim Wilson surprised his colleagues by proposing to his long-time partner Ryan Bolger. \nThe next day, Liberal MP Andrew Wallace, who is a devout Catholic, shared with his colleagues how his gay daughter helped change his position on same-sex marriage. \n\"She said: Dad, in the years to come, my generation will look back and judge your generation about how you deal with the issue of homosexuality in the same way that your generation considered your parents' generation in the way that they dealt with our Indigenous people,\" Wallace said. \nFighting back tears, Liberal MP Sarah Henderson told the story Wednesday night of a close gay friend of hers who died months ago and who, in one of their last conversations, asked her to continue to push for same-sex marriage. \nSurvey says yes \nThursday's vote comes three weeks after Australia voted overwhelmingly to legalize same-sex marriage as part of a national postal survey lasting two months. \nUnder political pressure to find a solution, the ruling Liberal National Coalition government announced the non-compulsory survey in August, saying if the result was \"yes\" they would allow a free vote in Parliament. \nIn the end, 61.6% of Australia voted in favor of allowing same-sex marriage, with 38.4% saying \"no.\" \nAbout 12.7 million people participated in the survey, which had a response rate of nearly 80% -- which is considered very high. \nAustralians have long been in favor of same-sex marriage, with polling from as long as 10 years ago showing a majority support for legalizing marriage equality.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine forster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia edwards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah henderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan bolger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pew research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal national coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aaac1738cf7fdb2976dda4362faadcd930385869", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSAgDui1SQTVZHI7PbRZcsgvqr90aCJJSL7xii_85M_sXUiZCTIPehMxggAdcl2HCY-", "site_full": "buffy-boards.com", "site": "buffy-boards.com", "site_section": "https://buffy-boards.com/forums/the-game-of-life.37/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "investors_and_patents"], "section_title": "The Game of Life | Buffy-Boards", "title": "Bangel gifs", "title_full": "Bangel gifs | Buffy-Boards", "published": "2017-12-07T09:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "https://buffy-boards.com/data/avatars/m/14/14571.jpg?1511983364", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "089f6055d98729e284a1fe277703485ef061fe0a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSAgDui1SQTVZHI7PbRZcsgvqr90aCJJSL7xii_85M_sXUiZCTIPehM15uEGttaH1AjdRm3Ggiklg--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "RachM", "published": "2017-12-07T09:17:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Aw.

Two months after comedian Ralphie May died on October 6, the official cause of his death has been revealed. Medical examiners in Las Vegas have determined that the runner-up of season one of \"Last Comic Standing\" passed away at 45 due to high blood pressure and heart disease. \"Ralphie May's cause of death was hypertensive cardiovascular disease,\" a spokesperson for the Clark County Coroner told TMZ on Wednesday, December 6. \"There were no drugs found in his system at the time of death, so it is being ruled as a natural death.\" May died in Las Vegas after suffering cardiac arrest. \"We are heartbroken to announce the untimely death of our friend, Ralphie May,\" the comedian's rep said in a statement. \"Ralphie had been battling pneumonia and had cancelled a handful of dates over the last month in an effort to recover. Earlier this morning at a private residence in Las Vegas his body was discovered, cause of death is cardiac arrest.\" Just two days before his passing, May \"won the Casino Comedian of the Year at the Global Gaming Expo and had performances throughout the remainder of 2017 as part of his residency at Harrah's Las Vegas,\" according to the rep. The stand-up comic \"is survived by his wife Lahna Turner and children April June May and August James May.\" May was born on February 17, 1972 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. His career as a comedian skyrocketed in 2003 after he was named as the runner up in the first season of \"Last Comic Standing\". He also starred in several specials of his own, including Netflix's \"Imperfectly Yours\" in 2013 and 2015's \"Unruly\".

FOX10 News | WALA Member Center: No. 5 Florida upset again, this time by Loyola-Chicago 65-59 Posted: \nBy MARK LONGAP Sports Writer \nGAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) - Aundre Jackson scored 23 points, Cameron Krutwig added 14 and Loyola-Chicago stunned No. 5 Florida 63-59 on Wednesday night, handing the Gators a third consecutive loss. \nLess than 48 hours after Florida coach Mike White said his team's performance against rival Florida State was \"the epitome of soft,\" the Gators delivered another dud. \nThis one could knock them out of The Associated Press Top 25 next week, especially if they lose to 17th-ranked Cincinnati in New Jersey on Saturday. Arizona went from No. 2 to unranked earlier this season. \nThe Gators (5-3) shot 36.9 percent from the field, missed 17 of 19 3-point attempts and finished with seven assists. \nThe Ramblers (9-1) were much more efficient, shooting 52 percent from the field and making half their 12 shots from behind the arc. \nWhite tweaked several aspects of Florida's approach: Deaundrae Ballard and Keith Stone replaced KeVaughn Allen and Jalen Hudson in the starting lineup, and the Gators pressed more than usual. Allen had started 68 consecutive games. \nBut nothing White did fixed Florida's shooting woes. \nAllen was 3-of-11 shooting, including 1 of 5 from 3-point range. Hudson was 3 of 11 from the field and 0 of 5 from behind the arc. Egor Koulechov was 3 of 13, including 0 for 3 on treys. Chris Chiozza was 3 of 7 from the field, had a team-high nine points and finished with four assists. \nNo Florida player reached double digits in scoring. \nThe Gators also led just 93 seconds. \nBIG PICTURE \nLoyola-Chicago: The Ramblers have to feel good. They enjoyed their best start through nine games since the 1965-66 season and led Florida for most of the night. Coach Porter Moses has an experienced squad that's playing without senior guard Ben Richardson (broken hand). \nFlorida: Since leading top-ranked Duke by 17 points with 10 minutes to play in a championship game of the PK80, the Gators haven't been the same. Between Duke's comeback and lackluster losses to Florida State and Loyola-Chicago, Florida has been outscored by a whopping 44 points in a 90-minute span. The stretch raised questions about the team's ranking and potential. \nUP NEXT \nLoyola-Chicago: Hosts Norfolk State on Saturday. \nFlorida: Plays No. 17 Cincinnati on Saturday in Newark, New Jersey. \nMore AP college basketball: www.collegebasketball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

He had 21 points in a win over Citadel on Nov. 24. \nThe Seminoles, who were playing their second game in three nights after beating No. 5 Florida on Monday, are 8-0 for the first time since the 2003-04 season, when they won their first 10 games. All but one of FSU's victories have been by 17 points or more. \nM.J. Walker scored 14, including four 3-pointers, before fouling out and Phil Cofer added 12 as Florida State led throughout. The Seminoles led by as many as 26 (84-58) on a Cofer jumper with 6:33 remaining. \nChuck Champion and Isaiah Hart each scored 15 points for the Greyhounds (1-7), who have lost four straight. \nTHE TAKEAWAY \nLoyola-Maryland: Cam Gregory, who came into the game 10th in the nation in offensive rebounds at 4.0 per game, was held without an offensive board in the first half but finished with three. He had eight rebounds total. \nFlorida State: The Seminoles have won 25 straight at home, which is the third-longest winning streak in the nation. They have won their four games at the Tucker Center this season by an average of 24.8 points. \nUP NEXT \nLoyola-Maryland: Hosts Binghamton on Saturday. \nFlorida State: Faces Tulane on Sunday in Tampa, Florida. \nMore AP college basketball at http://collegebasketball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 \nFollow Joe Reedy on Twitter at www.twitter.com/joereedy Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

We  may be bound by time, but  Jesus , the one who created time, is not. He always has time for each one of us!\nEven in His earthly ministry, in His limited form as Man, He always had time to minister to people. Consider a typical day in His ministry: When a severely demon-possessed man cried out from the tombs of a distant region, He had time to sail all the way from Galilee to the country of the Gadarenes to save that lonely, tormented man. On the way there, He had time to respond to the cries of His disciples when a fierce storm arose. He awoke from a much-deserved sleep and calmed the storm for them.\nAfter He saved the demonized man and returned to Galilee, another man, Jairus, came to him for help. Jairus\u2019 12-year-old daughter was dying and he begged Jesus to come to his house to heal her. Jesus agreed\u2014He had time. But on His way there, a woman with a 12-year bleeding condition touched the hem of His garment and received her healing. Though Jairus\u2019 daughter was in the throes of death, Jesus had time to find out who had touched Him, just so that He could minister to the woman.\nWhile Jesus was ministering to her, He received a death report concerning Jairus\u2019 daughter. Now, in the natural, Jesus was \u201ctoo late.\u201d Yet, He did not consider it a waste of time to encourage Jairus, \u201cDo not be afraid; only believe, and she will be made well\u201d (Luke 8:49\u201350). He wasn\u2019t troubled or harried. He still took time to go to Jairus\u2019 house and raised the little girl from the dead.\nMy friend, this same loving Jesus always has time for you. He hears your cries, cares about the little and big things that bother you, and will come and save you. Even when He\u2019s \u201cbusy,\u201d He has time to stop and minister to you. And even when it seems \u201ctoo late,\u201d He will still see to it that you get your miracle!\n\njosephprince.com theletgobook.com \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph prince", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jairus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luke 8:49", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "galilee", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:02.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5693db9dd0d0723c1583bc72f1c5e9d2e7793314", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTI6xdpBym9vx_B0WoLDNgs3I.6TIt7H755.mLb13TpijhtMx6_w5lH", "site_full": "afanasii1.livejournal.com", "site": "livejournal.com", "site_section": "https://afanasii1.livejournal.com/data/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "afanasii1", "title": "\u041c\u043e\u0438 \u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044b", "title_full": "\u041c\u043e\u0438 \u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044b", "published": "2017-12-07T11:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/sign.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5693db9dd0d0723c1583bc72f1c5e9d2e7793314", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTI6xdpBym9vx_B0WoLDNgs3I.6TIt7H755.mLb13TpijhtMx6_w5lH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u041c\u043e\u0438 \u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044b", "text": "Anonymous comments are disabled in this journal We will log you in after post We will log you in after post We will log you in after post We will log you in after post We will log you in after post Anonymously", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:02.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8c3785fd2ba1128d1f09af2d1c2fae4b30896b05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8vUdzJk69cXLbt6Og5ndAlgtfCJTNxg62rYaDUD89A9b0MkFR8J2RIN4wLA0hb98E-", "site_full": "www.akfiles.com", "site": "akfiles.com", "site_section": "http://www.akfiles.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=2", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "General Discussion -

the ocean environment \nA new exhibition at NTU CCA Singapore poses critical questions about human intervention in oceanic environments Dec 07, 2017 | By Art Republik SHARE Lisa Rave, \u2018Europium\u2019, 2014, still from HD video, sound, 21 min. \nWho owns the ocean, and who has the authority to govern it? These questions are repeatedly brought to the surface in \u2018The Oceanic\u2019 at NTU Centre for Contemporary Art (NTU CCA) Singapore\u2019s exhibition on extensive human interventions in oceanic biospheres. Running from 9 December 2017 to 4 March 2018, the exhibition is part of \u2018The Current\u2019, an ongoing research initiative by Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary\u2013Academy (TBA21\u2013Academy) which investigates environmental and socio-political issues. \nAt the helm is curator and NTU CCA\u2019s founding director Professor Ute Meta Bauer, who led the project\u2019s first cycle of expeditions from 2015 to 2017. Joining her were \u2018The Current\u2019 Research Fellows: 12 artists, composers, academics and filmmakers who contributed to the current exhibition. The team journeyed aboard TBA21\u2013 Academy\u2019s vessel Dardanella to the Pacific Ocean archipelagos of Papua New Guinea (2015), French Polynesia (2016), and Fiji (2017). \nBauer explains the rationale behind selecting these locations: \u201cWe wanted to focus on remote island groups that are immediately affected by climate change and human interventions. These areas contribute less than 2 percent to climate change but suffer 98 percent of the environmental impact caused by globalisation.\u201d \nThe first expedition to Papua New Guinea was undertaken with a group of 4 artists, and focused on alternative economies relating to the Kula Ring, a ceremonial exchange system practiced in the Trobriand Islands. On display are works such as Newell Harry\u2019s (Australia) black-and-white photo series \u2018(Untitled) Nimoa and Me: Kiriwina Notes\u2019 (2015\u201316) documenting exchange practices, and Laura Anderson Barbata\u2019s (Mexico/ United States) striking costumes incorporating items from artisans in Milne Bay Province. Newell Harry, An old Mawali Kula shell of elder, Hon. Camillus Mlabwema. Kotovila Village, Yalumgwa, Kiriwina Island, Papua New Guinea, 2015, documentation. \nThe journey to French Polynesia in 2016 explored the still neglected long-term impact of nuclear experiments in the Pacific. Atolls Mururoa and Fangataufa were the sites for 193 nuclear tests by the French Military from 1966 until 1996. In a bid to seek environmental justice and address the exploitation of resources in the region, artist Nabil Ahmed (Bangladesh/United Kingdom) collaborates with other researchers to call for an Inter-Pacific Ring Tribunal (INTERPRT) (2016\u2013ongoing). \nThe project\u2019s final expedition to Fiji turned the lens to the tradition of the Tabu, an indigenous rule system that recently became known for marine conservation and resource management. Amongst the participants was anthropologist Guigone Camus (France), whose documentation and materials from extensive research in Kiribati are displayed in The Lab, the Centre\u2019s project space. Another expeditioner Lisa Rave\u2019s film \u2018Europium\u2019 (2014) explores the link between colonialism, ecology, and currencies through an investigation of deep-sea mining. \nOn her curatorial process and working with the contributors, Bauer speaks of the emphasis on knowledge building and exchange. \u201cThe current project is very much aligned in the way that we maintain ongoing conversations with the contributors and sustain long term relationships,\u201d she notes. \u201cFor instance, before Nabil Ahmed and writer Filipa Ramos (Portugal/ United Kingdom) took part in the second expedition, they participated in the first post-expedition Convening. Similarly, filmmaker and photographer Armin Linke (Italy/Germany) brought continuity by being the only Fellow to participate in all 3 research trips.\u201d Armin Linke, \u2018OCEANS. Dialogues between ocean floor and water column\u2019, 2017, four-channel video, installation, 40 min, dimensions variable. \nGiven the varied skillsets of the contributors, a significant highlight of the exhibition is its combination of various mediums such as video installations, photography, physical object displays, and research documentation. \u201cThe works all originate from diverse research interests, but function like parts of a larger puzzle that start to take shape. What is depicted can be better recognised with each additional piece,\u201d says Bauer. \nThe idea of the disparate segments merging as part of a larger tapestry is also reflected in the transdisciplinary approach to \u2018The Oceanic\u2019. Banding together advisors working in various fields, from artists and curators, to scientists, marine biologists, anthropologists and policymakers, Bauer envisions the exhibition to speak to a broader audience, conveying the urgency of climate issues and calling the public to be active participants of change. \nIt is also Bauer\u2019s hope that conversations about environmental issues carry on long after \u2018The Oceanic\u2019 concludes. The exhibition serves as a starting point for NTU CCA Singapore\u2019s new overarching research topic \u2018CLIMATES. HABITATS. ENVIRONMENTS\u2019. Next up at the Centre is \u2018The Current\u2019 Convening #3\u2019 (25 th -27 th Jan 2018), an event with roundtables, workshops and screenings themed around modalities of exchange and shared responsibilities. \nAnother project in the works is the first exhibition in Southeast Asia by Paris-based Lebanese artist Tarek Atoui, investigates diverse notions of the sonic and modes of listening with regards to the natural environment, taking place from March to June 2018. \nMore information at ntu.ccasingapore.org . \nThis article was written by Rebecca Wong for Art Republik. \n ",

High-Cost ACA Plans By Julie Appleby December 7, 2017 <h1>Brokers Tout Mix-And-Match Coverage To Avoid High-Cost ACA Plans</h1> <span class=\"byline\">Julie Appleby,   <p>Health insurance a la carte?</p> <p>As the Affordable Care Act open-enrollment season moves into its final weeks, some consumers looking for lower-cost alternatives are considering a patchwork approach to health insurance. The products may secure some basic protection but leave patients on the hook for high medical bills.</p> <p>The idea involves mixing and matching several types of insurance products originally designed to cover the deductibles and other gaps in traditional coverage.</p> <p>\u201cWe have several carriers\u201d from which clients can choose \u201cprescription coverage from one and accident coverage from another and critical illness care from someone else,\u201d said Eric Jans, a Nashville, Tenn., broker.</p> <p>An entire package, he added, usually costs $900 to $1,000 a month for a family.</p> <p>Though not new, the tactic is gaining momentum and interest with consumers \u2014 particularly in regions of the country with high ACA plan premiums.</p> <p>And it\u2019s gone national with the online firm eHealth, which launched a set of packages Nov. 1 and promotes them on its <a href=\"https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/medical-insurance-packages?allid=Ado43827\">website</a> to people who \u201ccan\u2019t afford Obamacare.\u201d</p> <p>The packages won\u2019t exempt people from the IRS penalty under the ACA, experts warn.</p> <p>And consumer advocates caution the concept falls far short of full coverage.</p>   <p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing increased marketing of these over the past year. It\u2019s a very risky proposition for consumers,\u201d said Betsy Imholz, special projects director for Consumers Union. \u201cProceed with extreme caution.\u201d</p> <p>The packages cobble together \u201cfixed-benefit indemnity\u201d plans, also known as \u201cgap coverage\u201d plans, with other types of policies.</p> <p>Most such \u201cgap coverage\u201d plans are underwritten, meaning they ask about applicants\u2019 health and can exclude people with medical problems, or exempt those conditions from coverage.</p> <p>These plans pay an often-small per-day or per-service amount toward hospital care, doctor visits and lab tests \u2014 for example, $65 for a primary care appointment or $175 for an advanced imaging test.</p> <p>The packages usually include a prescription drug discount card.</p> <p>Many also feature a \u201ccritical illness policy\u201d that pays a lump sum of between $5,000 to as much as $50,000 if the policyholder is diagnosed with a qualifying illness, such as a heart attack, cancer or stroke. Some also incorporate short-term medical policies, which must be renewed every 90 days.</p> <p>None provides comprehensive major medical coverage.</p> <p>The effort to reinvigorate sales of such policies comes as premiums for some ACA plans are rising rapidly, fueled by that ban on rejecting people who are sick, the inability of Congress to agree on efforts to stabilize the market and Trump administration actions that undermine the federal health law.</p> <p>In some markets, families now face ACA premiums that exceed $20,000 a year.</p> <p>\u201cThere are entrepreneurs all over the insurance industry looking at the fact that people can\u2019t access insurance they can afford,\u201d said Robert Laszewski, an industry consultant based near Washington, D.C.</p> <p>Detailing The Coverage </p> <p>The IHC Group, which offers the type of hospital indemnity coverage often included in such packages, provides a <a href=\"https://www.healthedeals.com/Media/Default/Unbounce/Resource_Center/Brochures/Brochure_Care_Access_Plan_0817.pdf\">hypothetical example</a> of how its plan works. A person in the hospital with pneumonia for five days, two of them in intensive care, would receive a flat payment of $12,250 in total toward that hospital bill.</p> <p>While that may sound like a lot, the hospital bill, \u201cif you\u2019re on a ventilator and getting antibiotics, could be $12,000 a day,\u201d said Missy Conley, director of consumer claims at Roanoke-based Medliminal, a firm that helps consumers sort out their medical bills.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s just the nursing staff and the room,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t include the physician who pops in or the respiratory therapists.\u201d</p> <p>Most people have no clue how much big-ticket items like hospital care, chemotherapy or surgery can cost. And it\u2019s hard to get medical providers to disclose their charges. Still, the average cost of a three-day stay in the hospital is $30,000, according to the federal government\u2019s health website, <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/why-coverage-is-important/protection-from-high-medical-costs/\">healthcare.gov</a>.</p> <p>Even with those limitations, some consumers are now eyeing the packages for their sole coverage.</p> <p>\u201cWith [these products], we try to put together carriers that provide something [as] close to major medical as we could get,\u201d said Nate Purpura, eHealth\u2019s vice president of marketing.</p> <p>Prices vary by carrier, level of coverage and the age and gender of the applicant.</p> <p>Even with lower premiums, a package might not end up being less expensive than an ACA plan if the consumer has a medical issue or two during the year.</p> <p>The materials eHealth uses to explain its plans illustrates that point.</p> <p>It starts by warning consumers that medical insurance packages \u201cmay not be the best option\u201d if they have job-based insurance or can afford an ACA plan.</p> <p>But then it highlights Jane, <a href=\"https://slns93t2j3c4h0o42gaac81d-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/3-steps-medical-insurance-packages-ebook-2017.pdf\">a hypothetical 28-year-old</a> who says she can\u2019t afford the $350 a month an ACA plan would cost her.</p> <p>Instead, she gets an eHealth package plan for $230 a month, saving $1,440 in premium for the year.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Jane has a bike accident, breaks a bone and then a month later needs new glasses.</p> <p>The example shows that her package of plans paid a total of $17,000 toward the ambulance ride, the hospital costs, her pain medicine and her new glasses. Jane saved $17,000 off total costs incurred of $21,550, the brochure says.</p> <p>But, what it doesn\u2019t spell out is that she still had to pay about $4,550 for her share of the rest of the tab.</p> <p>Certainly, she\u2019s better off financially than being uninsured. But, in reality, her package plan cost her $3,110 more than if she had gone with the seemingly more expensive ACA coverage.</p> <p>\u201cEvery dollar you don\u2019t spend on premiums looks like a savings,\u201d said Michael Lujan, co-founder of employer benefit firm Limelight Health in San Francisco, and a board member of the Silicon Valley Association of Health Underwriters. \u201cBut let\u2019s say you end up in the hospital with surgery or whatever, you need to weigh that and consider \u2018What would my costs be?\u2019\u201d</p><p><a  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "julie appleby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert laszewski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missy conley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "betsy imholz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael lujan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric jans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nate purpura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ihc group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "limelight health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "consumers union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley association of health underwriters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ehealth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aca", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tenn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nashville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:03.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ea7b8e075b9c3c3509f05c733522390e529b09b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UdofhCmA41oP2E0yBFnumpx_YKExVZII.JjEpNC4EPrYnXwTiwxBaylvDAGcmQpbEWS7pGr8qkihG39U132cIJy6.SGXa86RXqQV.p6FqCZRWP0.jNTl4fb", "site_full": "dismantlingwhiteousness.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://dismantlingwhiteousness.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Dismantling Whiteousness", "title": "#DetroitStories from The Studio Detroit, April 21, 2017", "title_full": "#DetroitStories from The Studio Detroit, April 21, 2017", "published": "2017-04-22T17:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9c025492bfddde1c36b2d76894b148145f2836b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UdofhCmA41oP2E0yBFnumpx_YKExVZII.JjEpNC4EPrYnXwTiwxBaylvDAGcmQpbEWS7pGr8qkihG39U132cIJy6.SGXa86RXqQV.p6FqCZRfsYp0Zil.TUIOeaXI5ZIHI-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Advancing Justice Initiative", "published": "2017-11-23T02:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I read every word written by Donna Lillian Givens.

She extended her Division I career 3-point record with four makes from distance to sit at 415. \nSierra Calhoun added three 3-pointers and 21 points for Ohio State (9-2). Linnae Harper scored 18 points and reached 1,000 career points on a layup in the fourth quarter. The Buckeyes are seventh in the country at 89.5 points per game and have topped the century mark three times this season. \nMitchell made three 3-pointers in the first quarter and had 15 points to help OSU build a 31-18 lead. Ohio State led 51-38 at the half behind Mitchell's four 3s and 20 points. The Buckeyes shot 51 percent in the half. \nHaley Lorenzen led Florida (5-4) with 17 points. Funda Nakkasoglu scored 14 of her 16 points in the first half. \nPaulina Hersler's 4-point play pulled Florida within 60-54 with five minutes left in the third but OSU answered with a 12-2 run for a commanding lead again.

The advantage of such chip is that is requires less external component, and allows for smaller designs. For example, the boards I received would leave two row of pin on each side of the board, while most other ESP32 boards will only expose one row on each side. \nI used the board to play with Micropython ESP32 port , and later-on when I launched a giveaway of 8 of the boards, I found out the name had changed to ESP32-PICO Kit , with the documentation listing v3 with all pins connected to male headers, and v4 with 6-pin not connected to a male header as shown in the photo below. Both versions of the board also have a different pin layout. But you don\u2019t need to care since AFAIK v3 was never up for sale. \nESP32-PICO-KIT v4 however has now just launched, and Electrodragon offers it for $10 plus shipping . \nBoard specifications: SiP \u2013 ESP32-PICO-D4 802.11 b/g/n WiFi + Bluetooth LE system-in-package 3D antenna USB \u2013 1x micro USB port for power and programming; CP2102 USB-TTL Serial Bridge Expansion \u2013 2x 20-pin headers with I/O and power signals. 2x 17-pin male headers soldered Misc \u2013 EN and Boot buttons, on board power indicator LED. Power regulator \u2013 AMS1117 3.3V regulator Auto reset circuit Dimensions \u2013 51 x 20 mm \nThis board can be used like any other ESP32 board with ESP32 IDF SDK, Arduino Core, Micropython, and so on, it\u2019s just narrower than most. \nOther ESP32-PICO-D4 based boards have been launched such ESP32-PICO motherboard sold for $16 on Tindie , or TTGO T7, recently discovered by Time4EE , that can be purchased for $8.50 plus shipping on Aliexpress . The latter is however quite wider than the official Espressif devkit (estimated dimensions: 50\u00d730 mm), but does provide a battery connector TTGO T7 \nStandard ESP32 boards can now be purchased for as low as $5 , so boards based on the SiP are currently a little bit more expensive, but I\u2019d expect the price difference to come down overtime.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arduino core", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "espressif systems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "electrodragon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idf sdk", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "micropython", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "misc", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:04.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a7e01f98983c53f5ed28cf7d6433ad39e9d3e17a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQkK7aUqeqwE.fx2Pb7UwUj5t5.HW4Q4cfOngF81LvXtPqQrGp44j3gv2TUl88UwXSSOjf.jKB8iJWmCdVr_q.fJToELWl0Gg2tGdBPqoXj4H1qr4gDQ7X8R7b6EghluxurYknV.1gGS2EfVVxMDPEf", "site_full": "www.indiablooms.com", "site": "indiablooms.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "IIT Kharagpur students bag about 900 jobs in less than a week | Indiablooms - First Portal on Digital News Management", "title_full": "IIT Kharagpur students bag about 900 jobs in less than a week | Indiablooms - First Portal on Digital News Management", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.194, "main_image": "https://www.indiablooms.com/life_pic/2017/IITKGP-1512630473.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a7e01f98983c53f5ed28cf7d6433ad39e9d3e17a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQkK7aUqeqwE.fx2Pb7UwUj5t5.HW4Q4cfOngF81LvXtPqQrGp44j3gv2TUl88UwXSSOjf.jKB8iJWmCdVr_q.fJToELWl0Gg2tGdBPqoXj4H1qr4gDQ7X8R7b6EghluxurYknV.1gGS2EfVVxMDPEf", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "IIT Kharagpur students bag about 900 jobs in less than a week | Indiablooms - First Portal on Digital News Management", "text": "IIT Kharagpur students bag about 900 jobs in less than a week \nIndia Blooms News Service | @indiablooms | 07 Dec 2017 Twitter Pinterest \nKolkata, Dec 7 (IBNS) In 6 days IIT Kharagpur has rounded off with close to 900 jobs.

It is shaped by our views and interests, and not determined by any third country.\" \nTrump is expected to make the announcement of the dramatic foreign policy decision at the White House at 1 pm on Wednesday. \nThe United States will officially recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel as the first country in the world to do so since the foundation of the state in 1948, media reports said. \nTrump is also expected to give his approval for shifting the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city, reports quoted senior officials in the Trump administration as saying. \nThe Guardian quoted an administration official saying \"for a long time the United States\u2019 position held that ambiguity, or lack of acknowledgement would somehow advance the prospects of peace.\" \n\u201cIt seems clear now that the physical location of the embassy is not material to a peace deal \u2026 So having tried this for 22 years, an acknowledgement of reality seems like an important change,\u201d the official said. \nThe Independent has quoted officials as saying that recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital will be an acknowledgement of \"historical and current reality\" rather than a political statement. \nIsrael welcomes the changes but the Palestinians and Arab leaders have warned the move will jeopardise any Middle East peace process. \nIsrael considers Jerusalem as its capital city, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. \nAccording to reports, Trump's declaration could ignite violent protests in the Middle East and undermine the White House\u2019s effort to strike a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. \nU.S. allies, including France, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have reportedly urged Trump to avoid the extremely sensitive topic. \nMahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, has already warned Donald Trump of the \u201cdangerous consequences\" if he went ahead with the move. \nReports said after President Donald Trump told Jordan's King Abdullah II on Tuesday that he plans to move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, the latter warned Trump of \"the danger of taking any decision outside the context of a comprehensive solution that establishes a Palestinian state with its capital in east Jerusalem\". \n\"Jerusalem is the key to achieving peace and stability in the region and the world,\" the statement from Jordan said.

Wednesday, six allegations of groping or forcibly kissing women became seven and then eight, and fellow Democrats en masse demanded his resignation.\nAfter the claim that in 2006 he forced himself on a congressional staffer whose boss had just appeared on his radio show, it is hard to deny that Franken has a pattern of unacceptable behavior.\nAmerica is in the grips of sharp moral growing pains in which a range of predatory actions by powerful men, for decades shrouded in silence, are finally being aired, meriting overdue consequences.\nCount Franken\u2019s career as a necessary casualty.\nWith political consequences. Having purged two misbehaving men in their midst \u2014 both Franken and ousted Rep. John Conyers \u2014 Democrats can now rightly claim to have seized the moral high ground (if it matters, and it should) over a Republican Party that embraces a credibly accused child molester as its Senate candidate in Alabama.\nAnd that, oh, by the way, rallies behind a President who left in his wake a trail of women accusing him of unwanted sexual advances, and who bragged on tape of grabbing women \u201cby the p----.\u201d\nShould the reckoning be anything close to balanced, both Roy Moore and Donald Trump should face consequences.\nIt, however, behooves us all to take a moment \u2014 do we have even a moment amid the daily, if not hourly, purges of men accused of behavior that ranges from out-of-the-office boorishness to workplace sexual harassment to outright rape? \u2014 to ask ourselves, calmly if possible, how we will decide who is unfit to serve and who is not.\nOne disputed allegation of inappropriate touching may not cut it, unless it\u2019s especially severe. Two might not tip the scales either; did the hand slip down toward the buttocks on purpose? How tight was that waist squeeze when snapping a photo?\nMeantime, accusations \u2014 all of them \u2014 demand vetting. Yes, as a matter of basic decency, we should tend to believe women who accuse men of wrongdoing, even years after the fact. They generally have nothing to gain.\nBut a claim is not a fact. Smell-test standards of proof still apply. Corroboration, whenever possible, is a must.\nMeantime, the case of Conyers and now Franken and others are emerging in relative isolation, perhaps arbitrarily, from a Congress where more misconduct surely lurks.\nTexas Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold, who settled a large sexual harassment claim, remains in office. As do unknown numbers of sitting congressmen and senators who also settled claims but whose names are locked in a black box.\nAnd who knows who else might have groped or kissed aggressively once, or twice, or three times.\nIf the nation is to ensure that this does not devolve into convenient posturing, when additional revelations rain down we must be prepared to demand removal of any and all elected officials with an established pattern of harassment or abuse.\nAs the #metoo moment continues over the weeks and months and years, there will be few bright lines.

This was against the prescribed norms for dealing with newborns. The infant was declared dead by Max Hospital of Shalimar Bagh. But the baby showed signs of life, while the family was taking him to the cremation ground. Health Minister Satyendar Jain ordered a probe on December 1. The committee will submit its final report to Jain later this week. The Shalimar Bagh facility of Max Hospital had terminated the services of two doctors on Sunday.

Sex maybe. But not a relationship.\nWhy? Because I don't want that responsibility. I can't be someone's reason to live and find enjoyment in life. That is way too much to ask.\nFAR OUT NAT... You're a bit of a b.... Even when you're not angry. And funnily enough. I LIKE it. Weird.\nWhat did you learn from this?\nSpeaking up is kind of fun. You really hate hurting people... But you do like speaking your mind. Practice! You will stuff up and that's ok. This is kind of new to you (embracing this inner b.... And showing her to the world). Practice speaking up but please please please try and do it gently! Hurting people sucks. Criticism is not the end of the world. Like work. Like hubby being angry. You will upset people. That is normal. It doesn't make you evil. It makes you human. Try again. Read what you wrote to her and memorise it. You don't want to be someone's reason to live. So what do you think hubby feels? You are dependent on him sometimes to live. Is this the problem? Do you think maybe when he says he wants you to be happy and well again he doesn't mean to put pressure on you he just feels overwhelmed by how much you rely on him? You suspect this is true. Why? Because he is happier when you take control. He may carry on (like the work comments) but the reality is when you come home and feel happier and have felt enjoyment in your day he responds to this in a good way. You need to take control. Yes there are limits to work with financial and responsibility wise. But you're not trapped. You just need to make the effort to help yourself. Ok... End with the embarrassing because you need to remember it. Sometimes brutal honesty is not the way to go. Ok you want hubby to know you love him. That's good. But bloody hell Nat don't tell him you were thinking if he ever died you'd have to date a woman because no bloke could even touch how you feel for him. And especially don't tell him you'd go for a blonde cos you're straight and aren't fussed and he'd like to watch you with a blonde. Yes he laughed. So hard. But he also looked at you like you were mental. Avoid that in future ok? Please try not to post embarrassing stuff in future either. You'll fail. But try yeah?

When we reported on our day of check-out (we stayed 3 nights) that we never received the coffee pods and creamers we had asked for on our first evening, the front desk clerk, Jazmine, was sincerely apologetic and made a generous adjustment on our final bill--completely unexpected, but very much appreciated nonetheless! The mattress is super comfy and lots of fluffy pillows. Room and bathroom were spacious and comfortable with plenty of plug-ins and USB ports for our devices. We never used the pool or sat around the fire pit, but both looked very inviting and romantic--especially at night. The breakfast buffet included in our room rate is a wonderful value.

Ken Van Wagenen of Los Angeles shares his \u201cMagic 12\u201d with UCLA Anderson MBA Students \nI encourage all investors to maintain equity exposure, but do not chase those investments that look \u2018cheap\u2019 and have not participated in the recent market uptrend LOS ANGELES (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 A reliable investment portfolio can be built around accumulating tax-exempt bonds for stability of principal and tax-free interest income. In addition, a portion of everyone\u2019s nest egg should be allocated in stock market equity exposure for complimentary growth of principal. This news release is an update of just such a possible portfolio as described by Ken Van Wagenen, an investment professional with some 30 years of experience in the Los Angeles area. There are many ways to accomplish a balanced portfolio and often the question comes to an efficiency formula to minimize costs and maximize returns over the long haul. It is easy to buy exchange traded funds for maximum diversification, but the real returns are found by sourcing the correct equity in companies themselves. Becoming a part owner, and watching good business management grow those companies can be a rewarding experience. Oftentimes even the best companies \u201cstub their toe\u201d and temporarily underperform. These missteps are often the best opportunity to buy and hold as management corrects the course and returns to traditional upward profits and stock price momentum. This was true over the past decade when financial stocks and big money center banks were crippled during the housing crises of 2008-2009. The returns gained from such positions have been staggering. Ken Van Wagenen of Los Angeles believes the banking sector has more \u201croom to run\u201d as interest rates finally normalize and lending banks can increase loan rates and their profit margin \u201cspreads\u201d expand. Since the 2016 presidential election, we have noticed numerous successive all time highs in stock market performance. We have also seen the 60 day volatility for stock markets slip to below that of bonds for the first time this year. The US Treasury Bond yield curve has continued to flatten. This flattening means that the longer dated maturities return progressively less than expected for the additional risk associated with buying maturities far into the future. This yield curve anomaly typically anticipates a future sluggish economy. European high yield \u201cjunk bond\u201d debt has slipped to below 3% for the first time in 2017. It would seem everywhere we look there are \u201cbubbles\u201d in the various markets. The most pronounced run up in value can be found in the crypto currencies such as Bitcoin. This virtual currency has had a staggering tenfold rise in value in 2017 and recently broke $10,000 for the first time. Prudent money management dictates a focus on the higher quality names as a hedge against the certain correction that will follow in the near future. The high quality \u201cblue chip\u201d names are those that hold their value much better than marginal, more highly leveraged, equity positions in a market correction. Additionally, most blue chip large cap equities have generous yields when compared to market interest rates. When asked for advice, Ken Van Wagenen said, \u201cI encourage all investors to maintain equity exposure, but do not chase those investments that look \u2018cheap\u2019 and have not participated in the recent market uptrend.\u201d For this reason, Mr. Van Wagenen suggested investors consider holding and adding cautiously to such names as: Amgen, Apple, Bank of America, Caterpillar, Citigroup, Costco, Facebook, Home Depot, Netflix, Oracle, Priceline, and Raytheon. Although not all of these \u201cMagic 12\u201d stocks have generous dividends, many do offer dividend distributions that help compensate for patience in your investment holding horizon. Never forget to include a significant investment in the tax-free municipal bond market. These high quality loans with very low default rates routinely have returns exceeding that of taxable government bonds and high-grade corporate issues. Although the anticipated tax overhaul is being sold as meaningful, it appears now to have a moderated positive bias. The main benefits are chiefly based upon the notion of simplicity to individual taxpayers. Those few earning significant income and paying heavy income taxes are losing tax deductions historically relied upon. The closing of such deduction \u201cloopholes\u201d compensates to a great extent for any cut in marginal tax rates. Congress cannot seem to internalize growth in the economic \u201cpie\u201d therefore they have reduced the positive impact of a tax cut by insisting that the cut must be \u201cpaid for\u201d by reducing or eliminating tax deductions. It would be preferable to shrink the size of government and benefit from an expanding economy. The real upside momentum still may come from the corporate tax cuts which will hopefully provide meaningful momentum to business hiring and profitability in 2018. Ken Van Wagenen anticipates 2018 to be another strong year. Barring political instability, there should be a few insignificant corrections as is expected in a growing economy and a \u201ctoppy\u201d volatile marketplace. Mr. Van Wagenen encourages the savvy investor to stay invested and disciplined and watch your portfolio grow. Mr. Van Wagenen\u2019s opinions are his own and do not represent solicitations or recommendations to buy or sell. All investments should be transacted with the input from a competent investment professional familiar with your particular investment horizon, situation and risk tolerance.
