This functionality will allow Onapsis customers to quickly evaluate if SAP systems are meeting the requirements of this mandate to protect EU data subjects information. As with any new policy, the first stage is to identify those SAP systems that are in scope. In the case of GDPR, these are any systems that process, handle or store user information. \nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an EU regulation with an enforcement date in May 2018 concerning the protection of EU data subjects\u2019 personal and sensitive information. Research conducted by the UK & Ireland SAP User Group shows 86% of SAP users do not fully understand how GDPR will affect their SAP landscapes and how to reach compliance. It is almost certain GDPR will have an impact, in some way or another, on any company large enough to have chosen SAP, which touches all aspects of a business. In fact almost every SAP system includes GDPR\u2019s core element: personal data. \n\u201cIn speaking to our customers, we know that GDPR is a complicated mandate and many organizations are struggling to determine if or how their SAP landscapes are relevant. With this in mind, Onapsis\u2019s newly released audit policy within the Onapsis Security Platform (OSP) automatically evaluates any SAP system through the lens of the data protection requirements of GDPR. This includes both data at rest, data in transit and the assessment of data access or authorizations,\u201d commented Alex Horan, Director of Product Management, Onapsis. \nThrough the execution of this new policy, enterprises leveraging OSP can identify SAP systems that do not have adequate protection of the data and processes. Users will receive detailed guidance on how to address these security gaps. As new systems are brought in, scoped and tagged as GDPR, they will automatically be included in the next audit. \nFor further understanding of GDPR and how it affects SAP, download the recently released white paper from the Onapsis Research Labs titled, \u201c SAP and GDPR: Keeping Your Organization Ahead of the Upcoming EU Law .\u201d \nOnapsis\u2019s Director of Product Management, Alex Horan, will host a live webcast to help organizations understand the complex issue of GDPR and SAP on December 19th at 9:00am and 1:00pm EST. Register here for the webcast . \nAbout Onapsis \nOnapsis cybersecurity solutions automate the monitoring and protection of your SAP and Oracle applications, keeping them compliant and safe from insider and outsider threats.

It can also refer to an entity that primarily serves as a conduit. BREAKING DOWN 'Pipeline' \nA pipeline is often an important phase for development of an investment or investment product. The following examples exemplify various aspects of a pipeline. \n1) The underwriting procedure which must be completed by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) before a security can be offered for sale to the public. \n2) The period of time between a mortgage application and the purchase of the property. During the pipeline phase there is a high level of risk for potential change in financial factors affecting the final closing of a property purchase. \n3) A new security issue must go through the SEC's pipeline before it is legally cleared for sale to the public. This practice attempts to screen out fraudulent investments and ensures security offerings are presented to the public in an accurate fashion. Pipeline Companies \nPipeline theory suggests that companies serving primarily as a conduit should receive certain tax breaks. These companies can be referred to as pipeline companies. Such firms are usually exempt from normal corporate taxes, since they simply serve as an investment conduit, or pipeline, rather than actually producing goods and services as a regular corporation does. A mutual fund structured as a trust would be exempt from corporate taxes and considered an investment pipeline.

But the contradiction between President Trump\u2019s announcement that he will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel \u2014 at the very same time his son-in-law is trying to concoct the \u201cultimate\u201d deal between Israelis and Palestinians \u2014 is downright schizoid.\nOn the one hand, First Son-in-law Jared Kushner, paired with Trump\u2019s real estate lawyer Jason Greenblatt, have been traversing the Mideast for the last several months trying to come up with a peace plan whose details still remain a secret. But the plan will reportedly emerge early in the new year.\nOn the other hand, the future of Jerusalem \u2014 which would contain both the Palestinian and Israeli Jewish capitals in any plausible solution \u2014 is one of the most sensitive topics in any negotiation. And the issue of sovereignty over Jerusalem\u2019s holy places \u2014 sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims \u2014 is of concern globally. That\u2019s why none of the 160 countries that has diplomatic relations with Israel recognizes Jerusalem as its capital.\nNo U.S. president has ever recognized Israel\u2019s sovereignty over Jerusalem because they knew it would block any prospect of an \u201cultimate peace deal\u201d \u2014 the kind of deal that Trump insists that he alone can produce.\n\u201cThe Israelis and Palestinians have agreed that no side should take actions which preempt a final status agreement,\u201d I was told last week by the chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, who has met with Kushner and Greenblatt 11 times since September (while he has been recovering from a lung transplant in Virginia). \u201cThe United States can\u2019t dictate the outcome of Jerusalem, which should be negotiated by the two sides.\u201d\nIn 1995 Congress did call for the U.S. embassy to be moved to Jerusalem from its current location in Tel Aviv. But, because the issue was so sensitive, it permitted the president to issue a waiver every six months on moving the embassy, and every president since has done so \u2014 including Trump earlier this year and again this week.\nYesterday the president not only recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, but set in process an embassy move that could spark a surge of anti-American violence in the Muslim world. It could fuel post-ISIS terrorism and strengthen Iran. Trump seems oblivious to pleas this week by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and by close Arab allies such as King Abdullah II of Jordan \u2014 and Saudi King Salman, whom Trump considers his new best bud in battling Tehran.\nMost strange, Trump seems determined to abort any Kushner peace deal before it is born.\nPerhaps the president \u2014 in his determination to please his Christian evangelical backers \u2014 just doesn\u2019t understand Jerusalem geography. So here\u2019s a little background on why this issue is so explosive.\nJerusalem has always been holy to the Jewish people. But when the United Nations approved a plan to divide Mandate Palestine into one Palestinian and one Jewish state, it called for the internationalization of Jerusalem \u2014 because of its holiness to 3 billion people of three faiths.\nArab nations rejected the U.N. plan and invaded Mandate Palestine, but Israel triumphed, occupying the west side of the city, where it established its capital. Jordan occupied East Jerusalem and the Old City, including the Western Wall, holy to Jews, and the Temple Mount \u2014 holy to both Jews and Muslims.\nDuring the 1967 war, Israel won control of all Jerusalem. But \u2014 and here\u2019s the key \u2014 since 1967, Israel has annexed the Arab areas of Eastern Jerusalem as well as the Old City \u2014 with its holy sites. It has also annexed chunks of adjacent West Bank Palestinian areas, all of which are now included into the Jewish capital.\nYet, if there ever is to be an Israel-Palestine peace, the Palestinians will want their capital to be in the Arab parts of East Jerusalem. And some arrangement will have to be made about control of Jerusalem\u2019s holy sites that satisfies both Jews and Arabs.\nIn recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, Trump is effectively endorsing the position of the current Israeli government, which insists that none of its capital city should revert to Palestinian control.

Mitt Romney.\nI have seen the future of American populism, and it\u2019s an angry lunatic with bad hair ranting about Mormons.\nHaving watched his appearance at a Roy Moore event Monday night, I\u2019m done listening to Trump fans and Breitbart readers telling me Steve Bannon is a genius. No. Steve Bannon is bat-snot crazy. And his idiotic, insulting attack on Mitt Romney and his family is part of an insane effort to transform the Stupid Party into the Crazy One.\nTrust me, Republicans: Stick with stupid. It\u2019s in your wheelhouse.\nThere are plenty of good reasons to criticize Mitt Romney. I know, because I enumerated them regularly on the AnyoneButMitt.com website during the 2012 GOP primary. Romney represents exactly the sort of Establishment/Squish Republicanism \u2014 timid pseudo-conservatives who never faced a fight they couldn\u2019t run away from \u2014 that I\u2019ve spent my life as a conservative commentator opposing.\nBut as a guy who\u2019s never going to make Mitt and Ann\u2019s Christmas card list, I can say with absolute certainty that when it comes to character, Mitt Romney makes Roy Moore look like a smarmy, lecherous buffoon.\nActually, smarmy lecherous buffoons shuffle away from Bannon\u2019s \u201chero,\u201d Moore, aka the Alabama Ass-Grabber, the Tuscaloosa Teen Toucher, the Bible-Thumping Baby-Sitter Bopper from Birmingham. Moore has no respect for the law (he got booted from his state Supreme Court post twice for all the parts of \u201cillegal\u201d he didn\u2019t understand), no credibility and no character.\nThe same night Moore\u2019s campaign was attacking his (alleged) victims as \u201cliars,\u201d one of them found a graduation card he had signed while they were dating. She was in high school. He was a 34-year-old lawyer. He says they never met.\nThe card says \u201cHappy graduation Debbie. I wanted to give you this card myself \u2026 Roy.\u201d\nIn other words, there is no comparison between the basic human decency of Mitt Romney and the hands-y hypocrisy of Moore. Attacking a good guy like Mitt and defending a sleazeball like Moore at the same time the headlines are full of sexual harassment stories is political malpractice.\nOr insane.\nYou know what else is insane? Attacking Romney for his Mormon beliefs. Oh, yeah, there\u2019s a winning strategy: Let\u2019s make the GOP the anti-religion party!\nYes, Romney served as a Mormon missionary during Vietnam. Meanwhile Donald Trump was deferred from military service five times so he could wage the \u201cBattle For The Super Model\u2019s Undergarments\u201d on the frontlines of Manhattan\u2019s nightclub scene.\nBannon called serving as a missionary \u201chiding behind his religion.\u201d I wonder how many faithful Christians who\u2019ve done mission work or supported it would consider it \u201chiding\u201d \u2014 as opposed to answering the call of their faith.\nAnd this Bannon goes after the kids? Even if you are twisted enough to attack Mitt\u2019s faith, how do you drag his five sons into this? Yes, it\u2019s true, as Bannon said, that none of them have served in the military. That gives them something in common with more than 90 percent of the people in their age group. Fewer than 8 percent of all Americans have served in the military. Are 92 percent of Americans cowards? Unpatriotic?\nWhy would Steve Bannon go after Mitt\u2019s sons? Is it because Roy Moore only goes after daughters?\nTurning the GOP into the party of Trump, Bannon and Roy Moore may feel good to the Talk-Right fringe, but as a long-term strategy for winning, it\u2019s totally nuts.\nMichael Graham writes regularly for the Boston Herald.

to be dotted and the T\u2019s still have to be crossed as the details are finalised but the big picture remains the same at Ibrox. \nSix weeks on from the sacking of Pedro Caixinha, the Rangers board have made their move for Derek McInnes as they attempt to bring the process to a long-awaited conclusion. \nMcInnes will know exactly what he is walking in to if he puts pen-to-paper and clinches a return to Rangers in the coming days. \nHere, SportTimes looks at the issues the 46-year-old will face when if he assumes control and accepts the mission of bringing success back to Ibrox. \nRead more: Rangers close in on Derek McInnes after Aberdeen boss holds talks over his Pittodrie future \nRELATIONSHIPS \nBoth McInnes and Stewart Milne, the Aberdeen chairman, have previously spoken about the importance of the rapport between them and how it was key to the Dons\u2019 success in recent years. \nThat bond may have been stretched in recent days but McInnes will now look to replicate a similar situation at Ibrox. It is a matter of who that will be with, though. \nMcInnes has never worked under a Director of Football before and could be seen as more of a manager, in the traditional sense, than a Head Coach. \nSo the demarcation lines between he and Mark Allen must be made clearly. Allen has had a key role in the recruitment process in recent weeks and the working relationship that he forms with McInnes will be crucial going forward. \nRead more: Rangers must back Derek McInnes in the transfer market if he becomes new Ibrox boss, says Kris Boyd\u200b \nBoth are ultimately working towards the same goal and with the same targets in mind but they will need to share a philosophy when it comes to player identification, the youth department and the scouting structure. \nAllen will be the first point of contact for McInnes on all football matters, with the former Manchester City academy chief then reporting to Managing Director Stewart Robertson. \nUltimately, every major decision will be run by Dave King and the trust and backing of the chairman will be significant for McInnes. \nKing had differing relationships with Mark Warburton and Caixinha and he will hope to strike up a far more successful alliance with the next man in the dugout. \nSQUAD \nThe group of players that McInnes will inherit is of a greater strength and depth than the one that he leaves behind at Pittodrie. \nBut it is still some way off being capable of challenging at the top of the Premiership and it will need further surgery sooner rather than later. \nGraeme Murty has shown in recent weeks that it is possible to get more out of the players that underperformed and underachieved during Caixinha\u2019s reign and McInnes will hope he can improve the squad individually and collectively. \nRead more: Derek McInnes is the man to transform Rangers' fortunes, says St Johnstone stopper Joe Shaughnessy\u200b \nEveryone on the books will see the new era as a clean slate and a chance to impress but some have more ground to make up than others and even a change in the dugout won\u2019t be enough to prolong their Ibrox careers. \nWith the January transfer window just weeks away, time is of the essence for Rangers and McInnes will hope to quickly establish who he can work with and who will be allowed to leave. \nBUDGETS \nRangers have seen little return for their considerable outlays over the last two years and that must change if they are to close the gap to Celtic on and off the park. \nKing has already stated that funds will be made available to strengthen the squad but only time will tell how much cash McInnes feels is required next month and how much is saved for the summer transfer window. \nThe money at his disposal, both in terms of fees and wages, will increase several fold and McInnes will now be able to shop in a different market than the one he scoured at Aberdeen. \nMcInnes will be well aware of what is needed to get the Gers up to standard and will expect the Light Blues hierarchy to sign the big cheques as and when required. \nRead more: Rangers close in on Derek McInnes after Aberdeen boss holds talks over his Pittodrie future \nRECRUITMENT \nThe Ibrox board can\u2019t be faulted for backing both Warburton and Caixinha with significant funds but the strategy in the market can be questioned. \nIt would be no surprise to see McInnes operate a safety-first approach to the next stage of the rebuild. The likes of Kenny McLean and Louis Moult would certainly improve the Ibrox squad for relatively low outlays. \nThe new scouting structure implemented by Allen will be tasked with uncovering talent at both home and abroad but McInnes has already shown that he is a shrewd operator in the transfer market. \nHe will have the final say on all incomings but he will have to work with Allen to identify the characteristics of what he expects in a player. His knowledge of the club and Scottish football will certainly prove useful here. \nINFRASTRUCTURE \nMuch of this will come under Allen\u2019s remit and the appointment of Andy Scoulding as Head of Scouting was an important step for the Welshman. \nNine-in-a-row hero John Brown will scout the domestic market, while Dave Swanick will scour Europe for players and Billy McLaren will search for youngsters to bring into the Auchenhowie Academy. \nRead more: Rangers must back Derek McInnes in the transfer market if he becomes new Ibrox boss, says Kris Boyd\u200b \nRangers have invested in the youth system in recent years and Craig Mulholland is likely to be left to continue with his blueprint for the future. It remains to be seen if Under-20s boss Murty will have a role at first team level, though. \nMcInnes will inherit a significant backroom team and behind the scenes staff but will have the resources to bring his own people on board if required. \nRESULTS \nThe appointment of McInnes hasn\u2019t been universally popular with supporters but the former Light Blues midfielder will get the backing of the Ibrox crowd from the off. \nThe win for Murty\u2019s side at Pittodrie on Sunday was the first of seven fixtures the Gers will play this month and McInnes will have to hit the ground running if he is to pull away from the Dons. \nRangers won\u2019t be expected to challenge Celtic for the title but the Old Firm clash in a couple of weeks gives McInnes a chance to get a big game win under his belt early on. \nAMBITIONS \nThe goals for the remainder of the campaign are twofold for Rangers. The first objective is to finish best of the rest in the Premiership and the other is to mount a serious challenge for the Scottish Cup. \nNeither should be beyond the Gers in the coming months and ending the season with a bit of momentum will be crucial to allow McInnes to gear up for the Europa League qualifiers and his first full crack at the top flight.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st johnstone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graeme murty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billy mclaren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derek mcinnes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcinnes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kris boyd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warburton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stewart robertson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caixinha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louis moult", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe shaughnessy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig mulholland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenny mclean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kris boyd\u200b  rangers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedro caixinha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave swanick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy scoulding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stewart milne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark warburton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "light blues", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester city academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auchenhowie academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europa league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rangers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittodrie", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ibrox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittodrie", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:57.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "713bb0fcaf2b59f0e3afe8560a428bea58bf44f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTQY.gRDA6k9Whd54VYTLwvaGJAu0JAUf4H9D7mVyheHlsV4IE1v6.M7zHv6QOVhxsjMoWbxQQyd1MtypL_ResbVXWhOFjuEnz.vvcTyUFNhQ2y9dnqLEIfUI6CDQb.a.0IOQ8WO7aXQNOZrQ5saV9F9FLLW45K2sKA15CMvvWoiGkdnRwTni3ZBKFW5p5V.B4-", "site_full": "www.itsecuritynews.info", "site": "itsecuritynews.info", "site_section": "https://www.itsecuritynews.info", "site_categories": ["hacking", "tech"], "section_title": "IT Security News", "title": "Don\u2019t Be Fooled By Malware Signed with Stolen Certificates \u2013 How Intezer Analyze\u2122 Detects Major Breaches in Security", "title_full": "Don\u2019t Be Fooled By Malware Signed with Stolen Certificates \u2013 How Intezer Analyze\u2122 Detects Major Breaches in Security", "published": "2017-12-07T12:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "713bb0fcaf2b59f0e3afe8560a428bea58bf44f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTQY.gRDA6k9Whd54VYTLwvaGJAu0JAUf4H9D7mVyheHlsV4IE1v6.M7zHv6QOVhxsjMoWbxQQyd1MtypL_ResbVXWhOFjuEnz.vvcTyUFNhQ2y9dnqLEIfUI6CDQb.a.0IOQ8WO7aXQNOZrQ5saV9F9FLLW45K2sKA15CMvvWoiGkdnRwTni3ZBKFW5p5V.B4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ITSecurityNews", "published": "2017-12-07T12:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Don\u2019t Be Fooled By Malware Signed with Stolen Certificates \u2013 How Intezer Analyze\u2122 Detects Major Breaches in Security", "text": "Recent research conducted by the Cyber Security Research Institute (CSRI) demonstrates how easy and common it is for threat actors to purchase stolen digital certificates in order to bypass security solutions.

The NAV return of a mutual fund is one measure of return and can be different than the total return and the market return that investors realize because these products can trade at a premium or discount . BREAKING DOWN 'NAV Return' \nThe NAV return is calculated based on the daily NAV of the fund reported after the stock market\u2019s close each trading day. The NAV is a basic calculation performed by the fund\u2019s accountants. It represents the total assets minus total liabilities divided by outstanding shares. The value changes daily with the fluctuation of assets based on market value. The NAV return is a transparent accounting measure that reports the actual assets in the fund at the end of the day. Therefore, dividends , interest and capital gains distributions paid out to shareholders would not be included in the total assets unless they were reinvested. \nThe total return of a mutual fund provides a performance figure that includes distribution payouts. Therefore, it accounts for distributions associated with the fund that are paid out to shareholders regardless of whether or not these distributions are reinvested in the total assets of the fund. Distribution payouts are the primary reason an investor will see variations in NAV versus total return. \nInvestment funds that trade on exchanges with daily pricing, such as closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds, may also have a market price and a market return. Funds trading in real time with a market price can incur a market premium or discount that causes their market return to vary from the NAV return. Funds trading above their NAV are said to trade at a premium. Funds trading below their NAV are trading at a discount. Premiums and discounts may occur due to the real time valuations of securities in the fund versus their daily NAV. Funds typically trade close to their NAV with some deviation. If a fund varies excessively from its NAV then authorized participants may intervene to help correct the price. NAV Return and Fund Performance Reporting \nInvestment companies provide transparency in their fund performance reporting to help investors identify NAV return, total return and market return. Investors should monitor the returns they use to track the performance of their investments. Ensuring understanding of fund performance calculations will help an investor\u2019s due diligence and performance comparisons.

look the biggest? At the very top, you've got the guys who have spent the most time taking pictures of their dicks and probably reading and learning from all this discussion. Videos are a lot harder to get really flattering results from unless you can stick to one or two particular perspectives and not move around much. That's probably why you were less impressed by the one you mentioned. Porn stars have got it the worst as they're often expected to at least do some amount of moving around, though they do have camera guys and editors to track things. It's why a lot of the amateur \"look how massive my dick is\" clips look like the guy is locked in place with restraints. You rarely see some full body view where the guy moves and turns a lot. The ones that move at all will often just \"rotate\" from one impressive angle they've found into a second one like they marked out the locations in advance. Click to expand...

Press Release No comments Harrows are basically the agricultural tools which are used for smoothing out and breaking up the surface of soil. Harrowing is always carried out on the agricultural field to track the rough finish left by ploughing operations. The purpose of harrowing is generally to breakup lumps of soil, thereby providing a good tilth, finer finish soil structure that are suitable for seedbed use. Harrowing are also used to remove cover seed and weeds after sowing. Read Report Overview @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/harrows-market.html The rising demand for agricultural farm machinery is one of the prominent factors which is driving the harrows market demand worldwide. This is majorly supported by the growing demand for food which is expected to rise substantially owing to the significant increase in global population during the forecast period. Rising food demand has encouraged the adoption of advanced farming practices to increase crop yields which is further resulting in the demand for agricultural machinery globally. The global harrows market is driven by increasing adoption of farm machinery for mechanization of farming operations which resulted in increased production and profitability by achieving timeliness in farming operations. This in turn helps farmers in optimum utilization of costly inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, and irrigation among others. Farm mechanization also helps in the preservation of the farm produce, which further improves profitability and cost effectiveness by reducing post-harvest losses. Similarly, increasing awareness about the importance of technology in agriculture is also an important factor which is fueling the growth of the harrows market globally. This increasing awareness can be attributed to rising adoption of farm tractors and other agricultural machinery which yields high productivity gains. Moreover, Low purchasing power and high cost with low technology adoption is currently challenging the wide-scale adoption of farm machinery tools including harrows. The market growth is also inhibited by growing urbanization and decreasing farmlands. In order to counter this restraint, governments worldwide are promoting and encouraging the adoption of farm machinery tools by providing subsidies on this equipment, thereby allowing manufacturers to offer the equipment at lower rates. The global harrows market can be segmented on the basis of types, and various geographical regions. Based on different harrows types, the market has been segmented into disc harrow, chain harrow, tine harrow, and chain disk harrows. Based on various geographical regions, the market is classified into North America, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, and Latin America. In Asia Pacific, countries such as India and China are witnessing the shift in overall population. Growing population is responsible for increasing food demand in Asia Pacific, which in turn will fuel the demand for harrows for effective farm production in this region. In North America, rising need for enhanced productivity is also one of the major factors that are triggering the market growth. Likewise, in European countries such as Germany, governments are offering subsidies on agriculture and farm machinery, to promote the use of technology in farm production. This is further reinforced by increasing technical expertise, intense competition, and the presence of a large domestic market is expected to boost the harrows sales in Europe.

All photographs: Kind courtesy Yourstory.com Most artists and creative minds dream of jamming it with like-minded doers and go-getters, but creating such an opportunity and experience doesn't always come easy. \nIf you are someone who's looking for one such experience, then Experience Co. may be the place for you. \nThe creators of Experience Co. reassessed how travel and network is perceived in the country. \nIn attempt to redefine travel they came up with the Beach House Project and the Roadtrip Experience Project -- two initiatives that are new-age conversation and collaboration spaces that bring influencers and movement creators together to connect, collaborate and create while traveling. Shooting a 500-year-old martial art form. \nGathering doers, creators and influencers \nJaytirth Ahya is the founder and the brains behind The ExCo. \nWith an aim to bring influencers, culture-shifters and movement creators together to associate, collaborate and create while voyaging, Jaytirth set up The ExCo in 2014. \nHe dreamed of a community of ever-growing eclectic storytellers, musicians, entrepreneurs, influencers, go-getters and the trendsetters in an effort to be sustainable and generate impact. \n\"When we launched the first Road Trip Experience Project, it started with a question. \n\"But after the first project, it became very evident to us that there are more spaces that are required to bring people together -- people who will never meet otherwise because they do not belong to the same skillset or geography,\" Jaytirth says. \n\"But it is essential for these individuals to meet each other and talk about things that will help them grow, see new perspectives and make them better at what they do,\" the 27-year-old adds. The joy of painting walls of homes! \nHe is an experience designer by profession and previously travelled with 100+ creators and networkers. \nSpecialising in creating experiences for artists, planners, producers and entrepreneurs, the idea remains the same -- bringing them together and enabling independent conversations. \nJay remarks that figuring out ways to enable conversations and collaborations in a creative ecosystem was not an easy task. \nIn the conversation, Jay reveals how intricate and lengthy the logistics and the planning get. \nAt the same time, the process of inducting people on every experience is a sensitive task. \nThe location, projects and potential collaborations all follow up, all being equally demanding in their own merit. A jam session in progress. \nJay adds, \"Conversations can happen for sure. I believe in that. \n\"Seeing potential in the creator's perspective and finding inspiration to make it a reality is what Experience Co. strives to achieve.\" \nPeople who envision new, great ideas or cultivate passions that are old, people looking for new direction or overcoming a creative block -- our experiences are cut out for the new-gen hustler. \nJay credits a great deal of his understanding to the invaluable efforts put in by his team and the team is a magnetic one. \nWith analytical thinkers, chroniclers, revolutionary designers and muralists -- Charan GP, Kritika Hora, Tanya Gupta, Poornima Sukumar, Priyanka Nagarajan, Adrita Das and Drishti Sharma, along with Jay himself are devoted to build conversations and document journeys, to make things happen. \nThe offerings \nWalking us through Experience Co. Jay talks about it's primary offerings -- The Beach House Project (BHX) and The Roadtrip Experience Project (RTX). \nRoadtrip Experience is better understood as the most worthwhile handshakes across geographies, skill sets, exchanging inspiration, explorations with a knack for giving back to the community. \n\"BHX, meanwhile, is for the entrepreneur indulging on a brain vacation. \n\"It creates spaces of entrepreneurs to grow their business and have conversations in a laid back beach house while exchanging perspectives, challenging the known, sharing inspiration and most essentially learning from each others' successes and failures,\" says Jay. \nOver the next two years, Experience Co. aims to create more experiential and collaborative properties, writing residencies, village experience projects, among others. \nThis is done in an attempt to find new ways to connect various kinds of creators and doers, document and impact the local life positively and enable conversations as they proceed. Participants gather for a photo during one of the trips. \nA look at the projects \nExCo. did their first RoadTrip Experience project in August 2014, in Spiti and Lahaul, and their first Beach House Project in September, 2016 at Goa. \nTill date, the ExCo, has done three RoadTrip Experience Projects and four Beach House Projects, with the last one in Goa in September, 2017. \nThe next Beach House Project is slated to begin on December 17, 2017, at a 19th century British bungalow in the hill station Kumaon, Uttar Pradesh. \nThe cost to attend will be \u00e2\u0082\u0161 38,999, which includes stay for a week, food, workshops and activities throughout the week, including apple picking, orchard walks, jam making sessions, stargazing sessions with telescopes. \nOver the past three years, they have had over 130 attendees and done seven projects to date. \nThe ExCo has 100+ collaborators currently as part of its community. \n\"We are proud to be part of over 50 collaborations over the years. \n\"To give you a sense of the kind of collaborations we have created in the past within our community: we have created four soundtracks, two giant murals, revived an old beach house affected by tsunami, shot three documentaries, created photo projects of over 500+ pictures and worked with over five different brands including The Roadster Project,\" says Priyanka Nagarajan, one of the curators at ExCo.

In essence, it\u2019s a deeply rich fruit mixture heavy on the fruit and steeped in rum or brandy. Thick and dense, they bake for up to four hours on a low heat, which is a nice long time for the smell to permeate the house. We love it.\n\nI come from a family of British immigrants to New Zealand, and despite the fact we have summer in the festive season, my parents continued the tradition of the \u201cChristmas Cake.\u201d I have raised my boys with our own version of the family tradition. At the end of November, my kids and I don our aprons and head into the kitchen for the labour of love.\n\nI think the secret to a good result is in soaking the fruit in orange juice and rum or brandy overnight. In the old English style, the ratio of dried fruit to flour is about four to one. Typically, there will be raisins, currants, sultanas and chopped dates. Most recipes call for glace cherries and crystallised ginger, but, as I\u2019m not fond of these ingredients, I like to add chopped dried apricots and figs and extra blanched almonds.\n\nThis year, my boys and I came up with a fun idea for a crafty gift. We only used half the batter for the traditional rectangular cake, which will be iced closer to Christmas with brandy butter icing.\n\nThe other half of the batter, we fashioned into rough balls and baked in muffin tins. In this form, they take half the time, roughly two to two and a half hours at a low heat. They form a nice firm ball. Once cool, we dusted them lightly with sifted icing sugar.\n\nWe wrapped the individual balls in baking paper, making neat little parcels with cotton gift ties.\n\nI had been collecting gift boxes and tins from the thrift stores the last few weeks. We wrapped the paper parcels in cellophane wrap to ensure they will stay fresh as long as possible and divided the balls between the tins and boxes.\n\nWe wrote a personalised message on a gift tag inside each lid.\n\nWe tied a ribbon on each box and there you have it, our Christmas Cake Balls as a gift you can make with your kids and give away at this year.\n\nDo you make your own gifts or have your own crafting traditions at this time of year? If so, let us know! \n\nTalk to you later.\nKeep on Creating!\nYvette K.

Equity participation may involve the purchase of shares through options or by allowing partial ownership in exchange for financing. The greater the equity participation rate , the higher the percentage of shares owned by stakeholders. Allowing stakeholders to own shares ties the stakeholders' success with that of the company or real estate investment. In this case, a more profitable company will provide stakeholders with greater gains . BREAKING DOWN 'Equity Participation' \nEquity participation is used in many investments for two primary reasons. First, it is used to tie the financial rewards of executives to the fate of the company, increasing the likelihood that executives will make decisions that will improve company profitability. This type of compensation may be delayed, reducing the possibility of executives making short-term decisions to boost share price. Workers, not just executives, can also be offered equity by companies as a form of employee retention and work incentive. This typically is in addition to base salary and bonuses they receive. Effects of Equity Participation \nAs with executives who receive equity, the intent is to encourage employees to contribute their best efforts towards the long-term growth and prosperity of the organization. The equity held by executives and employees can come with additional stipulations regarding how the shares may be converted, sold, or transferred. Different types of equity such as options, reserve, phantoms stock, preferred stock, or common stock, may be issued if a company wants to create varied layers to the equity participation program offered to employees. Even with those potential benefits, the way a company makes equity participation available can have unintended consequences, such as exposing employees to new tax liabilities. \nA second reason for equity participation is it can be used by companies operating in emerging economies in which local governments want to reap the rewards brought on by development. Moreover, share ownership also allows local governments a say in company decisions. Residents of a municipality might also be offered equity stakes in the development or redevelopment of their hometown. For instance, after New Orleans was devastated by Hurricane Katrina and the ensuing floods, there were proposals to grant displaced residents equity in the revenue generated from the redevelopment of their neighborhoods.
