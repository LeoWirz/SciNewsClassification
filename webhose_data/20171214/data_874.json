The price of bitcoin, which crossed $12,000 less than 12 hours ago, has set a new record high by surpassing $13,000. At 19:46 UTC, the cryptocurrency was trading at $13,020.29, an increase of 11.30% in the last 24 hours. For those keeping count, bitcoin\u2019s price has jumped by $3,000 in less than a week. After spending most of last week shedding gains, the cryptocurrency geared up for a massive upward trajectory last Friday by flying past the $10,000 mark again. (See also: Bitcoin Price Reverses Course After CME Sets Futures Trading Date .) It was a fast and furious ride toward the next record. Monero and IOTA are still trending upward among the top 10 most-traded cryptocurrencies even as others have registered declines. The former is up by 17% and the latter rose by 19.16%. The overall cryptocurrency market was worth $378.5 billion at 19:56 UTC today. Most news reports attribute the surge in bitcoin\u2019s price this week to decisions by two prominent Chicago futures exchanges to introduce bitcoin futures trading soon. Last Friday, CME announced that it would begin bitcoin futures trading on its exchange on December 18, while the CBOE said Sunday that it was planning to begin bitcoin futures trading on its exchange on December 10. (See also: CBOE To Start Futures Trading On Dec. 10 .) At a conference yesterday, NYSE\u2019s owner said they might have been \u201cstupid\u201d to miss the chance at being the first to introduce bitcoin futures. Futures trading is expected to pave the way for entry of institutional money into bitcoin trading. In turn, this is expected to stabilize the cryptocurrency\u2019s volatile price movements. Enthusiasm from traders in South Korea might also be a reason for bitcoin\u2019s rapid rise in the last 24 hours. The U.S. dollar has dominated in a majority of transactions involving cryptocurrencies, except bitcoin. According to data from Coinmarketcap.com, the Korean won accounted for a majority of bitcoin trades in the last 24 hours. A Bloomberg article quotes a psychology professor at Seoul National University as saying that a shared border with an increasingly belligerent North Korea, coupled with local political turmoil, has driven South Koreans to the cryptocurrency. The government earlier this week formed a task force to review speculation in the cryptocurrency markets. (See also: Why South Korean Bitcoin Price Is $1,000 Over Global Price ). Miners have also shifted their resources to bitcoin mining from bitcoin cash, its rival currency. The spiraling bitcoin price has increased block rewards , which is helping them make profits even though the average amount of fees per block has increased.

The market has been segmented on the basis of parts, application and geography. On the basis of parts the fluid handling systems market can be segmented into seven categories; flow meters, pump skids, pumps, valves, meter systems, fire pump systems and fire pumps. The market on the basis of application can be divided into chemicals, oil and gas, power generation, marine, mining, fire pumps, wastewater management, food and beverage, and pharmaceuticals among others. Based on geography, the market has been divided into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa and Latin America. \nThe global fluid handling systems market is mainly driven due to the continuous research and development activities taking place which has improved the cost effectiveness and productivity. Installation of new pipelines and building of terminals and storage facilities pertaining to the oil and gas industry will further boost the market growth of the fluid handling systems market. Moreover, the demand for fluid handling systems will also be on the high as a result of the expansion and exploration of new refineries in various regions such as Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Latin America. For example, recent discoveries of large oil and gas sources off the coast of Brazil have brought increased investment activities to the region Furthermore; increasing investments in the power sector as a result of the undergoing structural changes due to environmental regulations will further propel the demand for fluid handling systems in the North America region. On account of changing economic and regulatory factors, the mining industry in Australia and Latin America is expected to show sustained growth which will further drive the market for fluid handling systems. In pharmaceutical industry of Asia Pacific region, demand for fluid handling systems is expected to increase during the forecast period. Request For Report Sample@ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=11156 \nHowever, one of the major restraints hampering the growth of the fluid handling systems market is the stiff competition being offered by the local manufacturers to the established manufacturers. The fluid handling systems being produced by the local manufacturers are often poor in quality as it comes at a lower price point. Due to its price being low, a lot of companies are opting for them and hence possessing a threat to the established players. \nIncreasing investments in the shale gas sector will act as strong opportunity for the growth of the fluid handling during the forecast period. Industrialization drive in the Asia Pacific region will further attract investments. Moreover, long-term mining and mineral project activity in the Latin America region will further create opportunities for the market to grow. Recent trends have shown that rising demand for efficient value chain for drug manufacturing has resulted various Multinational Corporations (MNC) deploying sophisticated fluid handling systems. \nSome of the key players operating in the fluid handling systems market are Shelton Fluid Technology, Fluid Handling Systems Inc., Ingersoll Rand LLC, Anestiwata Corporation, Flowserve Corporation, Metso Corporation, Pentair Plc, Crane Fluid Inc, Flowtech Industries L.L.P, Entegris Inc., Boyser S.R.L and Graco Inc. among others.

The violent crime rate is irrelevant. The gun crime rate is and as yet I can't find that anyone collects those stats.\n2.

Common topics for news reports include war, politics, and business, as well as athletic contests, quirky or unusual events, and the doings of celebrities. Government proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news from elsewhere, which they satisfy by traveling and talking to each other. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content.

BREAKING DOWN 'Free Reserves' \nUnder fractional reserve banking, commercial banks only hold a limited amount of their total funds in a liquid form at any given time. In other words, not all deposits are kept on hand in cash; most are lent out or otherwise invested. U.S. federal law requires banks to hold a certain portion of their funds in cash vaults or in Federal Reserve Bank accounts. Excess reserves , on which the Fed pays interest, are reserves that exceed these requirements. Borrowed reserves are those that banks borrow from each other out of excess reserves deposited at the Fed; the interest rate for these loans is the benchmark federal funds rate . \nSubtracting borrowed reserves from excess reserves yields a bank's free reserves, which are available to be lent out. \nMore free reserves a mean more available bank credit , which in theory lowers the cost of borrowing and leads to inflationary pressures. Free reserves rose to unprecedented levels following the financial crisis, when the Fed offered to pay interest on banks' excess reserves. This development coincided with an unprecedented cut in the federal funds rate to near-zero, but these policies have not spurred inflation because of a prevailing deflationary environment. The increase in Fed liabilities caused by rising free reserves has been more than balanced out by the assets the Fed created through quantitative easing .

Both wild swine were captured by police within 90 minutes after they were shot with tranquilizers. ...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "japanese school", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "higashiyama junior and senior high school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kyoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:02.119+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "907042fdb550f50a94775136b8f4298d4bc465b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhRi9rUVe42r28LWebNy8kOUQQS1J4.rTRukbBdfoPKI88VfWZ8gp7in9T3pCEo637bgtqTJB7q7xH69PNA0eyvlNsSnQxF80EgxsCwYFaouHB7nTuhVanPIe3sM1lf1kKG12MMjqNfcOpB8Mpp.oiEmSCmkUTvk6Y9gE6kP4vXnyNrc8Z88Nz2Y", "site_full": "www.chennaiclassic.com", "site": "chennaiclassic.com", "site_section": "http://www.chennaiclassic.com/feed/1/posts", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "Chennai  - ChennaiClassic.com", "title": "Hiring for Hardware & Network Engineer Bengaluru, Chennai for Exp. 1 - 2 Years at Magna Infotech Pvt (Chennai Job)", "title_full": "Hiring for Hardware & Network Engineer Bengaluru, Chennai for Exp. 1 - 2 Years at Magna Infotech Pvt (Chennai Job)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 64302, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "907042fdb550f50a94775136b8f4298d4bc465b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhRi9rUVe42r28LWebNy8kOUQQS1J4.rTRukbBdfoPKI88VfWZ8gp7in9T3pCEo637bgtqTJB7q7xH69PNA0eyvlNsSnQxF80EgxsCwYFaouHB7nTuhVanPIe3sM1lf1kKG12MMjqNfcOpB8Mpp.oiEmSCmkUTvk6Y9gE6kP4vXnyNrc8Z88Nz2Y", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hiring for Hardware & Network Engineer Bengaluru, Chennai for Exp. 1 - 2 Years at Magna Infotech Pvt (Chennai Job)", "text": "Hiring for Hardware & Network Engineer Bengaluru, Chennai for Exp. 1 - 2 Years at Magna Infotech Pvt (Chennai Job) Reply to: (Not Shown) (Please mention ChennaiClassic.com when contacting) Job Description: Experience required : Minimum 6 Month to 2 yrs JD:- Good knowledge in Windows XP,7,8,8.1,10 Server-2008\\2012 Computer assembling and maintenance.

Then this wagering tragedy happened...\nDerrick Henry is the CLOSER! #TitanUp pic.twitter.com/WeLkxCMwvm\n\u2014 Tennessee Titans (@Titans) December 3, 2017 Utterly incredible, and reason number one million that gambling is both the best and worst thing ever. (Also, the fact that this went unnoticed by the CBS announce team is a travesty! Get on the ball, Gumbel and Green!) Of course, I had the Titans as one of my best bets, so I can only cry so much for all of you that didn't. That win got me to a mediocre \"tread water\" mark of 3-3 on the week last week.\nSo that video clip is my personal reminder that I need to do better for all of you! So let's try to do just that. Here are this weekend's pick, all NFL games with the college regular season all wrapped up....\nJets PICK EM over BRONCOS\nI always like to say that the NFL season needs to be evaluated in segments. Sure, the Broncos won three games earlier this season, but they are on an eight-game losing streak now, and are quite possibly the worst team in all of football to back from a wagering standpoint. Hell, at least the Browns covered a 13-point spread in Los Angeles last weekend against the Chargers! More specifically, at least the Browns are 3-9 ATS this season \u2014 the Broncos are 2-9-1! The Jets are no great shakes on the road this year against the number (just 1-3-1), but if you're asking me if I think the Jets, who play HARD under head coach Todd Bowles, are better than the Broncos right now, there is no hesitation. They absolutely are. The Broncos are near rock bottom, with more room to fall.\nCARDINALS +2.5 over Titans\nMy biggest takeaway from the Texans-Titans game last weekend was this \u2014 the Tennessee Titans might be the worst 8-4 team in the history of the NFL. Their offense is a big nothing, Marcus Mariota is overrated at quarterback, and their defense gave up 368 yards passing to Tom Savage and just two healthy wide receivers. The Cardinals are 5-7 SU on the season, but they're pretty good at home, especially against AFC teams, going 8-1 against AFC foes at home since the start of the 2013 season. I can't believe I'm backing Blaine Gabbert here, but if Vegas is going to give me points at home just because the Titans have a hollow 8-4 record, I thank them.\nRedskins +6 over CHARGERS\nI got sucked into the Chargers' vortex last weekend. Yeah, I know they won, and now they're 6-6 after starting the season 0-4, but I should have known better than laying big points with them in what amounts to a home field with zero advantage, even against the Browns. The Chargers tend to play to the level of whoever the opponent is, and as I envision this game, I see a back and forth shootout. Washington has been solid in traveling to the West Coast this season, with road wins over the Rams and Seahawks, and I think they bounce back from the Thursday night thumping from the Cowboys last week with a spirited effort. The extra few days rest will help, too.\nRAMS +2.5 over Eagles\nThis is a situational play here, with the Eagles having to play a second West Coast road game in two weeks, and coming off a physical battle against the Seahawks on Sunday night this past weekend. The Eagles are a league best 9-3 ATS this season, but the Rams are right behind them at 8-4 ATS. I was a little surprised the Eagles were favored in this game, quite honestly. In almost any other scenario, I'd back the Eagles regardless of number in a \"bounce back\" situation, but on the road against the Rams isn't one of them, as I think Rams head coach Sean McCoy's familiarity with Philly from his Redskins days will come in handy, too.\nSeahawks +3 over JAGUARS\nOn the flip side of this past Sunday night's Eagles-Seahawks game is Seattle, who seemed to send their reminder to the NFL world that they aren't going away, despite injuries decimating their secondary. I think there are quarterbacks out there who will make Seattle pay, especially on the road, for missing multiple defensive backs, Jacksonville is not one of them. Blake Bortles is 2-12 both SU and ATS agains NFC teams since he was drafted in 2014, and the Seahawks are actually 4-0 SU on the road in their last four road games, On this day of dogs, I will continue to take the points!\nSTEELERS -7 over Ravens\nWith the Steelers coming off one of the most brutally physical games in recent history against Cincinnati on Monday night, I really wanted to take the points here. However, the Steelers have dominated the AFC North, going 8-1 in their last nine games. They're also 8-1 in their last nine games at home in prime time, and they are now 15-1 in their last 16 December games. The Ravens have lost their best cornerback for the season, and Joe Flacco seems to be a little too comfortable for a guy who is still wildly overrated....\npic.twitter.com/zA0C4BrD83\n\u2014 (@trashydrakefan) December 3, 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.co/zA0C4BrD83", "https://twitter.com/trashydrakefan/status/937461840661110784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://t.co/WeLkxCMwvm", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/TitanUp?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/Titans/status/937433210954268672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sean pendergast", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jack gorman", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gumbel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean mccoy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe flacco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blake bortles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom savage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derrick henry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "todd bowles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus mariota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blaine gabbert", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nfl football", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "redskins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chargers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "browns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chargers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eagles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broncos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eagles-seahawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardinals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "titans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seahawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cowboys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steelers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ravens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee titans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broncos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cincinnati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacksonville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:03.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8086cce502f8a7ba84e2ff7ae65b0fa2e62952bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMs28el7uyTmhYNRZjjTuZHjsEWWanzDTLq8COMnCC.Qys9FjtPndIdMIUdmiVSoU8BHLnlgAx9UwCtr4iwBViHpA24JGLekTAD5_qcGQrAn0Q--", "site_full": "viewfrommypew.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://viewfrommypew.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The View From Here", "title": "\u201cChristmas is a necessity.

I'll not decode that sentiment, but, I think most know what I am talking about. I wished I hadn't said that. Because I'm pretty sure I don't always know what I am talking about. At any rate, I do want to wish each and everyone a wonderfully blessed and productive day, here on this Thursday, December 7, 2017 . Many will recognize today because it is a day of remembrance of the surprise attack by the Japanese on the US fleet moored at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in 1941. I remember growing up there were oodles of people who would immediately tell me where they were when they got the news about this deadly attack. I'm sure I could find some today but they are surely passing off the scene. It's like my generation and the assassination of President Kennedy. We all remember exactly where we were when we got that news. For my boys, it's most likely the devastating September 11, 2001, terror attacks against our nation. Observing dates that commemorate key events in our nation's history help us to connect the dots of our development. I do know that many families were impacted by the attack on Pearl Harbor and I pause to remember the lives lost and those left to pick up the pieces. May God bless them and may God bless America is my prayer. Amen .\n\nOur appearance this past Tuesday evening as Santa and Mrs. Claus at the Chick-fil-A in Magnolia, Texas, was highlighted by a set-aside time to deal with special needs children. The manager there coordinated with the parents in their cars to bring in the child at a particular time. Several ended up having to cancel but our first little guy was dealing with leukemia. Another not only had autism but was also highly susceptible to illnesses. Then we had a special young lady who we have known since she was born. She has an aggressive form of autism. I still remember the first time they brought her to see Santa back in 2010. (Photo) They didn't know how she would react. She immediately ran over, grabbed hold of me and wouldn't let go. She loved us back then and she still does today. On Tuesday, the restaurant was packed. Literally. Standing room only. The hyped up kids were lined up and biting at the bit. Yet, the parents were able to contain them while we showered some special attention on these special kids. Those waiting are to be commended because we were able to bring some momentary joy to these families. The outstanding studio photographer we work with each year sent me a note the other day. She is planning a similar in-studio day for next year where special needs kids can come and have their portraits made with Santa. She said she felt like we have a higher calling to show love towards these children. Santa's heart was full the other evening and it appears his eyes might be leaking a little as he writes about it today. I may need to get that checked out.\n\nI saw a posting by a fellow Santa out in California. He had been asked to tour a large children's hospital and upon leaving he had this assessment: \"First tears of the season.\" I get that. Big time! It reminds us all that we do live in a world where folks, just like you and I, are dealing with all kinds of challenges. After losing our baby sister Kayla to leukemia back in 1978, my mom became a regular supporter of The St. Jude's Children's Hospital. As a tribute to her heart for suffering children, we designated this charity at her home going and raised over $3000.00 for St. Jude's in her name. I know she would be proud. I pause to remind us all of the greatest need that all humanity shares. That being a relationship with Creator God through His provision of His one and only Son, Jesus, The Christ. We are in the midst of celebrating His very coming into our world that He might save us. I caught a video the other day of a modern group singing 'Oh Happy Day' at a very glittery celebrity event. While everyone was swaying and into the music, I don't know if they paid any attention whatsoever to the message but here are the lyrics as penned by the great musician, the Rev. Edwin Hawkins,\n\nOh happy day (oh happy day)\nOh happy day (oh happy day)\nWhen Jesus washed (when Jesus washed)\nWhen Jesus washed (when Jesus washed)\nWhen Jesus washed (when Jesus washed)\nHe washed my sins away (oh happy day)\nOh happy day (oh happy day)\n\nHe taught me how to watch, fight and pray, fight and pray\nAnd live rejoicing every, everyday\nOh happy day\nHe taught me how\n\nOh happy day (oh happy day)\nOh happy day (oh happy day)\nOh happy day (oh happy day)\n\nThey did hear the truth and that is the only way to have a truly happy day. May God bless each and every one Amen . ....More later.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eric sevareid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kayla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edwin hawkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "god", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "st. jude's children's hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. jude", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "santa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pearl harbor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magnolia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:03.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2f308cecb9d191339cfd66975e691d27b08121aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxeZmRkil5CLDTYFXQOoH6mC2OjvZF213Pv4oXaiyCOtXCcXJlzlU8nELUmjISfIEutRtEj.PplPY27atyzeM_X8VvBeHbkGjmPqkSGzQt4KcNQ3hh31VzLnK7FJWcFFq59QtWLOO5C8Q--", "site_full": "postalnews.com", "site": "postalnews.com", "site_section": "http://postalnews.com/blog/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "postalnews.com", "title": "Ohio letter carrier steals check meant for childhood cancer non-profit", "title_full": "Ohio letter carrier steals check meant for childhood cancer non-profit", "published": "2017-12-07T00:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://postalnews.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/03406cad-7f4c-4175-af9d-8ff95d8eb4a5-large16x9_ripoffalert.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2f308cecb9d191339cfd66975e691d27b08121aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxeZmRkil5CLDTYFXQOoH6mC2OjvZF213Pv4oXaiyCOtXCcXJlzlU8nELUmjISfIEutRtEj.PplPY27atyzeM_X8VvBeHbkGjmPqkSGzQt4KcNQ3hh31VzLnK7FJWcFFq59QtWLOO5C8Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brian Sheehan", "published": "2017-12-07T00:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "Ohio letter carrier steals check meant for childhood cancer non-profit", "text": "LAS VEGAS (KSNV) \u2014 An Ohio mail carrier is facing felony charges and has been suspended from work after allegedly stealing a check.

Close Food & Drink All The MTA apparently has no idea how they\u2019re going to handle the rapidly approaching L Train shutdown December 6, 2017 By Robert Lanham Leave a Comment Steve Levin at a rally in Williamsburg on Tuesday. (Todd Maisel/NY Daily News) \nAs you undoubtedly know, the City and the MTA plan to close the L Train for nearly all of 2019 and part of 2020. We\u2019re just 16 months away, and they still haven\u2019t announced how they\u2019re going to handle the 15-month closure, which will affect an estimated 200,000 to 250,000 riders. Representatives from the MTA claim they simply haven\u2019t announced their plans, but their delay is angering local business owners who haven\u2019t gotten an update since the spring . \nIn May, the DOT and the MTA briefed lawmakers on ideas for addressing the commuters affected by the shutdown, including bus-only and HOV lanes on the Williamsburg Bridge, as well as a new ferry line to run between North 6th Street in Williamsburg and East 20th Street in Manhattan. But about 70 percent of L train riders, they noted, were expected to be diverted to the J/M/Z and G lines, which would see their service increased\u2026 \u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing from DOT and the MTA is that they have plans drawn up but they aren\u2019t ready to share them with us yet,\u201d said Minna Elias, the district chief of staff for Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, whose district encompasses parts of North Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan\u2026 Austin Finan, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, denied that a finished plan exists. \nAt a press conference in Williamsburg on Tuesday, Stephen Levin took some time off from green-lighting out-of-scale building projects on the Brooklyn waterfront to argue for a dedicated bus lane : \n\u201cThere has to be a dedicated bus lane on the Williamsburg Bridge. That has to happen. That is under the control of the DOT\u201d [said Levin]. \nMemos leaked to Second Avenue Sagas in October showed that while the MTA\u2019s suggestions included \u201cbus priority across the bridge,\u201d the DOT\u2019s plans favored making the bridge HOV-3 from 5 a.m. through the evening rush hour. Charles Komanoff, a transportation economist, told the Voice that without a dedicated bus lane during the L train shutdown, the Williamsburg Bridge and the roads leading to it will be mired in chaos. \n\u201cI think that what will happen is that on the second day, people are going to jump out of the buses and they\u2019re gonna start destroying the automobiles that are making them sit in traffic,\u201d Komanoff said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I would want to see, if the authorities are so cowardly and stupid as to not create the dedicated bus lane.\u201d \nA dedicated bus lane sounds like a good solution to us, but will need to be paired with increased service on the G, J, M and Z lines. We will also need more ferry service. No matter what solutions they come up with, it\u2019s insane they aren\u2019t communicating with the closure being just over a year away.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert lanham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minna elias", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carolyn maloney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "todd maisel/ny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin finan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve levin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles komanoff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen levin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill de blasio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "levin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "komanoff", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daily news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "voice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williamsburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north 6th street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north brooklyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east 20th street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williamsburg bridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lower manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:03.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "903f21e67717ee9e74df1cfaa78dba9d28423f38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOS_5hBLgIvVFcRTPXfQcfBopMNj4QyaIHr5Ka5Drv9C7FBl.ka0ob2kiTgOnHEM0_BpGztbect7yGxWhEyJsZIUUU0pLhkvH_xbMqsiXo79V3DdZK2bqhI", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g150768-i6-Mexico.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Mexico Forum, Travel Discussion for Mexico - TripAdvisor", "title": "Using a prepaid Visa card - Cross post - Puerto Vallarta", "title_full": "Using a prepaid Visa card - Cross post - Puerto Vallarta Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-07T06:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.019, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "903f21e67717ee9e74df1cfaa78dba9d28423f38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOS_5hBLgIvVFcRTPXfQcfBopMNj4QyaIHr5Ka5Drv9C7FBl.ka0ob2kiTgOnHEM0_BpGztbect7yGxWhEyJsZIUUU0pLhkvH_xbMqsiXo79V3DdZK2bqhI", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sean C", "published": "2017-12-07T06:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "Using a prepaid Visa card - Cross post - Puerto Vallarta", "text": "Hi we are heading to PV next week and staying at the Tropicana hotel.

(Photo: AFP/ Handout/ Blue Innovation) 07 Dec 2017 05:57PM   \nTOKYO: A drone that hovers over Japanese employees and blares music to force them to go home was unveiled Thursday (Dec 7), as the country tries to reduce its notoriously long work hours. \nThe \"T-Frend\" buzzes over those trying to work late, blasting out the strains of \"Auld Lang Syne\", a Scottish tune typically used in Japan to announce that a store is closing. \n\"You can't really work when you think 'it's coming over any time now' and hear 'Auld Lang Syne' along with the buzz,\" said Norihiro Kato, a director at Taisei, an office security and cleaning firm that co-developed the system. \nThe drone is equipped with a camera, which stores footage on an SD card. Office scenes can also be monitored almost in real time from a remote location. \nThe machine recognises its location on a building floor without GPS. \nIt takes off from its port, makes a surveillance flight on a pre-set path and then returns autonomously.   \nTaisei plans to start the T-Frend service in April in collaboration with drone system developer Blue Innovation and telecoms operator NTT East. \nThe fee for the service is yet to be officially set but \"the target price\" is around 500,000 yen (US$4,500) a month, said Kato. \nT-Frend's developers are also studying the possibility of giving the drone facial recognition technology to tell who is in the office after hours or whether there is an intruder. \nAdministrative officials at many companies push overtimers out of the door but this has ironically resulted in these officials working overtime themselves, to say nothing of \"causing friction between employees\", the companies said in a statement. \nFirms have therefore turned to security companies for this task, but they have struggled to provide enough staff given a nationwide labour shortage in Japan. \nT-Frend therefore serves the twin function of reducing overtime and making up for this labour shortage, the firms claimed. \nJapan's government has been trying to change a culture in which working long hours is perceived as proof of loyalty and dedication. \nEvery year in Japan, long working hours are blamed for dozens of deaths due to strokes, heart attacks and suicides. \nIn February, the country launched the \"Premium Friday\" programme, urging employees to knock off early on the last Friday of the month with the aim of both reducing work hours and invigorating spending. \nBut the plan fell flat with many claiming the last Friday of the month is one of their busiest days.

Liar's Poker is fairly similar to the card game \"cheat.\" Players hold random dollar bills with close attention to their own bill serial number. The objective of the game is to bluff the opponents into believing that your bid does not exceed the combined sum of all of the serial numbers. \nLiar's Poker is also book by Michael Lewis that depicts the Wall Street bond trading culture at Salomon Brother's. Though the author has commented that he intended the book to be a cautionary warning about behavior and practices he found to be questionable and deceptive, he admits that some individuals have used the book as a blueprint to seek personal profit. BREAKING DOWN 'Liar's Poker' \nIn Liar's Poker, if one player bids three 4s, he predicts that within all of the dollar serial numbers held by all players, there are at least three 4s. If the player's bluff is not called, the next player must either bid a higher frequency of any other digit (five 2s) or can bid a higher number at the same frequency level (three 6s). Strategies of Liar's Poker \nThe number of players in the game can affect the probability of winning, though the game itself largely rewards and benefits those who employ deception and trickery to win. Rather than merely bid as accurately as possible, the players are taking turns at coaxing their rivals to make a mistake as they play. Under the rules that require bids to continue escalating, the stakes of the game increase as well. With more than two players, it is a frequent strategy to continue to raise the bid given the likelihood of being challenged and the related likelihood of losing when challenging. Such a strategy is built on the basis that it is better to continue to bluff in the hopes of potentially winning than to challenge and lose. \nThe game is comparable to liar\u2019s dice, a game where players roll dice, hide the numbers they have rolled, and then make bids on the total number of dice they believed were rolled by all players with that face value. Here again, the players bid and bluff until challenged by another player. \nTypically if a player poses a challenge in Liar's Poker and is incorrect, they must pay the player they challenged. If the player who was challenged was found to be incorrect, then they must pay every player who posed a challenged. Usually the payout is one dollar but that may be increased depending on the agreed upon rules.

Those are the kinds of flabbergasting returns it takes normal assets decades to generate, with inflation gnawing away all the while. Bitcoin is a tulip , a South Sea Company , a Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC , take your pick. It simply can't keep this up in defiance of all logic. \nAs long-time hodlers ( sic ) love to point out, though, naysaying n00bs (sic) don't bother to read up on their bitcoin history. Since its inception in 2009, the cryptocurrency has enjoyed a handful of major runups. We'll ignore the first, when it went from nothing to being worth a few pennies: Calculating that return requires dividing by zero. Compared to the other two, though, this bitcoin bull market is a tiddler. \nFrom June 25, 2010 to June 7, 2011, bitcoin's closing price shot from $0.05 to $23.92, a 47,740% return. From Nov. 18, 2011 to Dec. 3, 2013, the price went from $2.05 to $1,068.67: a rise of 52,030%. \nCompare those returns to the 6,262% bitcoin has returned since Jan. 17, 2015. Nothing to write home about, by bitcoin standards. \nA few objections naturally arise. What about the bear markets? Sweet Satoshi Nakamoto have there been bear markets. The kinds of crashes that would cause instant recessions, if they were to happen in the S&P 500, come and go in a matter of hours in bitcoinland. And the real bears take a heavy toll: the one from June 8, 2011 to Nov. 17, 2011 ripped away 92% of bitcoin's value. The post-MtGox bear, from Dec. 4, 2013 to Jan. 16, 2015, saw the price drop 82%. \nPast performance is no indication of future returns, but if it were, bitcoin would be flirting with $100,000 in a matter of months, then plummet to around $10,000 a few weeks after that, and anybody who'd bought at the beginning of 2017 would still have decupled their money. A few repetitions of that would turn the planet into an ASIC farm, so things will probably have to calm down soon. \nOr perhaps the music will stop entirely. \nDisclosure: the author owns bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david floyd", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernard l. madoff investment securities llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south sea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:04.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cad6a05851b03cc2c8abcc9dbcc2d34b655f82d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOj4ovMO1.crWFrqLCkCH7xfsC7V_omPmyYGM8lytIo8RDdv2uv8dt3cqEN2FU3Wq05HxRERVMKPw82XjHvltzEE8tFP1AcsIfI-", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.com", "site": "huffingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/feeds/index.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Southern California's Wildfires Will Get Worse Before They Get Better | HuffPost", "title_full": "Southern California's Wildfires Will Get Worse Before They Get Better | HuffPost", "published": "2017-12-06T19:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a285617190000be35034e9f.jpeg?cache=hgxuaqb9l3&amp;ops=1910_1000", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 139, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2068, "comments": 0, "shares": 2068}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cad6a05851b03cc2c8abcc9dbcc2d34b655f82d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOj4ovMO1.crWFrqLCkCH7xfsC7V_omPmyYGM8lytIo8RDdv2uv8dt3cqEN2FU3Wq05HxRERVMKPw82XjHvltzEE8tFP1AcsIfI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T19:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Southern California's Wildfires Will Get Worse Before They Get Better | HuffPost", "text": "U.S. NEWS 12/06/2017 05:02 pm ET Updated 47 minutes ago Southern California's Wildfires Will Get Worse Before They Get Better \"The prospects for containment are not good. Mother Nature is going to decide when we have the ability to put it out.\" By Ryan Grenoble 1.3k It\u2019s been the most destructive wildfire season in California history , and it\u2019s getting worse.\nConditions in California are especially ripe for devastating fires at the moment, with tinder-dry undergrowth; strong, volatile winds; and terrain that\u2019s difficult for firefighters to traverse. Those natural catalysts are compounded by the proximity of several current fires to large population centers.\nIn just the past four days, multiple fires have started in the hills of Los Angeles and surrounding cities. As of early Thursday, most of them were barely contained, if at all, and tens of thousands of people have been required to evacuate .\nAnd the strong Santa Ana winds that funnel through the steep hills around LA, feeding and spreading fire as they do, are projected to build in strength this week, peaking at up to 80 miles per hour on Thursday .\nA red flag warning \u2015 alerting residents to conditions of extreme fire danger \u2015 was in effect for much of Southern California through Saturday, according to the National Weather Service, with high winds expected to pick up around Los Angeles and Ventura counties on Wednesday night into Thursday.\nAnd late Wednesday, authorities sent an emergency alert to all residents in Los Angeles County warning of \u201ccritical fire danger.\u201d\n\u201cWe are still in a very active and dangerous situation,\u201d Ventura City Fire Chief David Endaya said at a news conference Wednesday evening. \u201cWe are doing everything we can. We are facing dangers tonight and tomorrow. With the predicted wind, it could become a worse event than it is right now.\u201d\nCalFire Google Maps A map of the fires surrounding Los Angeles Wednesday morning. Red and yellow icons indicate a fire that's actively burning. A gray icon marks a fire that's 100 percent contained. The largest of those, the Thomas fire, has so far burned over 90,000 acres and had 5 percent containment as of Wednesday evening, according to Ventura city officials. The fire has destroyed at least 150 structures (that number is expected to grow substantially \u2015 the latest incident report lists 12,000 structures as threatened ) and forced the evacuation of 50,000 people .\nThe windy hills that birthed the Thomas fire haven\u2019t seen a decent rainfall in at least eight months, the Los Angeles Times notes .\nAnother fire in the Bel-Air neighborhood erupted and quickly burned nearly 500 acres, prompting evacuations as some homes were consumed by flames. A fire in the Sylmar area of the San Fernando Valley torched more than 12,000 acres of land are forced the evacuation of more than 100,000 people as of late Wednesday.\n\u201cThere will be no ability to fight fire in these kinds of winds,\u201d Ken Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said, according to the L.A. Times. \u201cAt the end of the day, we need everyone in the public to listen and pay attention. This is not \u2018watch the news and go about your day.\u2019 This is pay attention minute by minute \u2026 keep your head on a swivel.\u201d\nThough California has the largest fleet of firefighting aircraft in the world, those planes typically can\u2019t drop fire retardant in winds higher than 30 mph, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Scott McLean said at a news conference Wednesday.\n\u201cThe prospects for containment are not good,\u201d Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen said at a news conference Tuesday night . \u201cReally, Mother Nature is going to decide when we have the ability to put it out ... it is pushing hard.\u201d\nUnbelievable conditions #CreekFire @LACoFDPIO #LAWind pic.twitter.com/QGnYV1vRwF\n\u2014 Michael Dubron (@MichaelDubron) December 5, 2017 At 11,337 acres, the second-largest fire, known as the Creek fire, is burning homes on the west edge of the Angeles National Forest.\nAccording to Angeles National Forest spokesman Nathan Judy, 1,500 firefighters are currently battling that fire alone, seven of whom have suffered minor injuries. Ten helicopters in the area are helping staunch the inferno, one of which captured the above apocalyptic scene Tuesday.\n\u201cThis is steep, rugged terrain that\u2019s difficult to move in ,\u201d Judy told the L.A. Daily News. \u201cEven though it\u2019s been cooler, the winds are a challenge. The winds are going to continue to be a challenge today and throughout the week.\u201d\nGene Blevins/Reuters A man prays as the Creek fire advances behind him in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles.

Such benefits do not arise in a scenario where the use of IEEE 802.11p is mandated for C-ITS services, which would result in less than half these expected net benefits (EUR 20 billion).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jean-pierre", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "analysys mason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:06.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7df1866547535f34797df67f1709f2576eb63f41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSjiKFwPjp6pvF3U0Mf_WLxMDlFNjifUqYAtc7zA.zW8j1V69R1PxWZfG1.trMVIxFsP7zFXfRQzBP1utvmBHVbUsn701uPkkq", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "High Quality .gifs", "title": "I'm not a very good giffer", "title_full": "I'm not a very good giffer : HighQualityGifs", "published": "2017-12-06T04:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.403, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b9a5f21375d9ef397e571d04adc551ec3b2cb8fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSjiKFwPjp6pvF3U0Mf_WLxMDlFNjifUqYAtc7zA.zW8j1V69R1PxWZfG1.trMVIxFsP7zFXfRQzBP1utvmBHVbeokAboPULSCMPDBoiV.uKVlDj0V7mowrA--", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Lunti89", "published": "2017-12-07T11:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Well done!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:06.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "71fd3f45cfb5d56ce5d0c09aea772a3db4c3577f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw37pM0ts6wo4wks9yqTFoNwVlMVC.AtjuzmjEOL9Q2BomVMZnUqRRPApVeZyfMmXjv6AGWhUrk8iRlzcOjhgBoM2hNNvWyCw_jlR53XW1sQ--", "site_full": "www.gumtree.com.au", "site": "gumtree.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-boats-jet-skis/c18420", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "tech"], "section_title": "Boats for Sale - New &amp; Used Boats - Gumtree Australia", "title": "Tinny Aluvan | Tinnies & Dinghies Noosa Area - Tewantin | 1168128673", "title_full": "Tinny Aluvan | Tinnies & Dinghies | Gumtree Australia Noosa Area - Tewantin | 1168128673", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.64, "main_image": "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/6nUAAOSw6VRaKQzt/$_58.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1188, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "71fd3f45cfb5d56ce5d0c09aea772a3db4c3577f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw37pM0ts6wo4wks9yqTFoNwVlMVC.AtjuzmjEOL9Q2BomVMZnUqRRPApVeZyfMmXjv6AGWhUrk8iRlzcOjhgBoM2hNNvWyCw_jlR53XW1sQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "peter riley", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Tinny Aluvan | Tinnies & Dinghies Noosa Area - Tewantin | 1168128673", "text": "For sale is one of best boats you'll fish off in it's class.

These funds often use several alternative investing techniques such as leverage, derivatives and short positions. Long/short funds may also be referred to as enhanced funds or 130/30 funds. BREAKING DOWN 'Long/Short Fund' \nLong/short funds typically seek to enhance the returns from investing in a specific market segment by actively taking both long and short positions in securities. Long/short funds use varying active management techniques to determine portfolio holdings. They may also use leverage, derivatives and short positions which can increase the risks of the fund as well as the fund\u2019s potential total return. \nLong/short funds represent some similarities to hedge funds. They seek to offer investment strategies with greater risk and greater return potential over standard benchmarks. Most long/short funds feature higher liquidity than hedge funds, no lock-in periods and lower fees. However, they still have higher fees and less liquidity than most mutual funds. Long/short funds also may require higher minimum investments than other mutual funds. Long/short funds are more closely regulated than hedge funds therefore they have limitations on the use of leverage and derivatives where hedge funds do not. \nLong/short funds can be a good investment for investors seeking targeted index exposure with some active management.
