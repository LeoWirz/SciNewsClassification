Crooked teeth, excessive tooth spacing, poor tooth shape, and size are some of the most common tooth-related issues people have which can be easily corrected with advancements in the field of dental science. \nAnd with more and more candidates opting for the dental profession, as reported by salarieshub.com , finding an expert in dentistry who can fix your teeth should not be a problem at all. \nTo better understand why and how you can have the properly aligned teeth, continue reading. \nKnow why you need perfectly aligned teeth \nGetting your teeth aligned perfectly not only benefit one\u2019s mental wellbeing but takes care of physical well-being as well. Let\u2019s take a closer look at why getting your teeth straightened is important. \n\u00b7 Enhanced dental functioning: \nThe better the tooth alignment, the enhanced is the functioning of the tooth as well as of the jaw, which automatically maximizes long-term oral comfort and health. While the widely placed teeth tend to become inflamed and lead to developing gum disease, perfectly aligned teeth that fit the gum more accurately, prevent such gum problems from arising. \n\u00b7 Increased longevity of teeth structures: \nProper teeth alignment also ensures that your natural teeth as well as the restorations last longer. Plus, perfectly aligned teeth are easy to clean and floss, which prevents plaque buildup and tooth decay, thereby leading to better oral health. \n\u00b7 Prevents digestive problems: \nIneffective chewing often makes it impossible to process the food properly. And as a result of swallowing foods that aren\u2019t processed well or chewed well leads to digestive issues. However, perfectly aligned teeth ensure that the food is chewed as they should be. \n\u00b7 Improved speech and appearance: \nHaving excessive space in between teeth often affect the speech, causing difficulty in pronouncing. Straitening and aligning the teeth automatically improve the clarity of speech. Moreover, by adjusting the teeth alignment, the facial structure would improve as well which is an added benefit. \nKnow how you can get the neatly set teeth \nThe best and most effective way of getting perfectly aligned teeth is by visiting a dentist who specializes in tooth correction. It is only after thoroughly examining one\u2019s tooth and the tooth related issues he or she has that the dentist can offer the most suitable ways of aligning the teeth. Considering the requirement, the dentist may suggest one to opt for plastic aligners that are removable or traditional metal braces and retainers.

For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically. \n\nHistorically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days. This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn\u2019t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different. \n\nThe normal resolution for this is to either refund the original payment to the user, or ask the user to transfer additional funds to cover the remaining balance. In both these cases, the user is hit with the Bitcoin network transaction fee again. This year, we\u2019ve seen increasing number of customers get into this state. With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer). \n\nAt this point, it has become untenable to support Bitcoin as a payment option. We may re-evaluate whether Bitcoin makes sense for us and for the Steam community at a later date. \n\nWe will continue working to resolve any pending issues for customers who are impacted by existing underpayments or transaction fees. \n\n-- The Steam Team\" \n\nsource ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valve", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin valve corp.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:20.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a862578c4ac6f0aa185c583ee3323489cd78061", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdhdtyEekhwK.4.bckVevBX0EHrybsPT9FxZeMqKo4SEmFkIQTm5bZyN45Cqu12vZKAAy9pyepmYXoHbUo03MejQ2RaA1AEiNW7V.SCqFzHQ--", "site_full": "hudsonvalley.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://hudsonvalley.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist hudson valley | for sale search", "title": "2002 Roadtrek 190 Popular $5000", "title_full": "2002 Roadtrek 190 Popular $5000", "published": "2017-12-07T10:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_lAxQrPFO5cd_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a862578c4ac6f0aa185c583ee3323489cd78061", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdhdtyEekhwK.4.bckVevBX0EHrybsPT9FxZeMqKo4SEmFkIQTm5bZyN45Cqu12vZKAAy9pyepmYXoHbUo03MejQ2RaA1AEiNW7V.SCqFzHQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "2002 Roadtrek 190 Popular $5000", "text": "Fuel Capacity - 132 L - 35 US Gallons Anti Lock Rear Wheel Brakes Double Right Side & Rear Single Doors& Exits do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 6415794236", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "us gallons anti lock rear wheel brakes double right side & rear", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:20.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08fb76fa0061e8848cdc7562210b065aefa281e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQq3coW3.zjc9L2fmKCXwWnHfYhIk1.OBTE6OmG1C0PSgQfF4oWWqjDwGba1DIZxoZQUEhqYJfkXBc.HiKrTnICRtWstigoJ6D3uiV9YHshb.JrK.W3FtrX", "site_full": "www.naija.ng", "site": "naija.ng", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Wike, others are backing Secondus as a candidate for selfish reasons - Oyelese \u25b7 NAIJ.COM", "title_full": "Wike, others are backing Secondus as a candidate for selfish reasons - Oyelese \u25b7 NAIJ.COM", "published": "2017-12-07T10:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.613, "main_image": "https://fb.onthe.io/vllkyt364s85mmp93g.481a622b.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08fb76fa0061e8848cdc7562210b065aefa281e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQq3coW3.zjc9L2fmKCXwWnHfYhIk1.OBTE6OmG1C0PSgQfF4oWWqjDwGba1DIZxoZQUEhqYJfkXBc.HiKrTnICRtWstigoJ6D3uiV9YHshb.JrK.W3FtrX", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Oluwatobi Bolashodun", "published": "2017-12-07T10:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Wike, others are backing Secondus as a candidate for selfish reasons - Oyelese \u25b7 NAIJ.COM", "text": "Share on Facebook - Former minister for mines and steel, Wole Oyelese has issued a warning to leaders of the PDP and delegates ahead of the party's convention - Oyelese warned that they should not to fall into the trap set by Governor Wike and some governors - He noted that Wike and some others were working to install Prince Uche Secondus for selfish reasons Ahead of the Peoples Democratic Party's (PDP)convention, Wole Oyelese, the former minister for mines and steel has warned leaders of the party and delegates not to fall into the trap set by Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers state and some governors.

Some governors who are also afraid of their shadows believe that they cannot manipulate Chief Bode George and believe Secondus could easily be manipulated. \u201dWike and the other governors are unnecessarily anxious, they are not thinking about the future of the party. They should know that there is no room for experimentation.\u201d Oyelese also appealed to the PDP leaders in the southsouth to see Nigeria as a country that must be united and not divided along any ethnic line. He also challenged Secondus to come out with details of his achievements. The former minister also said as the organising secretary of the party, Secondus caused more division in Oyo State PDP when he allegedly accepted three different results from three different groups during a congress. He added that Secondus in 2014 imposed an unpopular candidate for the governorship election in Oyo State making PDP to lose the state. Oyelese said Chief Bode George turned the fortune of the party round when he was the South West Vice Chairman of the party in 2003 winning five out of the six states in the region for the party. \u201cGeorge as PDP vice chairman in South West went round all the states about five times and by the next election in 2003, PDP won in five states out of six \u201c. Let Secondus tell us what he achieved for the party. \u201dGeorge is one individual who can sit down and he knows the people to be contacted in Sokoto, Maiduguri, Calabar who can make the difference in the future of the party\u201d , he said.

She allegedly organized an event with strippers that ended with live sex in a club. \nAccording to businessmen in the region, last Saturday night, an \u201cOnly for Women\u201d (Solo para Mujeres) event was held at the \u201cLa Patrona\u201d, a male-dancer strip club. The event was reportedly organized by Governor Mar\u00eda del Roble Ortiz and another councilor from Parras de la Fuente, Coahuila, Javier Molina. \nA video from the event shows a male stripper and a female getting really intimate.

Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), shown during a September press conference, were among the first Democratic senators to call for Sen. Al Franken's resignation (REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein/File Photo) Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-Newfields, took a prominent role in the attempt by some within the Senate Democratic caucus to be done with Sen. Al Franken , D-MN, who is accused of sexually harassing women. Hassan was one of six Democratic women to break out within a 10-minute period Wednesday morning and issue rapid-fire statements calling for his resignation.\u201cIt is clear that Al Franken has engaged in a pattern of egregious and unacceptable behavior toward women, and he should resign,\u201d Hassan said in her statement . \u201cWe are experiencing a sea change in our culture that is long overdue, and we must continue working to empower all women and do everything we can to prevent sexual harassment, misconduct, and assault.\u201dWithin 90 minutes, there were 22 Democratic senators publicly making the call that Franken must go.Franken said he would have an announcement on his future Thursday. Capitol Hill insiders say he\u2019s likely leaving the Senate, though he said no final decision had been made.There was initially some push-back from liberals on social media angered at the piling on \u2014 even while President Trump endorses Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore , accused of sexually harassing multiple women, including a number in their teens.Filmmaker Barbara Malmet tweeted, \u201cSenators Gillabrand, Hirono, McCaskill, Murray, Harris, and Hassan, you are calling on Al Franken to resign the Senate when a pedophile from Alabama might join you and a man sits in the White House accused by 16 women of sexual harassment?\u201dIn case anybody doubted it, there were also those close to defeated Sen. Kelly Ayotte , R-Nashua. who sniped at Hassan: \u201cGlad @SenatorHassan called on @alfranken to resign,\u201d tweeted Lauren Zelt . \u201cWish she would have taken as strong a stance about news of sexual misconduct on campus at Phillips Exeter when her husband served as principal & accusations first broke about the teacher whose endorsement she touted in 2011.\u201dHassan\u2019s announcement also came moments after the state GOP issued yet another call for her to demand Franken\u2019s resignation, something the party had urged since the scandal first broke. New Hampshire\u2019s other senator, Democrat Jeanne Shaheen , could not and did not take a position on Franken\u2019s future because she potentially sits in judgment as a member and the only female on the Senate Ethics Committee. Members are barred under the rules from making any comment on pending matters and all six members, including the Republicans, have been silent on the Franken controversy.So what brought about this move to push Franken out the door? Well, Time Magazine\u2019s naming on Wednesday of the \u201csilence breakers\u201d \u2014 those starting the #MeToo movement \u2014 as the Person of The Year certainly didn\u2019t help Franken\u2019s case. Then earlier Wednesday, Politico reported a former Democratic congressional aide said Franken tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006, three years before he became a U.S. senator. Franken, who has been accused by six other women of groping or trying to forcibly kiss them, denied the accusation. One also doesn\u2019t know whether any Democratic senators got tipped off that Franken might be stepping aside of his own volition today.- - - - - - - - - - - -Another prominent Democrat is weighing his own 2018 run for governor.Two-term State Sen. Dan Feltes , D-Concord, has heard a lot of encouragement to leave his safe Senate seat and try to take out popular, first-term, Republican Gov. Chris Sununu .In case nobody noticed, the Democratic Party has its own divisions right now, although the chasm is not quite as wide as in the Republican Party.Anyone watching the Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters fuming outside Hillary Clinton\u2019s book-selling party in Concord Tuesday knows there are still some fresh wounds from that presidential campaign.Feltes is one of only a handful of Democrats who has close friends in both camps.This quick-study senator and new dad has risen up the ranks in the minority and is regarded as a go-to legislator on the floor when it comes to trying to hammer out a legal language compromise with the Senate\u2019s Republican majority.Also don\u2019t forget Feltes only got to the state Senate by challenging the party establishment.When Senate President Sylvia Larsen , D-Concord, retired, the Democratic power brokers had already decided this seat belonged to longtime Concord School Board member and past chairman Kass Ardinger whose husband, Bill , remains such a respected, non-partisan lawyer-lobbyist.Feltes crashed the big shots party and won the Democratic primary.There remains an unknown here. Who was the best-known Democrat who also bucked those party elders and got behind Feltes in his first Senate run? It was then-Executive Councilor and 2016 Democratic nominee for governor Colin Van Ostern of Concord. In return, Feltes helped Van Ostern\u2019s later gubernatorial campaign. Would Feltes jump into this race only to have Van Ostern join in at some later point?It could happen, but this might hurt both of their chances.- - - - - - - - - - - -State Rep. Al Baldasaro , R-Londonderry, the conservative Republican maverick who is never at a loss for words, came close to totally losing his voice this week. On Monday, Baldasaro had surgery in the Veterans Administration hospital in Jamaica Plain, Mass., to remove a polyp from his throat that was blocking his airway and his voice.\u201cYes, my throat is swollen, the voice is muffled but hopefully will be back soon,\u201d Baldasaro texted the Granite Status Wednesday afternoon. \u201cIt took a new doctor to identify my throat issue after I\u2019d been complaining for years at the (Manchester) VA and they gave me Mucinex.\u201dDon\u2019t you just know that before long, Baldasaro will be back at the State House to assume his customary role as the right-wing lion that roared.- - - - - - - - - - - -New House Speaker Gene Chandler , R-Bartlett, has an old and historical decision to make.Who is to become chairman of the House Public Works and Highways Committee?Anybody who knows this 18-term Republican is well aware that panel has always been Chandler\u2019s policy playground.He\u2019s owned it for more than 30 years.No matter which party was in power, Chandler has always been the man when it comes to finding a way in the New Hampshire House to craft a public works or capital budget in the odd-numbered year and a 10-year highway plan in the even-numbered year.Now that he\u2019s got the gavel, could he possibly do both?\u201cI know you have the 10-year highway plan coming up,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t made the decision yet. It would be difficult for me to continue I think, but I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see.\u201dThe new-age politicos who believe deal-making is the only way anything gets done still can\u2019t quite get their heads around a guy like Chandler, who promised nothing and endured a two-ballot scare before getting back the gavel.\u201cI don\u2019t know any other way to be,\u201d Chandler said, recalling his first successful run for House Speaker nearly two decades ago when his inseparable second lieutenant was the late Alton Republican Rep. Michael Whalley .\u201cWhen I ran the first time, Mike Whalley was such a good help getting me elected. He would drive me all over the state of New Hampshire,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cI\u2019d always be asked. So what is Mike getting? In all those hours of sitting in the car, we never talked about it. That was true up until the day of the vote.\u201dWhalley did become Chandler\u2019s majority leader and was widely seen as destined to one day become speaker himself until Whalley\u2019s tragic death at 54 in 2008 from a brain tumor.- - - - - - - - - - - -Exeter Republican Councilor Russell Prescott has championed the first system-wide proposal to increase tolls in 10 years.But Prescott insisted the council hold a public hearing in Portsmouth City Hall, the heart of his district.This highway improvement plan would generate $36 million a year, more than enough to erect the sound barriers in Portsmouth that residential neighborhoods have been clamoring years for.So why was Prescott a no-show for his own show Monday night?He had a good and unfortunate excuse \u2014 sudden stomach pain that ended up requiring a visit to Exeter Hospital earlier that day.Prescott was unable to make Wednesday\u2019s council meeting.But Prescott later reported Wednesday that it was just a stomach bug and, \u201cI am thankful for that.\u201dDo not presume this week\u2019s delay of the toll vote means the entire plan is a goner.It will likely return in some form within weeks. Another candidate for House Speaker will also be very involved in this toll hike plan should it get through the council.He\u2019s State Rep. Steve Smith , R-Charlestown, who endorsed Chandler after the first ballot in the GOP caucus.Smith chairs the House Transportation Committee and that\u2019s the panel first to tackle the proposal of the Department of Transportation to offer a volume discount to New Hampshire-only drivers who go through multiple toll plazas each day.- - - - - - - - - - - -Retiring Rep. Carol Shea-Porter , D-N.H., ratcheted up her call to get rid of President Trump .Shea-Porter announced she voted \u201cpresent\u201d on a vote that tabled a lopsided vote to impeach Trump.Shea-Porter then revealed she was joining six other Democratic colleagues as a co-sponsor of \u201cstronger and more comprehensive\u201d impeachment articles against Trump.\u201c Donald Trump lacks integrity and has not been willing or able to assume the moral leadership and seriousness of purpose the United States needs from its President,\u201d Shea-Porter said. - - - - - - - - - - - -It\u2019s hard to impress New Hampshire political activists who get all too used to the royal treatment with future Presidents coming into their living rooms to beg for their support.But former House Majority Leader D.J. Bettencourt , now a policy adviser to Gov. Chris Sununu , was moved by the treatment he got going to the office of Vice President Mike Pence . As an aide, Bettencourt was fully prepared to play the part of wallpaper.\u201cI knew my place, respected it and had no pretenses. However, as I went to excuse myself as he greeted Governor Sununu, Vice President Pence immediately welcomed me into his office and told me to have a seat on his couch. He shook my hand, slapped me on the shoulder and said he was happy to meet me. He did all of this for a lowly staffer,\u201d Bettencourt recalled.\u201cHe then encouraged me to take pictures of him meeting with the governor or anything that interested me in his office and when I was done, he told me he wanted a picture with ME before we left. I\u2019ve been in politics a long time; I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d klandrigan@unionleader.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

Ananya Bhattacharya | Posted by Lakshana N Palat A + A - \nVirat Kohli and Anushka Sharma are probably taking the big leap. If sources are to be believed, the couple is soon to fly off to Milan for their cosy Italian wedding. The wedding date is to take place sometime within December 9 and 12, tentatively. Virat and Anushka's wedding reception might take place in Mumbai on December 23. \nAnushka Sharma's spokesperson, however, refuted all rumours . \"There is absolutely no truth to it,\" Anushka's spokesperson told PTI yesterday. \nOver the last four years that Virat and Anushka have been together, their fans have waited with bated breath to see the couple finally tying the knot . In December 2016 too, rumours of Virat and Anushka's wedding made news. But it all turned out to be a false alarm. \nSo are Virat and Anushka actually getting married next week? \nWhile neither Virat nor Anushka has cleared the air yet, several hints point at an Italian wedding sometime next week. \nSources told India Today Television that the couple is taking their relationship to the next level . Reason? Virat's friends and family have booked their tickets to Milan. Anushka's trosseau is supposedly being handled by designer Sabyasachi, who was seen leaving the actress's house a few days ago. A place has been booked in Milan for three days, from December 9 to 12. \nVirat's childhood coach, Rajkumar Sharma, who is also the coach of the Under-23 Delhi team, has excused himself from a crucial match on December 7, citing a wedding. When asked whose wedding he was attending, he said that his 'nephew' was getting married. \nAre they getting married, are they not - we will have to wait a few days to know the truth. But the fact that marriage is on the cards for the two, is quite understandable. \nOn his part, Virat Kohli has gone out of his way to profess his love for Anushka several times in the past, and set some indomitable boyfriend goals. Take a look. \nAT THE AIRPORT Virat and Anushka at the airport \nThe paparazzi have clicked Virat and Anushka together at the airport many times in the last couple of years. Virat has been seen holding Anushka's hand and steering her out of the way of clicking shutters. Every time Virat and Anushka fly off on a holiday, photographers make sure they manage to come back from the airport with cute photos of the couple. \nPDA ON INSTAGRAM \nThe first time the country saw Virat Kohli opening up on his relationship status was when trolls began blaming Anushka for the cricketer's poor performance on the field. Virat's poignant note struck a chord with all, and the troll-attack subsided. \nVirat first shared a meme with the caption, \"Sharing this for the caption under the picture. This is for the trollers and the weak ones who hide and make fun of people and intend to start 'trending'. Use that energy to make something out of your life. It's precious. Making fun of someone is the easiest job out there. I guess they just like it easy in life. I feel bad for them. (sic)\" A post shared by Virat Kohli (@virat.kohli) on Mar 25, 2016 at 6:52am PDT \nAnd then came the hard-hitting post, \"Shame on those people who have been having a go at anushka for the longest time and connecting every negative thing to her. Shame on those people calling themselves educated. Shame on blaming and making fun of her when she has no control over what i do with my sport. If anything she has only motivated and given me more positivity. This was long time coming. Shame on these people that hide and take a dig. And i dont need any respect for this post. Have some compassion and respect her. Think of how your sister or girlfriend or wife would feel if someone trolled them and very conveniently rubbished them in public. #nocompassion#nocommonsense (sic)\" A post shared by Virat Kohli (@virat.kohli) on Mar 28, 2016 at 1:44am PDT \nVirat then changed his display picture on Instagram to one with Anushka in it. And ever since, Kohli's account has had a photo of the couple as its display picture. \nIn addition to that, several times in the past, Virat has given his and Anushka's fans something to be happy about: photos of the couple. \nOn Valentine's Day this year, Virat posted an astoundingly adorable message for Anushka, \"Everyday is a valentine day if you want it to be. You make everyday seem like one for me (sic)\" A post shared by Virat Kohli (@virat.kohli) on Feb 14, 2017 at 11:33pm PST \nThen came his heartwarming post, on Women's Day this year, \"Happy women's day to every woman out there, but specially to the two strongest women in my life. My mom for looking after the family in toughest times in life and @anushkasharma for fighting against the odds regularly and standing up for righteousness and changing the norms #happywomenday (sic)\" A post shared by Virat Kohli (@virat.kohli) on Mar 7, 2017 at 8:28pm PST \nOn July 12, came another sweet post from Virat. A post shared by Virat Kohli (@virat.kohli) on Jul 12, 2017 at 8:56am PDT \nWEDDINGS, ADS AND EVENTS \nOver the last few years, Virat and Anushka have made frequent public appearances together. Be it Virat's teammates' weddings or the Indian Cricket Team-only screening of Sachin Tendulkar 's biopic, Sachin: A Billion Dreams, 'Virushka' (the moniker that Virat and Anushka's fans have coined for them) entered and left the venues hand-in-hand, leaving people with wide smiles on their faces. \nAs recently as last month, during cricketer Zaheer Khan and actress Sagarika Ghatge's wedding reception, Virat and Anushka were snapped in perfectly coordinated outfits and burnt the dance floor with their bhangra. \nThe much-talked-about ad that Virat and Anushka appeared in a few months ago, too, set gossip mills on fire. The ad for an Indian designerwear line that Virat Kohli was the menswear brand ambassador of, now has Anushka as the face of its womenswear. The commercial brought out the actor in Virat too, sparking rumours that the cricketer will soon be signing his first film! \nIN INTERVIEWS \nVirat has not held back when to comes to pouring out his emotions for Anushka in public. His stance on his relationship, especially over the last couple of years, has been exceptionally open. He has not shied away from telling the media, and the world, that he loves Anushka, and that she has made him a better person and more. \nIn 2015, Virat spoke about his relationship with Anushka in an interview to a newspaper, \"I believe in my relationship. I trust my relationship. I trust her. I trust in my relationship with her. That's why I spoke to the Board and persons concerned about my relationship and tried to make them realise why I need her to be with me during such an important tour. I conveyed my feelings about her to the people who needed to be informed. And they respected my decision. They respected the fact that I respect my relationship. At a human level, people understand when you try to be honest about a relationship. She is a part of my daily life. And that's a fact. That is a major part of my life. People need to understand that.\" \nAnd went on to add, \"Anushka acts as a big motivation for me. She is one person in my life who keeps me very calm. There are very few people in my life that I can sit down and listen to. She is one of them. I listen to her calmly about everything she says. She makes me understand if I make a mistake, if I am doing something wrong. She gives me that calm feeling. She gives me that assurance. And I know she will always support me, no matter what. That's a big thing for me. So when I see her cheering for me at the ground, it obviously makes me feel special. It gives me more strength, makes me feel calmer... it's like an emotional support. Once you get that you don't need to think about anything else. Because once you are feeling the emotional support, you are feeling so confident that you can go out there and conquer. You know there is someone sitting out there to support you always. And Anushka is a very special part of my life. I love the fact that she comes and supports me when I play.\" \nIn July this year, Virat told a channel, \"I was in Mohali and there was a Test series going on. I was with Anushka then, she had come to visit me. Surprisingly, when I became the Test captain then also she was in Melbourne with me. That was a very special moment we shared together.\" \nWhen MS Dhoni announced that he would no longer be leading India in ODIs, and passed the baton on to Virat, the latter said that the moment became even more special for him because he was able to share it with Anushka. \nHe also shared an emotional moment, \"During the Mohali Test, they had spoken to me already. When I hung up the phone and told her, for me it was like a flashback. From the moment I started playing in my academy till the Mohali game. I was emotional. I was in tears because I had never thought that I will see this day. What was more beautiful was that, I was able to share it with Anushka. It was something that I will always remember.\" \nLast month, Virat told Gaurav Kapoor on his chat show, \"I've learnt a lot, become more sensible in the last four years all because of her (Anushka). She's taught me how to be more patient and taught me how to utilise the position you are in to the fullest.\" \n\"Luckily I have never tried to change myself over the years. But the flip has been because of her. That period in England in 2014. Anushka was there in my life, she understood what I was going through so she kept me motivated. Her support helped me push through, however bad it was for me. She was a constant in that time... And then Australia happened (the tour in 2014-15 when Kohli scored four hundreds in four Tests) and I ended up scoring runs, in her presence. So it was a special thing for both of us because she also faced a lot of flak. We were being criticised and people were saying this is what happens when you allow girlfriends on the tour. I thought, 'if you don't think this is right, then no one can be in a relationship'. According to you all - either get married or remain single. How can that be?\" asked Virat on the chat show. \nKohli also credited fellow cricketer Zaheer Khan for advising him to not hide his relationship with Anushka. \n\"A very big reason behind me not hiding my relationship is Mr. Zaheer Khan. Luckily he was one of the first guys I spoke to about this and he said whatever you do don't try to hide it because you'll stress yourself. And on top of that you're in a relationship, you're not doing anything wrong. I'm actually very grateful that my first interaction about this was with Zak. And he told me the right thing to do so I've followed it ever since,\" said Virat. \nWill they finally tie the knot before the end of 2017?

He\u2019s worked closely in athletics over the years and, in less than a year, has been a big part of things for Starkville High School. \nWhen the athletic director position was set to open up after Peasant was notified that Milton Smith would retire at the end of the year, he had several names in mind. One of the first ones to come to his head was longtime friend and mentor Dr. Cheyenne Trussell. \nTrussell has spent the last 15 years building Hattiesburg High School into one of the state\u2019s top athletic departments and has boosted the academic side of things for athletes down south. \nWhen Peasant approached Trussell about the job, he was a bit surprised he was receptive enough to check it out and eventually accept. \n\u201cI would say that he was a person that I would have dreamed of being able to get,\" Peasant said. \"He was in Hattiesburg for years so there was no guarantee that I could lure him from a place that he had loved. \n\u201cI was a little surprised that I was able to pull him away from there, but at the same time, I\u2019ve been blessed and fortunate with him and others I\u2019ve been able to hire. It\u2019s all about relationships and we\u2019ve had a relationship for a while.\u201d \nTrussell was formally announced in front of community members, coaches, media and athletes at SHS on Wednesday afternoon. He was met with a warm embrace by the faculty and coaches and his excitement came out immediately in his comments about what lies ahead. \u201cThe feel of Starkville is like I\u2019ve been here all along though I haven\u2019t,\u201d Trussell said. \u201cJust the welcome that I\u2019ve gotten has been awesome.\u201d \nWith over 30 years of experience in administration from Louisiana to North Carolina, Jackson and Hattiesburg, Trussell is well-received. In 2014 he was chosen the Mississippi Association of Educational Office Professionals Administrator of the Year as well as the University of Southern Miss National Girls and Sports Day Award Winner. In 2005, he was the Mississippi High School Activities Association Athletic Director of the Year. \nFor 15-straight years at Hattiesburg High School, Trussell balanced the athletic department budget through 40 percent cuts and two tornadoes. He helped plan over $6 million renovations in athletic facilities over that time to football, baseball and basketball. \n\u201cI want to make sure that the coaching staff is family-oriented and close-knit, (and) that we support each other and we share athletes with other sports,\" Trussell said. \"That is very important to succeeding. Also, we want to take a strategic look at the facilities and work with the booster clubs to see how we can move forward.\u201d \nPeasant credited Trussell in being the reason he pursued a doctorate degree. Needless to say, he felt that Trussell checked all the boxes of the leader of SHS athletics moving forward. \n\u201cI think that we have a person in here that is seasoned and has successful experience,\" Peasant said. \"He\u2019s a proven leader and is someone that can be a great mentor. There are teachers and coaches that I\u2019ve spoken to all around the state that have been mentored by him and they\u2019ll tell you how great a mentor and how knowledgeable he is. He will give our students everything they need to be successful and reach their potential.\u201d Category:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trussell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peasant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eddie peasant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cheyenne trussell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milton smith", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mississippi high school activities association athletic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of southern miss national girls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peasant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi association of educational office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "starkville high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hattiesburg high school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "starkville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "starkville-oktibbeha county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tupelo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "starkville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hattiesburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:21.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "734223272b82cba8b1a2004876aa5f13523ca589", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS8_3biL7WhsOZnNJTZUNf8eb5wJgzN5TWJpV1zmwBkXJruJ5Nv2F3jmvADuYILrNYFTS4gM4gF70ERCOuIBOWI.PqEj8m5ruhLPLdY_V83Hg--", "site_full": "forum.donanimhaber.com", "site": "donanimhaber.com", "site_section": "http://forum.donanimhaber.com/forumid_514/tt.htm", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Di\u011fer", "title": "Apple \u0130phone X Ana Konu / Kullan\u0131c\u0131 Klub\u00fc 173 - 173", "title_full": "Apple \u0130phone X Ana Konu / Kullan\u0131c\u0131 Klub\u00fc \u00bb Sayfa 173 - 173", "published": "2017-12-07T12:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TR", "spam_score": 0.697, "main_image": "https://www.petabayt.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/iphone-x-renkleri.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1142, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d4f822a5268498218098cf129d5e3030f4055f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS8_3biL7WhsOZnNJTZUNf8eb5wJgzN5TWJpV1zmwBkXJruJ5Nv2F3jmvADuYILrNYFTS4gM4gF70ERCOuIBOWI.PqEj8m5ruhycuZrJ5fJD1Q3l7l1Mq.OWdVYN_oUwwk-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "ender", "published": "2017-12-07T12:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Uygunsa alinir", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:21.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a21601d21042fd3bb97379250d65566e8cd03445", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSDQCKXO74oYRClFMrTEtVbZQu5QBqh7dlYIDR0kZ8irG5eBaohBTu5V2c44SyrnGcSQbjjduuoJyMay1YYZof63iFPv5VbG2Tv2IZZks.rAi1x7MwC70kwikAyTRrboi3kZGl4hFj8OQ--", "site_full": "glblgeopolitics.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://glblgeopolitics.wordpress.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Global Geopolitics", "title": "US New Moves: War with Iran May Be Much Closer Than We Think", "title_full": "US New Moves: War with Iran May Be Much Closer Than We Think", "published": "2017-12-07T11:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.strategic-culture.org/images/news/2017/12/05/or-40011.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a21601d21042fd3bb97379250d65566e8cd03445", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSDQCKXO74oYRClFMrTEtVbZQu5QBqh7dlYIDR0kZ8irG5eBaohBTu5V2c44SyrnGcSQbjjduuoJyMay1YYZof63iFPv5VbG2Tv2IZZks.rAi1x7MwC70kwikAyTRrboi3kZGl4hFj8OQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "aurelius77", "published": "2017-12-07T11:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "US New Moves: War with Iran May Be Much Closer Than We Think", "text": "US New Moves: War with Iran May Be Much Closer Than We Think Posted by aurelius77 on December 7, 2017 \n\nThe US does not intend to end or even curtail its military presence in Iraq (as well as Syria) after the defeat of the Islamic State. It is planning to turn Iraq into a major theater of confrontation with Iran. There are signs that a war with Iran may be much closer than we think. \nCIA director Mike Pompeo, an official known for his staunch opposition to Iran, has warned Tehran that the United States would hold it accountable for any attacks it conducted on American interests. Addressing high-ranking US military and security officials on Saturday, Dec. 2, at a defence forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute in Simi Valley, California, Pompeo said that he had sent the letter to General Qassem Suleimani, a leader of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and elite Quds. \u201c What we were communicating to him in that letter was that we will hold him and Iran accountable\u2026 and we wanted to make sure that he and the leadership of Iran understood that in a way that was crystal clear,\u201d the CIA director explained. \nAccording to Pompeo, the message was sent after the senior Iranian military commander had indicated that forces under his control might attack US forces in Iraq. He did not specify the date. \u201c You need to only look to the past few weeks and the efforts of the Iranians to exert influence now in Northern Iraq in addition to other places in Iraq to see that Iranian efforts to be the hegemonic power throughout the Middle East continues to increase ,\u201d he noted. Pompeo also said that Saudi Arabia had grown more willing to share intelligence with other Middle Eastern nations regarding Iran and Islamist extremism. \nAccording to Kurdish Basnews, large-scale US forces arrived at the Kaywan base-K1 west of Kirkuk on Nov.28 to split into two contingents. Several hundred servicemen stayed on base. Another contingent headed east on Dec. 1 towards Tuz Khumatu in eastern Iraq and took control of the Siddiq military airport 35 km to the west. Tuz Khumatu lies 100 km west of the Iraqi-Iranian border and 163 km north of Baghdad. US forces have never been deployed so close to the Iranian border since the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. \nIn mid-November, several hundred US Marines were reported to be building a new base in western Iraq, about 20 km from the strategic Anbar Province town of Al Qaim, which had been captured from Islamic State. Evidently, the move is part of US plan to prevent the creation of a Syrian-Iraqi corridor from Iran. \nIn mid-October, the Iraqi government allowed pro-Iranian Shia forces to capture Kirkuk and its oilfields from the Kurds. The US is not happy with the prospects of Iranian control established over Northern Iraq\u2019s oil. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on October 22 said it was time for Iranian military advisers and fighters \u201c to go home and allow the Iraqi people to regain control .\u201d Tehran supports large parts of Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), composed mainly of Shiite militias, both militarily and financially. But they have gone through a process of state legitimization , becoming a part of Iraq\u2019s security forces. Their status and activities are an internal Iraqi affair. \nTillerson\u2019s statement was followed up by US National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, who said in an interview on Oct.25 that it is possible to contain Iran\u2019s influence in the Middle East, and that a strong Iraq would be part of that. \nCoincidence or not, the American forces were deployed near the Iranian border at almost the same time Israel delivered an air strike (Dec.2) at the Syrian army\u2019s 91st Brigade HQ, outside al-Kiswah \u2013 14km southwest of Damascus where an alleged meeting of pro-Iranian Shia militia chiefs was taking place. On November 10, the BBC released a report that Iran was \u201c building permanent military base in Syria .\u201d Israeli leaders have sworn to prevent Iran from establishing permanent bases. \n43 Congress members sent a letter dated Nov.14 to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson calling for a change of strategy in Syria. According to the lawmakers, \u201c A strategy for Syria that includes how the United States plans to prevent Iran from gaining a permanent foothold on Israel and Jordan\u2019s doorstep and to block Iranian arms exports to Hizbollah \u201d. \nAnother essential component of the United States\u2019 anti-Iran strategy is promoting Saudi-Iraqi ties . A meeting between Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and Saudi King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud took place with US blessing when US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attended the launching of Coordination Council. The abovementioned Tillerson\u2019s statement (Oct.22) was made at his meeting with Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir. The US\u2019 return to the centre stage in Iraq to challenge Iran\u2019s regional influence will give much vigor to the US\u2019 alliance with Saudi Arabia. \nSaudi Arabia is seeking alliances that can cement its presence in Iraq. The high-level Iraqi visits to Jeddah and Riyadh have increased lately on the diplomatic, economic and military levels. Riyadh has also increased its participation in international economic forums in Baghdad, counting 60 companies that partook in Baghdad\u2019s International Fair . This summer, Moktada al-Sadr, the leader of the Sadrist movement, which represents millions of poor Shia Muslims in Baghdad and throughout southern Iraq, paid a visit to Saudi Arabia. He also visited the United Arab Emirates, another Sunni state that opposes Iran. \nThe US military presence in Iran allows it to prevent the establishment by Iran of a land link to the Mediterranean via Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, boost its role in Syrian settlement, conduct covert cross-border operations to destabilize the government in Tehran and maintain staging areas to deploy reinforcements in case of war. There are signs that a coordinated campaign to roll back Iran is underway. The possibility of war against Iran has grown immensely in the recent days. \nNote: For archiving purposes, a full version of the article will remain here.
