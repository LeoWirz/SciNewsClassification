Some big changes. \u201d \nOn Halloween, October 31st, 2559, Kyle was to be transported from the Mens Central Jail to the Metropolitan Detention Center due to overcrowding of the jail. On the prison bus, Kyle planned to attack Grandpoint Bank as a means to gain enough money for his plan to take out David . When a group of LEGION criminals blew up the street, the prison bus drove off course, flipping and crashing into the street. As the prison guard called for backup, the criminals moved into the bus and disabled the energy barriers separating the prisoners using an EMP grenade. All the prisoners start a fight with each other, except for Kyle, who escapes during the prisoners' riot. \nAfter gaining some distance from the bus, he encountered an escapee, Pedro Nunez. The two discussed their need for money and how they intend to use it. They both stumbled upon a department store and changed their clothes to better suit their motives. Pedro dressed in a blue linen suit. Kyle on the other hand, embraced Allhallows Eve and chose the Joker as his Halloween costume. The two began their massive crime spree and held hostages in the store. The cops surrounded the store and a rookie cop by the name of Jason Miller attempted to negotiate Kyle to free the hostages safely. Kyle and Pedro stole jewelry as a form of temporary payment to the criminal underworld. After Jason's proposal, Kyle released the hostages as a means of distraction while they escaped out the back. But for Jason it would not go out that easily. He ordered a SWAT unit to move to the back. Kyle used a flash bang grenade to disorientate the SWAT team. Once they were temporarily blinded, Pedro made a run for it and Kyle shot down the SWAT units using one of their sub machine guns. Angered by Pedro's betrayal, he took the sub machine gun and shot in the direction Pedro was running in. Pedro escaped and a cop car pulled in front of him, blocking off his target and ricocheting bullets. Kyle then took a grenade belt from one of the SWAT guys, pulled the pin, and threw it down the opposite end of the alleyway. The explosion had been big enough to destroy the SWAT van and a few other cop cars. Kyle ran, hijacking a car in the process. Kyle robs the grandpoint bank \nKyle had tracked down Pedro. They met together under a bridge with a few other members of the El Federaci\u00f3n. Pedro apologized for ditching him on the spot, but Kyle reinforced the Cartel's rules by punching him in the face and telling him no exceptions. The gang members took out their weapons and were ready to kill Kyle, when Pedro ordered his men to stand down. Pedro said that Kyle had been right and that he knew the Cartel's principles well: leave no man behind. Pedro gave the El Federaci\u00f3n members the bag containing their jewelry and in return the gang gave them an arsenal of weapons including: military-grade assault rifles, shotguns, pistols, and grenades. \nAs night approached, Kyle made his way to Jason's home and slipped a note on his door and continued on with his crime spree, creating a few kidnappings and murders to elude law enforcement from his ultimate plan: the robbery of the Grandpoint bank. Kyle met with Pedro and the two gathered their weapons and posed as an armored delivery crew, using the armored car given to them by the El Federaci\u00f3n. They made their way to the bank and began a full-fledged assault on the bank, killing all security forces that were inside. As Pedro gathered the citizens and held them hostage, Kyle grabbed the bank manager and headed for the vault. When the bank manager lied about not giving him the codes he shot him in the kneecap and forced the bank manager to give him the codes or he would end his life. He agreed and opened the vault. Kyle executed the bank manager and loaded the money into the extra large duffle bags. \nWhen UNSC forces surrounded the perimeter, Kyle threatened that he would start killing hostages if the UNSC didn't arrange for transport immediately and keep back from the bank. The UEG Police Department had brought up Jason once again to negotiate, though all forms of negotiation failed. Few hours have passed and Kyle escaped through the rooftops, killed the pilot of a civilian helicopter, and threw him out before Pedro took over. As they flew overhead and the SWAT teams moved into the bank to find all the hostages alive, Kyle fired upon the forces from above and rigged the vault with explosives. He blew up the vault killing multiple SWAT and police inside the atrium. Ground forces fired upon the chopper, and Kyle had escaped with little vehicular damage done. \nLater that night when the Cartel boss of the El Federaci\u00f3n looked over his prized jewelry, it took him a moment to realize it had been fake and inside the bag of jewelry was a medium-sized package. When he opened the package, a explosive device was present and a gift tag that read 'Trick or Treat'. The treat had been his claiming of jewelry, but the trick was far more sinister. Before he had time to think, his whole entire estate blew up in flames. It was part of Kyle's plan to end the El Federaci\u00f3n, but the device itself was designed by the Covenant Remnant. Christmas Eve ( 2559 ) \nASSASSINATION PLOT TO KILL DAVID KING. Life on Sanghelios Edit \nOn the run from UEG Law Enforcement Kyle headed for Sanghelios and furthered his job with the Order of the Assassins . He was given his first assignment and began killing the Covenant Remnant Commander Jul 'Hayash, along with his wife Aisha 'Hayash. After, he left a death threat which instilled other Sangheili in fear and made a promise to kill other Corporate CEO's and Kaidons in order to create chaos and fear in Sanghelios' most powerful states. Josh 'Konar tracked him down little by little, unraveling his clues on other potential targets. Kyle then planed to kill major population groups in other states with the Sarin gas that was provided by the Russian Criminal Syndicate, as a distraction towards his ultimate plan of killing the Arbiter. His plan eventually failed when he met Draco 'Rorke . The two planned to negotiate a temporary alliance in order to take out his main target, but Josh got in the way and instead Kyle planned to take out Fal 'Konar, Josh 'Konar's uncle, instead. Capture and Prison Edit \nWhen he tried to kill Josh 'Konar , he was defeated, arrested by UNSC personnel, and sent to UNSC Maximum Security Detention Facility . During his interrogation he vowed revenge on Josh 'Konar, and after the interrogation was over, he secretly hired a hitman to kill him. \nDuring most of his time in prison, he got into violent fights with a ruthless criminal on Cell Level 3, an African American drug leader. A few racial slurs were tossed back and forth and then what began as a profanity competition grew into a full on blood battle. After a few punches here and there, he tackled the drug leader and punched him on the ground, only to have his face gashed by the makeshift knife that was hidden by his attacker. He managed to disarm the drug lord, breaking his arm. When the drug leader dropped the knife, he grabbed the knife and shanked the drug lord in the abdomen before slitting his throat. \nEMT\u2019s and guards sprang into the room and separated Kyle from the victim, disarming him. Kyle tried to lash out at them with the makeshift knife, but was disarmed and knocked to the ground. Afterwards he was taken to the Cryochamber and put to Cryosleep. Second attempt to kill David King \u201c \nYou left me on Etheria to die! Now you will be the one who's abandoned and forgotten! \u201d \u2014 Kyle Craig expresses his anger towards David King \nOn 2573, Kyle was released from prison by order of the Warden, who was influenced by ONI. ONI had convinced the Warden that Kyle was the only person who knew David well enough to hunt him down and terminate him, while hiding all traces of evidence to prevent public panic, despite Fireteam Wolf's knowledge on David. Kyle also tried to negotiate with the Warden about having his personal belongings returned to him but was denied that due to the risks it would place on the mission. Kyle negotiated with Andrew Cross, leader of ONI's Section Zero, about methods of assassination and the mission. He was assured that any method of assassination was reasonable as long as it was done discreetly. When he was placed on his old team, he was surprised to see his old companions again. He was given standard ballistic protection and weaponry, enough to defend oneself and complete the assassination. He also would have a brace shackled to his ankle to prevent escape and stay within a five mile radius of his team. His team would also know his location at all times. Personality Edit \u201c \nWhat you dont understand is like what your boss said, you cant save everyone. Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties \u2013 up to and including life sentences or even death. Most people recognize this principle as just. \u201d \u2014 Kyle Craig in a discussion with Miller on Jaeter about the moralities of murder. \nKyle Craig views murder as a sport, and will not hesitate to toy with his captives before he finishes them off. He does things according to his own twisted sense of logic, and does not desire money. If there was one thing that he did desire, it would be the power to instill anarchy into his enemies by any means necessary, proving that their organization is meaningless and futile. After his second escape from prison, Kyle rarely killed directly but preferred to manipulate others and use them as disposable pawns when they were no longer of use to him. In moments of desperation or with no foreseeable alternative than violence he would have no problems with threatening or straight-up murder to protect his own life and infamous title as a master criminal or even keep things systematically in place. \nKyle is intelligent and this tends to be his greatest weapon against his enemies. He knows how to hack into systems and be one step ahead of everyone else. He has an obsessive-compulsive desire to not make mistakes and even better, NEVER make the same mistake twice. This also tends to be his greatest weakness because when he makes even the smallest of errors it's difficult for him to rethink his master plans and see's violence as the only solution. He is often confronted by the authorities, but easily evades capture due to the mind games he plays on them. He also has a dark side to his personality, barely showing empathy to his enemies and making them suffer. He also likes to be the center of attention, thus taking up a career in explosives so people know how dangerous he really is as well as the damage he can create. He also believes he is beyond the rules. Laws do not apply to him and remorse is only felt when someone catches and confronts him. \nKyle is also seen as an opportunist, making deals that puts him on the edge. For example, in Chapter 13 of Retaliation, he makes a deal with Draco 'Rorke by promising to push the humans out of Sanghelios and destroy the Sangheili-Human alliance once and for all, in order to give him the opportunity to take out Josh 'Konar. \nHe is also a man of sophistication, it's unknown if he was raised in this manner of upbringing with his adoptive parents, in this case he is a man of the finer things in life, such as his own private collection of brandy, showing an interest in classical orchestra and was able to fluently speak in Sangheili, a trait he shared with his former protege and son Damien Craig. \nAs he grew older into his middle age, his crime's became more sophisticated as well as his insanity.

Wie viel darf die Feier kosten? Hiervon h\u00e4ngt u.a. ab, ob eine Location angemietet werden oder die Feier in den Firmenr\u00e4umen stattfinden soll, was i.d.R. deutlich g\u00fcnstiger ist. Auch das gebotene Programm und das Weihnachts-Menu m\u00fcssen nat\u00fcrlich budgetabh\u00e4ngig ausgew\u00e4hlt werden. G\u00e4steliste \nMitarbeiter mit Partnern oder gar mit der ganzen Familie? Auch dies ist wieder eine Kostenfrage. Von der G\u00e4steliste h\u00e4ngt zudem ab, welche Location und welche Art von Programm sich eignen. Kommen die Mitarbeiter z.B. mit der ganzen Familie zur Feier, so sollte das Programm entsprechend kindgerecht gestaltet werden. \nTerminplanung Interline Limousinenservice [ \nSodann muss ein passender Termin gefunden werden. Dieser sollte einerseits in die Vorweihnachtzeit fallen, andererseits aber auch nicht allzu kurz vor den Feiertagen liegen. Dann k\u00f6nnten m\u00f6glicherweise schon viele Mitarbeiter Urlaub haben oder mit eigenen Weihnachtvorbereitungen besch\u00e4ftigt sein. Steht der Termin fest, k\u00f6nnen geeignete Locations angefragt werden. Da in der Vorweihnachtszeit viele Lokale schnell ausgebucht sind, muss bei einigen eventuell auch schon sehr fr\u00fchzeitig reserviert werden. \nBewirtung und Unterhaltungsprogramm \nIn einem n\u00e4chsten Schritt ist zu \u00fcberlegen, wie die Feier genau gestaltet werden soll. Ist ein gemeinsames Festessen geplant oder soll es z.B. zus\u00e4tzlich ein B\u00fchnenprogramm geben? \nBeim Weihnachtsessen muss zun\u00e4chst eine Entscheidung zwischen Buffet und Menu getroffen werden. Wichtig ist es, bei der Speisenauswahl darauf zu achten, dass wirklich f\u00fcr alle G\u00e4ste etwas dabei ist (Vegetarier, muslimisch- oder j\u00fcdisch Gl\u00e4ubige, Allergiker, kleine Kinder). \nGibt es daneben ein Unterhaltungsprogramm, so sollte dies sowohl zur Firma als auch zu den G\u00e4sten und zur Weihnachtszeit passen. Beliebt sind zum Beispiel Auftritte von Komikern, Kabarettisten, Artisten oder Musikern. Dar\u00fcber hinaus sollte auch an die musikalische Untermalung gedacht werden. H\u00e4ufig nutzt die Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrung die Weihnachtsfeier zudem f\u00fcr eine kurze Ansprache. \nStehen Termin und Programm fest, so m\u00fcssen noch die Einladungen verschickt bzw. verteilt werden. Entweder per E-Mail oder traditionell in Form von Einladungskarten. Sie sollten optisch und inhaltlich ansprechend sein und Lust auf die Feier machen. Wichtig ist die Angabe des Anmeldeschlusses. Soweit noch nicht geschehen, muss sp\u00e4testens, wenn alle Anmeldungen vorliegen und damit die Teilnehmerzahl feststeht, eine geeignete Location reserviert werden. \nTransport und \u00dcbernachtung planen \nJe nachdem wo die Feier stattfindet, m\u00fcssen ggf. Unterk\u00fcnfte f\u00fcr eine Hotel\u00fcbernachtung und/ oder die An- und Abfahrt der G\u00e4ste organisiert werden. Wenn alle G\u00e4ste trotz winterlichen Wetters bequem und trockenen Fu\u00dfes zur Feier kommen sollen, bietet sich ein Shuttle-Service mit Bussen oder Limousinen an. Auch f\u00fcr die sp\u00e4tere Heimfahrt ist er zu empfehlen, denn auf Weihnachtsfeiern wird ja nicht nur gut gegessen, sondern auch gerne das eine oder andere Gl\u00e4schen getrunken. Viele G\u00e4ste begr\u00fc\u00dfen es deshalb, sich nicht selbst hinters Steuer setzen zu m\u00fcssen, um wieder nach Hause zu kommen. \nrsonen wollen anreisen und wie viele Fahrzeuge welcher Gr\u00f6\u00dfe werden ben\u00f6tigt? \n-Sollen Shuttles an unterschiedlichen Orten starten oder zu unterschiedlichen Zeiten zur\u00fcckfahren? Dann sind oft mehrere kleinere Fahrzeuge besser geeignet als ein gro\u00dfer Bus. \n-Muss Gep\u00e4ck f\u00fcr eine \u00dcbernachtung bef\u00f6rdert werden? \n-Wird f\u00fcr eine l\u00e4ngere Fahrt ein Bus mit Bord-K\u00fcche und WC ben\u00f6tigt? \n-Soll es ein Fahrzeug mit Multimedia-Ausstattung sein? \nDienstleister wie der Interline Limousinen- , Reisebus- und Event-Service nehmen ihren Kunden das aufw\u00e4ndige Transportmanagement ab- von der Planung bis zur Durchf\u00fchrung. Je nach Bedarf und individuellem Budget wird ein ma\u00dfgeschneidertes Bef\u00f6rderungskonzept erstellt. F\u00fcr den Transport stehen Fahrzeuge alle Gr\u00f6\u00dfen zur Verf\u00fcgung.

deep state , democrats , Jeannie Rhee , Justice Department , political bias , President Trump , Robert Mueller , Russian collusion hoax , special counsel \n( Natural News ) Months ago critics of special counsel Robert Mueller pointed out that as he was assembling his legal team while ramping up his probe of alleged \u201ccollusion\u201d between the Trump campaign and Russia to \u201csteal the election\u201d from Hillary Clinton \u2014 which we now know is completely bogus \u2014 he appeared to be putting together a hit squad of Democrat-leaning lawyers. \n\u201cFour top lawyers hired by Mueller have contributed tens of thousands of dollars over the years to the Democratic Party and Democratic candidates, including former President Barack Obama and President Donald J. Trump\u2019s 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton,\u201d Lifezette reported in June . \nAs further noted by The National Sentinel , one of those attorneys is Jeannie Rhee. She has worked as a lawyer for the Clinton Foundation and actually helped persuade a federal judge to block a conservative activist\u2019s attempts to require the former first couple to respond under oath to questions under oath surrounding their family-operated charity. (Related: Now DEMS have a \u2018Russia problem.\u2019 ) \nAlso, \u201cRhee donated the maximum individual amount of $2,700 to Clinton in 2015 and 2016. In addition, she gave Obama 2,300 in 2008 and $2,500 in 2011,\u201d the site reported. \u201cWhile still working for the Justice Department, she donated $250 to the Democratic National Committee Services Corp.\u201d \nRhee has also given to other Democrats, including Sens. Mark Udall of New Mexico, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. \nNow, as exclusively reported by Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham on her program Tuesday, Rhee also worked in the Obama Justice Department as a deputy assistant attorney general in the office of legal counsel, which provided legal advice to the Obama White House . \nMoreover, Rhee served as the personal attorney of Obama\u2019s deputy national security advisor, Ben Rhodes . \nAdding more fuel to the bias fire, Ingraham noted that Rhee also worked in private practice with Andrew Weissmann, another Mueller team member who received deserved criticism this past week after it was discovered that he sent demonstrably partisan email to a former top Justice Department official. He praised outgoing Acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to enforce Trump\u2019s first travel ban. \n\u201cI\u2019m so proud and in awe. Thank you so much. All my deepest respect,\u201d he wrote. Trump fired Yates after she refused to do her job. \nRhee becomes the third member of the Mueller team to demonstrate \u201cbrazen partisanship\u201d towards the party opposed to the president, behind FBI counterterrorism investigator Peter Strzok (who has since been demoted off the investigation) and Weissmann, who also has a history of donating to Democrats, including then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008, during his first campaign for president, when he wrote a check for $2,300. \n\u201cThere is no way these people are going to be fair to Trump \u2013 a fact not lost on former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal advisor to the president,\u201d The National Sentinel noted. \nIngraham agrees. \n\u201cWhat Mueller did was hire a pedigree team of obvious partisans,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should all step aside, including Bob Mueller.\u201d \nShe\u2019s not the first to call for Mueller to step down, especially as more is learned about Strzok \u2014 who exchanged anti-Trump, pro-Clinton emails with FBI lawyer Lisa Page, whom he was also having an extramarital affair with. \n\u201cRepublicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair. Look who he is hiring. check fec reports. Time to rethink,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., tweeted in June, using the acronym for the Federal Election Commission, which tracks political donations. \nIn November, House Republicans introduced a resolution calling on Mueller to step down after it\u2019s become obvious he\u2019s a deep state operative who is so overwhelmingly compromised it\u2019s hard to imagine we\u2019re watching real life and not a Hollywood political thriller. \n\u201cMueller\u2019s got to go\u2026 Congressional pressure is growing by the hour,\u201d Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., said. \u201cMueller was not a spectator to the transactions\u201d regarding the Uranium One scandal and other events \u201cthat now give us grave concern,\u201d he added. \nNatural News founder/editor Mike Adams, writing at network affiliate site News Target , added that it is \u201ctime to ARREST Robert Mueller, James Comey, Hillary Clinton, Peter Strzok and the rest of the lawless gang trying to overthrow America.\u201d \nRead more of J.D.

December is a month for toys \u2013 and product safety. \nSafety is important all year round, but December is an ideal month to make sure kids\u2019 gifts are properly labeled. DENVER (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 In December, parents and companies alike can pause to make sure the gifts their kids are receiving and the toys they are playing with are safe. It\u2019s officially Safe Toys and Gifts Month, which makes sense, given the toy-centric nature of the holiday season. December\u2019s association with toys and other presents for kids is unshakeable, and businesses that make these items should take a little time and effort to produce warning labels that adequately describe their products. Managing the Risk Some items are only safe presents if their recipients have reached a certain age. Others have potential risks that kids and parents should be aware of, however old they are. Printed labels clearly giving restrictions and other relevant information are essential parts of toy packaging. While regulations on this subject must be obeyed without fail, they\u2019re only the beginning. Companies should go above and beyond requirements to show they\u2019re looking out for customers and kids. Addressing Danger via Custom Labels \u201cSafety is important all year round, but December is an ideal month to make sure kids\u2019 gifts are properly labeled,\u201d said Lightning Labels Director of Business Development AnneMarie Campbell. \u201cCustom labels can be a key safety reminder.\u201d Companies that see an opportunity to make toy age ranges and other warnings clearer, more accurate or more visible can contact Lightning Labels to learn more about custom product labels .

Justin Trudeau says Canada is looking for \u201cprogressive\u201d trade deals. The big buildup, the anticipation and then \u2026 nothing. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should have stayed in bed, colloquially speaking, and spared taxpayers the expense of yet another high-end jaunt to Beijing with a cadre of cabinet ministers and bureaucrats. Or are we to believe Trudeau was tricked by China and led to assume before boarding his flight that great inroads would be made into a bilateral free trade agreement between his democracy and its dictatorship? He sure made it appear that way, having suddenly inserted China into his schedule as if Canada was about to make history as the first G7 country to strike a two-way deal with the Red Dragon. In the end, however, he got bitten instead. And his disappointment showed. Sixteen hours in the air \u2014 one way \u2014 and nothing as payoff other than jet lag and a fancy hotel room stay. Following Monday\u2019s meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in the Great Hall of the People overlooking Tiananmen Square, it was obvious the two leaders had not agreed on much during their extended private meeting. Trudeau said the talks were \u201cfrank.\u201d Li said the talks were \u201ccandid.\u201d This, of course, is code-speak for \u201cwe banged heads.\u201d Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, right, walks with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang during a welcome ceremony held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, Monday, Dec. 4, 2017. (Ng Han Guan/AP) Almost immediately, the scheduled press conference with Li and Trudeau was abruptly called off, with the prime minister\u2019s office insisting it was the Chinese who put the kibosh on it, not their contingent. So much for great expectations. Trudeau didn\u2019t stand a hope, of course, if he thought China would buy into his progressive inclinations when it comes to free trade. Human rights? Labour standards? Gender equality? These are as foreign to fascist China as foreign can be. It is a communist dictatorship, after all, and just because Red China has been dropped as a descriptor over the years for the sake of diplomacy doesn\u2019t change the fact that China is as communist now as it was under Mao. China cares nothing about free enterprise and private ownership because it cares everything about state enterprise and state ownership . It is a country that relies on cheap labour to produce nasty plastic baubles and goods for a western market \u2014 check out where your artificial Christmas tree and national flags were manufactured \u2013 and once enforced a one-child policy that began in 1979 and was not phased out until 2015 out of fears of an unaffordable over-population should too many girls be born. This is the real China, a one-party state with a one-party mindset. As Li put it, \u201cBoth sides share the view that, due to national circumstances, it\u2019s only natural that we don\u2019t see eye-to-eye on some issues.\u201d Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau takes part in an event at Sina Weibo Headquarters in Beijing, China on Monday, Dec. 4, 2017, to promote Canada-China tourism. It was a brilliantly-put understatement, and worth a bonus being paid to the translator for couching it so deftly. So, what has come out of Trudeau\u2019s trip thus far? Not much. The two countries agreed to promote greater tourism, and work together on climate change, all predictable but hardly what prompted for Trudeau to fly 10,500 klicks to Beijing for a four-day Chinese layover. Was he played? Did the Chinese set him up for embarrassment? It is almost impossible to believe that Trudeau would travel such great distance, with the parliamentary press gallery in steerage, without being assured that free-trade negotiations with China would officially be launched. So, someone must have set him up \u2014 whether one of his own people or someone within the Chinese bureaucracy. There is no other conclusion to be drawn considering the non-outcome of the trip, other than to say Trudeau is that dumb. It\u2019s a wonder he didn\u2019t cry.

That\u2019s close to a third of the entire country\u2019s population, and undoubtedly a serious problem. \nRecent research from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) brings to light the fact that current methods of helping people recover and stay off their abused substances may need to be reworked. Apparently, some aspects of substance abuse treatment may not be as effective as other methods that are mostly being overlooked. Survey respondents almost split \nAccording to a study from the MGH Recovery Research Institute, more than nine percent of survey respondents consider themselves to be free of their old alcohol and drug use problems, thanks to their own efforts aided by sort of assistance. Meanwhile, only 46 percent of respondents referred to themselves as \u201cin recovery.\u201d That also means that the same number of people were able to overcome their problems without any sort of assistance whatsoever. \nAlthough that wasn\u2019t exactly what the survey was trying to find out, it\u2019s a great discovery that\u2019s leading researchers like John Kelly, Ph.D., to think about how current methods of treating people with substance abuse problems can and should be changed. \nIn particular, Kelly says that, \u201cThe number of people who have overcome serious alcohol and other drug problems and exactly how they have achieved that has been a question of increasing general interest and public health interest.\u201d So it\u2019s important not just that people are able to recover, but that they recover using the preferred or prescribed methods. And if they didn\u2019t, the exact reasons why should be fully explored. \nIt\u2019s not just about making sure that treatment programs are effective. It\u2019s also about knowing other methods which may be possible for those who don\u2019t or can\u2019t employ any assistance. How the study was performed \nFor the study, the researchers found a representative sample of 55,000 U.S. adults by surveying members of the KnowledgePanel of the research company GfK. And from that pool, a group of almost 40,000 people were asked the question, \u201cDid you used to have a problem with drugs or alcohol but no longer do?\u201d \nThe survey came back with answers from more than 25,000 panel members, of which 2,047 said that they did overcome alcohol or drug use problems, amounting to 9.1 percent. Those respondents were then sent a link to the full study survey, which resulted in 2,002 responses that were fit for analysis. \nFrom this sample of survey respondents, the researchers were able to determine that 54 percent of those who reported successfully resolving their substance use problems relied on some kind of assistance to do so. It was also revealed that those who received such assistance tended to be those with more severe issues, such as those who started using at a younger age or used several substances at the same time frame. \nAs for the rest of the respondents, they confirmed something that the researchers say was already known: that most people who \u201cmeet diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder and remit from their disorder do so without any kind of formal assistance.\u201d This is according to Kelly, who also says, \u201cThis study expands those prior findings to people who resolve significant but less serious AOD (alcohol and other drug) problems and suggests we may need to broaden our thinking about how people solve these problems without formal help .\u201d \nThe findings in this study directly contradict what many clinicians and researchers \u2014 as well as people in the general public \u2014 believe to be necessary to overcome a drug or alcohol use problem: that you need to \u201cgo to rehab\u201d or go to a well-known organization for treatment. For Kelly, this is a huge indicator that there may be \u201ca need to broaden our collective cultural mindset\u201d to fully overcome the problem as a society. There is power in the individual , after all. \nRead about more addiction at Addiction.news . \nSources include:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "recovery research institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts general hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mgh recovery research institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gfk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mgh", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:58.044+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f8bfd3a0a5bd388ce12d12e9518b0effa173a51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSwdWXoRh.CUs0ZeLvKTyGTWyv0Nh6QyHYuGoqJsMG3ItORItlPlDNt3LSLlaXUVwLrwHHG3nTftcBSFLOE5jTUhYXYuT6Ux3d6eFRZGZXfSY-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Sex", "title": "Sex on Saturday after 7 years of \"Dry Spell\".

And yes, we arranged it beforehand, because I'm a little nervous, and she's really awesome! I had my 28th birthday the day before, and by my calculations, I haven't had sex in roughly 7 years.\nI won't go super into the details of why, but after College, I got ill. I have an autoimmune disease, that's not curable, and I've spend years, trying to find medications that work for my condition. My body has also changed dramatically - In those 7 years I've been both overweight, and also anemic and underweight at least two times. I also have arthritis, I drink a lot of medication, and I'm a picky eater by necessity. Dating, drinking alcohol, going on restaurants, were not things I wanted to do. I moved back to my hometown, where I no longer had any social contacts. In general years flew by, without me realizing.\nAnyway I'm spinning a little out of control and I'm really nervous for Saturday! It's not the usual fears guys may ahve - last long or anything like that. I'm not overweight at the moment, but I'm also not feeling super attractive, and I can't fathom, why anyone would want to see me naked. I'm also not very experienced to begin with. I've never had adult sex! I've had drunken college sex, and I've had drunken awkward high school sex, but not proper adult, normal sex. I pretty much missed those years.\nI'm afraid I'll disappoint basically, and will ruin a good new relationship I have. I'm afraid I'll be really awkward and embarrassing. Should I talk about all of that with her before hand? Will that just ruin the mood? Should I ask her questions during sex, to make sure she's enjoying it? Should I go slow, or just make it a quickie, and get it over with? How do i focus on her, without betraying how little experience I actually have? Basically how do normal adult people have sex?\nSorry for my ramblings, I'd appreciate any suggestions, and help.\n submitted by /u/NoIdea89\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:59.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d59ffb42e5b6bdeba65789808fa71db7c5f0aa43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.kBusVGiehOW.XEQsdCCCCxicpRmT30GwM4lh3NJMZP5y_4t9xxWMkOM.8V09w5ztwecpPwh3rXVsQc.1kgnbX6PSnnwoMJjA2cpRecCoBTA--", "site_full": "www.showhouse.co.uk", "site": "showhouse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://showhouse.co.uk/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Show House", "title": "William Davis Homes announces Apprentice of the Year", "title_full": "William Davis Homes announces Apprentice of the Year", "published": "2017-12-07T06:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.showhouse.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/171207_WilliamDavisapprentice.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d59ffb42e5b6bdeba65789808fa71db7c5f0aa43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.kBusVGiehOW.XEQsdCCCCxicpRmT30GwM4lh3NJMZP5y_4t9xxWMkOM.8V09w5ztwecpPwh3rXVsQc.1kgnbX6PSnnwoMJjA2cpRecCoBTA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Keith Osborne", "published": "2017-12-07T06:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "William Davis Homes announces Apprentice of the Year", "text": "Home Career William Davis Homes announces Apprentice of...

Ben\u2019s mentors regularly praise his progression and determination to make the most of every learning opportunity; describing him as conscientious, well-mannered and enthusiastic. A popular member of his site team, Ben is a deserving winner of the 2017 Apprentice of the Year award.\u201d \nAmanda Drabant, CITB apprenticeship officer added: \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult this year to help choose the correct two winners as there were many potential candidates. Ben and Jake are polite, dedicated and keen to learn; and each of them shows very promising signs of becoming an exceptional tradesman. They both consistently demonstrate what we have come to expect of award-winning apprentices.\u201d \nDid you like this?

[Associated Press] FAYETTEVILLE, Arkansas - \nA person with direct knowledge of the decision tells The Associated Press that Arkansas has hired SMU's Chad Morris to become the school's new football coach. \nThe 49-year-old Morris agrees to a six-year contract and replaces Bret Bielema, who was fired after a regular-season ending loss to Missouri last month. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the decision hasn't been made public yet. \nMorris leaves the Mustangs after compiling a 14-22 record in three seasons. He took over an SMU team that finished 1-11 in 2014, won two games his first season and improved to 5-7 in 2016 and 7-5 this year. \nThe Texas native was a longtime high school coach in the state before beginning his collegiate career as the offensive coordinator at Tulsa in 2010. He then spent four years as the offensive coordinator at Clemson, helping lay the foundation for the Tigers' national championship last season.

If you\u2019re lucky enough to have a fully stocked Kmart near you then the short lifespan isn\u2019t a problem, however my residing in the UK has left me resorting to M&S multi pack but thats another review..\nVPL\nYou can see the seams through a pair of tights however these guys do not cut into your bod. So you may look a little Kim Craig, but at least you\u2019ll look and feel as if you\u2019ve got the right size.\nAdd to Basket\nYou can buy these babies online and instore from Kmart.\n4 pairs for 8 of your AUD\nSummary\nDon\u2019t expect to get more than a year from these fellas. But also get ready to find your new favourite jean undies. 8.5/10\nNamastay Put Thong* \u2013 Lululemon Athletica \nComfortability\nThe cotton is very light and breathable, however I did find they sit too low on my hips to be comfortable with the high rise tights/pants/shorts/jeans I gravitate towards. There are thin lines of silicon on the upper band of the undies to stop them from budging during movement, though I felt this was unnecessary as I had never experienced wondering undies and therefore didn\u2019t see the logic behind attempting to lock them into place.\nDurability\nThese began showing little holes along the upper seams after the second wash, which was just disappointing considering how pretty and pricey they were.\nVPL\nLululemon excels when it comes to shaping wear and lines, or in this case lack of. From the outside you never would have guessed I was wearing underwear. \nAdd to Basket\nYou can get your hands on these in all online and in stores.\n12 GBP each\nSummary\nThese are expensive little folds of cotton, personally they sat too low on my bot and fell apart far too quickly. 6/10\n*The particular undies I tried and tested are no longer available in store. The upgraded versions are meant to be the bees knees, I\u2019ll let you know..\nOrganic Bamboo Eco Wear Women\u2019s G-String \u2013 Boody Australia\nComfortability\nOn the first wear I felt these bad boys were hugging a little tight. However after a couple of washes and km\u2019s under the belt they began to reduce their intensity.\nDurability\nNow I don\u2019t know the socially appropriate amount of time to own and use a pair of underwear, but I am honest and have no shame; I have had this particular pair for four years and they are still in perfect working condition. Elastic is still snappy and there aren\u2019t any holes where there shouldn\u2019t be.\nVPL\nFor some reason, these particular pants didn\u2019t have as much give as others. So if you\u2019re having a bit of a bloaty day you experience a bit of cutting in.\nAdd to Basket\nYou\u2019ll find these and a full range of beautiful under bits online and in selected health stores for 12.95 AUD each\nSummary\nBuying these undies is like buying a good pair of Levis; you\u2019ll get your monies worth.\n*This post is not at all useful for those with external reproductive organs.

KRAK\u00d3W, Poland (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 WorkHQ , a China-based inventory management software signed a 5-year contract today with RepuX , an Ethereum-backed platform and protocol for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to earn rewards for sharing data. The agreement will give SME\u2019s using WorkHQs software to manage sales and purchase orders across Amazon, Taobao, and Tmall the option of earning rewards for selling encrypted data on the RepuX platform. RepuX brings value back to businesses by providing a secure platform for data to be sold to interested parties. It is costly and time consuming to maintain large data sets and, until recently, there has not been an easy way for businesses to monetize and repurpose their data despite interest from developers looking to build applications with AI and machine learning capabilities. Justifiably, many businesses have expressed concerns from a security perspective about sharing proprietary information. RepuX addresses need for incentive and concerns about security with its blockchain-backed platform that encrypts all data and rewards businesses in cryptocurrency for sharing data with developers and other interested parties. The distributed aspect of the blockchain-backed network enables RepuX to meet developers main consideration \u2014 the quality of data \u2014 by enabling data purchasers to rate the quality with reputation scores. Developers can trust the validity of data that has been vetted by the network because its value is not being determined by a single, centralized entity, but by peers. WorkHQ is incorporating RepuX\u2019s technology into applications used by SMEs to provide clients with a means to sell their data in return for RepuX tokens. The RepuX token sale will be launching in February of 2018.

As shoppers continue hunting for the perfect gift over the next couple weeks, it\u2019s important to remember that cyber criminals will likely be on the hunt as well. How prepared are retailers to deal with an attack? \nIn an effort to answer that question, Tripwire surveyed IT security professionals working in retail organisations about their experiences and attitudes towards factors affecting IT security. The results found that a large majority are not fully prepared for data breaches this holiday season. \nOf the respondents, only 28% of respondents said they have a fully tested plan in place in the event of a security breach. 21% said their organisation doesn\u2019t have a plan at all, and the same proportion of respondents said they didn\u2019t have the means to notify customers of a data breach within 72 hours, a requirement specified by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). \n\u201cConsidering the amount of high-profile data breaches that have occurred recently, plus the continued discussion around GDPR, it is surprising and concerning that many retailers do not have a tested plan in the event of a security breach,\u201d said Tim Erlin, vice president of product management and strategy at Tripwire. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging that most respondents think they can meet the 72-hour notification window as set out in the upcoming GDPR, but if they haven\u2019t tested their plans, I don\u2019t know how confident they should be in that assumption.\u201d \nOnly a small minority of the retail industry felt fully secure in their incident response capabilities. 23% of respondents said they were \u201cfully prepared\u201d to absorb potential financial penalties. Even fewer professionals (15%) said they were fully prepared to manage customer and press communications following an incident. \nNot all the survey\u2019s findings were discouraging, however. The results did provide some hope that the industry is moving in the right direction. More than half of respondents (57%) said that their organisation\u2019s ability to detect and respond to a security breach has improved in the past year and a half. With the holiday season in full swing, organisations should make sure they have proper security safeguards in place. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really critical that organisations have a good view of what\u2019s on their network at all times, that they harden their systems with secure configuration and vulnerability management, and that they are able to continuously monitor for change and are alerted to any drift outside the established security and compliance policies,\u201d said Erlin. \nThere are a number of effective and established security control frameworks available to guide organisations, such as the CIS Critical Security Controls . Implementing even the most basic security controls can go a long way in improving an organisation\u2019s security posture. \nComment on this article below or via Twitter: @IoTNow_ OR @jcIoTnow Posted In ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim erlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erlin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cis critical security controls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general data protection regulation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "95d66f867a759b7baadb6274f5a73882bc12fc8f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSwdWXoRh.CUs0ZeLvKTyGTWkMpaaTfBIAep9GvwojVvFM7g7RPsY1yK.p2rJ2Vd3J1zYJNXN3Li2Sc8mF1hcgDybHJKrKa1VCbkqLRAkK6K0-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Sex", "title": "How to get over embarrassment of my breast size when having sex?", "title_full": "How to get over embarrassment of my breast size when having sex? : sex", "published": "2017-12-07T14:51:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3d02942d8a97a0dd26f13d9926d8578a34c1118d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSwdWXoRh.CUs0ZeLvKTyGTWkMpaaTfBIAep9GvwojVvFM7g7RPsY1yK.p2rJ2Vd3J1zYJNXN3Li2Sc8mF1hcgDybHJKrKa1VCqFMTYzcAC9p0mkbIBPMsthze1kPtMg_e", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "neversiempre", "published": "2017-12-07T15:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Tell him to tone it down.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "95d66f867a759b7baadb6274f5a73882bc12fc8f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSwdWXoRh.CUs0ZeLvKTyGTWkMpaaTfBIAep9GvwojVvFM7g7RPsY1yK.p2rJ2Vd3J1zYJNXN3Li2Sc8mF1hcgDybHJKrKa1VCbkqLRAkK6K0-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Sex", "title": "How to get over embarrassment of my breast size when having sex?", "title_full": "How to get over embarrassment of my breast size when having sex? : sex", "published": "2017-12-07T14:51:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "76d81b56ee64a442c0c54e51850bd51ab97094c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSwdWXoRh.CUs0ZeLvKTyGTWkMpaaTfBIAep9GvwojVvFM7g7RPsY1yK.p2rJ2Vd3J1zYJNXN3Li2Sc8mF1hcgDybHJKrKa1VCqFMTYzcAC9p0mkbIBPMstnsfJBtSID9I", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "numberonerr", "published": "2017-12-07T17:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Have you went to therapy?

A new report from the In-vehicle UX (IVX) group at Strategy Analytics \u201cPersonalised Displays: A Potential Difference-Maker for In-Car HMI\u201d, surveying consumers in the US, Western Europe and China regarding their interest in personalising the appearance of their in-car displays, has found that wide swaths of consumers show some level of interest in customisable displays. These expectations are primarily driven by the immersive and very personal relationship most consumers now have with their smartphone. \nKey report findings include: As touchscreen-enabled smartphones complete their market saturation, and touch-enabled smart devices spread through the home and retail spaces, Strategy Analytics has found changes in the way consumers (particularly tech enthusiasts and early adopters) think about their in-car experiences. Predictably, more consumers are saying that they want their in-car display to behave like a smartphone. As automakers strive to differentiate their HMI, personalisation provides added value that has thus far remained untapped. Careful implementation is required however to ensure this is accomplished in a practical and usable way. \nDerek Viita, report author and senior analyst commented, \u201cBut as any product manager in the automotive space will attest: A car is not a smartphone. As long as a human remains in the loop, design considerations for the car will remain far different. Customised displays, though desirable, present some challenges in this unique use case where distraction must be taken into account. Background images must not wash out iconography, touch targets, or labeling. A user must be limited to a reasonably low number of options on each screen.\u201d \nAdded Chris Schreiner, director, Syndicated Research UXIP, \u201cHowever HMI, particularly for infotainment, is an area that can be quickly and easily innovated upon. If done correctly, through a conscientious effort to put the target consumer first in building safe, usable, and delightful UIs, customisable in-car displays could be low-hanging fruit for a forward-thinking interior design team.\u201d \nClick here for report. \nComment on this article below or via Twitter: @IoTNow_ OR @jcIoTnow Posted In ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zenobia hegde december", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derek viita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris schreiner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hmi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "strategy analytics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "viita of strategy analytics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syndicated research uxip", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7185f0084967a2cc2564464d73a4e607fae923b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9pi8_peWGxl_9CLv9zxzXjeagtWWAjyvkdZbYi_38FF9.QOBB05L4CdRvSDJYP8lp8_gyez3W7mUpG5O0gC7JBkNcRKLjRfO4-", "site_full": "www.onomesblog.com", "site": "onomesblog.com", "site_section": "http://www.onomesblog.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Onome's Blog", "title": "\u201cI Won\u2019t Bow To Society Pressure To Marry\u201d \u2013 Actress Rita Dominic", "title_full": "\u201cI Won\u2019t Bow To Society Pressure To Marry\u201d \u2013 Actress Rita Dominic", "published": "2017-12-07T12:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7185f0084967a2cc2564464d73a4e607fae923b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9pi8_peWGxl_9CLv9zxzXjeagtWWAjyvkdZbYi_38FF9.QOBB05L4CdRvSDJYP8lp8_gyez3W7mUpG5O0gC7JBkNcRKLjRfO4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "onome sandra (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u201cI Won\u2019t Bow To Society Pressure To Marry\u201d \u2013 Actress Rita Dominic", "text": "\nNollywood actress, Rita Dominic has vowed not to bow to society pressure to get married despite time running against her at 42.\n\nThe Theater Arts graduate from the University of Port Harcourt, who is one of Africa\u2019s most accomplished actresses, has often had to deal with issues with a man.\n\nBut in an interview with a Nigerian magazine recently, the screen diva explained that while it\u2019s not her doing that she is still single at her age, she would only commit to marriage on her own terms and conditions.\n\nShe said:\n\n\u201cI will live with the man, so it is very important that I do it because I want to, not because society wants it for me\u201d \n\nWhile expressing optimism that she would marry soon, the actress said she would wait for God\u2019s right time.\n\n\u201cI believe that God is in control of my life and will present the right man to me at the right time.\u201d \nOn the question of whether she is currently dating, She said:\n\n\u201cI do date sometimes when someone comes around.\n\n\u201cI love being totally drawn to someone and doing all the loving things couples do, but I am wary of liars and bullies\u201d, Rita Dominic added.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rita dominic  nollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rita dominic", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of port harcourt", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "75a67597f7869b9841e67d3be18c8032afca9bac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj16JfG7tME857oqwGjf4Ey98JBXGqUkyYUQYteFlxTsG7i_S83U6UWNoIMXqs7hESoj6owuH5d3onYt.F4FYeqfBYLxunllmV2K1DajzZ0PqvBuqOKk3YkIoZprbRQhLg_hHMWK._HX0F7A6Dd0KbFPjln.z6_Ck6mivF_NDf5t9", "site_full": "forums.wynncraft.com", "site": "wynncraft.com", "site_section": "https://forums.wynncraft.com/forums/general-suggestions.69/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "General Suggestions | Wynncraft Forums", "title": "World - 1 Roast = 1 Like : Update The Nether 41 People Want It, 33 People Think I Should Stop Using Drugs!

Trump was accused of creating another \u2018controversy\u2019 when he dared to exercise his constitutional authority as head of the Executive Branch and appoint his Office of Budget Management director Mick Mulvaney to head up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \nThe appointment sparked a lawsuit from the agency\u2019s acting director, Leandra English, who claimed that under the law creating the CFPB, the outgoing director gets to name his or her replacement. \nA federal judge, Timothy Kelly, ruled against English in late November and allowed Mulvaney\u2019s appointment to proceed. But now, a New York-based credit union has filed suit in Manhattan federal court to have Mulvaney removed, presumably to have English replace him and for certain to deny Trump the appointment. \nWhat in the world is so important about preventing Trump from putting in his own appointee in this particular federal agency ? \nMaybe it\u2019s because the agency is not really about \u2018protecting consumers\u2019 but all about enhancing and funding Alt-Left groups and causes. And we have none other than Sen. Elizabeth \u201cPocahontas\u201d Warren, D-Mass., to thank for it, since the CFBP was her brainchild. \nSo naturally, Warren was outraged when Trump appointed Mulvaney instead. Outraged not only because this upstart outsider president dared to assert his Article II appointment authority, but because now, with Mulvaney in and English out, the corruption and scheming are set to be exposed as well. \nWriting in The New York Post , investigative reporter Paul Sperry notes that the CFPB has engaged in your garden variety Washington swamp corruption \u2014 everything from using secret ledgers to utilizing penalties leveled against certain financial institutions and then \u2018laundering\u2019 the collected fines to Left-wing causes. \nAnd get this: Warren and her Democratic colleagues wrote the \u201cDodd-Frank\u201d law creating the CFPB to ensure it was an agency that could operate independently from the U.S. government, drawing its funding directly from the U.S. Treasury. So naturally, a full audit of the agency has never been done, though that is likely to change under Mulvaney\u2019s conservative leadership. \nHence the outrage. \nAs Sperry notes, on Mulvaney\u2019s first day on the job he implemented a 30-day freeze on all new hires and on the issuance of new regulations, which was met with approval, naturally, from America\u2019s beleaguered financial industry, which has been under assault from the CFPB since its inception. \n\u201cIt is a completely unaccountable agency, and I think that\u2019s wrong,\u201d said Mulvaney. \u201cIf the law allowed this place not to exist, I\u2019d sit down with the president to try to make the case that other agencies can do this job well if not more effectively.\u201d (Related: LOCK THEM UP: Why it\u2019s time to arrest James Comey, Robert Mueller, Peter Strzok and the other swamp creatures staging an attempted coup .) \nAnd with far less corruption, too. For example, as Sperry wrote, agency officials have \u201cbounced business owners and industry reps from secret meetings\u2026held with Democratic operatives, radical civil-rights activists, trial lawyers and other \u2018community advisers,\u2019 according to a report by the House Financial Services Committee.\u201d \nIn addition, CFPB has in the past retained a liberal advocacy group, GMMB, which created ads for the Obama and Hillary Clinton campaigns, costing taxpayers in excess of $40 million, \u201cmaking the Democrat shop the sole recipient of CFPB\u2019s advertising expenditure.\u201d \nThe agency has met behind closed doors to write financial regulatory policy with groups known for shaking down banks and which have taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal grant money to manufacture housing and lending discrimination complaints, which in turn get fed back to the CFPB. \nAlso, the agency has \u201cfunneled a large portion of more than $5 billion in penalties collected from defendants to community organizers aligned with Democrats \u2014 \u2018a slush fund by another name,\u2019\u201d according to a consultant who worked with the CFPB on its Civil Penalty Fund, Perry noted. \nPutting Mulvaney in and keeping English out gives Trump a huge opportunity to continue making good on his pledge to dramatically scale back regulations , which he correctly notes are job killers. \n\u201cIf you\u2019re wondering about his commitment to deregulation , don\u2019t,\u201d Mulvaney told a libertarian group earlier this year, \u201cbecause this is one of the things he pounds on again and again and again\u201d in White House meetings. \nNeutering the CFPB will also deprive Alt-Left groups of ill-gotten gains as well, much to Pocahontas\u2019 chagrin. \nSpecial counsel, Mr. President? \nJ.D.

MTN will be the first mobile operator in South Africa to deploy Cisco Jasper Control Centre, the automated connectivity management platform for IoT. The partnership also represents Cisco Jasper\u2019s initial expansion into South Africa. \nMariana Kruger, general manager for ICT Solutions at MTN Business , says this partnership will entrench MTN\u2019s position in the IoT and connected vehicles space and will give IoT device and vehicle manufacturers the opportunity to leverage MTN\u2019s expansive network. While this solution will initially be rolled out in South Africa, plans are in place to leverage MTN\u2019s data centres across its 22 points of presence across Africa. \n\u201cOur business customers in nearly every industry are looking to innovate and transform their businesses by offering connected services,\u201d said Kruger. \u201cThe combination of our powerful mobile networks and Cisco Jasper\u2019s leading IoT platform will empower our customers to deliver new connected services that generate recurring revenues, while also enhancing their customers\u2019 experiences. More enterprises globally rely on Cisco Jasper Control Centre than any other IoT platform, and we are excited to bring its capabilities to our customers.\u201d \nKruger says MTN is starting to reap the benefits of the substantial investment it has made in its network, and the strategic partnerships it has forged in the IoT space. \n\u201cOver the past three years, we have invested substantially in our network and have forged strategic partnerships with leading global players in the IoT space. These interventions have put us in a better position to provide our customers with a distinct customer experience. \nThe partnership between Cisco Jasper and MTN has several synergies \u2013 both companies have the unrivalled capacity and expertise to provide NB-IoT services to enterprise customers. In addition, the technologies that we have invested in give MTN the ability to provide cutting-edge and tailored propositions to our clients, while delivering a secure and fool-proof connection,\u201d concludes Kruger. \nMTN sees significant demand for the Control Centre platform across all markets, and particularly from the following segments: Telematics & vehicle diagnostics \u2013 Connected Car initiatives enable auto makers worldwide to constantly monitor the performance of their vehicles and proactively address any issues before they cause a problem for drivers. Cisco Jasper has a deep history in the Connected Car market, with 50 of the world\u2019s largest auto brands using Control Centre for their Connected Car initiatives. Vehicle tracking \u2013 Vehicle connectivity enables a range of vehicle tracking services, from remote tracking to aid in recovery of stolen vehicles to the monitoring of vehicles for better fleet management. Building security and automation \u2013 Connectivity has transformed how we interact with both commercial properties and our homes, making them more efficient, secure and responsive to our needs. The more we value these services, the more pivotal connectivity becomes, which is why many of the world\u2019s largest building security and automation providers rely on the Cisco Jasper platform. Logistics \u2013 IoT is a critical enabler for optimising and automating logistics businesses. Cisco Jasper Control Centre enables companies to increase productivity and profitability with real-time visibility, automated controls, and remote diagnostics that optimise performance and quickly identify, solve and prevent issues. Kalle Ward \nAs a global market leader, the Cisco Jasper Control Centre platform is the IoT connectivity management platform of choice of over 14,000 enterprises worldwide. Control Centre enables these companies to rapidly and efficiently launch, manage and monetise their IoT services, while providing the flexibility for businesses to scale those IoT services worldwide to meet the changing needs and expectations of their customers. \n\u201cFor more than a decade, Cisco Jasper has been helping enterprises across every industry to enhance their customers\u2019 experiences through connected services,\u201d said Kalle Ward, managing director EMEAR, IoT Cloud at Cisco Jasper. \n\u201cWe do this by partnering with the most strategic mobile operators, and by combining the Control Centre platform with their mobile networks and expertise, together we help businesses automate and manage the delivery of their IoT services globally. We are excited to partner with MTN and to expand into South Africa to serve this new, strategic market.\u201d \nComment on this article below or via Twitter: @IoTNow_ OR @jcIoTnow Posted In ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cisco jasper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zenobia hegde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kalle ward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mariana kruger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kruger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emear", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mtn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mtn business posted", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cisco jasper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ict solutions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cisco jasper control centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mtn business", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.034+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "75a67597f7869b9841e67d3be18c8032afca9bac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj16JfG7tME857oqwGjf4Ey98JBXGqUkyYUQYteFlxTsG7i_S83U6UWNoIMXqs7hESoj6owuH5d3onYt.F4FYeqfBYLxunllmV2K1DajzZ0PqvBuqOKk3YkIoZprbRQhLg_hHMWK._HX0F7A6Dd0KbFPjln.z6_Ck6mivF_NDf5t9", "site_full": "forums.wynncraft.com", "site": "wynncraft.com", "site_section": "https://forums.wynncraft.com/forums/general-suggestions.69/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "General Suggestions | Wynncraft Forums", "title": "World - 1 Roast = 1 Like : Update The Nether 41 People Want It, 33 People Think I Should Stop Using Drugs! 4", "title_full": "World - 1 Roast = 1 Like : Update The Nether 41 People Want It, 33 People Think I Should Stop Using Drugs! | Page 4 | Wynncraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-01T11:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.01, "main_image": "https://forums.wynncraft.com/data/avatars/m/79/79003.jpg?1485699490", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0a20e6b7d257aca083a2fcdeb67553a0f6d0fc5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj16JfG7tME857oqwGjf4Ey98JBXGqUkyYUQYteFlxTsG7i_S83U6UWNoIMXqs7hESoj6owuH5d3onYt.F4FYeqfBYLxunllmV2K1DajzZ0PqvBuqOKk3YkIoZprbRQhLg_hHMWK._HX0F7A6Dd0KbFPjln.z6_Ck6m1y6hZAhVBJkFGYel.0W6Q-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Khaps", "published": "2017-12-02T20:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "35 people want it!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.035+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93322fd7a2825576d96bfe577b62fe369af7948a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSwdWXoRh.CUs0ZeLvKTyGTbZLnGlc2wo0xrJ1XX2xUFwU59F7EcWYpSu3iUX4Ur1armC1DGgimxqXf4T1vTQMuQ--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Sex", "title": "Dog tail plug suggestions", "title_full": "Dog tail plug suggestions : sex", "published": "2017-12-07T14:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "58368952b7a25fbd8cebbc863bc0f954cee09029", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSwdWXoRh.CUs0ZeLvKTyGTbZLnGlc2wo0xrJ1XX2xUFwU59F7EcWYpSu3iUX4Ur1armC1DGgimxrl2kE93fzEoOygNE65suLdgkrtcXcoOaM-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "SparklingFuriosa", "published": "2017-12-07T16:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "It also depends a bit on where you live and what you want.

His father was against it and encouraged him to take up a career as a director, due to his high intelligence and his mindset for perfection. David turned it down because he sought adventure and a chance to learn new skills in the military. He passed his military exams with a high score and was recruited into the UNSC Special Forces. After displaying good combat skills, tactical marksmanship, and passing three additional layers of screening, he moved into the ODST's 7th Shock Troops Battalion and was a member of second squad , and specialized in direct action . Insurrection on Mamore Edit \nOn March 2552, David entered a bar that served the local citizens of Mamore. David talked among his fellow squad mates and shared a few laughs and a few drinks. After witnessing two travelers engage in a fight against four other opponents he told his friends to leave so he could talk to the two travelers in private. They obeyed and left the bar, making sarcastic jokes on the way out. David introduced himself to the two travelers who identified themselves as Veronica Miles and Carl Taylor . The three of them talked about military service and David told them that he would provide easy transportation for them to escape on: A stowaway solution. Battle of Mombasa Edit \nDuring the Battle of Mombasa , David and second squad were pinned down. David and the ODSTs in Hotel Zanzibar were then rescued by John-117, who then organized an offense by destroying Covenant infantry, armor, and Covenant artillery emplacements on the beaches facing New Mombasa. Later, he managed to board UNSC In Amber Clad in time to escape the Slipspace explosion caused by the Prophet of Regret's assault carrier. \nAfterwards, he participated in 05 Battle of Installation 05 He accompanied John-117 and Gunnery Sergeant Stacker all the way to the final temple, although he did not continue on inside the temple. While John-117 was inside, killing the Prophet of Regret, he was evacuated by a friendly dropship. \nAfter the Battle of Voi, he traveled through the portal to The Ark and participated in the Battle of Installation 00 . He assisted John in pushing to the Ark's Cartographer by offering him a Gauss Warthog and helping take down a Scarab. He also assisted John's push to the Shield Tower. After High Charity arrived and crashed on the Ark and John-117 planned to light Installation 04B, he evacuated the Ark with the rest of the surviving Marines and Covenant Separatists. He then took part in the 21-Gun-Salute for those fallen during the war. Spartan IV/ONI Background Edit \nBy 2552, David was accepted into the Spartan-IV program... \nIn 2553, David meets and develops a competitive victory against Kyle Craig. Participates in a few battles before the split up. \n2560 MURDERS TEAM LEADER IN PRIVATE? DISCHARGED WHEN UNCOVERED?
