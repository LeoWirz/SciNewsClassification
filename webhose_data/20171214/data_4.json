Boroh (rtd) and the Presidential Amnesty Office. This was contained in a video by the group \u2018ndagg\u2019. \nThe office in a press release signed by Mr. Okuba Wonikefi Special Adviser On Social Media OSAPND described the allegations as misinformation, false, baseless and a fabrication of the groups\u2019 imagination. \nBelow is the press release in full: \nOur attention has been drawn once again to a recent video on Facebook on Monday, 4th December 2017, titled \u201cUnprecedented Level of Corruption in Nigeria under President Buhari\u201d with the above and other numerous captions, we find it expedient to restate the truth for the benefit of those who have not heard the truth before now and to clear the air on some of the distorted facts presented in the said media videos publications.In the light of the false and misleading stories being circulated by ndagg and their cohorts about President Muhamadu Buhari\u2019s war against corruption and corrupt officials, the National Security Adviser (NSA) Maj Gen Babagana Monguno (rtd), and the Special Adviser to the President on Niger Delta/Coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme, Brig Gen PT Boroh (rtd) the emphasis of the facts against \u2018ngagg\u2019s fictions and fabrications becomes necessary. \nIt is a well known fact that the Muhammadu Buhari administration \u201cRenewed Vigor\u201d in the war against Boko Haram by moving the Military Command Centre to the heart of the war in Maiduguri and the troops\u2019 morale and confidence are on an upswing with the commit of the United States government to employ their resources to the fight against the insurgency and the Israeli government also contributing in helping Nigeria win the war. However, a total of 103 of the 300 Chibok Girls adducted by Book Haram Fighters on April 14, 2014, have been released. This was as a result of maximum security experience. \nIn waging a \u201cNon-Negotiable\u201d war against Corruption, on August 30, President Muhammadu Buhari, who described the war his administration is currently fihting on corruption in the country as \u201cNon-Negotiable\u201d and the anti-graft war remain one of his topmost priority. \nAnd as he stepped into office, he began a systematic war against the corruption he campaigned against. His government stood by a promise made during the campaign which is very uncommon among Nigerian politicians, most of whom make promises only to win over the gullible and throw the promises into the trash can as soon as they clinch the seat of power. But this is not so with Buhari who said: \u201cCorruption is a hydra-headed monster and a cankerworm that undermines the fabric of all societies. It does not differentiate between developed and developing countries. It constitutes a serious threat to good governance, rule of law, peace and security, as well as development programmes aimed at tackling poverty and economic backwardness,\u201d hence it must be fought on all fronts. \nHowever it has been stated clearly by the OSAPND that; the Presidential Amnesty Programme is a security Programme and the office of the National Security Adviser (NSA) serves as a first point of clearance, thus, as an office our continuous relationship is inevitable and sacrosanct. The NSA has not requested for any contract from the amnesty office as he is too busy with national security issues. \nThe National Security Adviser (NSA) is a trained military professional with special knowledge and ability in resources, protection against potential enemies of the state both within and without. The NSA is a senior aide in the cabinet of the President of Nigeria who serves as the chief advisor to the President on National Security issues. The office of NSA is an integral part of the inner workings, effectiveness of and efficient security on both the tangible and the intangibles, hence, such office is not to be taking for granted by any person or group of persons for personal and selfish interest. The NSA serves as an honest broker of policy options for the President in the field of National Security. Therefore, it is barbaric and an act of indiscipline to state that the NSA is using proxies to fetch contracts from the OSAPND. \nThe necessity of a collaborative effort at securing sustainable peace for development to strive, especially in the Niger Delta region, is a clarion call for all patriotic Nigerians hence, the sacrificial efforts of the NSA and the SAPND/COR in cubing, and moderating the activities of the Avengers and rising militancy in the Niger Delta. The relative peace witness in the Niger Delta today is a clear evidence of the continuous and commendable sacrifices of the NSA and all these cannot come to play without a sound effort. \nAs stated earlier without mincing words; Brig Gen PT Boroh (rtd) leadership since assumption of office as the Special Adviser to the President on Niger Delta/Coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme has only brought about experience, pragmatism, discipline and unparalleled achievements across board. In a sane society only commendation and applause follows such sacrificial leadership. The records are there for the public to verify that; Brig Gen PT Boroh (rtd) inherited a back-log of debts but today that has been offset and the office is living up to its financial obligations consistently within the limits of the available resource. The Reintegration Phase of the Amnesty Programme can therefore be said to be in a more secured hand. \nThe continuous inconsistencies of figure by the ndagg have continuously shown dishonesty, faithlessness, treachery and gross misrepresentation of facts alleged in their various publication and videos that; $200million (N72billion), N6.2billion and recently N60billion making a total sum of N138.2billion has been mismanaged by the Amnesty Office between 2015-date, in simplifying these statements the public should note that: \nThere are about eleven (11) Capital Projects and only 2 were awarded under Brig Gen PT Boroh\u2019s administration. \nThere are about 7 Consultancy Commission\u2019s for Capital Projects and only one was awarded under Brig Gen PT Boroh\u2019s administration. \nThe SAPND approval limit for any Capital Project contract is less than N500m and about N150m for others. \nIn addition, taking a look at the budget breakdown since 2016, \n2016-N20 billion was released \n2016 Viament-Additional N35 billion was released \n2017-N65 billion was budgeted for, only about N30billion; less than half has been released yet making a total of N85billion that has been released from the Ministry Of Finance under Brig Gen PT Boroh\u2019s administration. The question is: where did they get their N138.2billion from? \nHowever, OSAPND will continue to stress that these blackmail videos and publications is a figmentation of the author\u2019s imagination in their efforts of cheap blackmail and propaganda, considering the CBN Treasury Single Account (TSA), where payments are done through a consolidated revenue account will not even allow such amount of money through its platform and with the introduction of the Bank Verification Number (BVN) where biometric technologies are used to analyze human characteristics, ghost names and duplication\u2019s are not possible in payment of stipends as claimed by the distraction. Our records are there for verification. \nAs an office we want to state categorically that, allegations and accusations are totally false, untrue and misrepresentation of facts all the contacts awarded by Brig Gen PT Boroh are executed by the contractors. There is a strict policy of no-work no-pay for contractors at the office and a team of OSAPND staff and ICPC normally go for inspections to the training and empowerment centers of our beneficiaries. Video clips and live telecast of amnesty beneficiaries set up by the Brig Gen PT Boroh led administration is everywhere for all to see. However, there are no ghost contracts or ghost contractors\u2019 in the Amnesty Office. \nThat the SAPND has over 24 bank accounts with commercial banks in Nigeria is a very white lie just to rubbish his office and that, the SAPND constantly transfer huge sums of monies to staffers account is untrue and pretense with ndagg intent to deceive the public and beneficiaries of the Amnesty Programme. \nThe Presidential Amnesty Programme remains the only Federal Government office charged with this massive responsibility of addressing lack of human capital development with the overall objective of engendering lasting peace and stability. By implication these strategic effort addresses poverty in the Niger Delta Region through the empowerment programmes of Brig Gen PT Boroh. \nThe Amnesty Office is much engaged in the discharge of its duties and responsibilities to the government by ensuring lasting peace in the Niger delta region, her beneficiaries offshore and onshore, ensuring adequate care and provisions as appropriated in the budget. The principal objective of the Amnesty Programme is to stabilize, to unite and maintain security conditions in the region and in the country at large which Brig Gen. PT Boroh to a large extent has achieved. \nMoreover, the number of delegates deployed to onshore university in the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 academic sessions respectively has never been recorded in the history of the Amnesty Programme. Over 2,000 qualified beneficiaries extracted from the Presidential Amnesty Data Base were deployed, these comprises of First Phase, Second Phase, Third Phase and the Impacted Communities List approved by the Fmr President Goodluck Jonathan and all necessary payments were made. \nFurthermore, it is on record that as an office we have been very diligent in the discharge of our duties. Our students offshore and onshore, our vocational training delegates onshore are paid within the limits of the resources released to the office at intervals and it is with this resources that the Office under the leadership of Brig Gen PT Boroh (rtd), has also trained and set-up more than 4,000 beneficiaries in their choice areas of business making them entrepreneurs across Niger Delta. \nIt is really messy for a contractor who has trained and benefited from the Presidential Amnesty Office in different capacity to turnout those junks in his publication/video under the guise of advocacy for corrupt practices and intervention of the President. However, this rejoinder has become imperative in order to set the records straight and assuage the concerns of the Amnesty programme beneficiaries, Niger Deltan\u2019s and Nigerians at large. \nThe President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration\u2019s focus had been on insecurity, official corruption, and rebuilding the collapsing economy. In other words; \ncaused such feelings of disbelief, dismay, and disappointment that I forced myself to watch the video multiple times in order to make sure I understood what was being mischievously communicated by the group. \nFinally, We hereby use these medium to plead with friends, well-wishers and beneficiaries who are well acquainted with the enormous achievements and contribution of Brig Gen PT Boroh to sustainable and stabilized security, continued development of the Niger Delta Region to be calm and continue to have trust in the Amnesty Programme as such ill-informed and malicious video will not dissuade the SAPND from continuing to blaze new trails and canvass for the betterment of the Amnesty Programme and its beneficiaries. \nWe seize this opportunity to express our profound appreciation to all who have called our offices to express their concern, solidarity and support. We assure you that the SAPND Brig Gen PT Boro and by extension the Presidential Amnesty Office remain uncorrupt, law-abiding and a pragmatic organization and are taking steps to seek redress appropriately against those who without provocation intent on tarnishing personal and corporate goodwill and status that has been built up and maintained over the years. \nOkuba Wonikefi ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "niger delt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babagana monguno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul t. boroh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "okuba wonikefi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brig gen pt boroh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammadu buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhamadu buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boko haram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goodluck jonathan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maj gen babagana monguno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niger deltan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amnesty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green parrot news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbn treasury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fmr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amnesty programme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal government", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "programme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icpc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "presidential amnesty data base", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brig gen pt boroh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "osapnd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "presidential amnesty programme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "presidential amnesty office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amnesty office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "consultancy commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of finance", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "maiduguri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niger delta region", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "military command centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niger delta", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:12.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2fdd576f88849d1d19455a5a05ae88b03345819e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Zo6Jdbl4jwnUDBfdgZZMB54B.V1q.fGPvPBEErFNdMJqAgylY6VEWR4xnfNV5bWvMAtGA6bXPrSRbaSHIhP4mTKKq_SMC6HNlhjAY42OnOWqqf5XZg29dLSd7EUABgG93iOsrU3CGug--", "site_full": "www.thepresstribune.com", "site": "thepresstribune.com", "site_section": "http://www.colfaxrecord.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "sports"], "section_title": "Colfax Record", "title": "15027 FILE NO. 17-02302 FILED NOVEMBER 8, 2017 FICTITIOUS", "title_full": "15027 FILE NO. 17-02302 FILED NOVEMBER 8, 2017 FICTITIOUS", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2fdd576f88849d1d19455a5a05ae88b03345819e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Zo6Jdbl4jwnUDBfdgZZMB54B.V1q.fGPvPBEErFNdMJqAgylY6VEWR4xnfNV5bWvMAtGA6bXPrSRbaSHIhP4mTKKq_SMC6HNlhjAY42OnOWqqf5XZg29dLSd7EUABgG93iOsrU3CGug--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "15027 FILE NO. 17-02302 FILED NOVEMBER 8, 2017 FICTITIOUS", "text": "15027 FILE NO. 17-02302 FILED NOVEMBER 8, 2017 FICTITIOUS   \n15027 FILE NO. 17-02302 FILED NOVEMBER 8,   NUTRISHOP ROSEVILLE, 10341 FAIRWAY DR., ROSEVILLE, CA 95678 1.

Awkward, inexperienced, unsure. More than a boy, hardly a man. He speaks fast, the words clipped, sharp, hurtful. He keeps playing with his rifle, waving it, aiming it, caressing it, turning it upside down, comforting it when it somehow rights itself again. The bullet clip is loaded; I can\u2019t see if the safety catch is released. I don\u2019t like any of this, for two reasons. First, I don\u2019t like guns. I had to carry one, when I was a little older than the lieutenant, and I hated it. Second, I don\u2019t like men who like guns. \nPhoto: Guy Butavia \nHe\u2019s here to drive the shepherds off their lands. He\u2019s got the Closed Military Zone order, not in its usual hard-copy form, a piece of paper signed by the Brigade Commander, but on his cell phone. Not good enough, we say, show us the order and the signature. There\u2019s no signature on the cell phone. No, he says. We\u2019re more advanced than we used to be. \nUmm al-Amad, June, 2014. photograph: margaret olin* \nSo Guy tells him clearly, and mildly, that the order is illegal, and we have with us the Supreme Court ruling to prove it. After years of struggle in Umm al-Amad, with all the usual travails\u2014repeated expulsions, beatings, arrests, endless threats, routine state terror, as we fought, week by week, literally meter by meter, to extend the area the shepherds could reclaim as theirs\u2013 the Supreme Court recognized that the wadi and the hills beneath the settlement of Otniel were Palestinian lands that the people of Umm al-Amad and Karama and the other villages could freely use. It took us some four years on the ground and in the courts to win back the stolen terrain. Guy carries the ruling with him whenever he comes here. The lieutenant takes it, glances at it, and says, \u201cThis means nothing to me. I have my orders. Get these shepherds out of here.\u201d \n\u201cWhy?\u201d \n\u201c Kacha \u2014because.\u201d \n\u201cWhat you are doing is illegal.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s no concern of mine. I\u2019ll be quite happy to arrest them, handcuff them, blindfold them, and leave them lying like that for some hours in the settlement.\u201d Photograph: Elena Mucciarelli \n\u201cYou have no right to threaten them like that. This is their land.\u201d \n\u201cI can do what I want. I don\u2019t need any papers to prove it. I have my gun.\u201d \nBut he doesn\u2019t look as cocksure as he sounds. He keeps glancing around at his soldiers. There are five of them, in the usual get-up. Helmets, rifles, boots. Some of them seem to me not too happy. But then, when are soldiers happy? It\u2019s worse, I know from experience, when they have an officer who\u2019s no damned good. \nThe lieutenant likes to issue threats. \u201cI\u2019m very affable,\u201d he says to us, \u201cbut when people don\u2019t obey me I get physical and violent very quickly. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d This is the only language he knows, impoverished beyond belief, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s recently, or maybe ever, had an original thought. However, as an afterthought, he says to his men, \u201cWe\u2019re doing this today for the Motherland, the moledet .\u201d Never has the Hebrew word sounded to me so sinister. Umm al-Amad, June, 2014 photograph: margaret olin \nThen there\u2019s the question of the map that accompanies the digital CMZ order, as it must. The whole business is illegal, but the lieutenant, who\u2019s not so good at reading maps, compounds the crime. Since we\u2019re worried about what will happen to \u2018Abed and Ahmad and Hamid if they get arrested, we\u2019re prepared to move farther away from the settlement, up the wadi, to the hillside that is clearly outside the line on the map. But that\u2019s not good enough for our lieutenant. He thinks the shepherds have to go home, get out of there, not be there, not be. He tells them this in pigeon Arabic, horrible to the ear. Guy, who\u2019s good at maps, tells him over and over that the hill we\u2019re retreating to is beyond the arbitrary line of the map. The lieutenant, unable to lose face, insists that his orders are to clear them out altogether, to make them disappear. He says: \u201cGet them off my lands.\u201d I wonder why he thinks they\u2019re his. We demand that he summon the Matak, a senior officer from the Civil Administration, to settle this point. Now. \nHe calls the Matak\u2014or someone else. Who can say? Now we wait. Every once in a while he points his gun at us and repeats the threat. If the shepherds dare to cross the line even by an inch, he\u2019ll arrest them. He wants them to know this. It should be crystal clear. But the goats, endowed, one supposes, with the less than lucid consciousness of a goat, have a way of spilling over the hills and crossing the invisible line. On second thought, maybe their awareness is more lucid than the lieutenant\u2019s. It\u2019s the shepherds\u2019 kids who are sent to fetch them, and if you say to the lieutenant\u2014\u201cLook, they\u2019re six years old, stop pointing your gun at them, stop threatening them\u201d\u2014he gets riled. \u2018Abed, however, who\u2019s already been through whatever hells the army has to offer, is enraged. \u201cLook at this,\u201d he says to me. \u201cHave you ever seen anything like it? A little boy, a bunch of hungry goats, and six soldiers with their big guns aimed at them. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree more. I tell him: the court will decide, and it will decide in our favor. We can\u2019t settle it here on the ground. \nAhmad in Umm al-Amad, July, 2017. photograph: Margaret Olin \nI think that only the surreal feels really real. Late winter morning, the sun on our skin. There\u2019s an enormous, heavy, black sheep, probably pregnant, lumbering across the wadi floor. The kids are running up and down the rocks in the wake of the incorrigible goats. One of the shepherds has decided that this is the perfect moment to make tea. He lights a fire and puts the old, soot-soiled kettle on the burning twigs. Soon Wala, impish, insouciant, brings each of us of a glass of tea. The soldiers huddle together, making evil plans. The Matak, of course, never turns up. Ahmad, furious, yells at the lieutenant: \u201cYou think you\u2019re some big man, but you\u2019re no more than a common criminal.\u201d The lieutenant probably can\u2019t understand. Photograph: David Shulman \n\nMaybe, it occurs to me, he might be amenable to some suggestion that would allow him to climb down off the tree. \u201cLook,\u201d I say to him, \u201cthey\u2019re almost finished with today\u2019s grazing. They\u2019ve already moved outside the \u2018forbidden\u2019 ground. Give them another 10 or 15 minutes, they\u2019ll wind up and go home. Stop threatening them, it makes everything worse and it scares the kids.\u201d Something like that. The lieutenant looks at me with scorn. \u201cNo.\u201d \nWala gathers up the empty tea glasses, balancing them against her body in a delicious, gravity-defying system that only she could invent. These people are poor; every glass counts. She will bring them home over the high hill. How many times have I climbed this hill? But today is worse. I figure my ancestors must have been driven from their homes\u2014in Spain, in the Rhineland, God knows where else\u2014and here it is again, what they must have known, something black inside me, the blackness of rage, of hate, though hate is rare for me in south Hebron, over the years it\u2019s been displaced by something else that I can\u2019t name, something better than hate. And there is the weariness; do we have to start all over? We\u2019ll go back to the courts, and the courts will reaffirm the earlier ruling, and the wadi will be open again, and for a while the sheep will graze there until we have to do it all once more, and the pitiful lieutenant might even grow up some day and discover he is a person with a mind and a body of his own, I know it can happen, maybe after the Occupation ends. Maybe even before. Guy in Umm al-Amad, July, 2017. photograph: Margaret Olin \nOn the way to Umm al-Khair we stop at Ma\u2018in and climb the hill to where the owners were digging shallow pits for planting baby olive trees, a few days back. The settlers of Avigail, across the highway, must have summoned the soldiers. This time they arrested ten Palestinians, accusing them of digging in an \u201carchaeological site.\u201d There is no square meter in Palestine-Israel that is not an archaeological site. A new and ominous pretext, potentially useful for stealing land. They kept their prisoners all day and released them in the evening. This story, like Umm al-Amad\u2019s, isn\u2019t over yet. \nOne thing I can say. Things are getting worse. \ntext David Shulman \u00a9 2017 *you may see more of Um al-Amad in 2014 here", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "margaret olin  he", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umm al-amad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margaret olin umm al-amad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margaret olin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "avigail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david shulman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umm al-khair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elena mucciarelli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abed", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "civil administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "matak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "otniel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine-israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hebron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umm al-amad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:12.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f7b913294bffba735ebc8c9730569320c058c132", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_StcUp8dvfp7Xmu2.AFjVoIPZc1fSy_an9VQYHCK3TUqwxvzXOZj2yrtGyHuy3wRBYpNhXlZG0kNwEfjTzO3y0qx3V6u8bzg-", "site_full": "www.bikeforums.net", "site": "bikeforums.net", "site_section": "https://www.bikeforums.net/road-cycling/", "site_categories": ["bicycling", "sports"], "section_title": "Road Cycling - Bike Forums", "title": "Addiction LXVIII - Page 270", "title_full": "Addiction LXVIII - Page 270 - Bike Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T05:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 18862, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "54a5987efd32f4170a397a59fc75b7f862e6c058", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_StcUp8dvfp7Xmu2.AFjVoIPZc1fSy_an9VQYHCK3TUqwxvzXOZj2yrtGyHuy3wRBYpNhXlZG0kNwEfjTzO3y2ecT9nehymM-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "f4rrest", "published": "2017-12-07T08:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : That's why I have one. Every other car I have owned that had racing potential eventually morphed into a purpose-built, weight-weenied, stripped-down race car. The Stealth is too heavy and there's no way to get the weight out enough to make it a legit race car. So I'm keeping it streetable, and I get to keep my marriage.\nOK, Corvette war story. Helmets on everyone!\nMy turbo sponsor back in the day was Forced Performance, from Texas. Great group of guys; love them to death. Every once and a while, a new turbo would show up and I'd try it out and give R&D feedback.\nWell one problem I had was that success in my racing series didn't translate into turbo sales - it made for way better turbos, but \"DG uses this!\" didn't carry the water you'd otherwise hope. The market was very sensitive to 1/4 mile drag times \"This turbo runs 12s\" etc - so one of the things I had to do was put a drag time on any new turbo.\nTwo hours down the road from me was a hole-in-the-wall dragstrip that had a super-sticky start line and it was really flat and smooth. That track was usually good for a tenth or 2 compared to closer tracks (which were sandy and uphill) so when a new turbo showed up, I went out there for a Saturday Test'n'Tune session - run all the passes you want, but no prizes or whatnot. The idea was to spend the morning dialing in the electronic engine management system to adapt to the new turbo, and once I had it sussed out, the gloves would come off and we'd put down a number.\nSo we pull into our paddock spot, and next to me is another trailered car - a brand new C5 Corvette. Crew of 2 dudes: one guy the mechanic, the other guy the car owner/driver. Mechanic is dressed like a mechanic; driver is dressed in designer chinos, mirrorshades, no-**** string-backed leather driving gloves... like the poster child for 1985 Preppie nozzle. And he is *berating the hell* out of his mechanic. Treating him like a rented mule. And the mechanic is scurrying and all \"Yes Boss!\".\nI got a quick glimpse under the hood, and I saw headers and an aftermarket air filter, so the car had some work done to it, but I had stuff to do and I wasn't interested in interacting with Chad Douchnozzle so I got to unloading my own car and getting ready.\nSo the morning goes well, I don't break anything, and I'm pretty happy about my state of tune. Oddly for a Test'n\"Tune, the stands are *packed* with random spectators, some of whom have been chirping my riceburner that's all stickered out and whatnot. I haven't done a full-up pass yet as I've been tuning, so I haven't really showed my cards.\nTime to make a number. So I pull into my lane and get ready for a run.\nNow if you've never been drag racing before, the light tree has a set of lights on the top connected to a pair of beams that cross the track near the start line. The first lights \"Pre-Stage\" means \"you are close to the start\" and the second lights \"Stage\" mean \"stop here\". Both cars pull forward until the stage lights are on, the starter makes sure both cars are ready, and then he triggers the tree to start the race.\nMy car had a special feature called \"two step rev limiter launch control\". What this means is that the engine management system knows when the clutch is in. With the clutch pushed down, it lowers the rev limiter to a user-controlled value; with the clutch out, it raises the rev limiter to \"as fast as you can spin it without blowing the engine\". The idea is you light the Stage light, then push both the clutch *and the gas* flat to the floor. The 2-step keeps the engine at launch RPM, and as an added bonus, the turbo builds boost (I'd see 12-14 PSI on a 22 PSI turbo) so you make more power at launch. The downside is that while it is operating, it's like sitting inside a machine gun, and it is a little hard on the engine.\nSo I roll up, light the Pre-Stage and Stage lights, push in the clutch, and floor the accelerator. The guy next to me lights the Pre-Stage lights...\n...and sits...\n...and sits...\n...and sits...\nand I finally look over at his lane to see what is taking him so long to stage, and I look *directly into the mirrorshades of Chad Douchnozzle* because he is *staring right at me* - and I suddenly realize that he is trying to \"burn me down\".\n\"Burning someone down\" is a racing technique you can use on someone who has a launch control or a trans brake or a similar device that works like my launch control. The idea is you make him sit there popping and banging until either his engine blows up or he backs off. You then immediately stage, and there's a pretty good chance he won't be able to get loaded up again before the starter drops the lights. It's a legit technique, but as the Bird People say, \"It's a dick move\" so it isn't done very often. And at a Test'n'Tune? NEVER. Because we aren't \"racing\"; we just happen to be running at the same time.\nSo I roll my eyes and back out of the launch control, he immediately stages, and as soon as the light flickers the starter drops the lights because he's tired of this ****. Chad roars off, and I let him go, because I don't care about Chad, I'm trying to put down a number. I come back up on the launch control, let the boost stabilize, and let rip.\nWhen I launch, he has about 1/3 of a track head start...\n...and I run him down at about the 1100' mark.\nMy wife said that when the win light came on in my lane and the crowd saw my number, the stands just *erupted*. I didn't see that part. When I got the timeslip, I was happy with the number, so I pulled up to our trailer. Chad followed, got out of his car - and ran over and started SCREAMING at his mechanic. Just completely LOSING HIS **** because this stickered-out 4-banger riceburner had handed him his hat even after the giant head start and his flawless driving.\n(Never mind that I made more power, had 4 wheels to put it down with, and weighed 1000lbs less than he did. Which he never found out. Because he never said a word to me.)\nSo I loaded up the car, signed a couple of autographs for people who figured out who I was, and went home, mission accomplished.\nI sure hope that mechanic found a better job.

Updated: December 7, 2017, 1:15 PM IST Picture for Representation. New Delhi: Rajiv Gandhi had a proposal to amicably resolve the Ayodhya dispute that would have involved five Supreme Court judges with a secular composition, determining \u2018whether there was any evidence that Babri Masjid was constructed after the demolition of a living Ram temple\u2019. All India Babri Masjid Action Committee (AIBMAC) Convenor Zafaryab Jilani, who held a series of meetings with the Congress leadership at the peak of the Ayodhya dispute, told News18 that the request was turned down as the CJI cited insufficiency of judges to handle the case. \u201cSince our counsel was Siddhartha Shankar Ray, after Rajiv Gandhi was defeated, Gandhi asked Ray that he wanted to meet us. So, I and Mr Mushtaq Ahmed Siddiqui, members of the action committee, both of us went, under the instruction of Siddhartha Shankar Ray on the condition that we will not talk in the presence of Buta Singh. Rajiv Ji asked his secretary to bring a typed letter. He gave that to us in which the proposal in the SC that \u2018we ask to give its opinion whether there was any living Ram Temple in the disputed place,\u201d said Jilani who is now the counsel for All India Muslim Personal Law Board in the Babri Masjid case pending at the Supreme Court. According to Jilani, Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s suggestion was that five senior most judges of the SC form a commission and decide this matter to see \u2018whether there was any evidence to the effect that Babri Masjid was constructed after the demolition of a living Ram temple\u2019. The letter was sent to the Chief Justice of India and the CJI replied that there weren\u2019t sufficient judges. \u201cI had put a question to Rajiv Gandhi why do you think that five senior most judges will be secular and impartial? Then he asked us not to worry. Then he told us that in the commission one will be Hindu, one will be Christian, one will be Muslim, one will be Sikh and the other would be Parsi. It is then we kept quiet,\u201d said Jilani. Zafaryab Jilani, then a young lawyer, who became the convenor of the Babri Masjid Action Committee after it was formed in 1986, told News18 that, \u201cThe tacit deal allegation by Arif Mohd Khan has been made several times and is not new and if Rajiv Gandhi would have been alive then the Babri dispute would have been resolved peacefully.\u201d Former Union Minister, Arif Mohd Khan in a recent article for News18 stated that a legislation overturning Shah Bano Verdict and to suppress agitation by the Babri Masjid Action Committee was a part of tacit deal between the personal law board and the Rajiv Gandhi government. Jilani who was one of the founders of the action committee rejects any suggestions of a quid pro quo between the the government and AIMPLB. On 1 February 1986, Faizabad District Judge KM Pandey ordered the Babri Masjid be unlocked. He observed, \u201c[...] Muslims are not going to be affected by any stretch of imagination if the locks of the gates are opened and idols inside the premises are allowed to be seen and worshipped by pilgrims and devotees. Heavens will not fall if the locks of the gates are removed\u201d. \u201cWhen this meeting was held with Rajiv Gandhi on the issue of personal law and the draft of that act was discussed, at that very time, Maulana Ali Mian had asked Rajiv Gandhi that in the manner you have settled this issue, settle the Babri issue too. Gandhi had promised to solve that issue too. So, there was no question of any bargaining. Otherwise what the use of the December 1990 resolution by the Personal Law Board. Rajiv Gandhi was alive at that time and Prime Minister Chandrasekhar was in support of Gandhi,\u201d said Jilani. Arif Mohd Khan has also stated how Maulana Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi, the then Chairman of the MPLB was severely critical of the Babri masjid Action Committee and movement. \u201cIf we read the autobiography of Maulana Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi, the then Chairman of the MPLB carefully then one is struck by the strong language he has used against the leaders of the Babri Masjid Action Committee and movement. In Volume 4 on Page 130, he squarely blamed these leaders for provoking \u2018Hindu revivalism\u2019 and described their movement as leading Muslims on the path of \u2018collective suicide,\u201d said Khan. However, Jilani said that any such comment was completely false and baseless. \u201cMaulana Abdul Hasan Ali Nadvi was the president of the board when the resolution was taken. In 1990, the board had taken a decision that not an inch of the Babri masjid land can be given or bartered or be surrendered. The PLB meeting held in Delhi in 1990 December had resolved that whatever has been done by the Babri Masjid Action Committee and the Babri Masjid Women Committee must continue with their efforts and this was the endorsement of the activities of the action committee by the board when Nadvi was himself the president. No such observation has ever been made by Nadvi blaming the action committee,\u201d said Jilani. Jilani, who was a part of secret meeting with Shankracharya of Kachikot refuted any such observation. \u201cBefore the 1990 resolution, in 1986 itself there was an effort by two governors, Mr Krishna Kant and Mr Yunus Salim to have a meeting of Maulana Nadvi with Shankracharya of Kachikot. This meeting took place sometime in August that year and after the meeting, I was called along with Mr Azam Khan, and Advocate Abdul Mannan, all members of the action committee. In closed room Shankracharya had said that \u2018if the property in dispute is given in his charge till the final decision of the case, then he will ensure that a wall is constructed around the structure and no one can perform any puja or namaz there. He would also ensure that it would remain in his custody.\u2019 We agreed with his proposal as the property would be in the custody of the receiver, Shankracharya and had no objection to it,\u201d said Jilani. \u201cShankracharya had asked for a draft to this effect and we came back to the residence of Advocate Abdul Mannar and prepared a one page draft to this effect and handed it over to Maulana Ali Mian. The next day we met Shankracharya and he said that he was helpless as he was prevailed upon by Ashok Singhal, Jagraj Kishor, and other leaders of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, and that I should not be interfering in the matter.\u2019 This was told to us later by Ali Mian too and that is what he refers to in his book too,\u201d said Jilani who believes that Khan has always been accused of being at loggerheads with the \u2018Muslim leadership.\u2019 Jilani maintains that the unlocking of the gates to Babri Masjid had \u201chappened before the government had taken the decision to introduce any such bill to overturn the verdict in the Shah Bano case in the parliament.\u201d \u201cThe government had not announced its decision to reverse the SC verdict on January 15, 1986, but made such an announcement subsequent to it. This is because, the meeting of the Muslim Personal Law Board to take a stock of situation was held on February 2, 1986, at Delhi. I was a part of the meeting, and in that meeting it was resolved that we will start our agitation, so if the government would have made any such announcement then there was no need for us to agitate. So the entire theory of Arif Mohd Khan is misplaced,\u201d said Jilani.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name":

Ornamental shrubs, young shade trees, deciduous, and evergreens will need some help to make it through harsh winter weather. \nHeavy snow and accumulated ice can break limbs and branches or even topple a tree all together. Evergreens can suffer bleaching from cold temperatures, winter sun and wind, and further damage can be caused to the roots, bark, and branches can be injured or killed. \nAs food sources become sparse in the coldest months, deer and rodents will seek out bark, foliage, buds, and twigs. If left unattended, this foraging can severely injure and possibly kill your trees, shrubs, and plants. \nDon\u2019t give up! There is hope. The following will help you lend a hand to your garden and landscape occupants throughout the harshest weather this winter may bring. Protecting and Hydrating Tree, Plant and Shrub Roots \nThat\u2019s right, it all starts with the roots. In the fall, right up to the first freeze, there are two steps you can take to ensure proper hydration and root protection. Understand that soil temperatures drop much more slowly than air temperature and that roots of most trees will begin to die if the soil reaches temperatures below 10\u00b0F. \nFall Watering \u2013 Evergreens, newly planted trees and woody plants need to be watered frequently during the fall (especially during a dry fall season). During a deep freeze (when the ground freezes) roots can no longer absorb moisture from the soil and become dependent on what they\u2019ve stored in the fall. \nNOTE: The primary cause of winter damage to evergreens is from dehydration. Evergreens don\u2019t lose their foliage in the winter and will continue to transpire. If they haven\u2019t stored sufficient water, they may suffer burning or browning of the foliage. \nThick Mulching \u2013 As previously mentioned, soil temperatures below 10\u00b0F can cause severe damage and kill the roots of most trees. While it may seem counterintuitive, moist soil is able to hold more heat than dry soil. In order to maximize root growth in the fall and minimize winter root injury, a 3 to 6 inch layer of wood chips or organic mulch should be used around your trees, plants, and shrubs. \nNOTE: If you live in an area where the temperature remains at or below freezing for extended periods of time, you should mulch your trees, shrubs, and plants with 6 to 8 inches. \nVisit thetreecareguide.com/how-trees-survive-winter-months/ to understand how trees survive the winter months so you can better aid them. Severe Cold Weather Damage and Your Hardiness Zone \nThe health and longevity of your landscape begins with the selection of trees, shrubs, and plants appropriate for your hardiness zone. Unless kept in and protected by a microclimate, plant life that is not hardy in your hardiness zone may be severely damaged or killed during the winter months. \nYour plant life sustains the most damage when pronounced temperature fluctuations occur during the fall, winter, and spring. Prolonged low temperatures in early fall and late spring will potentially cause the greatest damage, as well as \u201ctripping up\u201d the dormancy or \u201cawakening periods for deciduous trees, shrubs, and plants. This damage may occur regardless of the hardiness zone location, but plant life that thrives in your zone will have a better chance at recovery. \nVisit http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/ to find out which hardiness zone you are located inside. Avoid Tree and Shrub Damage from Snow and Ice Storms \nIce and snow accumulation can get heavy enough to bend and eventually break both deciduous and evergreen branches. Evergreens like junipers and multiple leader (clump trees) like birch are highly susceptible to this type of damage. \nNOTE: The proper pruning and trimming of your trees and shrubs (to eliminate multiple leaders and weak branches) will help to avoid damage caused by snow and ice accumulation. \nTying leaders together, cabling larger trees, or wrapping smaller trees is an option. Seek assistance from a tree professional, the improper application of these alternatives can cause more harm than good. These ties, wraps, and cablings must be removed in the spring to avoid girdling and return free movement to the stems and branches. Prevent Deer, Rabbits, and Rodents from Feeding on Your Trees \nDeer, rabbits, and rodents will begin to feed on foliage, twigs, and bark as their normal food sources become unattainable in the winter months. The foraging of these animals poses a great threat to the health and life of your trees, shrubs, and plants. Here are some simple solutions like trunk wrapping to keep your landscape safe from these critters and their appetites: \nPlastic Tree Guards \u2013 Putting plastic tree guards around the bottom of your trees (especially young or newly planted trees) will keep rabbits and mice from feasting on them. If you live in areas which accumulate snow, the guards should be well above the snow line. Otherwise, your efforts will be in vain. \nNOTE: Once spring arrives, remove the guards. They can cause the trapping of moisture in the bark, attracting insects and possible infestation issues. \nChicken Wire Barriers \u2013 This is the best solution for rabbits. Erecting chicken wire fences/cages around your trees, shrubs, and plants will keep them out of harm\u2019s way. \nNOTE: This is a solution which can be employed at any time of the year and kept in place until the rabbit issue is properly dealt with. \nDeer and Pest Repellent Spray \u2013 Applying a repellant spray to the trunks, branches, and stems of your trees is a great option, especially if you have numerous trees on your property. Repellant sprays are easy to come by at nurseries and home supply stores that have a gardening department. \nNOTE: Rain will wash away most repellents. If you are experiencing a wet season in your geographic location, you will need to reapply the repellant after heavy rain storms. \nTrunk Wrapping for Deer Prevention \u2013 Deer love to rub their antlers on tree trunks. That said, if you live in an area where deer graze, it is a prudent idea to wrap your most vulnerable tree trunks. Take a look at the following video for a smart and inexpensive way to wrap your tree trunks. Is Tree Wrapping Necessary? \nNo \u2013 If you have chosen evergreens according to your location on the USDA Hardiness Zone Map, and they\u2019ve had time to establish their root systems, the answer is no. \nYes \u2013 For newly planted evergreens and those that are prone to dehydration and winter-burn, the answer is yes. They should be wrapped for the winter season. \nNOTE: As mentioned above, dehydration occurs in evergreens because the never stop transpiring throughout the winter. Thus, if they haven\u2019t stored enough water in the fall (or are unable to attain sufficient water in the winter), your evergreens will most likely suffer winter-burn. \nFor more on tree wraps, visit extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/trees-shrubs/protecting-from-winter-damage/ Save Evergreens, Trees, and Shrubs with Preparation and Common Sense \nKnowing your location on the hardiness zone map and planting accordingly is the beginning to a successful landscape. Using common sense throughout the year by properly pruning, trimming, protecting, and watering your plants, shrubs, trees, and evergreens will keep them alive and vibrant for many years. \nEvery winter provides a different set of challenges and every plant responds differently to those stressors. While plants, shrubs, and trees are remarkable in their ability to adapt, they often need your assistance to avoid severe damage, illness, and infestations. Consulting a local tree professional will help you decide which methods to employ to keep your landscape alive and healthy on the other side of the coldest months of the year.

The tests are now available for the patients all over Europe through the online platform http://www.locus-medicus.com . (Photo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/616634/Locus_Medicus.jpg ) THE HIDDEN-C TEST changes the way we look at feminine reproductive health The Hidden-C(R) Test is a unique non-invasive method which uses menstrual blood to provide a deeper understanding of the feminine reproductive health, being able to identify in one sample, more than 31 microorganisms, viruses and fungi which can remain asymptomatic and may lead to infertility or to sexually transmitted infections. \"The innovation in the Hidden-C(R) Test lies in the use of menstrual material, which flows through the upper and lower female genital tract, collecting cells of the shedding endometrium, as well as any microorganisms contained in cervical and vaginal fluids, becoming a complex source of information. Combined with the extremely high sensitivity of Real-Time PCR, the Hidden-C(R) Test exceeds >95% sensitivity for screening the endometrium for the presence of pathogens revealing hidden infections in both the upper and the lower genital tract\", says Doctor Vassilis Tsilivakos, Head of Research in Reproductive Medicine at Locus Medicus. EARLY PREGNANCY FAILURE AND RECURRENT MISCARRIAGES MAY ORIGINATE FROM THE SPERM Locus Medicus laboratories propose a comprehensive investigation of sperm, to identify hidden microorganisms inside the spermatozoa, which can have a crucial influence on the future pregnancy even after a successful conception. The SPITM test (Sperm Pathogen Immunophenotyping Test) is the most sensitive test commercially available that allows the detection of intracellular pathogens which can lead to early miscarriage. The \"Fertility Kit\" that can be purchased on http://www.locus-medicus.com and samples are collected by patients in the comfort of their home then sent to Locus Medicus in Greece. Analysis are carried out at the laboratories of Locus Medicus and results are sent by e-mail to patients within 6 days after receiving the samples. http://www.locus-medicus.com The Hidden-C(R) Test - patent EP 1395670 - DETERMINING ENDOMETRIAL STATUS BY TESTING MENSTRUATION TISSUE The SPITM Test - patent EP2831588 A1 - METHOD OF INTRACELLULAR INFECTIOUS AGENT DETECTION IN SPERM CELLS Contact: Dr. Panagiotis Venieratos, info@locus-medicus.com, (+30)210-54-444 More info on: https://www.locus-medicus.com/index.php/news#DiagnosisTreatment Photo: CONTACT: Ludmila Tones, Positive Communication, ludmila@positivecommunication.ro PR Newswire Dit persbericht is via ANP Pers Support naar internationale (vak en online) media gestuurd.

The assembly members will name the seven states formed under the constitution and will draft provincial laws. \nThursday's voting involves about 12 million people in the southern half of the Himalayan nation, nearly 80 percent of the population. The northern, mountainous region voted on Nov. 26. Counting of all the votes is expected to start Friday and take several days as some of the ballot boxes must be transported from remote villages to counting centers. \nPeople holding their voting cards in their hands lined up before polling stations opened at 7 a.m. in the capital, Kathmandu. \n\"I am here to vote today because it is the first election for provinces with the hope these provincial governments would be able to deliver development to a focused and concentrated areas,\" said Kedar Sharan Raya, 74-year-old retired advocate. \n\"I am voting after many years because there is new hope in the country with the establishment of provinces,\" said Iswor Prasad Shrestha, 70, businessman. \nPolice spokesman Manoj Nupane said voting on Thursday was mostly peaceful and security was stepped up in the region. \nPolice, army soldiers and temporary police officers are guarding polling stations. Vehicles were banned from the streets and voters walked to the polling stations in their neighborhoods. \nBoth foreign and local observers were monitoring the polling. \nEuropean Union observer Zeljana Zovko said they have not noted any major issues in the places they have visited. \"The process has started without any major incidents, this is something which is very important,\" she said. \nNepal's slow path to democracy began in 2006, when protesters forced the king to give up his rule. Two years later, Nepal officially abolished the centuries-old monarchy and decided a federal system would best serve all corners of the one of the poorest nations in the world. \nBut bickering among political parties delayed until 2015 the implementation of the new constitution, which declared Nepal a republic. \nSecurity was stepped up for the elections, with thousands of police and army soldiers deployed. According to the Home Ministry, more than 400 people were detained in days leading up to the vote. \nSoon after the constitution was implemented in 2015, protests by ethnic groups in southern Nepal turned violent and left some 50 people dead. \nThe ethnic Madhesi group protested for months, saying they did not get enough territory in the province assigned to them. They said they deserved more land because they represented a bigger population. Their protest blocked the border with India for months, cutting off fuel and other supplies in Nepal.
