You will be able to make up your mind. Past Clients \nMake sure any doctor you interview has a portfolio of his past clients. Ask all the questions you want answers to, and ask if you can speak to any past clients to find out more about the entire experience. This will help you in deciding if the doctor is right for you. TIP! Ask your surgeon about his malpractice insurance, what it covers and how to make a claim. In case something goes wrong, you will need enough money to have another procedure to correct the problem. \nTalk to your surgeon about antibiotics. You will probably have to take this medicine before the surgery in order to cut infection risks and complications related to your risk of infections. Get a second opinion if your surgeon does not plan to prescribe anitbiotics. \nFind out from the surgeon if your surgery . TIP! Do some research to find out if the surgeon you are interested in has a policy about revisions. There are many times that surgeons botch procedures, and you have to pay a ton of money to get corrective surgery . \nMany people think plastic surgery is for those who are vain or self-obsessed, and you can help to avoid that stigma by changing what you call the alterations that are being made to your body. \nDo some homework to discover if your possible surgeon has a policy about revisions. Some surgeons will give you free surgery at no charge up to a year after the procedure was done. TIP! You don\u2019t want to save money by going to an unqualified surgeon or doing anything else risky, but there are legitimate ways to lower the costs of plastic surgery . For example, other countries have highly qualified cosmetic surgeons who charge far less than those in the States. \nMake sure that you see all of the credentials for the location where your surgery will take place. Just like you want to know the details of your doctor , it is also important to know what the medical facility is like. This includes any problems or successes. \nYou should be prepared for the pain and scarring with any cosmetic surgery procedure. A lot of people do not know how painful it will be in during recovery . You can help to improve your healing time post- surgery by mentally prepared for how much pain you are going to be in after the expected pain. TIP! Discuss costs with your doctor and have him or her go over them in detail. Also, investigate whether or not a payment plan is an option if you do not have the full amount available. \nResearch the place where your cosmetic surgery will be performed. These centers should be licensed, and they should be inspected often. Even physician surgery offices of physicians are supposed to be inspected and inspected. Be sure that the location where you will have surgery is up to date with your state certification board standards. You should also want to make sure they do not have any negative history. \nBlood loss is one of the biggest potential complications patients are exposed to during surgery . Bleeding is common, but excessive bleeding can be troublesome. Bleeding might happen during the surgery or afterwards. You may need corrective surgery if you have post- surgery bleeding under the skin . \nIf your potential surgeon is not board certified, you need to go elsewhere. \nRespect the decisions of your cosmetic surgeon offers. If a surgeon does not want to perform a procedure on you, there is usually a good medical reason for it. You can get the opinion of a second well-respected surgeon if you disagree with your doctor . Doing these things can help ensure the safety of any surgery you ultimately undergo. Cosmetic Surgery \nThere are many reasons people get plastic surgery ; feeling better about themselves is one of self-esteem. Cosmetic surgery can be helpful to people who have scars from burns or burns. When a person has suffered a severe burn, their appearance can be altered; therefore, cosmetic surgery can offer a lot of help. TIP! Listen to your doctor . When a doctor tells you that you should not have something done because it is unsafe, there\u2019s a good chance they understand well what the risks are to you. \nBefore committing to undergo cosmetic surgery , find out if there is something else you can do to fix your problems. Most plastic surgery does not carry any danger, but there are a lot of risks you need to consider. Some issues, such as extra fat around your middle, can be treated in other ways. \nWhen you decide on having a plastic surgery procedure , make certain that you inquire as to what the length of the recovery time is. You need to make sure you have prepared adequate rest time for your body to heal before big events in order to heal. You want to miss out on any plans because you have poor timing. TIP! Ask questions regarding your recover and your aftercare. It may be a while before you are able to resume working and participating in regular activities. \nThere are four areas of research that you should do before your surgery . The first area to consider is recovery period. You should also need to find out more about infections or inflammations after the possibility of post-operative inflammation and infection. \nSet expectations for how you will look after your plastic surgery . This is especially true if there are deep rooted mental issues in regards to perceptions about physical appearance. Simply altering your appearance might not prove sufficient to alleviate such concerns. You need to look for professional to get help specific to what you are going through. TIP! When consulting any medical professional about cosmetic surgery , make certain that you inquire as to what the length of the recovery time is. Make sure you allow the full time that is recommended. \nThere are many positive aspects to plastic surgery , but there are also risks and limitations to it as well. To minimize the impact of these risks and work inside the limitations, you need to understand how the procedure works to make the best decision. Use this article as a jumping off point. Use these tips, research further, and make wise decisions.

Security Council resolutions, which have been adopted so far, and negotiations between the parties concerned,\u201d he told a news conference. \nForeign Minister Taro Kono later told reporters, \u201cWe have concerns that conditions could worsen in the Middle East as a whole, or that the situation of peace in the Middle East could become tougher, so we will keep a close eye on developments.\u201d \nAt the same time, Kono said, Japan \u201cappreciates President Trump\u2019s strong commitment to promoting a permanent peace agreement and his support for a two-state solution.\u201d \nKono said there will be \u201cabsolutely no change\u201d to Japan\u2019s efforts to contribute to the Middle East peace process, and Japan has no intention of moving its embassy from Tel Aviv. \nAmong other Group of Seven nations, Britain, France, Italy and Germany have directly expressed disagreement with or concern about the U.S. decision. \nThe U.N. Security Council, for its part, said Wednesday it will meet on Friday in emergency session to discuss the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. \nThe talks \u2014 requested by eight nations \u2014 will begin at 10:00 a.m., but there are other items on the agenda, so the Jerusalem issue may not come up until the late morning, said Japan, which holds the council\u2019s rotating presidency. \nBolivia, Britain, Egypt, France, Italy, Senegal, Sweden and Uruguay requested the talks. They have also asked U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to open the meeting with remarks. \nAfter Trump\u2019s announcement, Guterres said Jerusalem\u2019s final status could only be resolved through direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. \nTrump\u2019s announcement on Wednesday broke long-standing policy on the Middle East. Observers fear the decision could inflame regional tensions and jeopardize efforts to promote Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. \nThe president also directed the State Department to start the process of relocating the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in line with a campaign promise. \nTrump and his staff described the move as a recognition of reality on the ground. Israeli government institutions are based in Jerusalem, and the country\u2019s leaders would almost certainly insist as part of any deal that the city be the country\u2019s capital. \n\u201cWhen I came into office, I promised to look at the world\u2019s challenges, with open eyes and very fresh thinking,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past.\u201d \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed Trump\u2019s announcement as a \u201chistoric landmark,\u201d but Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the U.S. had abdicated its role as a mediator in peace efforts. \nRight after Trump\u2019s declaration, hundreds of angry Palestinians took to the streets to denounce Trump. Demonstrators burned tires in the towns of Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip, across Gaza City and in the southern Gaza Strip\u2019s towns of Khan Younis and Rafah.Protests were also reported in Turkey, and images circulated online of demonstrations breaking out throughout the region. \nThe international community does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the entire city, believing its status should be resolved in negotiations. No other country has its embassy in Jerusalem. \nMalaysia said Thursday that the United States \u201cmust reconsider\u201d its decision, saying the move would end \u201call efforts\u201d made toward resolving the Palestinian question, \u201chave grave repercussions\u201d for the stability of the Middle East and \u201cinflame sentiments, making efforts to combat terrorism all the more difficult.\u201d \nIndonesia joined a chorus of criticism from Muslim-majority countries, with Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi saying that Indonesians \u201ccondemn\u201d the decision. \u201cDemocracy means respecting the international law, (and) the recognition does not respect various U.N. Security Council resolutions,\u201d Retno said at a democracy forum in Jakarta while wearing a Palestinian scarf. \u201cAs a democratic country, the U.S. should know what democracy means,\u201d she said. \nTrump\u2019s decision fulfills a campaign promise and will please Republican conservatives and evangelicals who make up a sizable portion of his domestic support. \nThe American president tried to temper his decision by reaffirming U.S. support for a \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d and saying he wasn\u2019t preempting any final decision about Israel\u2019s borders or sovereignty within Jerusalem. That is important to Palestinians, because they view the eastern part of the city as their future capital, but it is also something they would have already expected in any peace deal, so Trump\u2019s statement rang hollow. \nThe full impact of Trump\u2019s decision won\u2019t really be known until his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, unveils a plan he has been working on with a small team aimed at forging peace in the Middle East. White House officials conceded that the effort isn\u2019t ready yet and that there will be a cooling off period following Wednesday\u2019s announcement before the administration can move forward with it. \n\u201cThis step is prejudging, dictating, closing doors for negotiations and I think President Trump tonight disqualified the United States of America to play any role in any peace process,\u201d said Saeb Erekat, the main Palestinian peace negotiator. \nTamara Cofman Wittes, a senior fellow in the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, warned that the move could backfire well beyond the current global outcry. \nThat may be why Arab leaders, even key U.S. allies, protested the move so strongly, knowing the president\u2019s move won\u2019t play well among their populations. Trump said he would send Vice President Mike Pence to the region in the coming days \u201cto reaffirm our commitment to work with partners throughout the Middle East to defeat radicalism that threatens the hopes and dreams of future generations.\u201d \nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who often says, \u201cAmerica first is not America alone\u201d when called on to explain his boss on the world stage stood all by himself amid onslaught from all sides as he visited NATO headquarters in Brussels. \nSo far, not a single country other than Israel has thrown its support behind the declaration. Even Tillerson\u2019s own State Department has conceded the announcement could sow unrest throughout the Middle East. \nTurkey\u2019s top diplomat, Mevlut Cavusoglu, was unsparing in criticism that was far harsher than any the U.S. is accustomed to from a NATO ally. \n\u201cThe whole world is against this,\u201d Cavusoglu told reporters as he awaited Tillerson\u2019s arrival for their meeting. He said he had already told Trump\u2019s chief diplomat that it was a \u201cgrave mistake.\u201d Cavusoglu said he planned to \u201ctell him again.\u201d \nAs for the time-tested \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Britain, it was not so special as to prevent Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson from putting Tillerson on the spot. After the two shook hands, Johnson used the occasion to suggest it was time for Trump\u2019s Mideast peace team to put up or shut up. \n\u201cClearly this is a decision that makes it more important than ever that the long-awaited American proposals on the Middle East peace process are now brought forward, and I would say that that should happen as a matter of priority,\u201d Johnson said as Tillerson stood uneasily a few feet away. \nWhile the decision directly affects his department, Tillerson acknowledged his role was relatively minimal. He said Trump\u2019s Mideast peace team, led by Kushner, had shared the decision with him so he could \u201cgive them guidance on areas that I thought would be challenging to address.\u201d \n\u201cThey\u2019ve done the hard work to try to address those,\u201d Tillerson said, insisting there remains \u201ca very good opportunity for peace to be achieved, and the president has a team that is devoted to that entirely.\u201d Photos", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tamara cofman wittes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taro kono", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kono", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yoshihide suga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julie bishop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio guterres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guterres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khan younis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "retno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saeb erekat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "retno marsudi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boris johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike pence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cavusoglu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mevlut cavusoglu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.n. security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for middle east policy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.n.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem share  kuala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bolivia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim-majority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "old city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uruguay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senegal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jakarta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beit hanoun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:28.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d65eef47e2bf223e0927043ac107c7f16090cdee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/qp0TC1ajDjgYeZ177f4HOWMrd5dreVkRspbkuGu26MI9D3LzwatG6qfHdCfEwJH8rdvm7KzDGkM-", "site_full": "67.227.255.239", "site": "67.227.255.239", "site_section": "http://67.227.255.239/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=2", "site_categories": ["adult", "business", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Gaming Discussion - NeoGAF", "title": "Final Fantasy 3 (snes) or Final Fantasy 6 (steam)?", "title_full": "Final Fantasy 3 (snes) or Final Fantasy 6 (steam)?

Many race bikes do not use them, as mine below. They should not be preventing movement, however. The front brake will not adjust correctly unless you have as little brake arm movement as possible and the brake arm levers are near equal on both sides and perpendicular to the cable when pulled. I would start there. It is the outer cable starting at the brake lever that is doing all the work.\nDavid\nLast edited by David Dunfey; 02/27/17 9:42 pm .

What a beautiful set-up you have on your bike! I'm envious.\nI believe I have improved mine by removing the balance beam and cleaning the gum out of the pivot insert and replacing with clean grease. The beam now moves much more freely. I found it interesting to see that the cable housing can actually be a hindrance - depending on the adjustment on the left side, the housing can restrict the beam from moving downward on the left and, hence restrict the upward movement on the right side, which means the left side brake arm movement is also restricted. I now see that one might be better off without the housing altogether - as on your bike.\nCheers\nPaul\n'74 Commando\n'75 T160 Trident\n'15 R1200 GS Adv\n'51 Vincent Rapide #686614 - 03/02/17 9:42 pm Re: Front brakes [ Re: Paul Sammut Paul,\nYes, the sheath on the left side has to be short enough to allow the left side cable to shorten. The cable on the right side is fixed.\nYou can slide the ferule up and expose the winding. With two needle nose you can unwind a bit and then grind it off with a dremel. Smooth it up and pull the ferule back over. Unfortunately, if the brake arm lever moves too much it may indicate that the brake linings are too worn. I use longer brake arms, which need more handlebar lever movement to work. My linings have to be quite thick to work. The stock levers can move a lot more with less handle bar lever movement. If you are trapping the outer housing on the lower left brake cable, it could be too long, or your shoe linings are too worn.\nIt is best to see if you can adjust the brakes to work correctly with even movement on each side. Then you can decide if the shoes seem too worn or someone just made the cable outer a little too long. There are a lot of adjusters, which is good in the long run, but it takes a while to figure out exactly how to set it up best.\nDavid\n#686898 - 03/05/17 5:33 pm Re: Front brakes [ Re: David Dunfey ] Joined: May 2009\nPosts: 270 Paul Sammut\n Paul Sammut\n May 2009\nPosts: 270\nOmaha, NE, USA Thank you, David - I'd already decided to shorten the left sided outer sheath as you describe.

I found that the shoe face plates (H48) on all four front brake shoes were missing! I ordered some from John and installed them after degreasing and re packing the bearings. I was then able to adjust the brakes with very satisfactory action of both levels and balance beam and without the binding I'd experienced from the left side outer cable housing.\nUpsetting to think the p.o. had been so sloppy, but glad I had an easy fix.\nThanks for all the kind suggestions.\nPaul\n'74 Commando\n'75 T160 Trident\n'15 R1200 GS Adv\n'51 Vincent Rapide #688217 - 03/15/17 2:09 pm Re: Front brakes [ Re: Paul Sammut Paul,\nI'm glad it was that simple.

Did Cash-Strapped Puerto Rico Pay Government Employees More Than $100 Million Christmas Bonuses? 12/07/2017 by Fraud Alert Leave a Comment Fraud Alert: \nIn early December 2017, various web sites and right-wing personalities began circulating on social media stories and blog posts reporting that the United States territory of Puerto Rico will give government employees their annual Christmas bonuses \u2014 despite the island being ravaged by Hurricane Maria just months earlier. \nPuerto Rico\u2019s plight in the face of a deadly natural disaster became the latest political spectacle of its kind after President Donald Trump got into a running Twitter spat with San Juan mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz over the federal government\u2019s sluggish response which left many with little or no assistance, and most without electricity for weeks. The capital city\u2019s mayor frequently pleaded with the mainland for aid, and was vocal in her criticism of the Trump administration\u2019s failure to provide it. \nBut like other aggrieved Americans before her (including two Gold Star families ), Cruz and the commonwealth island became the villains instead of the victims in the hyper-partisan social media universe. Thus, a public accountability story about wrangling over government budgeting became the latest Internet outrage, with one angry Facebook user opining: \nI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t give a dime. The money never seem to get to the people that it needs it everybody that donates just donate to the CEOs and the governors in the Mayors everybody that can steal from these relief funds I\u2019m not paying for their vacations or whatever else they use the stolen money on \nCribbing off an article in the right-wing site Breitbart , anti-Muslim blogger Pamela Geller wrote : \nPuerto Rico\u2019s leftist leaning politicos have been on a rant against President Donald Trump over what they say was his failure to give them the money they need for Hurricane Maria cleanup \u2014 but then they turn around and give out $100 million in government employee bonuses. \nThe governor\u2019s office said the bonuses had been part of an approved budget. \nOK \u2014 but so what? \nIt is true that Puerto Rican government will pay out a total of $113 million in bonuses to 105,000 public employees, totaling $600 each, and 141,000 retirees at $200 each, according to Bloomberg . The bonuses are and have been controversial in Puerto Rico, and they have earned the ire of a financial oversight board put in place by Congress in 2016 to mediate the islands fiscal woes. \nBut a letter sent from Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3\u2019s representative Christian Sobrino to the island\u2019s Financial Oversight and Management Board argues that the bonuses have been mandated by Puerto Rican law since 1969, and that they were already set to be paid before the hurricane struck with the approval of the oversight board: \nThe Government has always understood that it would make the end of year bonus payments during fiscal year 2018. As acknowledged in your Letter, the bonus payments are consistent with the March 13, 2017 certified Fiscal Plan. Moreover, the FY18 Commonwealth Budget, which was prepared and certified by the Oversight Board, provided for these bonus payments. Furthermore, the Oversight Board and the Government have included these payments in its internal and external figures before and after Hurricane Maria impacted Puerto Rico as part of the Government\u2019s regular payroll. Thus, the payment of Christmas bonuses has always been contemplated as part of the Fiscal Plan and FY18 Commonwealth Budget and have never been modified. The Oversight Board has also been well aware of this regular payment and at no time after Hurricane Maria suggested to the Government that such end of year bonus should not be made. \n[\u2026] \nAll public employees who meet this six-month requirement are \u201centitled\u201d to the bonus. This is not an issue of \u201cprudence\u201d because the Government\u2019s payment of the bonuses is not discretionary. The Government is required to pay the bonuses as a matter of law to all qualifying employees regardless of whether they continue to work at the time the bonus is paid. Characterizing such payment as extraordinary is simply incorrect. \nThe letter was in response to one sent a week earlier by oversight board chair Jos\u00e9 B. Carri\u00f3n which called the paying out of bonuses at this time \u201cimprudent.\u201d The 27 November 2017 letter reads: \nWe are writing to express our concern with the Government\u2019s decision \u2014 without prior consultation with the Oversight Board \u2014 to make early payment of Christmas bonuses despite the perilous liquidity situation on the Island. While the Oversight Board shares in your desire to recognize public employees who have gone above and beyond in aiding recovery efforts across the Island, to do so in a way that increases the liquidity strain on the Commonwealth at this time puts the public at risk and demonstrates a lack of fiscal discipline. We are particularly concerned that Christmas bonuses are being paid not only to those who are working hard to restore order on the Island, but possibly are also going to public employees who are no longer working. \nTherefore, regardless of whether the payments described under Act 26 are in compliance with the certified Fiscal Plan of March 13, 2017 and the FY18 Commonwealth Budget, the Oversight Board finds it imprudent to make such payments while the Government is in the midst of developing a proposed revised Fiscal Plan and at a time of extreme uncertainty with regards to the impact of Hurricane Maria on both the current cash situation of the Government and on public sector employment. Going forward, the Oversight Board expects to be consulted during the formulation and prior to the announcement of policies such as this to ensure the Government is upholding the principles of fiscal responsibility that are so crucial in this post-Hurricane Maria environment. \nThe conflict over the bonuses and overall budget situation isn\u2019t new, but the sudden national interest in it is \u2014driven by the obvious clickbait appeal of cash-strapped Puerto Rico, a predominantly Spanish-speaking territory in the Caribbean Sea, asking for $94 billion in federal recovery aid while paying millions in bonuses, after its political leaders criticized the Trump administration. The hostility that spread through social media was perhaps influenced by the fact that many Americans don\u2019t know Puerto Ricans are fellow United States citizens. \nAlthough the official death toll from Maria, which slammed into Puerto Rico in late September, hovers at 55, hundreds who have not been accounted for died in the aftermath of the storm from conditions exacerbated by the fact that a majority of the island lost electricity and drinking water for weeks on end. Reports in the news media from the island provide accounts of bodies piling up at funeral homes and morgues. \nThen there are anecdotes about people like Quint\u00edn Vidal Rol\u00f3n, an 89-year-old who survived the storm itself. Rol\u00f3n died one month after the storm in a house fire caused by an oil lantern he had been using in lieu of electricity. \nGot a tip or a rumor?

In order to cope with the situation, its important to find a good dyslexia therapist Michigan . The symptoms should be recognized and proper diagnosis should be made so that effective treatment plan can be put into place.\n\nThere are situations where individuals do not receive the necessary treatment because their illness is not diagnosed in an accurate manner. To ensure that the child gets proper treatment, he needs to undergo certain assessments in order to identify the real cause of this problem and its severity level as well.\n\nDifficulty in recognizing letters or rhyming them incorrectly are few of the symptoms associated with dyslexia. When a child reaches a certain age they should be able to recognize letters and get good at rhyming as well. But, if they struggle to do so then you should take it seriously and do further assessments to identify the real cause of this issue.\n\nDyslexics find it a very difficult task to copy things from books and blackboards. It is very stressful for a child who is dyslexic to do these tasks without making any mistakes. They are a bit disorientated with their writing abilities as well as other functional abilities.\n\nAs compared to other children, their intelligence level is far more superior and in their head, they know the right words but when they tend to speak out, they use the wrong words and afterwards they feel embarrassed about it. Using wring words is not that big issue but the reason why they use these wrong words needs to be identified and you should make effort to resolve this issue.\n\nIf these symptoms are not treated and ignored then slowly gradually the child starts to feel embarrassed about himself and loses his confidence. He may not want to go to school anymore and loses interests in everything related to his studies. The reason why a child needs to be assessed is because its important to distinguish whether he is suffering from dyslexia or some other learning disability.\n\nProper treatment plan is only possible when the diagnosis is made at an early age. Full recovery can never be achieved but the severeness of the illness can be minimized provided the child receives full care and attention to deal with this issue in an accurate manner. He may struggles at first but afterwards he would learn how to cope with these issues in a manner that his learning abilities are no longer affected by it.\n\nAs it is a condition that would stay with your child therefore he needs to learn how to deal with it.

Even a Facebook page can bring an unbelievable amount of traffic to your business and get your name out there among potential customers. There is no limit to the possibilities. This article can help you tap the potential of Internet marketing and harness the power for your business. Make a website for your business and keep it up-to-date. If a customer or potential client is interested in your business, the first thing they\u2019ll often look at is your website. You want to include any relevant information about your business on that site, make it look nice, and above all, make sure it\u2019s user friendly!\nAllow your customers to write product reviews on your website. Filling a website with unique content is arguably the best search engine optimization technique around. Unfortunately, content can be expensive, however, if you allow your existing customers to write product reviews about items they have already purchased, you can get useful, unique content for free.\nUse PLRs, private label rights, for internet marketing if you do not have the time to write. PLR is content that someone writes and after you purchase it, you can do as you wish with it. You can change all, rewrite it, and use it for other purposes. You can find quality PLR in many places on the internet and use the content in your e-mails to customers, followers and subscribers.\nOne of the most appealing aspects of your personality that you can instill in your site is humor. Make sure that you keep things business professional, but including a joke here and there will never hurt. Inserting humor into your communication with customers makes for a very light and fun level of dialogue.\nInternet marketing is inevitably intertwined with search engine optimization; solidifying a strong search engine optimization strategy is critical. Search engine optimization helps people find your website and, by extension, your brand\u2019s marketing messages. Much of your marketing will be more effective if you can lead people to your own online property effectively through search engine optimization.\nWhen you are running an online business, make sure that the content of your website stays fresh. If your customers see the same content on your site day after day, they will soon lose interest and move on to other places. When you offer something new periodically, this will keep your customers interested.\nRevisit ideas you have decided against, again and again. If a form of marketing was not right for your budding business a year ago, that does not mean it will still be that way today. Remember to attempt to take advantage of as many marketing tools as you can, including those that you initially disliked.\nRather than using only text, add some pictures, videos or diagrams to your site. Use content that is related to your business. You can demonstrate how to use the product or show pictures of the inside of the product if it is an electronic item. Find material that will appeal to the readers.\nLook at your website, you may love it just because it is yours, but there is always room for improvement. If you are not open to the idea that your website can be improved, you will not have the website you desire and others want to visit. Not one website is perfect, and all websites can improve.\nOne of the latest internet marketing tactics is to ensure that your website appears with Rich Snippets on search engine results pages. You may have noticed some results on the results page have a small line of metadata between the page title and the page description \u2013 these are Rich Snippets. Educate yourself on microdata and RDFA protocols to ensure your pages get Rich Snippets of their own.\n\nAbout the Author: \nEven though there may be no \u201cperfect\u201d technique in existence, you\u2019ll find a great deal of simple approaches and procedures that may be utilized to drastically increase your ppv networks earnings. It requires time, dedication, and study inside your niche to climb the ladder, but in the long run it will all be worth it. \nTips To Help You With Internet Marketing\nfrom top of http://ift.tt/2BRGCgE ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "saul jennifer internet", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:31.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "83d77ff0b82b82c25357dbc042cd898935face7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9xvkZ.HdOFxRC3M2jloPMfHazAe0IU6NNW50txcwhr4dpPKIbiX9E.ztT1GpB5HW_xoUtF5G9rAsWbtr6MWNjp", "site_full": "www.zipleaf.us", "site": "zipleaf.us", "site_section": "http://www.zipleaf.us/RSS", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Popular Businesses Listed In ZipLeaf", "title": "Stanley Garage Door Repair Hurst - Hurst, Texas, United States", "title_full": "Stanley Garage Door Repair Hurst - Hurst, Texas, United States", "published": "2017-12-07T09:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "83d77ff0b82b82c25357dbc042cd898935face7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9xvkZ.HdOFxRC3M2jloPMfHazAe0IU6NNW50txcwhr4dpPKIbiX9E.ztT1GpB5HW_xoUtF5G9rAsWbtr6MWNjp", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "Stanley Garage Door Repair Hurst - Hurst, Texas, United States", "text": "About Stanley Garage Door Repair Hurst Established January 2017 \nHere at Stanley Garage Door Repair Hurst, We have all garage door repair services you will need and offer both garage door service & repair for our customers.

A player confirmed to TSN on the condition of anonymity that he received his ballot yesterday. Another confirms hes been told to expect his shortly. \"The unions executive committee insists a strike vote does not mean were pushing away from the table,\" the player said. \"But we want the league to know were serious about our position.\" The players executive committee includes union president Scott Flory, vice-presidents Jay McNeil, Marwan Hage and Jeff Keeping and treasurer Brian Ramsay. Keeping (Toronto Argonauts) and Ramsay (Edmonton Eskimos) are the two active players on the committee. The league and players are still scheduled to meet in Toronto Wednesday - eight days before the current CBA is set to expire on May 29 - when the players will table a new proposed collective bargaining agreement that will include a revenue sharing scheme with the union requesting a percentage of gate, sponsorship and television revenue. With each revenue stream the union is proposing its share be in the range of approximately 40-55 per cent. The proposal includes a salary cap of approximately $7 million in the first year of a new CBA. In 2013, the last year of the current agreement, the salary cap was $4.4 million. The league has so far been reluctant to discuss any revenue sharing model. \"Weve been told to expect a step back tomorrow (from the owners),\" the player says. The CFLPA requires more than 50 per cent of its players to confirm a strike vote. But the players must adhere to provincial labour laws, and cannot picket immediately. According to a source with knowledge of the talks, only players in certain provinces, where a strike vote can happen before the current bargaining expires, have received their ballots.

Making his fifth major league start, Despaigne didnt allow a hit until Daniel Murphy doubled to left-centre with two outs in the eighth. San Diego, the only active major league franchise without a no-hitter, was playing its 7,264th regular-season game and has played 34 more in the post-season. The Mets were the only other active big league team without a no-hitter before Johan Santana pitched one against St. Louis in June 2012 during New Yorks 8,020th regular-season game. Murphy scored on David Wrights single to tie the score 1-1. Vic Black (2-3) walked Carlos Quentin on four pitches leading off the ninth, and Alexi Amarista bunted, with pinch-runner Cameron Maybin advancing to second and Amarista reaching when the ball went through Blacks legs for an error. Chase Headley grounded into a 4-3-6 double play as Maybin reached third. Josh Edgin relieved, and the pitcher tumbled to the ground when he came off the mound to field Smiths bouncer between the mound and first. Edgin dropped the ball, picked it up and then shovelled it to first too late to catch Smith as Maybin came across the plate. Joaquin Benoit (4-2), San Diegos fourth pitcher, threw a perfect ninth for the winn. New York scored one run in the last 18 innings of the series and has lost two in a row following a 9-2 spurt. Despaigne, a 27-year-old Cuban right-hander signed as a minor league free agent on May 2, allowed one run and two hits in 7 2-3 innings with five strikeouts and three walks. He threw 123 pitches and lowered his ERA to 1.31. His was the longest no-hit bid by a single Padres pitcher since Sept. 7, 2008, when Chris Young allowed a two-out home run in the eighth to Milwaukees Gabe Kapler. Yasmani Grandal homered in the fourth off Zack Wheeler, who allowed one run and eight hits in six innings with seven strikeouts and a walk. NOTES: Mets manager Terry Collins said RHP Daisuke Matsuzaka could step in if LHP Jon Nieses start is cut short in Seattle on Monday. With Neises return from the DL, Matsuzaka will work out of the bullpen but is available for a spot start. ... Collins said OF Bobby Abreu started on Sunday to prepare him for the DH role in Seattle. Abreu is 0 for 18 as a pinch hitter. ... Padres SS Everth Cabrera (strained left hamstring) is to play Monday with Triple A El Paso. ... RHP Andrew Cashner (right shoulder strain) threw again on the side but will rest on Monday. ... Niese (5-4, 2.96) faces Mariners LHP Roenis Elias (7-8, 4.54) on Monday. Padres LHP Eric Stults (3-11, 4.98) goes against Cubs RHP Kyle Hendricks (0-0, 6.00) on Tuesday in Chicago.

Posted: 8:01, December 7, 2017 by TenerifeNews Morgan homed Morgan arrived at the kennels in a terrible state a few months ago. She had a severe flea allergy which left her partially bald. Her skin was covered in irritation and painful lesions. If that isn\u2019t enough, she came back heartworm positive! Her allergy was treated with flea prevention medication and her skin was treated with a combination of shampoos, creams and spot on oils. Once she began to recover we really saw a change in her behaviour. She came out of her shell and quickly stole everyone\u2019s hearts. Eventually she made a full recovery from her allergy and heartworm disease. After recovering in a foster home, PondencoWorld helped K9 to find her forever home in Holland, which she jetted off to last week. Although she is an old dear she deserves to live out her days in a loving and care free home. We are so happy to see her arrive safely and we await more news from her once she has settled in!

It lost the popular vote for the first time to the opposition in 2013.\nDespite being plagued by an epic corruption scandal that involved hundreds of millions of dollars passing through his bank accounts, Najib has clung to power and his coalition is likely to win elections due by August.\nThe opposition coalition was in disarray but has converged under 92-year-old Mahathir after he made a high-profile return to politics in a bid to oust Najib. Mahathir was Asia's longest serving leader for 22 years before stepping down in 2003, and is still influential among ethnic Malay Muslims who account for about 60 percent of Malaysia's 32 million people. Chinese and Indians make up the rest.\n\"It is odd that there are still people who are willing to be led by someone in his twilight years. Former Zimbabwe President Mugabe, who is the same age as he is, has already been rejected by his own people,\" Najib said.\nHe urged UMNO's more than 3 million members to stay loyal and prevent the country from falling into the opposition's hands.\n\"We are at a monumental crossroad. The fate of the nation is in our hands. The nightmare that will befall us is unthinkable\" if the party loses, Najib said, warning that Malays will be stepped on and disparaged in their own land.\nNajib has fired critics in his own government, including an attorney-general and deputy prime minister and muzzled the media since the corruption scandal erupted two years ago. The U.S. and several other countries are investigating allegations of cross-border embezzlement and money laundering at 1MDB, a state investment fund set up and previously led by Najib to promote economic development but which accumulated billions in debt.\nThe U.S. Justice Department says at least $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB by associates of Najib, and it is working to seize $1.7 billion taken from the fund to buy assets in the U.S, potentially its largest asset seizure ever.\nIts complaint filed with a U.S. District Court says more than $700 million landed in the accounts of \"Malaysian Official 1,\" which it did not name but through descriptions of that official's role in the fund and government, as well as other details, made clear was Najib. Malaysia's attorney-general has said the millions in Najib's accounts were a political donation from the Saudi royal family that was mostly returned. Najib has denied any wrongdoing.\nAnalysts said the 1MDB scandal didn't resonate with rural Malays, who were more irked by rising cost of living. Aided by a stronger economy, Najib recently promised financial handouts to rural folks, cut income tax, abolished tolls on several major highways and boosted infrastructure spending in the 2018 national budget.\n\"He is the best prime minister of all because he takes care of our welfare,\" said Aisah Mahidin, who was listening to Najib's speech.\nShe said there was no proof that Najib took the money and that the U.S. investigation was a move to smear Najib's image.\n  Malaysian PM plays ethnic card as he gears for elections Southern California wildfires burn with little containment as conditions worsen Doctors   Air Force secretary tells Congress of concerns about reporting criminal activity Women behind #MeToo movement named Time magazine's 2017 person of the year Patagonia,   ANALYSIS:   Hormonal birth control linked to increased breast cancer risk, study says Kentucky lawyer who vanished pleads not guilty to escape Driver recounts moment woman was pushed in front of bus by jogger Temporary OK for travel ban puts focus on Wednesday hearing Court to hear bid to dismiss lawsuit in Freddie Gray case North Dakota: Refinery near national park could win permit Putin announces 2018 re-election bid, ends long speculation Congressman:   Lionel Richie cancels show to help family evacuate California fires Homeless numbers rise for the first time in 7 years, officials say  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mugabe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aisah mahidin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahathir mohamad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahathir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "najib razak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mugabe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "najib", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. district court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shares star   united malays national organisation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united malays national organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national front coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumpur", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:31.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2db337d6713a3acc2b5663b07e74ffe8e0728e5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg94_2GKak84QkpDC4yla9UYpdkVq7o6.8MyAmiqCxQirpW02n5ZUm3vpOp_Ghh0Pe8-", "site_full": "www.usasexguide.info", "site": "usasexguide.info", "site_section": "http://www.USASexGuide.info/forum/forumdisplay.php?72", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "South Carolina", "title": "BackPage Advertiser Reviews", "title_full": "BackPage Advertiser Reviews", "published": "2017-12-06T08:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9b20b2af8f32e24da85f72f77587535deaf6321", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg94_2GKak84QkpDC4yla9UYpdkVq7o6.8MyAmiqCxQirpW02n5ZUm3v7gwoMwnJ8K_uKGQOdF7Neg2tCBk_kNDK", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Xist269", "published": "2017-12-06T07:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Where can I find contact info.

Dezember 2017 44 Views Foto: IG Metall \nTarifrunde der Metall- und Elektroindustrie startet \nMit 3,4 Millionen Besch\u00e4ftigten ist die Metallindustrie der wichtigste Bereich der deutschen Wirtschaft. Deren Tarifrunde ist daher von gro\u00dfer Bedeutung. \nVon Torsten Sting, Rostock \nDie Metallbosse verdienen pr\u00e4chtig. So stieg die Nettoumsatzrendite mit vier Prozent auf den h\u00f6chsten Stand seit 2008 . Gerade die Autokonzerne haben zuletzt ein Rekordergebnis nach dem anderen eingefahren. \nOffiziell gilt in der westdeutschen Metallindustrie die 35-Stunden-Woche. Sie steht in vielen Betrieben jedoch nur auf dem Papier, da sie durch eine krasse Flexibilisierung faktisch ausgehebelt wird. Der Arbeitsdruck hat f\u00fcr viele Besch\u00e4ftigte zugenommen. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist die Debatte um Arbeitszeitverk\u00fcrzung und damit verbundene Entlastung wieder in die G\u00e4nge gekommen. IGM-Forderungen \nEines der Ziele der Metallgewerkschaft ist eine Lohnsteigerung um sechs Prozent. Angesichts der gro\u00dfen Gewinne der Kapitalisten, sowie steigender Lebenshaltungskosten, zum Beispiel den Mieten, ist dies eigentlich eine bescheidene Forderung. \nDie Forderung nach Arbeitszeitverk\u00fcrzung ist erstmal grundlegend zu begr\u00fc\u00dfen, ist diese doch eine Chance, den Druck zu verringern und die Arbeitszeit auf mehr K\u00f6pfe zu verteilen und damit letztlich die Erwerbslosigkeit zu bek\u00e4mpfen. Dies w\u00e4re im Interesse der gesamten Arbeiterklasse und w\u00fcrde zudem die Kr\u00e4fteverh\u00e4ltnisse zugunsten der Lohnabh\u00e4ngigen verbessern. Knackpunkte \nDer Anspruch der Gewerkschaften war fr\u00fcher, dass alle Besch\u00e4ftigten in den Genuss der Arbeitszeitverk\u00fcrzung kommen sollten. Die Forderung der IGM folgt dem aktuellen Trend, dass diese keinen kollektiven Charakter hat, stattdessen soll ein individueller Anspruch ausgehandelt werden. Die Arbeitszeitverk\u00fcrzung w\u00e4re zudem auf maximal zwei Jahre begrenzt. Sinnvoller w\u00e4ren Forderungen, wie sie von Gewerkschaftslinken vorgeschlagen wurden, wie die nach zus\u00e4tzlichen freien Tagen f\u00fcr alle. \nDie Gewerkschaft EVG schloss vor einigen Monaten beim DB-Konzern einen Tarifvertrag ab, bei dessen Ergebnis die Besch\u00e4ftigten zwischen Lohnerh\u00f6hung, mehr Urlaub oder k\u00fcrzeren Arbeitszeiten w\u00e4hlen konnten. Aufgabe von Gewerkschaftslinken muss sein, deutlich zu machen, dass man diese Forderungen nicht gegeneinander stellen darf. N\u00f6tig ist sowohl, dass die Arbeitszeiten verk\u00fcrzt, als auch die L\u00f6hne deutlich gesteigert werden, beziehungsweise es zu einem vollen Lohnausgleich kommt. Nicht nur, weil wir wenig davon haben, wenn wir mehr Freizeit, aber weniger Geld in der Tasche haben \u2013 sondern auch, weil eine solche Individualisierung die kollektive Kampfkraft untergraben kann. Streik vorbereiten \nNeben den traditionellen Warnstreiks, wird die Spitze der IGM wahrscheinlich auf weitergehenden Druck verzichten, da sie an einem zugespitzten Konflikt mit dem \u201eSozialpartner\u201c kein Interesse hat und eine Bewegung von unten f\u00fcrchtet, wie der Teufel das Weihwasser. KollegInnen von der Basis m\u00fcssen jetzt damit beginnen, von unten Druck aufzubauen (zum Beispiel bei Betriebsversammlungen, durch Antr\u00e4ge in Gremien), um einen Arbeitskampf in die Wege zu leiten. Zudem sollte die \u00d6ffentlichkeit gesucht und mit Aktionen f\u00fcr die Forderungen geworben und der Schulterschluss mit den anderen Gewerkschaften gesucht werden.

Answers Emerge", "text": "donderdag 7 december 2017 How Much Did the Fires in California Cost? Answers Emerge \u201cThe most destructive and deadliest\u201d fires in the state\u2019s history . The wildfires in California\u2019s North Bay area that started on October 8 and killed 44 people, \u201cthe most destructive and deadliest in our state\u2019s history,\u201d as the California Department of Insurance said on Wednesday, caused $9.0 billion in claimed losses so far. This is triple the $3 billion of claimed losses insurers reported a month ago. With the October fires in southern California included, the amount of losses rises to $9.4 billion. This does not include the losses from fires currently raging in Southern California, such as the Skirball fire in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles that is threatening the homes of many celebrities and potentates, including Elon Musk, who owns five homes in the neighborhood, and Rupert Murdoch. The fire is also threatening the Getty Museum. Any losses from those current fires will be on top of the $9.4 billion. We say that there are two seasons in California: rainy season (if any) and fire season. This year, both of them have been ferocious. The report by the insurance commissioner is based on claims data as of December 1, supplied by over 260 insurance companies. Any claims made after that date are not included. The insurers reported some sobering numbers of the devastation, according to claims filed by policy holders so far: * 5,747 residential properties that are total losses * 15,359 residential properties that are partial losses, * 2,814 commercial property claims, businesses and apartment buildings with four or more units, including 997 total losses. * 6,101 private and commercial vehicles. * 788 losses involving other lines of insurance such as agricultural equipment and watercraft. # Sonoma County got hit the hardest among the impacted counties with nearly $7.49 billion in claimed losses, including: - $6.9 billion in claims by 14,686 policy holders of residential personal properties, including 4,785 for total losses. - 480 million in claims for commercial properties. - $70 million in claims for vehicles. # Napa County accounted for $1.27 billion in claimed losses, including $1.1 billion for residential properties, involving nearly 2,500 claims, with 447 for total losses. In Mendocino County, policy holders have filed $182 million in claims so far. Other counties were impacted as well, but to a lesser extent. Of the $9.4 billion in claims, insurers have so far paid out $3.19 billion, according to the Insurance Department. But numerous homeowners are finding out that their homes were underinsured. Vehicles without comprehensive insurance were not covered. Countless personal items were destroyed that were not insured. Marijuana growers were not covered. Under California law, medical marijuana has been legal for two decades, and \u201crecreational\u201d marijuana will become legal on January 1. Under Federal law, all of it remains illegal, creating a no-man\u2019s land for insurers and banks in the booming business. Some of the crops, buildings, and equipment were destroyed. None were insured. Anecdotally, it was reported that some properties burned down with substantial amounts of paper cash inside as banks don\u2019t service this industry. Part of the land turned to ash, including entire neighborhoods of Santa Rosa. And tourism, a big thing in beautiful Sonoma County, has taken a major hit. So the ultimate monetary damage will be far larger than the aggregate insurance claims reported by the industry, and may never be fully known....

If you take the time to take a step back and look at the bigger picture, you can as he said above view your life as chapters, whereby this particular one you're living right now is where you're experiencing hardship but when you take that next step and open up a new chapter in your life per say, you will view the negative experience as a much needed learning opportunity for you to learn from your mistakes and grow up to be a better human being. Then? Using the quote given by the user below, it is just like reliving your past life as if you're still there, whether you were on top of the world or going through the darkest moments in your life. If you can't move on from the past, you are stuck there and would not be able to evolve as a person and going through the pages of this book called \"Life\".\n So? Sure motivating quotes from strangers on the internet would not mean anything if you don't stop for a moment and take the time to learn something from what they say. These quotes mean something because they speak out of experience and knowing that they've move on from something that heavy, that should at least motivate you to review your approach to your own life and maybe start to do something about it. What do you say? Lesson Learned: Hardship can be so debilitating when you're experiencing it in the moment but if you endure it just enough, there will be an opportunity for you to restart your life anew.\n\nsource:  r/ GetMotivated ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:35.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9886ece1cda51e94544888b7db4ec1da5e294560", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog60D4cOXotpoMJ8KcGF_U1bQ65174Z_VgYwFhbnEGABRMDDQm3f5mg0a1NqGbdDk_lFs7k6jMgX.jZDsbghtSu.EQC.EyAGfqVQ--", "site_full": "community.sky.com", "site": "sky.com", "site_section": "http://community.sky.com/t5/The-Walking-Dead/bd-p/WalkingDead", "site_categories": ["science", "space_astronomy"], "section_title": "The Walking Dead -
