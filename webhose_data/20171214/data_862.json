BREAKING DOWN 'Uncle Sam' \nA popular etymology traces the use of \"Uncle Sam\" to the War of 1812, when it ostensibly referred to the meat packer Samuel Wilson, whose business supplied troops in New York and New Jersey. Barrels of Wilson's meat stamped \"U.S.\" were associated with his nickname, Uncle Sam, when in turn became a personification of the national government. \nUncle Sam is sometimes used in the financial media to refer to the federal government, particularly in the context of income taxes . \nPrior to the 19th century, the U.S. had been personified by the figure \"Brother Jonathan,\" originally a derogatory term for Puritans during the English Civil War. Female representations of the U.S. are also common: Columbia and, since the 20th century, Lady Liberty. \nThe most popular image of Uncle Sam is a World War I recruiting poster drawn by James Montgomery Flagg, which features a stern Uncle Sam pointing outward and the words, \"I want YOU for U.S. Army.\" \nSource: Wikimedia.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sam uncle sam definition", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "sam", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "jonathan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samuel wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james montgomery flagg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uncle sam", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wikimedia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. army", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:58.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aefdf1a08a1ea5931e7363fa03d6eef8a6d87009", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSttB_hD1IIFV0WQfwfOfgB8xI9DsNwVgZxf627i1xqSdHALCmSEzzeW96YWVQPdljsZz2HAtKLZtMDYJ3v34SVySd_iM0WkbC", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "r/IOTA", "title": "Iota down almost 50%..whats going on?", "title_full": "Iota down almost 50%..whats going on? : Iota", "published": "2017-12-07T15:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 59, "participants_count": 52, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d0a14dacb9b7fa618a824c9ca7e22bb5e7b7a2c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSttB_hD1IIFV0WQfwfOfgB8xI9DsNwVgZxf627i1xqSdHALCmSEzzeW96YWVQPdljsZz2HAtKLZtMDYJ3v34SVyZc.U39hL6um6oV4Cmsn.ZNeoLAXLhiHg--", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "Charmander_32", "published": "2017-12-07T15:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Are you srsly surprised it dipped... cmon", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:58.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aefdf1a08a1ea5931e7363fa03d6eef8a6d87009", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSttB_hD1IIFV0WQfwfOfgB8xI9DsNwVgZxf627i1xqSdHALCmSEzzeW96YWVQPdljsZz2HAtKLZtMDYJ3v34SVySd_iM0WkbC", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "r/IOTA", "title": "Iota down almost 50%..whats going on?", "title_full": "Iota down almost 50%..whats going on? : Iota", "published": "2017-12-07T15:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 59, "participants_count": 52, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f054185223bd75c88ee3d0acf9351c98c462d80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSttB_hD1IIFV0WQfwfOfgB8xI9DsNwVgZxf627i1xqSdHALCmSEzzeW96YWVQPdljsZz2HAtKLZtMDYJ3v34SVyZc.U39hL6uuew2JEIkDaAXhIcA1UkT1Q--", "ord_in_thread": 20, "author": "dandimite", "published": "2017-12-07T15:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "HODL strong fellas.

Two more accused, Nitin and Deepak, both aged 30, were arrested around 4 am by the Crime Branch, the police said on Thursday. \nA total of seven people were involved in the killings and five of them were arrested yesterday. \nPolice claimed the guard was one of the conspirators, but the accused killed him too, fearing he might confess during questioning. The women \u2014 Urmila Jindal (78) and her three daughters, Sangeeta Gupta (52), Nupur Jindal (48) and Anjali Jindal (45) \u2014 lived with about 40 members of their extended family at the residential complex, spread over 24,000 sq feet. They were found with their throats slit on October 7. Their first-floor flat had been ransacked. The body of the security guard, Rakesh (56), was found on the ground floor. \nJoint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Alok Kumar yesterday identified the accused as Vikash (26), Anuj (25), Sunny (22), Vikas (23), Neeraj (37), Nitin and Deepak. Anuj is a resident of Baghpat, while the others are residents of Ghaziabad. Police said they have recovered jewellery and Rs 50,000 from their possession. \nAccording to police, Vikash, Anuj and their associates came to Jindal\u2019s house around 2 am. Rakesh opened the gate and he took Vikash and Anuj to Urmila\u2019s flat. When Nupur came to the door, Vikash overpowered her and dragged her to a room, where he allegedly slit her throat. The six others then entered the flat, while Rakesh stood guard outside. \nPolice said the men allegedly stabbed the women to death, broke open the almirah and took the cash and jewellery.

Police Kills Undergraduate Bride Over N200 Bride", "text": "So SAD! Police Kills Undergraduate Bride Over N200 Bride So SAD! Police Kills Undergraduate Bride Over N200 Bride A student of Delta State Polytechnic, Sofia Oghogho, has been allegedly shot dead by a policeman identified as Sergeant Abua, who is attached to the Igbuzo Police Division, in Delta State. Also shot by Abua, at a checkpoint in the community, was a civil servant, Victor Emeagwai. The victims were in a Toyota Corolla, driven by an estate agent, Jerry Akinlabi, when the incident happened. Oghogho and Emeagwai were Akinlabi\u2019s girlfriend and friend, respectively. Punch newspaper reports that a team of five policemen, including Abua, had flagged down Ogogo at a checkpoint along Igbuzo Market. One of the policemen, identified as Nwokolo, was said to have demanded money from Akinlabi and the driver told him that he did not have N200 to give him. Nwokolo reportedly said he would take one of the N1,000 notes Jerry had on him. As Akinlabi drove off from the checkpoint, Abua reportedly shot at the car and bullets pierced the back of the vehicle, hitting Oghogho, who sat at the back seat. The bullet also grazed the back of Emeagwai, who was at the passenger\u2019s seat. Akinlabi told our correspondent that four cops, including the team leader, one ASP Akhabue, were detained by the police, while Abua evaded arrest. He said, \u201cOn Sunday, November 17, 2017, I was driving to the Igbuzor Market and on getting to a checkpoint, I met the policemen. We knew one another some months ago when I had an issue concerning a property at the station. I sounded the horn to greet them, but they did not respond.\u201cOne of them used his gun to hit the boot and I reversed. He said I wanted to beat the checkpoint. I told him that I assumed that they knew me very well and apologised. He demanded money. I wanted to give him N100 or N200, but it was N1,000 notes I had on me and I explained to him.\u201cHe said, \u2018Am I too small to collect N1,000?\u2019 When I declined to give him N1,000, he asked me to pull over, which I did. As the argument over N1,000 got heated, I entered my car and drove off.

The drive, which will continue till December 18, will cover 24 districts in Maharashtra. The previous two rounds of the campaign were conducted in January and July this year, during which, over 15,000 more TB cases were detected from across the country. \nSpeaking to The Indian Express, Deputy Director General of the Central TB Division, Government of India, Dr Sunil Khaparde, said the third round commenced in a majority of states from December 4 and will continue till December 18. Across the country, there are an estimated 28 lakh TB cases, he added. As part of the third round, he said, a house-to-house survey will be conducted in 189 districts across various states. \nOn the inclusion of Pune district in the third round, District TB Officer Dr Sunil Pote said a total of 121 sensitive pockets have been identified across 13 tehsils. A house-to-house survey is currently underway that will cover at least 2.8 lakh people. \u201cEarly detection and treatment is the key focus of the campaign,\u201d said Pote. He added, \u201cThere are 4,000 TB patients in Pune district, while 161 have multi-drug resistant TB and 14 have been detected with XDR (extremely drug resistant TB).\u201d \nAccording to Dr Sanjeev Kamble, joint director of health (TB and Leprosy), Maharashtra, the third phase will see an intensified survey in detecting TB cases among those living in slums, on the streets, old-age homes, as well as prisoners and other vulnerable groups.In Maharashtra, every year nearly 1.30 lakh new cases of TB are detected. There are 5,305 cases of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and 288 of extremely drug resistant TB (XDR-TB). \n\u201cWe have 3,400 teams of accredited social health activists, multipurpose workers, among others, to conduct the survey in 24 districts,\u201d he said.

With the agreement in place and contractors, Tetra Tech and Stantec selected, the project team is moving ahead to conceptualize the plan and develop its project specifications for construction. The Negley Run project involves several Pittsburgh neighborhoods and will address regional, water quality issues in an area that is prone to some of Pittsburgh\u2019s most catastrophic wet weather events. \u201cSeparating stormwater from the sewer system along Negley Run Boulevard will alleviate a habitual problem of flash flooding during storm events along that corridor of the city,\u201d said Capt. Matthew Wright, project manager Pittsburgh District. \u201cCurrent stormwater infrastructure was not designed to hold the volume of water that occasionally precipitates in that area.\u201d Homewood, Larimer, Lincoln-Lemington, Point Breeze and parts of East Liberty all have a direct connection to Washington Boulevard where it is essential to manage stormwater. The project team is reviewing previous studies conducted by these neighborhoods and will coordinate the final design with multiple city departments, regional, state, and federal agencies as well as impacted community groups and nonprofit partners. \u201cLocal community groups and nonprofits have done an exceptional job studying this area,\u201d stated Robert Weimar, Interim Executive Director of PWSA. \u201cThese existing studies will help to inform the final design, and we look forward to continued collaboration throughout this project.\u201d It is estimated that the completed project will divert 17 million gallons annually from the combined sewer system. In early 2018, the design team will seek community input from project stakeholders, and PWSA is in the process of developing a public outreach plan to continue the community process. The Negley Run project is a Section 219 Environmental Infrastructure Project as defined by the Water Resources and Development Act of 1992. It authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to assist non-federal agencies in carrying out water-related environmental infrastructure and resource protection projects. The Army Corps of Engineers will provide 75 percent of the project cost as part of the cost-sharing agreement, and PWSA will contribute the remaining 25 percent. \u201cWorking with a partner like PWSA is an integral component of a cost-share project such as this one,\u201d said Wright. \u201cUltimately, we want to design a system that meets the needs of PWSA and the residents along Negley Run.  PWSA makes for a valuable partner because they have a level of expertise and access to a lot of the hydrologic data needed to design an appropriate system.\u201d For more information on Pittsburgh\u2019s green infrastructure plans, visit the Authority\u2019s Going Green webpage.

But in June 1967, during the Six-Day Arab-Israel War, Israel snatched East Jerusalem from Jordanian forces, and Israel\u2019s Parliament declared the territory had been \u201cannexed to Israel\u201d and Jerusalem had been \u201creunited\u201d. \nThis marginalised the Palestinians, who wanted East Jerusalem to be their capital under the \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d. Undeterred by the refusal of the international community to endorse the annexation, Israel added over 200,000 Jewish settlers to the once-almost entirely Arab East Jerusalem. Despite Israel\u2019s hold over its \u201cunited and eternal capital\u201d, in December 2016, the UN reaffirmed that Jerusalem\u2019s Palestinian territories were under \u201chostile occupation\u201d. Foreign embassies to Israel are in Tel Aviv, not Jerusalem. The positions of countries on the status of the city differ by degrees, but virtually none recognise the Israeli claim. India has traditionally backed a two-state solution, and assured that the Indian embassy would stay in Tel Aviv. Given all this, Trump recognising Jerusalem as the capital solely of Israel will mark a huge policy shift. \nREAD | US Jerusalem recognition: Our position on Palestine is independent, consistent, says India \nOK, but is the fight only over territory? \nIt is over both faith and civic space. Jerusalem has the Western Wall, part of the mount on which the Holy Temple stood, containing the Holy of Holies, the most sacred Jewish site where Jews believe the foundation creating the world was located, and where Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son; the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam; and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Jesus is believed to have been crucified, and where he rose again. Millions visit these shrines, and friction over who controls Jerusalem sets off unrest. In July, protests started after a shootout between Israeli Arab gunmen and Israeli policemen near the Temple Mount. The tension extends to civic rights \u2014 about 37% of Jerusalem\u2019s population is Arab, but municipal budgets allegedly discriminate against Palestinians, who live with residence permits that can be revoked. Palestinians also face segregation, surrounded by post-1967 Jewish enclaves, and there have been reports of Israeli soldiers targetting Palestinian civilians in acts of intimidation. \nRead | Donald Trump\u2019s Jerusalem move rings alarm bells in Arab world \nSo, why is Trump taking this step now? \nBack in 1995, when Bill Clinton was President, Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act, recognising the city as Israel\u2019s capital. But while Presidents Clinton, Bush Jr and Obama have backed the law domestically, international realities have kept them from implementing it. Thus, the US President signs a waiver every six months, deferring the decision to move the embassy. On campaign, Trump promised to implement the Jerusalem Embassy Act. Speculation that he was close to delivering arose after he missed two deadlines to sign the waiver. \nHow have other countries reacted? \nThe Islamic world is outraged. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has warned of \u201cdangerous consequences\u201d, Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II and Saudi King Salman have cautioned the US, Turkey has threatened to cut ties with Israel, Iran has declared that \u201cthe Palestinian nation will achieve victory\u201d, China has said it \u201ccould sharpen regional conflict\u201d, Egypt, the Arab League and several European nations have expressed grave reservations, and the Pope has pleaded for status quo. Hamas has threatened an intifada, and Hezbollah could react aggressively. India, friends with both Palestine and Israel, could face a quandary. \nWhat does Trump hope to gain? \nHe no doubt seeks to please his core base of pro-Israel hardliners. But as with most political developments in the Middle East, a bigger regional game could be afoot, including, possibly, a US-Saudi-Israel alliance against Iran, the common enemy. Critics have also pointed to alleged Israeli attempts to pressure Trump\u2019s transition team, which could fall in the scope of the investigation by special counsel Robert S Mueller III. And there may be the hidden hand of Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, who is reportedly close to Trump\u2019s son-in-law and Middle East adviser, Jared Kushner (who faces allegations of interests in Israeli settlements). Hearing the last in this story is a long way away.

The cartoon depicts a takeoff on Monopoly\u2019s \u201cget out of jail free,\u201d depicting a Hispanic-looking man with the label \u201csanctuary policies.\u201d This is not a humorous \u201cviewpoint\u201d from a conservative perspective, but a false, hate-mongering tagline of the alt-right; the type of material one would expect from Breitbart, not the Star Tribune.\nThe city of Minneapolis, like many other jurisdictions, has a \u201cseparation ordinance\u201d \u2014 an ordinance that makes clear the separation of responsibility between the federal government, which has exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the immigration laws, and local government. Contrary to the false narrative in the cartoon, separation ordinances are not \u201cget out of jail free\u201d schemes. People who commit crimes in Minneapolis will be charged and prosecuted, regardless of their immigration status.\nSeparation ordinances make our city safer, not less safe, because victims and witnesses of crime can report crimes and provide evidence to our police without fear of being turned over to ICE. Indeed, the federal immigration laws recognize the importance of encouraging victims to report crimes with their U and T Visa programs.\nThe national Holocaust Museum has an exhibit detailing the fascist propaganda that contributed to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. The parallels between items like the \u201csanctuary policies\u201d cartoon and the cartoons put out by the Nazis are obvious and disturbing.\nSusan Segal, Minneapolis\nThe writer is Minneapolis city attorney.\nPUBLIC DEFENDERS\nContention in Ramsey County reveals long-standing issues\nI read with interest the Dec. 5 article regarding Jim Fleming, chief public defender of Ramsey County, and his fighting \u201cRamsey County court\u2019s old ways.\u201d\nDifferences like those mentioned in the article have been going on for years, and are really nothing new. What has historically been problematic is the fact that courts expect defense attorneys to meet the courts\u2019 needs for the sake of convenience. An example of this is Ramsey County wanting the public defender\u2019s office to agree to an outdated, 27-year-old criminal calendaring system.\nFleming is an excellent chief public defender. His primary responsibility is not to serve the Ramsey County Court. His primary responsibility is to his office\u2019s clients and his public defender staff. Those are jobs he is doing well!\nDick Scherman, Pequot Lakes, Minn.\nThe writer is a retired former chief administrator for the state Board of Public Defense.\nTAX REFORM\nIt\u2019s tough, but possible, to favor the middle class\nWe all want to favor the middle class when providing tax relief. Let\u2019s ask questions, then analyze facts:\n\u2022\u2009Is achieving economic expansion desirable? Yes!\n\u2022\u2009If so, can the middle class receive the bulk of the relief dollars, and still achieve meaningful expansion \u2014 i.e., a level of expansion adequate to preclude long-term increases in the national debt?\n\u2022\u2009Alternatively, can we have meaningful expansion if the middle class benefits proportionally more than the highest earners, even though not receiving the bulk of the dollars?\nFacts:\n\u2022\u2009The top 25 percent of earners pay about 87 percent of federal taxes.\n\u2022\u2009The middle 50 percent (middle class) pay about 13 percent.\n\u2022\u2009Almost 50 percent of middle-class taxpayers pay no federal income taxes.\nBottom line:\n\u2022\u2009The middle class can be treated favorably while giving across-the-board tax relief.\n\u2022\u2009The middle class can receive a larger proportionate relief than the highest-earning individuals, and the country can still achieve meaningful expansion.\n\u2022\u2009However, insisting the middle class receive the bulk of the relief dollars precludes meaningful expansionary results.\nWe want tax relief. We want favorable treatment for the middle class. We want meaningful economic expansion. We can have all that if we support the developing Republican legislation. Remember, \u201cperfection\u201d is the enemy of \u201cthe good.\u201d\nSteve Bakke, Edina\nThe writer is a retired CPA and commercial finance executive.\nCOLON SCREENING\nColumn raised important topic, but didn\u2019t give a full account\nAs a practicing gastroenterologist, I recently read with great interest the \u201cAfraid to Ask\u201d column in the Star Tribune Magazine (\u201cOver 50? Get your you-know-what to the gastroenterologist\u201d). Raising awareness about colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention is commendable. The article highlights some very important information about colonoscopy and attempts to allay patients\u2019 fears and misunderstandings.\nWhile I recognize this column is meant to address uncomfortable topics, and colonoscopy certainly can be, I believe a great disservice was done to the readership in limiting the discussion to colonoscopy. The real question I am \u201cAfraid to Ask\u201d is why the column left out less expensive and less invasive CRC prevention methods. The column fails to mention alternative CRC prevention methods such as fecal immunohistochemistry testing, or FIT. Colonoscopy is not the only test, and it isn\u2019t even necessarily the best test for every patient. The U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer Screening recommends equally colonoscopy and FIT as first-tier tests. The Star Tribune article leaves readers ill-informed. Space could have been dedicated to alternative CRC prevention methods. Instead, the article closes with a poop joke.\nDr. Brian Hanson, Minneapolis\nThe writer is a staff gastroenterologist for the Minneapolis Veterans Health Care System and an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://1871.tm.zedo.com/v1/de0b1340-9167-4a0d-8f46-f1a0d7761ce3/atm.js", "http://1871.tm.zedo.com/v1/de0b1340-9167-4a0d-8f46-f1a0d7761ce3/tm.js?data="], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "adolf hitler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fleming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian hanson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim fleming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dick scherman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "breitbart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susan segal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bakke", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "star tribune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minneapolis veterans health care system", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state board of public defense", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramsey county court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "star tribune magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holocaust museum", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ramsey county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minneapolis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pequot lakes", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:00.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6c3ea4cf6a4ec381afa096a2e13d997cc56b13e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qP8PVPdFRHGUd6gG4I8fFllDoxRTCmfLJYIwJWJPcPvGQruuzZmRsoQ6vgk4cmHertQiSgJZ30633xkwMuwBGxGZFiBQM2UyQRT2oDHZzYxQg--", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "AAI recruitment 2017-18: Apply for junior assistant posts at aai.aero | The Indian Express", "title_full": "AAI recruitment 2017-18: Apply for junior assistant posts at aai.aero | The Indian Express", "published": "2017-12-07T13:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.891, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/12/aai1.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 11, "comments": 0, "shares": 11}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6c3ea4cf6a4ec381afa096a2e13d997cc56b13e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qP8PVPdFRHGUd6gG4I8fFllDoxRTCmfLJYIwJWJPcPvGQruuzZmRsoQ6vgk4cmHertQiSgJZ30633xkwMuwBGxGZFiBQM2UyQRT2oDHZzYxQg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Express Web Desk", "published": "2017-12-07T13:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "AAI recruitment 2017-18: Apply for junior assistant posts at aai.aero | The Indian Express", "text": "\nPay scale: Rs.12500-28500. \nEligibility criteria: Educational qualification: The aspirant should have a minimum qualification of class 10 pass plus three years approved regular diploma in mechanical / automobile / fire with minimum 50 per cent marks. \nor \nThe candidate should pass class 12 (regular study) with 50 per cent marks. \nThe candidate should have a driving licence.

Express", "text": "Rajasthan labourer hacked: Accused claimed murder in name of rescuing woman, she denies link \nArabs and Muslims across the Middle East on Wednesday condemned the US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital as an incendiary move in a volatile region and Palestinians said Washington was abandoning its leading role as a peace mediator. The European Union and United Nations also voiced alarm at US President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to move the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and its repercussions for any chances of reviving Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking. \nMajor US allies came out against Trump\u2019s reversal of decades of US and broad international policy on Jerusalem. \nFrance rejected the \u201cunilateral\u201d decision while appealing for calm in the region. Britain said the move would not help peace efforts and Jerusalem should ultimately be shared by Israel and a future Palestinian state. Germany said Jerusalem\u2019s status could only be resolved on the basis of a two-state solution. \nIsrael, by contrast, applauded Trump\u2019s move. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a pre-recorded video message that it was \u201can important step towards peace\u201d and it was \u201cour goal from Israel\u2019s first day\u201d. \nHe added that any peace accord with the Palestinians would have to include Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and he urged other countries to follow Trump\u2019s example. \nTrump upended decades of US policy in defiance of warnings from around the world that the gesture risks aggravating conflict in the tinderbox Middle East. \nThe status of Jerusalem is home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths. Its eastern sector was captured by Israel in a 1967 war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem for the capital of an independent state they seek. \nIsrael deems Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital dating to antiquity, and its status is one of the thorniest barriers to a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, in a pre-recorded speech, said Jerusalem was the \u201ceternal capital of the State of Palestine\u201d and that Trump\u2019s move was \u201ctantamount to the United States abdicating its role as a peace mediator.\u201d \nThe last round of US-brokered talks foundered in 2014 over issues including Israeli settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank and Israeli accusations of Palestinian incitement to violence and refusal to recognise it as a Jewish state. \nThe Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which has dominated Gaza since soon after Israel ended a 38-year occupation in 2005, said Trump had committed a \u201cflagrant aggression against the Palestinian people\u201d. Hamas urged Arabs and Muslims to \u201cundermine US interests in the region\u201d and to \u201cshun Israel\u201d. \nProtests broke out in parts of Jordan\u2019s capital Amman inhabited by Palestinian refugees, with youths chanting anti-American slogans. In the Baqaa refugee camp on Amman\u2019s outskirts, hundreds roamed the streets denouncing Trump and urging Jordan to scrap its 1994 peace treaty with Israel. \u201cDown with America\u2026America is the mother of terror,\u201d they chanted. \nAngry Palestinians switched off Christmas lights at Jesus\u2019 traditional birthplace in the West Bank town of Bethlehem and in Ramallah. A tree adorned with lights outside Bethlehem\u2019s Church of the Nativity, where Christians believe Jesus was born, and another in Ramallah, next to the grave of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, were plunged into darkness. \nAll Palestinian factions called for a general strike and protest rallies at midday on Thursday. \n\u201cLEGALLY NULL\u201d DECISION \nEgypt, which forged the first Arab peace deal with Israel in 1979, brushed off Trump\u2019s decision and said it did not change Jerusalem\u2019s disputed legal status. \nJordan said Trump\u2019s action was \u201clegally null\u201d because it consolidated Israel\u2019s occupation of East Jerusalem. \nLebanese President Michel Aoun said Trump\u2019s Jerusalem decision was dangerous and threatened the credibility of the United States as a broker of Middle East peace. He said the move would put back the peace process by decades and threatened regional stability and perhaps global stability. \nQatar\u2019s foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, said Trump\u2019s undertaking was a \u201cdeath sentence for all who seek peace\u201d and called it \u201ca dangerous escalation\u201d. \nTurkey said Trump\u2019s move was \u201cirresponsible\u201d. \n\u201cWe call upon the US Administration to reconsider this faulty decision which may result in highly negative outcomes and to avoid uncalculated steps that will harm the multicultural identity and historical status of Jerusalem,\u201d the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement. \nA few hundred protesters gathered outside the US consulate in Istanbul, a Reuters cameraman at the scene said. The protest was largely peaceful, though some of the demonstrators threw coins and other objects at the consulate. \nIran \u201cseriously condemns\u201d Trump\u2019s move as it violates UN resolutions on the Israel-Palestinian conflict, state media reported. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said earlier in the day that the United States was trying to destabilize the region and start a war to protect Israel\u2019s security. \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May disagreed with Trump\u2019s embrace of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital before a final-status agreement as this was unlikely to help nurture peace in the region, her spokesman said. \nHowever, May\u2019s spokesman welcomed Trump\u2019s stated wish to end the conflict and his acknowledgement that the final status of Jerusalem, including boundaries within the city, must be subject to negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said he did not support Trump\u2019s \u201cunilateral\u201d move. \n\u201cThe status of Jerusalem is a question of international security that concerns the entire international community. The status of Jerusalem must be determined by Israelis and Palestinians in the framework of negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations,\u201d Macron told reporters in Algiers. \n\u201cFrance and Europe are attached to a two-state solution \u2013 Israel and Palestine \u2013 leaving side by side in peace and security within recognised international borders with Jerusalem the capital of both states,\u201d he said. \n\u201cFor now, I urge for calm and for everyone to be responsible. We must avoid at all costs avoid violence and foster dialogue,\u201d he said. \nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said there was no alternative to a two-state solution and Jerusalem was a final-status matter only to be settled through direct talks. \n\u201cI have consistently spoken out against any unilateral measures that would jeopardize the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cI will do everything in my power to support the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to return to meaningful negotiations.\u201d For all the latest World News , download Indian Express App More Top News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "michel aoun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheikh mohammed bin abdulrahman al-thani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio guterres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guterres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yasser arafat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ayatollah ali khamenei", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "un", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union and united nations", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "algiers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bethlehem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramallah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:01.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aefdf1a08a1ea5931e7363fa03d6eef8a6d87009", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSttB_hD1IIFV0WQfwfOfgB8xI9DsNwVgZxf627i1xqSdHALCmSEzzeW96YWVQPdljsZz2HAtKLZtMDYJ3v34SVySd_iM0WkbC", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "r/IOTA", "title": "Iota down almost 50%..whats going on?", "title_full": "Iota down almost 50%..whats going on? : Iota", "published": "2017-12-07T15:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 59, "participants_count": 52, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f5324b944f15eb26c41f5f58689a4c8077e693ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSttB_hD1IIFV0WQfwfOfgB8xI9DsNwVgZxf627i1xqSdHALCmSEzzeW96YWVQPdljsZz2HAtKLZtMDYJ3v34SVyZc.U39hL6uDtic01RgrnR1.bd07fcl2g--", "ord_in_thread": 50, "author": "CynicalFinn", "published": "2017-12-07T17:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Not likely.

Now, a new study published online December 7 in the journal Scientific Reports by researchers at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University (LKSOM) associates the consumption of canola oil in the diet with worsened memory, worsened learning ability and weight gain in mice which model Alzheimer's disease. The study is the first to suggest that canola oil is more harmful than healthful for the brain. \n\"Canola oil is appealing because it is less expensive than other vegetable oils, and it is advertised as being healthy,\" explained Domenico Pratic\u00f2, MD, Professor in the Departments of Pharmacology and Microbiology and Director of the Alzheimer's Center at LKSOM, as well as senior investigator on the study. \"Very few studies, however, have examined that claim, especially in terms of the brain.\" \nCurious about how canola oil affects brain function, Dr. Pratic\u00f2 and Elisabetta Lauretti, a graduate student in Dr. Pratico's laboratory at LKSOM and co-author on the new study, focused their work on memory impairment and the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau, which is responsible for the formation of tau neurofibrillary tangles, contribute to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration and memory loss in Alzheimer's disease. The animal model was designed to recapitulate Alzheimer's in humans, progressing from an asymptomatic phase in early life to full-blown disease in aged animals. \nDr. Pratic\u00f2 and Lauretti had previously used the same mouse model in an investigation of olive oil, the results of which were published earlier in 2017. In that study, they found that Alzheimer mice fed a diet enriched with extra-virgin olive oil had reduced levels of amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau and experienced memory improvement. For their latest work, they wanted to determine whether canola oil is similarly beneficial for the brain. \nThe researchers started by dividing the mice into two groups at six months of age, before the animals developed signs of Alzheimer's disease. One group was fed a normal diet, while the other was fed a diet supplemented with the equivalent of about two tablespoons of canola oil daily. \nThe researchers then assessed the animals at 12 months. One of the first differences observed was in body weight - animals on the canola oil-enriched diet weighed significantly more than mice on the regular diet. Maze tests to assess working memory, short-term memory, and learning ability uncovered additional differences. Most significantly, mice that had consumed canola oil over a period of six months suffered impairments in working memory. \nExamination of brain tissue from the two groups of mice revealed that canola oil-treated animals had greatly reduced levels of amyloid beta 1-40. Amyloid beta 1-40 is the more soluble form of the amyloid beta proteins. It generally is considered to serve a beneficial role in the brain and acts as a buffer for the more harmful insoluble form, amyloid beta 1-42. \nAs a result of decreased amyloid beta 1-40, animals on the canola oil diet further showed increased formation of amyloid plaques in the brain, with neurons engulfed in amyloid beta 1-42. The damage was accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of contacts between neurons, indicative of extensive synapse injury. Synapses, the areas where neurons come into contact with one another, play a central role in memory formation and retrieval. \n\"Amyloid beta 1-40 neutralizes the actions of amyloid 1-42, which means that a decrease in 1-40, like the one observed in our study, leaves 1-42 unchecked,\" Dr. Pratic\u00f2 explained. \"In our model, this change in ratio resulted in considerable neuronal damage, decreased neural contacts, and memory impairment.\" \nThe findings suggest that long-term consumption of canola oil is not beneficial to brain health. \"Even though canola oil is a vegetable oil, we need to be careful before we say that it is healthy,\" Dr. Pratic\u00f2 said. \"Based on the evidence from this study, canola oil should not be thought of as being equivalent to oils with proven health benefits.\" \nThe next step is to carry out a study of shorter duration to determine the minimum extent of exposure necessary to produce observable changes in the ratio of amyloid beta 1-42 to 1-40 in the brain and alter synapse connections. A longer study may be warranted in order to determine whether canola oil also eventually impacts tau phosphorylation, since no effects on tau were observed over the six-month exposure period. \n\"We also want to know whether the negative effects of canola oil are specific for Alzheimer's disease,\" Dr. Pratic\u00f2 added. \"There is a chance that the consumption of canola oil could also affect the onset and course of other neurodegenerative diseases or other forms of dementia.\" ### \nThe research was funded in part by a grant from the Wanda Simone Endowment for Neuroscience. \nAbout Temple Health \nTemple University Health System (TUHS) is a $1.8 billion academic health system dedicated to providing access to quality patient care and supporting excellence in medical education and research.
