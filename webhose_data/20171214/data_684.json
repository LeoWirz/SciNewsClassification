You won't see any benefit from 4 GHz with 3200 MHz RAM compared to lets say, 3.9-3466 MHz.. I can run 4 GHz too with 3200 MHz RAM but i see better performance with 3.950 GHz and 346 MHz RAM. Also, why risking the high voltage that is needed for 4 GHz when you won't see any real world performance increase and risking degradation? It doesn't make sense to me..\nYou mean Super I/O Clock skew? You should disable it and put values of 272, you can find it in tweakers paradise.\nAgreed, its not worth risking the CPU with that kind of volts for only marginally speed increase you will only see in benchmarks..\nI never used Super I/O clock skew, i disabled it from the beginning because its not a good idea to leave it enabled when overclocking as it can cause problems for the CPU and i think for memory too.\n4266 MHz on Intel? It doesn't quite work like that, you need to bin CPU for clock speed and IMC which is very hard and nearly impossible to get the best of both worlds. Even then, Intel CPU's don't benefit from running faster memory speeds as Ryzen does and if they do, gains are marginally because timings cancel out speed at a certain level.\nIs better 3950 mh with 3466 cl14 than 4000 3200 cl 14-13-13-13?\nIf the answer is yes... i'm going for 3950 mhz an 3466 cl14...\nThanks...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ryzen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "intel cpu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:20.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5e98a504b2d437ed6d264ada417fb0636d9c4e05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCdXZgM0GGBfejqqOXxvJ43oIZUeMocZyjDJ67O2M.o_P0vkMmy8EvLySq7aIeT2LMCA_GU2OQqPAeLa1iqEjtOCM.IdfgKrU-", "site_full": "www.lpsg.com", "site": "lpsg.com", "site_section": "https://www.lpsg.com/forums/straight-adult-websites.32/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Straight Adult Websites | LPSG", "title": "Thesammysnake (Huge amateur cock) 2", "title_full": "Thesammysnake (Huge amateur cock) | Page 2 | LPSG", "published": "2017-12-06T12:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.387, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46054, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5e98a504b2d437ed6d264ada417fb0636d9c4e05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCdXZgM0GGBfejqqOXxvJ43oIZUeMocZyjDJ67O2M.o_P0vkMmy8EvLySq7aIeT2LMCA_GU2OQqPAeLa1iqEjtOCM.IdfgKrU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bigblackcocks", "published": "2017-12-06T12:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Thesammysnake (Huge amateur cock) 2", "text": "Some more finds?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:20.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c4da6c0b5c71ec360de33bee1ece6b0bda87192e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAW3R_b0zLFDzFQOS_R.p0EOvsWuS_J_a1vbUfXEvppmmPrMM1xmzuYX00xOg64hc71dAuxfFncI7nWVPWQKyArKqXgRuAddOsP.7ZZx2DcA6k6NJOpSAAl.iQBUKyXM0KQlCp5HOR4jv7u0ffa5NJ5iV3dkqT1PH_kfcg_Wh8DW.c-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/pediasure/abbott-official-store/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Pediasure Abbott Official Store - Buy Pediasure Abbott Official Store at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "PEDIASURE Nutrition Milk Powder VANILLA 1.6KG (1 to 10 Years Old)", "title_full": "PEDIASURE Complete Nutrition Milk Powder - VANILLA 1.6KG (1 to 10 Years Old) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-10-05T03:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 29, "participants_count": 30, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.057, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7dc414694a22462e355c71593e4b26058c1a0d2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAW3R_b0zLFDzFQOS_R.p0EOvsWuS_J_a1vbUfXEvppmmPrMM1xmzuYX00xOg64hc71dAuxfFncI7nWVPWQKyArKqXgRuAddOsP.7ZZx2DcA6k6NJOpSAAl.iQBUKyXM0KQlCp5HOR4jv7u0ffa5NJ5iV3dkqT1PH_kf9G0Vo3S0HsSNPqzC43n4Q--", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "Hemala M.", "published": "2017-11-28T04:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "fast delivery", "text": "fast delivery and exp date on 2019.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:20.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "214b1d503dbf5bcfd207c3333669d5ffd32a6613", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dlGaiyHn9kDUa_u6LiPoacx9EhguERruduwRn.rLi8pF1JeT3oVkFUTXBkimsy_OGDrDjkfMxE.FaBC6on1Qh", "site_full": "www.aldeer.com", "site": "aldeer.com", "site_section": "http://www.aldeer.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&Board=18", "site_categories": ["hunting_shooting", "sports"], "section_title": "AL Squirrel, Rabbit, Trapping, and Varmits - Aldeer", "title": "ICOtec GC350 Predator Call ?", "title_full": "ICOtec GC350 Predator Call ?

Saw this while videoing full moon. filmed it for 37 seconds. object flew erratically and pulsed different colors \nI was out videoing the full moon as i have documented several unidentified objects over the last 2 years while videoing. out of the corner of my eye, i saw an unusual flashing light pulsing different colors. it was very small in the night sky so no idea how big it was but could see it change colors with my naked eye. after about a minute of watching it, i decided to stop recording the moon and see if i could use the zoom to see what it was. i filmed it for 37 seconds before it disappeared. when zoomed in, the object looks like a flying jellyfish that pulses and can change shape and color. it was moving erratically around in the sky and i didn't understand why. when i increased the brightness, contrast and saturation of the video, i learned why it was moving erratically. only with the video pushed to enhance it could i see what was happening which was a number of beams that looked like lasers shooting from the object and shooting at the object from beneath. when i saw my first unidentified object while viewing the moon about 2 years ago, i was motivated to capture them on video. i purchased an 8\" celestron nexstar telescope along with digital camera gear and have been recording the moon for many months. i even started a youtube channel to post up my pictures and videos. nobody really knows about it since i want to stay anonymous and it doesn't really get viewed by many people. i decided to finally come forward with this because i feel people have a right to know the truth about ufos. the video i shot is undisputable evidence of some type of alien technology that could not possibly be anything our government can make. i have the raw footage of the video and once seen, it is very clear that it could not be a created video as the object changes color and shape continuously. i posted about a 5 second clip of the video on my youtube page. it was shot in full 1080p and can clearly be seen. here is the link to the youtube video http://bitly.com/2ADN36X again, i would like to remain anonymous with this but want people to know we are not alone in the universe. if you look at the videos and pics on my youtube page, you will see many more videos of ufos which further prove we are clearly not alone in the universe. \nLatest UFO Sighting \nCredit: MUFON \nAny duplication, in part or in whole, is forbidden without permission of copyright holder.

Bony said: \u201cI think it was probably two seasons ago, when I was at Manchester City, that I last played 90 minutes three times in a week,\u201d the Ivorian said. \n\u201cMy body is feeling okay. I had a little bit of pain in my legs after the three games but I will be ready for Saturday. \u201cI am happy because all you want as a player is to play games. The only way to get fit is to play. Once you play a few games you get more confidence.\u201d Netting his first goal back in South Wales after an unsettled past few seasons at Manchester City and Stoke City respectively, Bony\u2019s return to the principality has seen the forward struggle to return to the form that saw him score 26 goals in two seasons at Swansea, after his 2013 switch from Dutch side Vitesse. Having played the full 90 minutes in their last three games versus AFC Bournemouth, Chelsea and Stoke City however, Bony now feels ready to not only meet his full quota of playing time, but to score the goals to fire his club again, ahead of the festive schedule that begins in just over a fortnight. \nAs the basement-dwellers host a Baggies side four points above them \u2013 but still hovering precariously above the drop zone \u2013 Bony has emphasized the importance of Saturday\u2019s game and hopes to play his part, together with the home fans\u2019 support. \n\u201cWe know it\u2019s a crucial game,\u201d Bony stated. \u201cWe are at home and we have to find a way to win.

conference delegates.\nAmanda works as a Health Visitor in NHS Dumfries and Galloway and will also be presenting the poster at her local development day.\nIn addition to keynote speakers, the conference is a celebratory event to share the success of teams across the UK who have achieved or maintained baby friendly accreditation.\nThe SCPHN-Health Visiting programme was delighted to be re-accredited by baby friendly earlier this year and maintain the commitment of UWS to protect, promote and support breastfeeding.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

The England camp insists that he has recovered from a cut finger, which had compromised his effectiveness in Brisbane. Moeen did not bowl much ahead of the Ashes Test series due to a side strain, which limited his involvement in the warm-up matches.\nAs a result, he has been comprehensively out-bowled by his Australian counterpart Nathan Lyon in the series. The variation in performance between Moeen and Lyon has been one of the key differences in the series to date.\nAlso read Ashes: All-rounder Mitchell Marsh back in Australian squad for third Test While Australia have been able to rest and rotate their seamers to maintain an attacking edge to their game (Lyon has conceded just 2.29 runs per over and taken a wicket every 59.50 balls), Moeen has failed to pose much threat (he has taken a wicket every 189 deliveries) or control the run-rate as much as England would have liked (he is conceding 3.11 runs per over).\nEngland hope that Moeen will gain some rhythm and confidence from the two-day match with the coach, Trevor Bayliss, and the captain, Joe Root, suggesting he will retain his place for the Perth Test.\nAlso read Ben Stokes, Alex Hales included in England squad for ODI series against Australia Moeen will be joined in the side by the five members of the England squad who did not feature in the Adelaide Test (Gary Ballance, Ben Foakes, Mason Crane, Jake Ball and Tom Curran), while six members of the England Lions squad (Ben Duckett, Keaton Jennings, Dan Lawrence, Jack Leach, Liam Livingstone and Mark Wood) have also been included to make-up the rest of the team.\nPerhaps, the most intriguing of those inclusions from the Lions is Wood. If he is able to prove his fitness and bowl at his full pace, he could be added to the squad and could play a part in the Ashes later. Leach, the left-arm spinner, is also included, alongside spinners Crane and Moeen.\nAlso read Ashes ain't over: England captain Joe Root after Adelaide loss England XI's 12-man squad Moeen Ali (captain), Jake Ball, Gary Ballance, Mason Crane, Tom Curran, Ben Duckett, Ben Foakes (wk), Keaton Jennings, Dan Lawrence, Jack Leach, Liam Livingstone and Mark Wood.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dhoni", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "moeen ali", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ben foakes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitchell marsh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben duckett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom curran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe root", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mason crane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nathan lyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben stokes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark wood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keaton jennings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex hales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trevor bayliss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gary ballance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan lawrence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack leach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jake ball", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liam livingstone", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cricket australia xi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england lions", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chennai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adelaide", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richardson park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perth test", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:24.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "864134faf0a3ad022babe674cee04ee7a4dba0c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8vPZA6toGHh_4M7y2RJicAQi.Y33JMAHVIVQ8kz0ryCDw56yperW8MijPyMY4m4N0ZUDColsrTvhRe2ShooguAZmfQ9FcFzaGpkdaFvzL4_8vIFBfYJrwjL50h8kDr4U-", "site_full": "uk.reuters.com", "site": "reuters.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/UKVideoLatest", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Reuters Video: Latest Videos UK", "title": "Putin to seek another term as Russia's president", "title_full": "Putin to seek another term as Russia's president", "published": "2017-12-07T11:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://yospace-cds1.reuters.com/u/resize~ad1~1200cce51a24522-1512565844867?width=640&location=LANDSCAPE&videoId=RCV0046PG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 408, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "864134faf0a3ad022babe674cee04ee7a4dba0c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8vPZA6toGHh_4M7y2RJicAQi.Y33JMAHVIVQ8kz0ryCDw56yperW8MijPyMY4m4N0ZUDColsrTvhRe2ShooguAZmfQ9FcFzaGpkdaFvzL4_8vIFBfYJrwjL50h8kDr4U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "Putin to seek another term as Russia's president", "text": "Putin to seek another term as Russia's president   02:00 \nPresident Vladimir Putin confirmed Russia's worst kept political secret on Wednesday, saying he would run for re-election in March 2018 - a contest he seems sure to win comfortably and extend his grip on power into a third decade.   \nPresident Vladimir Putin confirmed Russia's worst kept political secret on Wednesday, saying he would run for re-election in March 2018 - a contest he seems sure to win comfortably and extend his grip on power into a third decade.  //reut.rs/2BRjvCT", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "putin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:24.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e799f2b974b9ecffab63782a889d7c952820e824", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWZ5Qwe35OYZIMOsW6fut9dFEfao0KOtyO9vz_rSNN2QDJFPZDIyYnGDVIKpkjJhA-", "site_full": "www.blowoutforums.com", "site": "blowoutforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.blowoutforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=65", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Spam your eBay &amp; COMC listings here!

He was one of the first people to call me when I got the job here. \n\u201cHe was manager of Crawley in my first game at Mansfield and we had a few little Scotches after the game. \n\u201cHe is someone I'd speak to once or twice every two weeks all the way through and to get that news was a real shock. \n\u201cI shed a tear with my daughters when I got the news on a text message. God only takes the good young.\u201d \nUnpredictable Crawley have won one, lost one and drawn four of their last six League Two games. \n\u201cThey have picked up in the last few weeks,\u201d said Evans. \u201cThey have been inconsistent but they do have good players. \n\u201cThey have a good guy for me in the manager's seat in Harry Kewell who had an impeccable CV as a footballer. \n\u201cThen he was at Watford as U23s coach, he knows what he's doing.\u201d \nEvans retains his affection for the club he took out of Non-League. \n\u201cI still look for their results as I do for Rotherham and Leeds,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThey are on different divisions so I want them all to win every week. But the most important result is ours and we want to add to out points tally at Crawley. \n\u201cIf we get one it will be a decent result on the road. If we can get three I think that will put us in the top five on Saturday night. \n\u201cThe people behind the scenes there and the supporters were wonderful to me.

With twelve larger islands and numerous smaller uninhabited islands and islets, the Dodecanese Islands have the right mix of tourism and tradition, a fascinating history, two UNESCO World Heritage sites and stunning landscapes. Best of all; it is still possible to escape the tourist and cruise ship crowds many of the more famous island groups attract. \nThese are the five Greek islands of the Dodecanese group we believe will appeal to a range of holiday criteria. But don\u2019t think for a minute you have to choose just one. A regular ferry service means you can have a Greek Island hopping holiday that will tick all the boxes. Leros Island \nWe really must start with our favourite. We spent nearly three months on Leros Island one winter and it is often our first choice for some rest and relaxation during the summer. Leros is a little off the mainstream tourist trail, so if it is authentic Greek holidays you are looking for, this incredibly friendly island is for you. \nDeep crystal clear bays for swimming, small fishing villages, and a beautiful landscape dotted with quaint little churches. Traditional tavernas across the island serve up some of the best Greek food we have eaten making this an idyllic island holiday setting. \nIf you want more than just sun-drenched days bathing in the clear Mediterranean waters, the island caters well to the active explorer and history buff. Leros has played many roles throughout history; the most prominent during the Byzantine era with the Knights of St John and in WW II. The island offers fantastic exploring for the hiker and some of the best wreck diving you will find anywhere. Leros has something for everyone without the maddening tourist crowds. \nYou can read more about Leros HERE Greek Island Hopping Tip: A holiday on Leros can be combined with a stay on Patmos Island as the distances are quite short. As the Patmos ferry service from Leros is fairly regular, it is also possible to visit Patmos Island on a day trip. Getting to Leros Island \nFlights: There are daily flights from Athens taking less than an hour. \nFerries: Overnight ferries leave Athens taking around 12 hours. Regular fast inter-island ferries leave from Kos and Rhodes daily. \nLeros Accommodation: Check latest accommodation rates for Leros hotels . \nWe have stayed at the Hotel Marilen . We like it because of the location, it has self-contained rooms, beautiful gardens and a fantastic swimming pool. It is very good value. Symi Island \nEntering the port of Symi, you are struck by the kaleidoscope of colour cascading down the hill. Neoclassical mansions in shades of terracotta, indigo and ochre tumble down the hillside to the port\u2019s edge. The approach to Symi Island is a sight you could never tire of. \nSymi\u2019s economy was founded on shipping, winemaking, commercial sponge diving and boat building. While these trades are still evident today, tourism is the prominent industry on this picturesque little island. \nWhile Symi does attract cruise ships and day-trippers from neighbouring islands, you can still enjoy the quiet, laid-back Greek island lifestyle. Most of the day-trippers will not stray far from the main port leaving many pristine swimming beaches free from crowds. Some Symi beaches can only be reached by taxi boats making them less enticing for the day tripper. \nAt the end of the day, when the tourists have left, head back to town to wander the quaint little backstreet boutiques in the cool of the early evening and then settle in for some fantastic waterfront dining. Symi Island may be more touristy than Leros but still retains a rustic Greek Island quality mixed with a sophisticated touch of other high end European destinations. \nGreek Island Hopping Tip: Symi would be well paired with a Rhodes holiday due to their proximity. A day trip is also achievable using the regular Rhodes to Symi ferry. Getting to Symi Island \nThere is no airport on Symi. Inter-island fast ferries run regularly from Rhodes and Kos. Ferry timetables will vary according to the season. \nSymi Hotels: If you are looking for good value, spacious semi self-contained apartments, The Opera House Apartments are perfectly located in quiet countryside but still within walking distance to the Port of Symi. Want something a little fancier? The Old Markets Hotel is in a beautifully restored historic building perfectly located near the main port town and beaches. \nCheck more accommodation rates for Symi Island . Kos Island. \nOne of the largest of the Dodecanese islands, the Greek island of Kos seems to have more history in the first five minutes of arriving than thought possible. It is also one of the most touristy and cosmopolitan islands. The islands iconic medieval castle greets you at the port, and as you head into Kos town through the castles\u2019 walls, you start to realise the ruins of ancient Greece. Ruins where Hippocrates, the father of medicine once taught his students, lie dormant throughout the city. Kos has so many ruins, you tend to become a bit blas\u00e9 about passing ancient relics lying on the side of the street or engulfed by weeds in a park. They appear to lie just as they fell thousands of years ago. \nIf history is not your thing, Kos has a thriving cafe, restaurant and bar scene, great shopping and is renown for its long stretches of sandy beaches. Organised beaches cater to the bustling seasonal tourist scene, but you can still escape the crowds and get off the beaten path. Leave the main towns, and you will find a slower more traditional Greek atmosphere, quiet beaches, local villages and scenic landscapes. You will never run out of things to do in Kos . \nKos will cater to those who want a comfortable, classic tourist holiday experience as well as those who still like to experience some local flavour.

Rhodes Island. \nThe largest of the Dodecanese Islands, Rhodes is also the most popular tourist destination. This island epitomises the perfect mix of tourism and tradition. A bustling tourist scene set in the UNESCO-listed medieval Old Town. You are instantly transported back to the days of Ottoman invasions and the Crusades of the Knights of St John. \nStroll the maze of medieval streets and laneways, and you will bear witness to different stages of history and the cultures that came with it. You will also be treated to busy restaurants, cool cafes and a plethora of shopping possibilities. Come dark; you will find a pulsing nightlife where tourists can kick up their heels and enjoy good old Greek hospitality, you will even find a casino. Rhodes boasts large hotels and resorts that you will not find on the other islands. \nTourism is mostly centred around Old Town, so there are plenty of opportunities to sneak away and find your secluded slice of this busy island. Beaches are not in short supply with organised beaches close to town as well as plenty of secluded bays offering pristine swimming conditions. If its water sports and boat trips you are after, head down the waterfront where there are no end of options for exploring both above and below water. \nMuch like Kos, Rhodes is very cosmopolitan so ticks the box for the perfect tourist getaway as well satisfying the culture vulture who likes a little bit more of a local experience. \nIsland Hopping Tip: A visit to Symi would be well paired with a Rhodes holiday due to their proximity.

In summer, there are flights from Thessaloniki as well as some charter flights from abroad. \nFerries: Regular ferries depart from Athens. Expect 12 hours travel time.

If wanting to make this transfer in winter, check timetables and be prepared for delays as ferries are cancelled in strong winds. \nWhere to Stay in Rhodes: Much like Kos, Rhodes has accommodation for all types and budgets. If you are looking for spacious, self-catering check out the Island Boutique Hotel or the Bellevue Suites. You will find luxury and romance for couples at the Rhodos Park Suites & Spa and great facilities including private beach at the adults only Lindos Blu Luxury Hotel \nYou can find more accommodation rates for Rhodes Island here . Patmos Island \nThe island of the Apocolypse, Patmos is known as a sacred island, the place where Saint John wrote the Book of Revelation. Designated as a \u201d Holy Island\u201d by Greek Parliament in 1981 and a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1999, Patmos also earns the title as one of the most idyllic islands to live. \nPerhaps this is why the island attracts a more discerning holiday maker and some very wealthy property investors. Patmos is about as traditional as you can get, but there is also a refined element of upmarket influence on this island, so expect things to be a little pricier than say on Leros or even touristy Rhodes. \nSet beneath the majestic monastery of St John and the Cave of the Apocalypse where St John is said to have written the Book of Revelations you will find the town of Chora. A maze of blindingly white alleyways dating back centuries wind through the hillside, lined with houses of all shapes and sizes. Houses with not much more than a small door in a wall to larger multi-level homes hanging precariously on the hillside with views to die for. The quintessential image of the Greek Islands. \nThe image is completed by three historic windmills on the ridge to the side of Chora. Beautifully restored, two of the windmills date back to 1588 and the third to 1863. \nPatmos has an abundance of beautiful fish tavernas, beautiful restaurants and some very elegant boutiques. So while, at its core, Patmos is a spiritual island, one of reflection and pilgrimage, it is also a refined island where there is a subtlety in the finer things in life. \nGreek Island Hopping Tip: Patmos would be paired well with a holiday to Leros due to its proximity. A day trip to Patmos is also possible from Leros Island. Getting to Patmos Island \nThere is no airport on Patmos. \nThere are ferries to Patmos from the port of Piraeus in Athens a few times a week depending on the season. Expect 7-10 hours depending on the boat. \nInter-island fast ferries run regularly connecting with islands with airports such as Rhodes, Kos or nearby Leros. Ferry timetables will vary according to the season. \nPatmos Hotels: As mentioned, Patmos is a small island so you won\u2019t find big resorts on the island. What you will find is charming boutique and luxury hotels and villas like Erini Luxury Villas or the Patmos Aktis Suites & Spa. And while Patmos may be a little more exclusive than some of the other islands it\u2019s not all high end accommodation. The family-run Asteri Hotel and Blue Bay Hotel , a favourite with island hoppers both offer value for money options on this slightly more expensive island. \nCheck more accommodation rates for Patmos Island here . \nObviously, this is not the be all and end all of what the Dodecanese Islands have to offer.
