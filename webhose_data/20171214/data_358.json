[Richard D. Ryder]\r\nDefinition IV: Speciesism: prejudice or attitude of bias in favor of the interests of members of one's own species and agsint those of members of other specfies. [Richard D. Ryder, Peter Singer]\r\nObservation II: The word 'animal' in the resolution refers to non human animals, because although the taxonomy of homo sapiens certainly makes us animals, the phrase \u201canimal rights\u201d is a distinct phrase from \u201chuman rights\u201d, and thus when discussing rights a distinction is made.\r\nObservation III: The word 'rights' in the resolution refers to negative rights. This is largely the basis for the distinction between human and animal rights.\r\nObservation IV: Humans and animals share the same negative rights. \r\n Value: Justice\r\nCriterion: Minimization of animal suffering\r\nContention one: Animals are morally equal to humans, and therefore entitled to the same rights\r\na. The only basis for rights is the ability to feel pain\r\nThe United Nations Declaration of Human Rights sets out a list of rights all people are entitled to. They are as follows:\r\nEveryone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person\r\nNo one shall be held in slavery or servitude\r\nNo one shall be subject to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\r\nWho should have these rights? The declaration makes it clear that these basic rights apply to everyone, regardless of capacity for reason. To make a slave of someone who is intellectually handicapped is no more justifiable than to make a slave of anyone else. Much in the same way, this protection applies to animals: if the differences between humans and animals are not justification to deny animals rights, then rights must come from the largest commonality between us and animals: painism. Animals can still experience pain like we do, according to ethicist Peter Singer, who says \u201cIf it is justifiable to assume that other human beings feel pain as we do, is there any reason why a similar inference should not be justifiable in the case of other animals? \r\nNearly all the external signs that lead us to infer pain in other humans can be seen in other species...The behavioral signs include writhing, facial contortions, moaning, yelping or other forms of calling, attempts to avoid the source of the pain, appearance of fear at the prospect of its repetition, and so on.\u201d \r\nAnimals can experience physical suffering much in the same manner as we do, and hence, are entitled to the same negative rights as we are. \r\nb.

centuries and there are so many things you can learn about this great tasting drink. Getting the facts right is only half the fun and learning about how to serve, taste or enjoy wine can make your night complete. The following article will focus on some great tips that will help you enjoy your next bottle of wine!\nGo to as many wine tastings as you can. These events can help you get out of your wine comfort zones. It is a great social gathering. Invite friends and family to enjoy the wine with you. If http://www.foodandwine.com/how/how-order-restaurant-wine-list-pro have a large group, consider splitting the cost of a limousine.\nPinot Grigio is a natural partner to a seafood meal. The flavors complement each other well. Other white wines go equally well with seafood. It makes for a tasty combination when you pair white wine with seafood.\nAttend wine tastings! Wine tastings are events that allow you to try out different types of wines for a lower cost. You can even make it a social event. Invite others that also enjoy wine to come with you. You\u2019ll have a great time while building your relationship.\nThe longer you keep the white wine in the fridge, the more the coldness will affect both its smell and taste. Therefore, it is best to only chill wine for several hours prior to serving. This will maximize the taste and enjoyment that you will receive from each bottle you drink.\nSwirling is part of tasting wine. Make the circular motion necessary from your elbow rather than your wrist. Doing so will enable you to smell the wine, enhancing the flavor of it as well. Making the motion just using the wrist is difficult and often will not have the desired effect.\nWhite wines do not always need to be chilled before serving. They are not the same and have different serving requirements. As an example, Pinot Gris is best served closer to room temperature.\nSwirling is part of tasting wine. Make the circular motion necessary from your elbow rather than your wrist. Doing so will enable you to smell the wine, enhancing the flavor of it as well. Making the motion just using the wrist is difficult and often will not have the desired effect.\nIt can really pay off to have a wide selection of wines on hand at home. Just having a white selection won\u2019t help you when you eat beef. Be a good host and have a variety of wines available, including red, white, sweet and sparkling.\nSo many tastes are available in wine, so have fun with them. When analyzing wines, you\u2019ll be breaking them down by their construction, pairings, and flavors. Instead, just enjoy yourself and choose things that you like.\nTake a look at how your wine is stored in the store. In a wine store, wine will be stored in the exact lighting and temperature required to keep that wine tasting its best. When you get home, try to mimic those conditions to the best of your ability until you drink the wine.\n\nPlan on visiting a nearby winery if you enjoy fine wine. Work out a budget that you will keep to on your visit, and plant to bring a designated driver along. Think about any questions you have and know how to explain your tastes in wine.\nMaking sure a Spanish wine is kept fresh is easily done, but there are different methods depending on its type. Rioja lasts up to seven years after bottling, and it is popular here. Storing Visit Homepage in a place that is dark and cool, such as a basement or closet, can really help to ensure you get the maximum flavor from your wine.\nWhen you first get a glass of wine, look at its color. This will tell you all about what the wine will taste like. Aged white wine gets darker and stronger. Aged red wine actually fades in color. How the wine has been aged and which grapes were used will also affect the color.\nWhite and red wines should be served at two totally different temperatures. Reds should be served at a temperature that is 10-15 degrees warmer than white wines. One way to chill wine that\u2019s white is to put it in the fridge first and after that just let it sit for a couple of minutes. Try to get your reds to 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and get your whites to 45.\nAre you pleased with your new-found knowledge? You don\u2019t have to sip wine to enjoy it. There\u2019s much more than that. Use the tips from this piece to see what benefits you can receive from wine.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rioja", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:15.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a2474e6ef4d381a5389215c868c9fbca2d3ad4cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.3n_squU4ovxSB5cUmlhNM923aY4RRQ45GCuPJFTF.G2LgyuueJbBmEG1IwYrfsndIWSSBDpYCf0DoBoLhVFqLpIe4CPOYKKeftSp0upYQTaqtaPP5GZ.99dwl61W0UvLXCSIpFLfGkA--", "site_full": "www.aish.com", "site": "aish.com", "site_section": "http://www.aish.com/", "site_categories": ["religion", "judaism"], "section_title": "The Jewish Website - aish.com", "title": "Conduct Unbecoming: Society Is No Longer Willing to Tolerate Sexual Harassment", "title_full": "Conduct Unbecoming: Society Is No Longer Willing to Tolerate Sexual Harassment", "published": "2017-12-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 30, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://media.aish.com/images/Conduct+Unbecoming1024x512.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 37052, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e6faaf66a2309f7d8de220542147a6bfcc9cae21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.3n_squU4ovxSB5cUmlhNM923aY4RRQ45GCuPJFTF.G2LgyuueJbBmEG1IwYrfsndIWSSBDpYCf0DoBoLhVFqLpIe4CPOYKKeftSp0upYQTaqtaPP5GZ.99dwl61W0UvJ0tXMElMwR6.x2EzQhJTzE", "ord_in_thread": 30, "author": "Annie", "published": "2017-12-07T13:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\"The nail that sticks out gets hammered down.\" -- this and variants of this are found from one end of the world to the other.\nIs this also true in Israel?

Voiced with perfect innocence by Ben Whishaw and gorgeously animated by Framestore, this profoundly likeable bear consistently toes the line of maximum charm without slipping into schmaltz. Miraculously, that\u2019s also as true of this sequel as it was of his first big-screen outing, as the film goes bigger and darker without losing focus on the small acts of kindness that make its ursine hero great. \nAs we rejoin Paddington and his adoptive family, the Browns, our hero is searching for the perfect present for his Aunt Lucy\u2019s (voiced by Imelda Staunton) 100th birthday. He finds just the ticket in Mr Gruber\u2019s (Jim Broadbent) antique shop: a unique pop-up book. But while Paddington is saving up for it, a nefarious rival steals the book and frames Paddington for the crime. It\u2019s no great spoiler to reveal that the baddie is Hugh Grant\u2019s faded actor Phoenix Buchanan, a flamboyant weirdo who\u2019s calibrated his levels of high camp to within reach of the summit of Everest. \nThe plot has a whodunnit-and-how-do-we-prove-it element here that is a little more complex than last time, but crucially director Paul King and his co-writer Simon Farnaby once again show a perfect feel for Paddington\u2019s humour, strengths and effect on the world. The bear\u2019s guileless politeness even enables him to win over Brendan Gleeson\u2019s Knuckles McGinty, the terrifying bully who rules Portobello Prison with an iron ladle. The hardman then helps our hero enact a Wes Anderson-esque prison break that even Andy Dufresne would admire. \nEqually intoxicating is the setting, a sort of fairytale London where everything and everyone is a little more eccentric, colourful and friendly than reality. This city shines with a marmalade sheen, the sort of cooperative, whimsical Britain that \u2018The Great British Bake Off\u2019 and \u2018Strictly Come Dancing\u2019 would have us believe we already live in.

Millions will die in a historic famine and public health crisis if President Trump's call is not heeded,\" Scott Paul said in a statement. He also noted \"the fact that US support has helped create Yemen's horrific crisis\" and called on Washington to cease military assistance to the aggressors. Riyadh imposed a tight blockade on nearly all Yemeni air, land and sea ports on November 6, prompting human rights and charity groups to raise the alarm over the deteriorating situation in the country as people, particularly children, are increasingly suffering from the lack of food and medical supplies. More than 12,000 people have been killed since the onset of Saudi Arabia's deadly campaign against Yemen in March 2015.

\n\"What makes the whole situation even worse is that this drop in price is out of line with our European neighbours and has, once again, left the UK market out of sync with the rest of Europe. \n\"The size of the UK retail market, and the percentage of milk that continues to be sold daily as fresh, should provide stability to prices, but it just hasn\u2019t happened. Are we again seeing processors chasing retail contracts on price to the detriment of their dairy farmers? \n\"Dairy farmers need answers and Muller needs to explain their action when we meet next week. \n\"It is impossible for the milk market to function properly while price transparency between farmers, processors and retailers does not exist. It is imperative that all sections of the industry are open and honest with each other for us to move on from the hard times of a few years ago. \n\"The reality is that, when commodity prices surged, farmgate prices were slow to respond and now that markets have softened, Muller has chosen to drop prices like a stone. That has huge impact on confidence at a time when bank accounts have still to recover from the milk price crash in 2015 and 2016. \n\"At AgriScot, dairy expert Chris Walkland stated that analysis of all UK milk price indices showed that the average Scottish dairy farmer had missed out on between \u00a340,000 and \u00a345,000 of income based on what they could have reasonably expected to have received as a milk price in 2017 and what their milk buyers have actually delivered. \n\"We have written today to Grocery Code Adjudicator Christine Tacon and Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Michael Gove asking them to do what is necessary to bring some badly needed price transparency to this market. \n\"As an example of the lack of transparency, it is now common knowledge that in aligned supermarket milk contracts there is a cream price tracker and rebate system - yet the industry knows little about how that operates. However, it is hugely important in setting the milk price, as cream income to a liquid processor is currently worth 12.75p per litre - the 5th highest on record\u2013 when three years ago it was worth 5.5p. \n\"That is value in the chain that should be getting shared with producers and isn\u2019t.\" Further Reading \nGo to our previous news item on this story by clicking here . \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris walkland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gary mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael gove", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine tacon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "meet muller on milk price shocker union to meet muller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfu scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rural affairs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfu england & wales", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:17.057+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f88ec5b484dfea0a43e039137e467c05fd9f821", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_8xjDrUVH9kfJzJUMBflkwCb9rkFBkGhnkJDZaFA5EU1eM..vhh3gwVq9273x5QZO7g560H5NSCgZyCx6anRzmh9BevDlo1C2JsoPcNCKl8Kgprrj3PPZyLOzh_Jp1ynP2TxGMp1lKMFqfLMI6GuUq", "site_full": "www.wxii12.com", "site": "wxii12.com", "site_section": "http://www.wxii12.com/10626942?format=rss_2.0&view=feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Stories", "title": "Teen arrested after disturbing viral video showed him hurling cat into street", "title_full": "Teen arrested after disturbing viral video showed him hurling cat into street", "published": "2017-12-07T11:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IT", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://hips.htvapps.com/vidthumb/b082f12f-d7fe-413b-a853-f0b930e5dd8d/b082f12f-d7fe-413b-a853-f0b930e5dd8d_image.png?crop=1xw:1.0xh;center,top&amp;resize=1200:*", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71682, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f88ec5b484dfea0a43e039137e467c05fd9f821", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_8xjDrUVH9kfJzJUMBflkwCb9rkFBkGhnkJDZaFA5EU1eM..vhh3gwVq9273x5QZO7g560H5NSCgZyCx6anRzmh9BevDlo1C2JsoPcNCKl8Kgprrj3PPZyLOzh_Jp1ynP2TxGMp1lKMFqfLMI6GuUq", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "Teen arrested after disturbing viral video showed him hurling cat into street", "text": "  Teen arrested after disturbing viral video showed him hurling cat into street   \nWarning: The video above may be upsetting to some viewers Advertisement \nAuthorities in Southern California have arrested a 16-year-old boy who was captured on a Snapchat video throwing a cat into the street. \nPolice in the city of Ontario said Monday that the boy ran off when he saw officers approaching him, was tackled and taken into custody.

(LUIS SINCO / Los Angeles Times) PD Editorial: Familiar fire scenes point out need for better alert systems THE EDITORIAL BOARD BY THE EDITORIAL BOARD | December 7, 2017, 12:11AM | Updated 11 hours ago. Wind-driven flames racing through canyons and down tree-lined ridges. Residents fleeing homes in the dark of smoke-filled nights. Firefighters racing toward mountains crowned with orange glow. The scenes this week in Ventura County and other communities around Los Angeles are all too familiar. The hearts of the North Bay go out to those in Southern California for all they are experiencing \u2014 and all they will experience in the days to come. The most chilling aspects of this devastation is that, like the fires that swept through Sonoma and Napa counties in October, these are largely suburban wildfires, something climate experts say are likely to be more common. As Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis at Pomona College, told the Associated Press, California\u2019s fire season is becoming a year-round event. The number of acres burned so far this year is already more than double the 244,297 acres that burned in 2016.\u201dThese fires are not just fast and furious, but they\u2019re really expensive to fight,\u201d Miller said. They are also becoming a round-the-clock risk. This points out once again the need for California as a whole \u2014 and Sonoma County in particular \u2014 to develop a more effective system for alerting residents, especially when fire is approaching in the dead of night. Thankfully, residents in Ventura were warned about the fast-approaching flames through an emergency notification system that helped evacuate at-risk neighborhoods. According to Ventura County officials, a blast of Amber alert-type messages went out to all residents with AT&T or Verizon landlines and to all cellphones in the evacuation areas. This is in sharp contrast to what occurred in Sonoma County where alerts only went out to some landline phones that still had power and to the cellphones of those relatively few residents who had signed up in advance to receive Nixle or SoCo Alerts. Local emergency officials had opted against using the more extensive alert system out of concern that such a broad message would have created widespread confusion and congestion as tens of thousands of residents fled their homes, potentially interfering with the ability of first responders to fight the fires. But as a result, many residents only found out about the fires because of friends, family and neighbors who pounded on their doors in the dead of night or called them directly. Sonoma County can do better. So can the state as a whole. State Sen. Mike McGuire, D-Healdsburg, was right when he noted on Monday during a legislative hearing on the North Coast fires that lives may have been saved had Sonoma County taken the same action as Ventura County. He\u2019s also correct that the California needs a broader system for just such crisis situations. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for this state to seriously explore a statewide standard for emergency alerts,\u201d McGuire said during the oversight hearing of the state\u2019s alert systems. According to the Sacramento Bee, McGuire said he and other lawmakers plan to introduce legislation calling for a statewide notification system that would send emergency messages to all cellphones and landlines in at-risk areas. Such a system makes sense. But given the uncertainties of how many residents may be without power or may have their phones turned off at night, no phone-based alert system is foolproof.

It will improve efforts in the Appalachian mountain region and streamline drug trafficking investigations under a single special agent in charge, acting DEA Administrator Robert Patterson said during a news conference Wednesday with Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \nD. Christopher Evans, an associate agent in charge in the DEA's Detroit field office, will lead the new Louisville office. \nSessions said it's the first restructuring of DEA field offices since 1998, when the agency created an El Paso, Texas, field office.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"Today we are facing the worst drug crisis in American history, with one American dying of a drug overdose every nine minutes,\" Sessions said during the news conference in Washington. The Department of Justice also announced $12 million in grants for state and local law enforcement to combat heroin and methamphetamine dealers. \nDesignating Louisville as a field office and installing a special agent in charge will better align DEA with the U.S. attorney offices in the three states, according to a release. \nThe Appalachian region has been ground zero for the opioid problem in recent years. Overdose deaths were 65 percent higher among people in Appalachia than in the rest of the country in 2015, a recent Appalachian Regional Commission study found. The study, \"Appalachian Diseases of Despair,\" reported that nearly 70 percent of the overdose deaths in the Appalachian region in 2015 were caused by opioids. West Virginia had the highest opioid overdose mortality rates with 52.8 deaths per 100,000 people. \nThe new Louisville office will have a total of 150 positions with 90 special agents in the three states. The restructuring involved moving the three states out of other DEA divisions to place them under the Louisville office. The Louisville office will begin operations on Jan. 1.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert patterson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d. christopher evans", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dea", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dylan lovan associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "appalachian regional commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. drug enforcement agency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "louisville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "detroit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el paso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "appalachia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "appalachian", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:18.033+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "744fb97296372052aca5867d116fcab14d11b510", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.twjHCbZ7mPRABBPXtnDeUS.wBjAI7abKuyDmaG_Th3wvL4nFN8KnOni4O9WnyBYTez7LgxAdA5daJlxgcCzmLBIp193hfXsRt3vaieb.wWKxaz_vnY.jt", "site_full": "www.thecattlesite.com", "site": "thecattlesite.com", "site_section": "http://thecattlesite.com//rss/news.php", "site_categories": ["agriculture", "business"], "section_title": "TheCattleSite - Global  Industry News Feeds", "title": "CME: Feeder Cattle Demand from Feedlots in H2/2017", "title_full": "CME: Feeder Cattle Demand from Feedlots in H2/2017", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.thecattlesite.com/images/cattlesiteFacebook.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "744fb97296372052aca5867d116fcab14d11b510", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.twjHCbZ7mPRABBPXtnDeUS.wBjAI7abKuyDmaG_Th3wvL4nFN8KnOni4O9WnyBYTez7LgxAdA5daJlxgcCzmLBIp193hfXsRt3vaieb.wWKxaz_vnY.jt", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "CME: Feeder Cattle Demand from Feedlots in H2/2017", "text": "CME: Feeder Cattle Demand from Feedlots in H2/2017 07 December 2017 \nUS - The demand for feeder cattle from feedlots in the second half of this year has been one of the surprises of the cattle market in 2017, reports Steiner Consulting Group, DLR Division, Inc. \nThis demand is reflected in the size and trend of the price premium between heavier feeder cattle and slaughter cattle prices. The behavior of this premium followed a typical seasonal pattern through late July. \nA combination of favorable corn crop development weather in July and strong Live Cattle futures prices for 2018 delivery contracts that began during the summer have provided the foundation for excellent feeder cattle demand. \nThe peak in the premium of feeder cattle prices relative to slaughter cattle values for the year occurred in early October. Cattle producers placated feedlot operators willingness to pay higher prices by selling more cattle to feedlots. \nYear-to-date placements of cattle into feedlots are up 9 per cent from 2016 through October. Placements in October were up 10 per cent from the prior October. \nIn recent months, weekly data on receipts of feeder cattle moving through marketing channels by USDA-AMS (Agricultural Marketing Service) has tracked consistently with trends seen in monthly feedlot placements reported by USDA-NASS (National Agricultural Statistics Service). \nWeekly feeder cattle receipts in October were up 9.9 per cent from the prior October. The graph above shows the pattern of receipts during the last three months with a peak that lagged the high point of the ratio between feeder cattle and slaughter cattle prices by 3-4 weeks. \nSimilarly, receipts fell below year earlier volumes in mid-November, again consistent with the relationship between feeder and slaughter cattle prices 3-4 weeks prior. The last three weeks have seen receipts below prior year volume in each week, only the third time this has happened in 2017. \nThe other times that occurred was in August and May. Total feeder cattle market receipts for the four weeks in November (the last week ending on 2 December) were down 0.8 per cent after starting out the month significantly higher than a year ago. \nThe bulk of the decline in feeder cattle marketings in November is accounted for by fewer cattle weighing over 600 pounds. November receipts of these heavier weight cattle were down 9.7 per cent from last year. \nCalves born in 2016 are the dominant source of supply for these feeder cattle marketings and the 2016 calf crop was only up 3 per cent from the prior year. The larger marketings in prior months of 2017 was probably at the expense of feeder cattle marketings in November.

Trust in juries EDITOR: People occasionally ask me for my prediction of the outcome of an ongoing criminal case. I invariably reply that, not having heard the evidence and arguments of counsel, I am unable to venture an opinion. But others seem to have no hesitation in doing so. The death of Kate Steinle was a great tragedy, and my heart goes out to the Steinle family, and to others who knew her, for their immeasurable loss. But an assessment of blame, and the ensuing imposition of punishment, require going beyond our emotional reaction to the tragedy. Not all homicides are punishable as murder or manslaughter. Neither Dennis Tobin (\u201cGross injustice,\u201d Letters, Saturday) nor Donald Trump et al had the benefit of hearing the evidence, the arguments of opposing counsel and the judge\u2019s instructions on the nuances of the applicable law. For any of them to imply they have greater knowledge and insight than the members of the jury, who did have that benefit, is the height of arrogance. Juries are not perfect. They make mistakes sometimes. But I would rather entrust my life and liberty to a jury of my peers than to an ill-informed man on the street or to an ignorant megalomaniac. MANNY NESTLE Santa Rosa \nClearing encampments EDITOR: Under cold and rainy skies, some 85 homeless people were evicted on Nov. 14 from camps in downtown Santa Rosa under threat of arrest (\u201cEncampments cleared,\u201d Nov. 18). A Catholic Charities team offered shelter space to evictees. Activists from Homeless Action and the Community Action Coalition were also there to monitor police activity and offer assistance to residents. Dozens of granola bars, sandwiches, fruit and water were provided, and wet blankets and clothing were laundered and dried. Twenty-one individuals relocated to the shelter, while some 40-50 people declined, citing the lack of privacy and safety. Hotel vouchers were not offered. Some 11th hour handiwork by Dr. Carolyn Epple, a co-founder of Camp Michaela, resulted in county space in Roseland adjacent to that camp becoming available to evictees, and a new tent village sprang to life. Volunteered flatbed and U-Haul trucks provided transportation of people and belongings. Yet Kelli Kuykendall, the city\u2019s Housing and Community Development manager, said that activists were \u201cdisruptive and interfering with the outreach efforts.\u201d Santa Rosa City Manager Sean McGlynn subsequently claimed that outreach efforts had been \u201cchallenged\u201d by activists. But neither was ever on the scene. Activists and homeless individuals weren\u2019t interviewed for the article. Were activists obstructors or protectors? You can decide for yourself. KATHLEEN FINIGAN Santa Rosa \nHeartless in San Francisco EDITOR: I attended the Tony Bennett show at the Luther Burbank Center for the Arts on Tuesday and was thoroughly disappointed \u2014 too much time wasted in repeatedly introducing his band members, not one Christmas song, overly priced tickets (for what we got) and, for conclusion, he didn\u2019t even sing his signature song, \u201cI Left my Heart in San Francisco,\u201d while performing here in the Bay Area. It may be time for him to put the microphone down and just continue his passion for painting.

GRAVES AP Sports Writer   2 MINUTES AGO LEXINGTON, Ky. \nJust as No. 7 Kentucky seemed headed toward blowing out another opponent, the Wildcats suddenly lost the focus and accuracy that had Harvard on the brink. \nThe pesky Crimson took advantage down the stretch to get within single digits, only lacking enough time to make things even tenser against a team still learning that a 20-point lead should be a starting point toward finishing off games. \n\"We have to be able to put our foot on their throats and get good plays and good shots and not try to turn into a selfish team,\" freshman forward Kevin Knox said after scoring 20 points in Kentucky's 79-70 victory Saturday over the Crimson. \"I think that's what we do when we start to get up, people start trying to get their own. Next thing, they're (only) down eight.\" \nOfficially, Harvard's deficit was nine after Seth Towns' 3-pointer with 22 seconds left capped an 18-7 closing run after trailing 72-52 midway through the second half. Kentucky (7-1) ran out the clock, which seemed logical considering it missed seven of its final eight shots and went without a field goal for the final 2:31.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"Give Harvard credit,\" Kentucky coach John Calipari said. \"They shot the ball. (Coach Tommy) Amaker did a great job of putting his people in positions. It was another good game for us to play where a team's not just going to give us a win. This team needs that.\" \nBefore that, the Wildcats appeared to show hints of following up Sunday's 107-73 pummeling of Illinois-Chicago with another big game. \nHamidou Diallo added 19 points as Kentucky used a 13-0 run over 2:42 for a lead that seemed safe during a game when things were mostly clicking on both ends. The Wildcats returned from a break to shoot well for most of the game and lead the Ivy League Crimson throughout. \nIt wasn't easy, and the Wildcats needed that initial accuracy to counter Harvard's 12 3-pointers \u2014 including six by sophomore forward Towns (25 points) \u2014 that kept the Crimson within reach. \n\"They found me for a lot of open shots,\" said Towns, who was 8 of 14 from the field and missed just once from long range. Harvard shot 37 percent but was 12 of 28 from behind the arc. \n\"Tonight I was just able to get them in. A lot of them came from assists, and when we do that and move the ball really well is when we play our best. That showed a lot today, but I give credits to my teammates for finding me.\" \n\"I was pleased with how Seth came off the bench for us and gave us a shot in the arm,\" Amaker said. \nKentucky made three of four free throws in the final minutes to win the first meeting between the schools and earn its fifth straight victory. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 12 points for the Wildcats, who shot 46 percent but were just 2 of 14 from long range. \nBIG PICTURE \nHarvard: Just as critical as making all those 3s was a bench that outscored Kentucky 44-26. The Crimson faced a huge hurdle keeping up with the Wildcats' length and speed, factors that made the difference in allowing Kentucky to hold on. Danilo Djuricic had 10 points. \n\"I thought we were putting things together for a while to kind of keep it interesting and I thought our kids competed,\" Amaker said, \"but their length and size on the backboard and not having some of our better players inside and out with Chris Lewis and Bryce Aiken not having really good offensive games certainly hurt us.\" \nKentucky: The Wildcats had a tough task following a 34-point win over Illinois-Chicago but seemed capable of handling it in never trailing. But they struggled defending the Crimson from the outside, allowing a big lead to be cut down in the final minutes. The Wildcats owned the paint 42-20 and outscored Harvard 24-3 off 15 turnovers but barely won the rebounding battle 37-36. \nRIGHT ON CUE \nFire alarms went off briefly inside Rupp Arena early in the second half, but spectators didn't miss a beat. As the alarm buzzed in three-beat increments, a chant of \"Go! Big! Blue!\" began and within a moment it was over. \nSEEN \nActress Ashley Judd, a big Kentucky fan, was among 22,922. \nUP NEXT \nHarvard hosts Fordham on Wednesday. \nKentucky enters final exams before

Waco Tribune Herald via AP Rod Aydelotte Baylor guard Alexis Morris reacts to a 3-point shot against Kentucky during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game, Thursday, Nov. 30, 2017, in Waco, Texas. Waco Tribune Herald via AP Rod Aydelotte No. 9 Baylor wins 90-63 over No. 20 Kentucky with 0-fer 3rd The Associated Press   2 MINUTES AGO WACO, Texas \nWith the size and skill No. 9 Baylor has in the post, anything it gets from the outside is a bonus. \nWhen its guards are making nearly everything they put up from the outside, there isn't much opponents can do. \nKristy Wallace scored 15 of her 20 points in the first half and the Lady Bears held No. 20 Kentucky without a field goal in the third quarter on way to a 90-63 victory Thursday night in the Big 12/SEC Challenge. \nThe Lady Bears outscored the Wildcats 23-6 in that decisive quarter, with Kentucky (6-1) missing all 13 of its shots from the floor while losing for the first time.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"We haven't played quarters for but a few years, but that's pretty impressive to defend a whole quarter and hold them to zero field goals,\" Baylor coach Kim Mulkey said. \"That's impressive. We'll watch film, and those kids that were on the floor and contributed to that will be acknowledged.\" \nWallace led six players in double figures for Lady Bears (6-1), who shot 54 percent (35 for 65) from the floor and 53 percent (9 for 17) on 3-pointers. The senior guard had plenty of help in the backcourt, with Alexis Morris scoring 15 points and Juicy Landrum 14. Landrum made all four of her 3-point tries. \nMaci Morris had a game-high 22 points for Kentucky, which had four players in double figures and made 11 of 19 3-pointers (58 percent). But the Wildcats shot only 32 percent overall after making only 8 for 40 inside the arc. \n\"The snowball just got too big rolling down the hill. We couldn't stop it,\" Kentucky coach Matt Mitchell said. \"We're going to have a very good team. We weren't ready to beat Baylor tonight. But my spirits are buoyed because of the way the players show up every day and work and what they're capable of doing.\" \nBaylor was up only 25-21 in the second quarter when Maci Morris was called for a flagrant foul on Wallace's drive to the basket. Wallace made the two free throws, Alexis Morris added a layup to make it a four-point trip and start a 12-2 run. \n\"I thought when the girl went to swat (Wallace's shot), she gave one of those windmill swats and hit Kristy in the head,\" Mulkey said. \"I don't think she intentionally meant to do that, but when you have the intention or not, if you come across the head that hard, it can be upgraded. He did go, I'll give him credit for that.\" \nKentucky was back within seven before Landrum made two 3s and Wallace added one from long range in a 67-second span just before halftime for a 50-34 lead. \nJaida Roper added 12 points for Kentucky, while Taylor Murray and Makenzie Cann had 10 each. \n\"I think as the score started to separate, we - like a lot of teams do - panicked trying to get it all back quickly,\" Mitchell said. \"But, that's all the things you learn from that. We just defensively aren't sophisticated enough to try to take something away.\" \nBIG PICTURE \nKentucky: This was the Wildcats' first Top 25 test of the season, and they showed how far they have to go. The lane was closed off nearly the entire night by Baylor's height inside, so the offense all but dried up at times when they were missing shots and unable to get to the foul line. \nBaylor: With the way the Lady Bears shot from the outside, that meant Kentucky couldn't gang up on them inside. Baylor took advantage with a 46-12 advantage in the paint, with Kalani Brown, Lauren Cox and Dekeiya Cohen all scoring in double figures. Brown and Cox both had 13 points, while Cohen had 10 points with nine rebounds. \nPOLL IMPLICATION \nKentucky: Usually losing on the road against a top-10 team doesn't cause much of a fall, but the margin of the defeat is glaring. The Wildcats have plenty of meat on the nonconferce schedule, including home games against No. 4 Louisville, No. 24 California and No. 12 Tennessee. \nBaylor: A win Sunday against No. 16 Stanford would all but guarantee a move up, especially after No. 8 Ohio State's loss to No. 14 Duke on Thursday night. \nUP NEXT \nKentucky will return home for a two-game stretch, beginning with Tennessee Tech on Sunday. \nBaylor will play its second straight ranked opponent Sunday when it hosts No. 16 Stanford.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexis morris", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cohen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "makenzie cann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "landrum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kalani brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lauren cox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim mulkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaida roper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juicy landrum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mulkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dekeiya cohen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristy wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taylor murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maci morris", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "3rd mobile & apps baylor", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "baylor", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ncaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waco tribune herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap rod aydelotte baylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap rod aydelotte no.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wildcats", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee tech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cox", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:20.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "462b256c5b8c33b18420304b196c615ebe1469b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qqruij56f9C67UATMLMaZD8gl8N0BuxJSU6favXhheynuEhPLVA4YkYwzSncGkgdge5Jj0p0ySsd.bOLZOOQQqF61MwNmiVE-", "site_full": "www.pressdemocrat.com", "site": "pressdemocrat.com", "site_section": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/rss-opinion", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Press Democrat Opinion RSS Feed", "title": "Hunt: Whoever wins in Alabama, Republicans will lose", "title_full": "Hunt: Whoever wins in Alabama, Republicans will lose", "published": "2017-12-07T09:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=CjSY8Evccttb$VVIz3fSIM$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYuTKlIH3nYnIWu3RWhSeISkWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 17376, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "462b256c5b8c33b18420304b196c615ebe1469b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qqruij56f9C67UATMLMaZD8gl8N0BuxJSU6favXhheynuEhPLVA4YkYwzSncGkgdge5Jj0p0ySsd.bOLZOOQQqF61MwNmiVE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Albert Hunt", "published": "2017-12-07T09:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hunt: Whoever wins in Alabama, Republicans will lose", "text": "(1 of ) CHAN LOWE / Tribune Content Agency Hunt: Whoever wins in Alabama, Republicans will lose BYALBERT HUNT ALBERT HUNT IS A COLUMNIST FOR BLOOMBERG VIEW. | December 7, 2017, 12:05AM | Updated 11 hours ago. Dilemma? Catch-22? Hobson\u2019s choice? They\u2019re all good ways to say why Republicans are so anguished over next week\u2019s special Senate election in Alabama. Is it better for their candidate, Roy Moore, who has been credibly accused of sexually abusing underage girls, to win and keep the party\u2019s slim Senate majority? Or would he be such an albatross, causing bitter intra-party schisms, that it\u2019s actually better for Republicans if Democrat Doug Jones wins? \u201cWe don\u2019t need a liberal person in there, a Democrat,\u201d President Donald Trump said in embracing Moore. Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, offers the other view: If Moore wins, \u201cthe Senate should vote to expel him because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate.\u201d Related Stories Trump offers full support for Roy Moore Moore is running ahead in the contest, according to most recent polls. The seat now is held by Luther Strange, who was defeated by Moore in a September primary after being appointed when Jeff Sessions stepped down to become attorney general. The winner of the Dec. 12 election is slated to take Strange\u2019s place immediately. A few Republicans have come out against seating Moore, demanding a new election. That might present legal challenges. The political problems would be worse. Count on Trump to demand that Moore be seated because Republicans need the vote in a Senate where they now hold only a two-vote majority. He\u2019ll certainly gin up his base and the religious right, the core of Moore\u2019s support despite the charges of depravity. They would rise up in fury against the anti-Moore Republicans. It would be ugly, exacerbating tensions between Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. An alternative if Moore wins is to send the issue to the Senate Ethics Committee. It\u2019s already looking into the sexually inappropriate behavior of Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, who has apologized after four women accused him of unwanted kissing and touching. Moore, 70, is an ultra-right former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court who twice was kicked off the bench for disobeying the law. He denies all the charges against him, claiming they were ginned up by lesbians, socialists and other leftist anti-Trump factions. But eight women have come forth to describe similar conduct by Moore decades ago, and their accounts have been supported by reporting in the Washington Post and Alabama outlets. One woman said she was sexually assaulted by Moore when she was 14. For moral and political reasons, some Republicans conclude that it would be better if the Jones, a moderate former prosecutor, wins. That would be a nightmare for McConnell. It would reduce his Senate margin. Moreover, it threatens the Republican majority after next year\u2019s elections, which once seemed secure. But with the unpopularity of Trump, these dynamics have changed. Whatever the outcome, there will be no joy among Republicans on Tuesday. Albert Hunt is a columnist for Bloomberg View.

FILE - In a Wednesday, Aug. 5, 2015 file photo, a statue of Jefferson Davis, left, overlooks the statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Rotunda of the Kentucky State Capitol in Frankfort Ky. A plaque attached to the 15-foot-tall 4.5 meters) marble statue of Davis, declaring Jefferson Davis to be a hero and a patriot will not be removed until a lawyer with Gov. Matt Bevin\u2019s administration can determine whether the commission that voted to get rid of the marker has the authority to do it. Removal of Jefferson Davis plaque in Kentucky delayed By ADAM BEAM Associated Press   1 MINUTE AGO FRANKFORT, Ky. \nA plaque in the Kentucky Capitol declaring the only president of the Confederacy to be a hero and a patriot will stay until a lawyer with Republican Gov. Matt Bevin's administration can determine if the decision to remove it was legal. \nThe plaque is attached to a 15-foot (4.5 meters) marble statue of Jefferson Davis, who was born in Kentucky and was president of the Confederacy during the Civil War. \nEfforts to remove the statue have been ongoing for years, but they gained momentum following the 2015 racially motivated killings of nine people at an African-American church in South Carolina. \nThe state commission that governs the statue voted to keep it in 2015. But earlier this year, following violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the commission voted to remove the plaque that says Davis was a \"hero, patriot, statesman.\"   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nAt the time, state officials said the plaque would be removed in a few days. But on Wednesday, Historic Properties Division Director Leslie Nigels said the legal department at the Finance and Administration Cabinet was doing research \"to make sure that we were absolutely within our rights to remove the plaque.\" \n\"There is a possibility that it may be something that the legislature will have to address,\" she said. \nShe said the plaque will stay at least until the commission's next scheduled meeting in February. \nState and local governments across the country have been removing Confederate monuments in recent years following the racially motivated violence in South Carolina and Virginia. In Kentucky, the statue of Davis in the Capitol rotunda has been a flashpoint given its prominent location. \nThe statue has been in place since 1936, paid for by $5,000 in public money authorized by the state legislature and private donations raised by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. \nKentucky did not secede from the Union during the Civil War. But it was filled with Confederate sympathizers who attempted to establish a Confederate government in the western part of the state. \nKentucky has wrestled with its history since the Civil War. In addition to Davis, the Capitol Rotunda includes a statue of Abraham Lincoln, who was also born in Kentucky. The Lincoln statue came first. \nThe original plan, according to the Kentucky Historical Society, was to have the Davis statue back-to-back with Lincoln, with Davis facing south and Lincoln facing north. But that plan was abandoned because the statues were too heavy to be that close together. \nThe Davis statue has been the source of political controversies. When he was running for governor in 2015, Matt Bevin was one of the first Republicans to call for the statue to be removed from the Capitol and placed in a museum. \nBut earlier this year, Bevin said removing the statue would set a \"dangerous precedent.\" Bevin has said decisions about the Davis statue should be left up to the commission because \"no one individual should be making these decisions.\" \nA spokeswoman for Bevin did not respond to a request for comment.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jefferson davis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "matt bevin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leslie nigels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bevin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lincoln", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abraham lincoln", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mobile & apps file", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "united daughters of the confederacy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "administration cabinet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky historical society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lincoln", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam beam associated press", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol rotunda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlottesville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankfort ky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankfort", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky state capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south carolina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:21.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "275b0c21064f92e00d8da4e3b802b705efa90785", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVApD4O0EWvHlX7YKjkqQqJTA5frvDJBMwNE0138l_NLIwrkgApNy_BJerHD3nqDxBPXtIw_2OSYa24msHNOqHXjMY0g7aAn0Hihx6neKyMW", "site_full": "www.expedia.es", "site": "expedia.es", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.es/Jerome-Hoteles.d119566.Guia-Viajes-Hoteles", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "110 Hoteles en Jerome, Sedona baratos con Expedia.es", "title": "Sedona Rouge Hotel And Spa (Sedona,", "title_full": "Sedona Rouge Hotel And Spa (Sedona, Estados Unidos) | Expedia.es", "published": "2017-10-26T08:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26131, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af742c6213878fb77f1681240710c2b5edd343e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVApD4O0EWvHlX7YKjkqQqJTA5frvDJBMwNE0138l_NLIwrkgApNy_BJerHD3nqDxBPXtIw_2OSYa24msHNOqHXjMY0g7aAn0LR5yHTrS71X_yTtzhEehhWC_TrfSwGBpY32sjOhN.fa", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-07T00:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "We had the master almeria suite and it was spacious and very very nice.

At the 2015 Paris Agreement, India has set ambitious targets, which constituted its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), where it vowed to reduce emission intensity by 33-35 per cent of its 2005 levels, and make 40 per cent of the population dependent on renewable energy by 2030. Considering that 300 million people in India lack access to electricity, and coal still remains the largest provider of electricity in India, significant strides will need to be taken by India to match its targets committed in the Paris Agreements. India has also vowed to add 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022, hence the next five years are crucial for addressing the extent to which India can reach its NDC targets, and reaffirm its commitment to the Paris Agreements, which was a major point of discussion at the COP 23 meeting held from November 6-17. The United Nations Climate Change Conference incorporated the 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP23), the 13th meeting of the parties for the Kyoto Protocol (CMP13), and the second meeting of the parties for the Paris Agreement (CMA2). Held at the UN Campus at Bonn, Germany, the conference was a gathering of international political leaders and activists to discuss and implement plans to combat climate change, especially the Paris Agreement. \u201cClimate change is an issue determining our destiny as mankind \u2013 it will determine the wellbeing of all of us,\u201d said German Chancellor, Angela Merkel (who as environment minister earlier, had chaired the first climate summit 23 years ago), to nations gathered at the climate summit. The UN Secretary General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, told the gathering in Bonn of his visit to the Caribbean s after the recent hurricanes. \u201cThe catastrophic damage of climate change is upon us and when the frontline is devastated, the whole army is lost,\u201d he said, railing against the $825 billion invested in fossil fuels in 2016. \u201cWe must stop making bets on an unsustainable future,\u201d he added.French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been among the biggest critics of Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull the US out of the Paris deal, got the loudest applause when he committed France and European partners to filling the funding gap for the UN\u2019s climate science panel, left by the US withdrawal. \u201cThey will not miss a single euro. The fight against climate change is, by far, the most significant struggle of our times.\u201d Regarding India\u2019s participation in the conference, Marina Walter, India Country Director at UNDP, said, \u201cIn India, Prime Minister Modi has already indicated that the country will go \u2018above and beyond\u2019 the Paris agreement, with a call to action: We must leave for our future generations a climate wherein they can breathe clean air and have a healthy life\u2019.\u201d Developing countries like India will suffer the most from the impact of climate change. However, the main concern for India is that limiting greenhouse gas emissions will interfere with its growth. The pre-2020 climate action was a major source of contention at the conference. Developing countries, such as China and India, were particularly irked that pre-2020 action did not have a formal space on the COP23 agenda. At first, although many developed countries dismissed these demands, in the end they conceded, and pre-2020 ambition and implementation formed a major part of the COP23 decision text.While stressing that it would take time to achieve the targets, India\u2019s Environment Minister, Harsh Vardhan, reaffirmed India\u2019s commitment to moving away from coal-based energy systems. \u201cSteps are being taken to de-couple the Indian energy system from carbon in the long run. However, poverty eradication remains an overriding priority for us as we strive to ensure housing, electricity and food security for all,\u201d he said in his address to heads of state and ministers, even though India did not sign the phasing-out of the coal agreement.\u201cIndia managed to advance pre-2020 climate actions despite strong resistance from the developed countries. However, indecisiveness on climate finance reporting at COP23 prevented any progress on enhanced transparency requirements. This could be a major deterrent at COP24 when the Paris Rulebook has to be finalised,\u201d says Vaibhav Gupta, Senior Programme Lead, CEEW. \u201cCOP23 saw India\u2019s effective negotiation to seek EU and other developed nations\u2019 partnerships to access technology, which will go a long way in helping meet the sustainable development goals,\u201d says Dipankar Ghosh, Partner and Leader for Sustainability and Climate Change at Thinkthrough Consulting.The US government\u2019s role at the conference, the big moments emerging in the realm of climate risk assurance (despite some ambiguity) and the deadlines looming in 2018, were the key takeaways from this summit.

And it seems that this is the problem - ExCE has its own version of Smithsonian which it puts under Scientific Theory or Natural History if working together wth EE. VP-EE removes Natural History from DB, thus you get Smithsonian from the start (ExCE version that grants Aqueduct, VP-EE grants Museum). Also, there are Adventurers doubled.\nI don't know how many people play ExCE, maybe I could make a VP-EE-ExCE patch?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:22.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "635e53b8cc12fd6730316fd50379056da927007e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9pO534B3n0k5hf47kXI3RgvtPNoDOoPSfVbShs8BA_sMCbhkBMzMC1kIfzGIIf8.ucNtrtZiaEIubLGTfDrsS5c0dkL8K15ovgU1rRVr9AQU_kxcGeFy3kZn9zLSAMCOfdyfKqd4YeTblAbDqsx_MPEnuX_XpVGAl8YTjjxnJMBRd9B5o0IfgoQN8WV9LD8lojWSui2_swSA--", "site_full": "www.bqlive.co.uk", "site": "bqlive.co.uk", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u2018Championing Great British design is key to our export success\u2019: Maxwell \u2013 Scott chief talks exporting - BQLive", "title_full": "\u2018Championing Great British design is key to our export success\u2019: Maxwell \u2013 Scott chief talks exporting - BQLive", "published": "2017-12-06T13:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.134, "main_image": "http://www.bqlive.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1512580047952.jpg--_championing_great_british_design_is_key_to_our_export_success___maxwell___scott_chief_talks_exporting.jpg?1512580049000", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "635e53b8cc12fd6730316fd50379056da927007e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9pO534B3n0k5hf47kXI3RgvtPNoDOoPSfVbShs8BA_sMCbhkBMzMC1kIfzGIIf8.ucNtrtZiaEIubLGTfDrsS5c0dkL8K15ovgU1rRVr9AQU_kxcGeFy3kZn9zLSAMCOfdyfKqd4YeTblAbDqsx_MPEnuX_XpVGAl8YTjjxnJMBRd9B5o0IfgoQN8WV9LD8lojWSui2_swSA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T13:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u2018Championing Great British design is key to our export success\u2019: Maxwell \u2013 Scott chief talks exporting - BQLive", "text": "William Forshaw, founder of Maxwell \u2013 Scott \u2018Championing Great British design is key to our export success\u2019: Maxwell \u2013 Scott chief talks exporting \nMaxwell \u2013 Scott founder William Forshaw explains how launching dedicated websites for its core markets has helped the company expand its overseas presence\u2026 \nThis 'Around the World in 80 Trades' interview coincides with the PD Ports Northern Powerhouse Export Awards in association with HSBC, which is being held on 22 February in Leeds. For information on the event, to nominate or buy tickets, click here. \n\nFounded in London back in 2002, Maxwell \u2013 Scott has established itself as a household name in the luxury bags sector over the past 15 years. \nIts founder, William Forshaw, who now runs the business from York, is a convert from the city who launched the business after quitting his high profiled job during his early 20\u2019s. \n\u201cAfter working in London, I noticed a severe lack of quality when observing businessmen\u2019s briefcases whilst on the tube and in the office,\u201d he told BQ. \n\u201cInspired by my mother\u2019s regular trips to Italy, I designed my very first Italian leather briefcase - the Paolo whilst working in the City. \n\u201cI then decided to leave my job in advertising and began selling the briefcases to businessmen on their lunch breaks in London. This is the moment Maxwell - Scott was born.\u201d \nChampioning the finest leather craft, Maxwell \u2013 Scott\u2019s collections range from business, travel and leisure for both men and women. \nFlying the flag for UK design, its signature full-grain leather is naturally vegetable-tanned - a finish which creates a unique and desirable patina over time. \nFor Forshaw, the Designed in Britain tag and the company\u2019s commitment to manufacturing using only the highest quality materials, is key to the company\u2019s success. \n\u201cDue to retail\u2019s ever-expanding dependence on the digital world, we turned to ecommerce in 2007 with the launch of our first online store,\u201d he said. \n\u201cFortunately, customers desire high quality all over the world, therefore Maxwell - Scott\u2019s leather goods sold globally instantly. \n\u201cWe currently export all our leather products from all collections entirely worldwide with the exception of a few countries, namely Russia, North Korea and Burma.\u201d \nAiding the company\u2019s ambitious export drive has also been the launch of a series of websites dedicated to each of its core markets. \nSince 2007, Forshaw has gone on to launch websites bespoke for customers in the UK, US, Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland and Australia. \nHe said: \u201cSince the launch of Maxwell - Scott\u2019s first website in 2007, the company has always offered international delivery. \n\u201cWe are now predominantly an ecommerce business so expanding the company worldwide has been vital to our success. \n\u201cOnce you have the right contacts and a streamlined structure in place for your native country, it is easy to transfer this formula into other countries. \n\u201cLike everything in business, it\u2019s all about developing relationships to secure the best deal. Once you have jumped this hurdle, everything else, in theory, should fall into place seamlessly.\u201d \nHowever, establishing itself as an exporting powerhouse hasn\u2019t come without its challenges, as Forshaw pointed out: \n\u201cAs we are based in Yorkshire, the most challenging part is finding native-speaking professionals from around the world to manage our sites. \n\u201cWe have learned that it is vital to employ natives so that our international customers receive a localised and personal experience. \n\u201cAs we offer such a high-quality product, we must ensure that our customer service is of the same quality, whether the customer is from London, Lisbon or Los Angeles. Native local knowledge is imperative to securing this standard. \n\u201cLuckily, we gained support from representatives of international couriers. At the start, we would always meet face-to-face on a regular basis in order to learn the main mechanics and policies involved in trading abroad. Understanding every part of the process is key to being efficient and cost-effective.\u201d \nHaving hurdled these obstacles, exporting has now proven a perfect fit for Maxwell \u2013 Scott and Forshaw is enjoying the fruits of his labour. \nHe said: \u201cExporting our leather goods overseas has significantly developed and expanded our business as it has opened us up to so many additional markets. \n\u201cA major factor of Maxwell - Scott\u2019s international success is that we champion Great British design - an aesthetic that is deemed to be highly prestigious and desirable by other cultures. \n\u201cWe also ensure that our delivery rates remain highly competitive within the industry by developing good relationships with international couriers. \n\u201cAs our goods have a relatively high price point, we are able to offer our overseas customers with special delivery offers to entice them. For example, on our US site, customers receive free delivery when their order exceeds US$150.\u201d \nSo, what next for the business? Forshaw concludes: \u201cIn the near future, the Maxwell - Scott team plan to launch websites in China and South America. \n\u201cIn five years time, we see the business developing further into bespoke products, luxury wholesale opportunities and corporate gifting. \n\u201cWe are also hoping to see the Maxwell - Scott team expand further into PR, UX and digital marketing within the next five years.\u201d \nForshaw\u2019s top tips for exporters: \u201cGain contacts with industry professionals from the markets you are looking into and absorb as much information from them as possible. \n\u201cThis will give you the insight and the knowledge necessary to ensure that your product or service is worthy of export.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "william forshaw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maxwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paolo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maxwell - scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forshaw", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pd ports northern powerhouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maxwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maxwell - scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hsbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leeds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisbon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yorkshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:22.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dad34f14bfec5db00bb29b5af4a3eb8c87d1fbba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qqruij56f9C67UATMLMaZD8gl8N0BuxJSU6favXhhezqSnkL6hs23VFo8MUqXReSLiT_UaUEnNtshFK0unbySeYcXKNdUHVo-", "site_full": "www.pressdemocrat.com", "site": "pressdemocrat.com", "site_section": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/rss-opinion", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Press Democrat Opinion RSS Feed", "title": "Rubin: Trump blows hopes of a new Middle East peace deal", "title_full": "Rubin: Trump blows hopes of a new Middle East peace deal", "published": "2017-12-07T09:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=$AWfKFaPBXyNwu20KQcgNc$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYsA6QN6TwxizjWmuBuwluKAWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 17376, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dad34f14bfec5db00bb29b5af4a3eb8c87d1fbba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qqruij56f9C67UATMLMaZD8gl8N0BuxJSU6favXhhezqSnkL6hs23VFo8MUqXReSLiT_UaUEnNtshFK0unbySeYcXKNdUHVo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Trudy Rubin", "published": "2017-12-07T09:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "Rubin: Trump blows hopes of a new Middle East peace deal", "text": "Rubin: Trump blows hopes of a new Middle East peace deal TRUDY RUBIN BY TRUDY RUBIN | December 7, 2017, 12:01AM | Updated 1 hour ago. What on earth is Trump thinking? That\u2019s a question one asks all too often about the president. But the contradiction between President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel \u2014 at the very same time his son-in-law is trying to concoct the \u201cultimate\u201d deal between Israelis and Palestinians \u2014 is downright schizoid. On the one hand, First Son-in-law Jared Kushner, paired with Trump\u2019s real estate lawyer Jason Greenblatt, have been traversing the Mideast for the last several months trying to come up with a peace plan whose details still remain a secret. But the plan will reportedly emerge early in the new year. On the other hand, the future of Jerusalem \u2014 which would contain both the Palestinian and Israeli Jewish capitals in any plausible solution \u2014 is one of the most sensitive topics in any negotiation. And the issue of sovereignty over Jerusalem\u2019s holy places \u2014 sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims \u2014 is of concern globally. That\u2019s why none of the 160 countries that has diplomatic relations with Israel recognize Jerusalem as its capital. No U.S. president has ever recognized Israel\u2019s sovereignty over Jerusalem because they knew it would block any prospect of an \u201cultimate peace deal\u201d \u2014 the kind of deal that Trump insists that he alone can produce. \u201cThe Israelis and Palestinians have agreed that no side should take actions which preempt a final status agreement,\u201d I was told last week by the chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, who has met with Kushner and Greenblatt 11 times since September (while he has been recovering from a lung transplant in Virginia). \u201cThe United States can\u2019t dictate the outcome of Jerusalem, which should be negotiated by the two sides.\u201d In 1995, Congress did call for the U.S. embassy to be moved to Jerusalem from its current location in Tel Aviv. But, because the issue was so sensitive, it permitted the president to issue a waiver every six months on moving the embassy, and every president since has done so \u2014 including Trump earlier this year. Yet now the president is willing to make a move \u2014 not just recognition, but setting in process an embassy move \u2014 that could spark a surge of anti-American violence in the Muslim world. It could fuel post-ISIS terrorism and strengthen Iran. Trump seems oblivious to pleas this week by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and by close Arab allies such as King Abdullah II of Jordan \u2014 and Saudi King Salman, whom Trump considers his new best bud in battling Tehran. Most strange, Trump seems determined to abort any Kushner peace deal before it is born. Perhaps the president \u2014 in his determination to please his Christian evangelical backers \u2014 just doesn\u2019t understand Jerusalem geography. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s been shown maps of the city, but perhaps he was too impatient to study them. So here\u2019s a little background on why this issue is so explosive \u2014 and why Trump\u2019s heedless behavior is so bizarre. Jerusalem has always been holy to the Jewish people. But when the United Nations approved a plan to divide the Mandate of Palestine into one Palestinian and one Jewish state, it called for the internationalization of Jerusalem \u2014 because of its holiness to three billion people of three faiths.

Bhavin Turkahia, CEO of Flock, looks at how AI will revolutionise how you work. \nTechnological evolutions also underpin the on-going growth of the enterprise messenger market, taking business communications to a new level of speed and efficiency. \nA recent Gartner study investigating consumers' behaviour and their attitudes on the use of mobile apps, found that 71% of respondents used messaging apps. This was up 3% from usage in 2015, with 35% of over 3000 respondents saying they used virtual personal assistants (VPAs) in 2016, a 4% rise from 2015. \nThis on-going demand for messaging apps, coupled with the pace of technological change means that messaging platforms need to become early adopters of technologies. Although these technologies are still in their infancy, they promise to revolutionise how we work and do business. This rings true particularly for artificial intelligence (AI), where the growing sophistication of machine learning has the ability to streamline any workplace. \nAlongside many other leading enterprise messaging apps, Flock has embraced artificial intelligence by integrating bots to automate tasks within work groups. This allows users to centralise their \u2018to-do list\u2019 through one channel, with the bot providing reminders on upcoming tasks and notifying groups about workflow actions. \nThis is just the beginning for AI. The future will involve bots that automatically schedule appointments when a request comes through or that book taxis after you\u2019ve finished your meeting. Moreover, machine learning allows bots to learn from past conversations with users, enabling them to send emails that mimic the language used by an employee. Bots of the future will help people work smarter and increase productivity by helping knowledge workers focus on tasks that explicitly require their time and expertise. \nIn the future AI will also help to arrange meetings. Agreeing on a date and time often requires a great deal of organisation, time and coordination. With the introduction of AI, users will be able to save time as bots avoid any potential pitfalls and can make informed recommendations tailored to your business needs. When further technology advancements are made, Virtual Reality (VR) will also be used to bring colleagues together in a virtual meeting room and hold virtual meetings. This new way of conducting meetings will aid collaboration across an increasingly distributed workforce that is choosing to work remotely and out of the physical constraints of a traditional office. \nBy 2030, not only will AI and VR have become an essential component across many enterprise messenger platforms, but the Internet of Things (IoT) will also transform how we communicate, work and operate our personal and business lives. \nThe enterprise messaging market is developing parallel to the needs of its users. As enterprises have varying user requirements, the best communication platforms will use the latest technologies to solve customers\u2019 pain points in different ways.

He described very well the reaction of big game to a variety of shots. He was adamant that any shot at a deer that \"missed\" required at least 45 minutes of follow up before declaring the shot a miss and that any deer that dropped as if struck by the hand of god required a couple of minutes under the cross hairs if one could not get to the deer quickly and ensure it was dead.\nAfter reading this I became a proponent of keeping the cross hairs on any deer that dropped immediately for several minutes as well as the detailed follow up of any shot. Experience has confirmed the validity of these practices.\nI am also a fan of putting a second shot (sometimes a third) into an animal if the opportunity presents. Some of my buddies have hassled me about this but throughout my time hunting and guiding I have seen several dead animals \"come back to life\" and I would rather have an extra hole or two in an animal than have a long tracking job whilst an animal suffers unnecessarily.\nMy last deer of our 2017 season was a good reminder of keep the cross hairs on any deer that drops immediately. I'm sitting beneath a large spruce tree hidden behind a couple of poplar blowdowns in the Alberta foothills watching an opening in the bush. A buck come drifting through the poplars about 110 yards east of me, I grunt, he stops only allowing me to see his nose, guts and hind legs.I expect him to start looking for the source of the grunt and whilst doing so move around a bit and give me a shot opportunity. He just puts his head down and takes off, not running but walking with purpose and vigor.\nAt the next gap in the trees I aim for just behind his ear and expect delay in my reaction,my lack of leading his movement and travel time of the bullet to allow for an impact in the neck near the shoulder. At the shot the buck drops, it looks like his bedded with his head outstretched. Load another round and keep the cross hairs on the deer. In about a minute his head begins to move side to side, the rejuvenation develops rapidly from there, it takes about 15 seconds and he is throwing his head and using one front leg to try and get up. Another shot into the neck just above the chest puts an end to his movement. Another couple of minutes of no movement I grab my stuff and go gt the deer.\nWhilst skinning and butchering the deer a bit of DSI (deer shot investigation) was done. The first shot entered the neck just in front of the shoulder and exited at the very top of the far shoulder, the dorsal process of several vertebrae were completely destroyed but the spine itself remained intact, the second shot took out a fist sized chunk of spine.\nWhat also showed up was a number of recent superficial wounds and a puncture through the abdominal wall. Looks like this guy just got his ass kicked by another buck. Most likely the reason for getting out of Dodge rather than looking around for the source of the grunt.\nWould the deer been able to recover enough from the first shot to get up and leave we'll never know, but I have seen deer and caribou recover enough from similar shots when friends and clients did not believe me that they needed to be prepared for a follow up shot that rodeos ensued .At the end of one multi shot rodeo the client asked Rick (another guide) \"should I shoot him again? Why not I think there's one quarter without a bullet in it\"\nSo this year's last deer just reinforced my possibly excess enthusiasms for thoroughly following up every shot.\nFor those who are interested the rifle is a 7-08 Vanguard, 140 grain nosler ballistic tips propelled by varget.\nThis hunting seasons ends with me being a mile north of Montana and 24 miles west of Saskatchewan as my furthest south east and west of Hythe in Grand Prairie country as my north west extreme. For those of you whose seasons are over I hope they were grand, for those of you still hunting the best of luck.\nThanks for reading my ramblings and I hope they have triggered some thoughts and recollections.\nAll the best GRF\nCMG 300 BP\n#12434220 - 12/01/17 Re: Shot follow up [ Re: GRF ] Joined: Feb 2003\nPosts: 6,241 bwinters\nCampfire Tracker bwinters\nCampfire Tracker\nJoined: Feb 2003\nPosts: 6,241\nSmoky Mountains, TN Good post. I agree with your thoughts and actions.\nOn Monday, I shot a medium size 8 pt at about 40 yards slightly quartering to me. At the shot he dropped and started kicking. I put another in the rifle and watched him starting to collect his wits about him. He stood up and started motivating past me, actually getting closer. I put another tight to the shoulder and he went down. My second shot was a twin to the first except dead broadside. He didn't need another shot but I've seen enough rodeos to know a follow up is always a good idea, especially when they've gotten back up. The DSI revealed shredded lungs but no broken bones. Gun was a 308 fueled with Re15 and 180 Sierras. I wasn't undergunned \ud83d\ude0e\nAdversity doesn't build character, it reveals it. #12434306 - 12/01/17 Re: Shot follow up [ Re: GRF ] Joined: Mar 2011\nPosts: 1,643 davet\nCampfire Ranger davet\nCampfire Ranger\nJoined: Mar 2011\nPosts: 1,643 In my early 20's I had a shot at my biggest buck at the time, at 40 yards on the move. I shot the darn thing 4 times before he could hit the ground. I was so excited at the sight of him, that I had that bolt action Ruger sounding like an uzi. He was not going to get away!\nWith more experience I grew out of that.\n#12434346 - 12/01/17 Re: Shot follow up [ Re: GRF ] Joined: Jan 2001\nPosts: 4,613 Okanagan\nCampfire Guide Okanagan\nCampfire Guide\nJoined: Jan 2001\nPosts: 4,613 Very good post, excellent info.\nFWIW day before yesterday I thought that I missed a whitetail buck and had we not persisted in looking (and if not for a grandson's sharp young eyes) we would have called it a miss and not recovered the buck.\nI saw no reaction to a hit aimed at its near shoulder as it angled toward me, and then found zero hair or sign of a hit at the spot where the deer was walking when hit. I asked my 14 year old grandson to go with me and look for sign with his better eyes, and within a minute he had found a speck of bloody hide with a few hairs attached. He worked out a faint blood trail and found the buck 28 yards away lying dead hidden in a hummock hole. Broken shoulder, shredded heart and lung: there should have been gouts of blood but he left minimal blood trail. As said, a shot deserves 45 minutes of serious looking for sign of a hit or where the bullet went.\nRe second shot: not doing it cost me a bull elk lying apparently dead. OTOH I got a large bull moose because I gave him an insurance shot when he appeared dead. Something about the way he fell and the way he looked when \u201cdead\u201d didn't seem right so I put one in his brain and went on to finish pushing bush for my friend. When we returned, we discovered that the first shot had gone between the vertical bones in his hump and didn't even bleed on the ground. He would have woken up and left with no more than a sore neck.\nLast edited by Okanagan; 12/01/17 . #12435438 - 12/01/17 Re: Shot follow up [ Re: Okanagan ] Joined: Jan 2008\nPosts: 5,702 geedubya\nCampfire Tracker geedubya\nCampfire Tracker\nJoined: Jan 2008\nPosts: 5,702\nTexas 100%\nIf the animal is down, I always get the cross-hairs back on him ASAP.

I watched for a couple of minutes and he didn\u2019t move so I climbed down from my stand. I looked up and he was trying to get up. Trying to reload and keeping an eye on the buck was a trick but I was able to get the second shot in which did the trick.\nWhat I should have done was that during that first couple of minutes while I was watching him I should have been reloading then, not as he was trying to get up.

Most of my game animals have required but a single shot - however... There have been a few that needed at least one more shot.\nI've long had the habit of instantly cycling the bolt or lever and getting a fresh cartridge in the chamber, while keeping an eye on the animal, down or not. One of the things I like a lot about hunting pronghorn & mule deer with the soft-kicking 25-06 is that it doesn't really come off target much, so it's real fast to get back on target if necessary.\nIt's paid off a few times. Tougher with a muzzle loader, but yes, I've scrambled to reload before approaching the downed animal, just in case.\nSomebody here described a moose that just didn't look dead. I had a mule deer buck like that once. Down, but... Dead? My 13 year old son knew I was a bit uneasy about the buck - though I didn't shoot it again. Probably should have. After I got the heart and lungs out of the deer my son said \"I'm pretty sure he's dead now Dad.\"\nGuy\n#12436785 - 12/02/17 Re: Shot follow up [ Re: GRF ] Joined: Jul 2007\nPosts: 5,112 GuyM\nCampfire Tracker GuyM\nCampfire Tracker\nJoined: Jul 2007\nPosts: 5,112\nWashington - dry side A few years ago my son shot a whitetail buck with his 30-06 at modest range, maybe 80 yards.

Within 30 seconds that buck was back on his feet. John put him down for good with the second shot.\nThe first one had indeed, hit near the spine, but hadn't broken it.

If they take a good hit, run or walk away, and fall over, they aren't getting up. I've seen both deer and elk take a whopping from the first shot, drop like they were hit by lightning, and pop up later. Have come to recognize this generally happens due to a temporary shock to the nervous system. If vital tissues have not been destroyed, they are getting back up. High ribs shots have been most common when they get back up. As far as likely misses and follow-ups go, I have found that it is important to hunt with a partner if you can. Someone acting as an observer while you shoot is at times really vital. It's easy to miss when all adrenaline'd up, and it's also easy to miss the signs of a good hit when in the same state. Having that observer there can make a world of difference when the quarry vanished at the shot from the perspective of the shooter.\nAnd it depends on what the target was. I popped a deer in the head this year. It was a bedded doe, and I was on sticks, and she wasn't standing up anytime soon, so I opted to take the headshot, and if I missed, a follow-up to the ribs would be pretty simple. At the shot, her head vanished. The rest of her was concealed in grass. I was SURE that I connected, but I had no evidence of that. She was with a group of does, all bedded, and she was to the left of the rest of them where she lay. The other does didn't react to the shot either. Likely because she had been the dominant doe in the group, and since she wasn't getting up, none of the others did either. They eventually all stood and jogged off, minus my doe, as I made my way to their bed area. Like I said, I KNEW I hit her. No point in waiting. My point is that circumstances play a part in decision-making. If the doe's head had not vanished at the shot, that would have been a sign of a problem. If you are shooting for the CNS and the animal does not drop immediately, you missed.\nI belong on eroding granite, among the pines.

And that is even after I've told them, previous to the shot, to keep shooting until they are down and not moving. What is worse is when someone shoots and not only does not reload but doesn't even stay on the rifle, but starts getting up to celebrate. You see this on the hunting shows all the time.\nGetting a second shot might not be possible but you ALWAYS reload and try for one.\nI once had a sheep hunter drop a ram with a muzzle loader. I told him to start reloading and I'd keep eyes on the ram. And he argued with me about the need for reloading. I was stunned. I \"politely asked\" him to reload and he did.\nI've wondered why an instant reload isn't a natural reaction, but I don't have a good explanation, does anybody?\n#12442138 - 12/04/17 Re: Shot follow up [ Re: GRF ] Joined: Dec 2010\nPosts: 1,507 GRF\nCampfire Ranger GRF\nCampfire Ranger\nJoined: Dec 2010\nPosts: 1,507\nCalgary Alberta Ralphie; some thoughts on your question:\nSome of the PHs I have talked to and hunted with think North American hunters admire their shot rather than getting ready for the next shot....\nSome hunters have far too much confidence in the \"power\" of their cartridge and too little awareness of how tenacious some game animals can be. They think that after receiving the 180 grain bullet from their .30-06 or .300 RUM that no animal could possibly stand up let alone run away\nSome may lack hunting experience and have not seen the \"dead\" animal leaving scenario\nSome may have not had the experiences that we have had to make us think a reload and back onto the animal is common sense...\nSome are caught up in the one shot one kill ethos and don't want to have to tell their buddies that it took them 2 shots to kill their beast\nSome have not had mentoring or coaching....\nSome are 100% sure that the animal is dead....\nSome may be unaware of all the non-lethal spots one can hit on a game animal...\nSome may have put all of their emotional effort into pulling the trigger and are too mentally drained to think to recycle..\nSome have very little to no experience shooting without a bench for practice, with all of their hunting being from enclosed stands with great rests, therefore have had little need or opportunity for the quick reload....\nI have see friends and clients making more fuss over making sure they don't lose their brass than reloading and getting ready for a second shot.\nPerhaps some think life will work out like their video games....\nI'm sure I've missed a few but I think there are many reasons why a hunter does not reload as soon as the have finished \"follow through\" on their shot. Just my thoughts.\nGRF\n#12442299 - 12/04/17 Re: Shot follow up [ Re: GRF ] Joined: Oct 2007\nPosts: 768 melchung\nCampfire Regular melchung\nCampfire Regular\nJoined: Oct 2007\nPosts: 768\nKaunakakai, Molokai, Hawaii GRF: I lost a nice wild pig like that once.
