Thursday, 7 December 2017 Chinese ZTZ-169C As you can all guess, with Terror Tree now out, tanks, especially large tanks, have been on my mind. These are old Ral Partha Demolisher tanks from the original FASA BattleTech miniatures range. Back in the day, when I was young, I bought one, which despite my best efforts to shed stuff over the years I still have. It's the one at the back. Over the past few years I acquired two more, which were originally bought to be turned into cybertanks for Ogre/GEV. But I have a shed ton of Ogre cybertanks, so they've become surplus to requirements. Since then, I've been of two minds about what to do with them. As a BattleTech tank, it really is way too big to use, if you agree that the battlemech models are accurate 1/300th scale representations. If on the other hand, like me, you're in the habit of using the Dark Age Mech Warrior infantry for your BattleTech games, because they look better, then these Demolishers do look the business. They would also make a reasonable 15mm, nominal 1/100th scale tanks too. So, decisions, decisions. After much thought, I've decided to use them as part of my ongoing Bad Dog project, as I want some tank to support my Chinese All Terrain Suits, and I've given them the designation ZTZ-169C. I think that the Demolisher looks pretty good next to these Chinese All Terrain Suits I made. Big without being too big, and one can rationalize the treads as independent electric drive units. So time to strip the two partly painted models and reassemble them.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "battletech", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ral partha demolisher", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:46.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9b54ed23fc4421783a813dcfbaf88432e6992129", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKprIkY0g9nZJO8b1eoUw3a0ftKHvZeBy5vKCIrXZDykcm1xZGBs56DpurXx9Mm6DFcX3dDtuK_.5xwQLDUF.KfidNsL8JULrZ", "site_full": "www.freelancer.com.pe", "site": "freelancer.com.pe", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.com.pe/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "freelance_writing"], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "Price Comparison Website Like pricebaba,pricedekho by developersyour", "title_full": "Price Comparison Website Like pricebaba,pricedekho by developersyour", "published": "2017-12-07T11:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "PE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9b54ed23fc4421783a813dcfbaf88432e6992129", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKprIkY0g9nZJO8b1eoUw3a0ftKHvZeBy5vKCIrXZDykcm1xZGBs56DpurXx9Mm6DFcX3dDtuK_.5xwQLDUF.KfidNsL8JULrZ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "Price Comparison Website Like pricebaba,pricedekho by developersyour", "text": "CSS Price Comparison Website Like pricebaba,pricedekho \nI want price comparion website as like pricebaba,[url removed, login to view] whose body make like this send me request \u00a1Ofr\u00e9cete a trabajar en este proyecto ahora!

Advertisement \nThe Kuruman One Stop Health Service centre was opened by mineral resources deputy minister Godfrey Oliphant on Tuesday, on behalf of Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa . \nIt is a collaboration by various stakeholders led by government and supported by captains of the mining industry, organised labour and current and ex-mineworker associations with the aim to de-centralise services to claimants and beneficiaries. Advertisement \nThe centre is part of the Department of Health\u2019s ongoing service roll-out campaign to current and ex-mineworkers following the Minister of Health Aaron Motsoaledi \u2019s national launch of the Ku-Riha project in Carletonville, Gauteng province in 2015. \nOne-Stop Centres are located in mining or labour-sending areas, and are designed to provide medical support to ex-mine workers, who often cease receiving treatment for various reasons when they leave employment. \nThey offer medical examinations, rehabilitation assessments, health promotion and counselling to all patients, as well as referrals to other medical specialists if necessary. These services mean that patients can be diagnosed, treated and receive the help they need to remain healthy, in one place. In addition, the centres help individuals prepare and submit claims to the Medical Bureau for Occupational Diseases (MBOD) for compensation. \nThe service centres enable government to trace eligible previous and current mineworkers who have not claimed their compensation benefits over the last 30 years after they contracted occupational lung disease during the time they were employed at mines. \nIn addressing more than 4,000 members of the Kuruman community including ex-mineworkers, Oliphant said there was initially about R1.5 billion available for the compensation of 106,000 unpaid beneficiaries. \nSince the launch of One Stop Health Service Centres, the number of unpaid beneficiaries increased by 8,320. \nOliphant encouraged ex-mineworkers to visit the service centres as well as the mobile centres in order to check the status of their claims and if they are eligible for compensation. \nChamber of Mines acting chief executive, Nikisi Lesufi said that these institutions clearly demonstrated the value of partnership between the private sector and government.

You can suffer or let go of what no longer serves you.\nMany people mask their pain by avoiding it. They rather forget the hurt which only reinforces it.\nYou must love and acknowledge your darkness, like pain and grief. If you appreciate the sun and wish away the darkness how would you see the stars at night?\nYour emotional wounds lead you to experience the wholeness of yourself. It is remiss to emphasise your darkness while identifying with your light since you encompass both parts.\nPain is a powerful teacher that connects you with your inner wisdom.\nWithout pain, how will you recognise the enduring self that lies beneath the rubble of suffering?\nWithout pain, you are powerless to embrace the entirety of who you are.\nYour emotional wounds do not imply you are flawed, yet show your true character. They are your battle scars that show you have danced with life and lived to tell the tale.\nYou communicate to others of the struggles that lie ahead, having traversed the path yourself.\nYour wounds lie fragmented deep within your psyche. If you have not reconciled them, they grow stronger until you address them. They are the imposing shadow, lurking in the darkness waiting to grab hold if you grow weary.\nThe mind\u2019s self-protection is an admirable defence to preserve your emotional wellbeing. It stows away the pain when you\u2019re least equipped to deal with it.\nRather than persecute yourself for holding on to unpleasant memories, appreciate that your mind protects you from further getting hurt.\nA Return to Love \u201cWhen I stand before thee at the day\u2019s end, thou shalt see my scars and know that I had my wounds and also my healing.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aRabindranath Tagore You can become your own healer via loving and nurturing declarations to yourself. This reinforces how it is now safe to face these emotions with openness to heal.\nYour emotional wounds call you to connect with your inner child instead of escaping the pain when it intensifies.\nTo run away from pain is the opposite of loving kindness because you neglect to honour your emotional wellbeing. You must love yourself foremost as you would a friend or loved one who is hurt.\nTo demonstrate this commitment, consider the vows recited when two people marry: to honour one another through the good times and bad. Make the same commitment to yourself, irrespective of the emotions that arise, knowing you will honour them.\nYour emotional wounds strengthen you because they show you have lived a purposeful life.\nThere is a broader lesson contained within each emotional wound. If you penetrate through the pain, you realise it is a return to love as the American spiritual teacher Marianne Williamson affirms.\nSo when you experience pain and suffering, love yourself.\nWhen you feel anxiety and tension, love yourself.\nWhen you feel happiness and joy, love yourself.\nThis simple act of self-renewal permeates into your consciousness, so regardless of the external conditions, your deepest wisdom leads you to connect with your heart.\nI\u2019ve noted, when I embrace my emotional wounds, it opens me to a greater awareness of my soulful nature. The shell which conceals the pain is cracked open to expose the loving tenderness beneath. This is the basis for heart-centred living, in contrast to the egoist self.\nTo fully heal, declutter your life and nurture the child within, while creating a secure environment for healing to occur.\nInner Transformation \u201cA man on the run finds compassion or love or even pretended innocence his greatest source of danger.\u201d \u2015 Bryce Courtenay \u201cThe transformation process evolves your consciousness from fear to love. That means you have to dissolve the fears and heal the emotional wounds that are in the way\u200a\u2014\u200aby understanding them. And that means you have to face them, feel them, and decode them, which most of us dread,\u201d states author Penney Peirce.\nThe saying: time heals all wounds does not hold significance if you don\u2019t make the time to face them. You may store away the emotional fragments of the past, only to have them reappear at a later stage.\nTo confront your emotional wounds means to honour yourself foremost. No matter what emerges, you trust you will cope.\nEveryone is bound to experience hurt and pain in their lives. Unless you\u2019ve lived under a rock, we all carry emotional pain. It\u2019s how we transform the pain to develop a deeper relationship with ourselves that leads to inner freedom.\nYour wounds strengthen you because they invite you to be sensitive to your emotional life. You become inquisitive about your emotions and examine them with openness and equanimity.\nTo be curious fosters a balanced relationship with the wholeness of who you are, rather than dismiss the emotions as untoward. As you connect with your fractured parts, you strengthen your commitment to yourself.\nTo accept and heal your emotional wounds, release them to invite the power of love to occupy its space. Allow the experience to transform you into an empowered being.\nI am drawn to author Dennis Merritt Jones\u2019 message: \u201cRemember, forgiveness doesn\u2019t necessarily mean forgetting. We may always have memories attached to some of our emotional wounds in much the same way we have scar tissue from a physical wound that happened long ago. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to relive the pain that caused the scar.\u201d\nYour childhood wounds are exposed through adult relationships and if you do little to confront them, they can ruin your life. Therefore, they are a gift guiding you to heal within.\nThrough mindfulness, you learn to be grounded in the present moment and experience any emotions that emerge. This simple act cultivates true intimacy with yourself.\nSo avoid holding on to your pain. There is no power gained from being a victim, other than to deflect your wounds onto others to appease your suffering.\nI leave you with a quote from psychotherapist John Prendergast Ph.D. who states: \u201cIf our heart has been closed and then begins to open, we often discover why our native sensitivity originally shut down. Old emotional wounds will surface and ask for our attention. Difficult feelings such as grief, shame, self-loathing, personal deficiency, despair, and fear can arise.\u201d\nThis statement reaffirms the need to love yourself completely, no matter the emotions that surface.\nYour responsibility is not to judge yourself, but to reconcile the pain and integrate it into your experience toward oneness.\nCall To Action To live a remarkable life, it is vital to take consistent action in spite of your fears and doubts.

(AP) \u2014 The mayor of Kentucky's second-largest city says he is running for Congress, setting up a fierce primary in one of the many GOP districts across the country Democrats think they can win with the help of a Trump backlash.\nJim Gray announced Tuesday he will seek the Democratic nomination in Kentucky's 6th Congressional District.\nThe district had traditionally been a Democratic seat. But since 1979, it has flipped five times between the two major political parties, most recently when Republican Andy Barr ousted Democrat Ben Chandler in 2012.\nBarr won re-election comfortably during President Barack Obama's administration, taking advantage of the former president's unpopularity in Kentucky. But now that Republican Donald Trump is in office, Democrats believe they have a better chance at winning the seat.\nTrump's efforts to repeal Obama's health care law have sparked vocal massive protests within the district, including hundreds of hecklers at some of Barr's town hall meetings.\nLATEST SFGATE VIDEOS Now Playing: Now Playing Behind the scenes: \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" sfgate Star Wars: The Last Jedi (official trailer) sfgate Muni bus and streetcar collide sfgate Time lapse of Bay Area traffic sfgate Mountain lion and kitten spotted for first time since fire sfgate Santa Rosa firefighters headed south to fight LA blaze sfgate The best views in Russian Hill sfgate Ventura resident shows view of massive fire sfgate Oakland city workers go on strike sfgate Smoke from Creek Fire smothers Lake View Terrace in Los Angeles sfgate \"People are either mad as hell or they are scared as hell. And that shows a real division in the country,\" Gray said in an interview. \"What we need in Washington is adult supervision. We need grown-ups, and that's the kind of experience I bring.\"\nBut while Trump might be unpopular in the Lexington area, he won the surrounding counties by a large margin during the 2016 election. Barr has supported Trump's agenda in Congress, including his repeal of the health care law and an overhaul of the tax code.\nIt appears Barr's campaign will again focus on tying his opponents to the national Democratic party, which has proved to be unpopular in Kentucky.\n\"All of the Democrat candidates running in this race support the extreme liberal Obama-Clinton-Pelosi agenda of more taxes, more regulations, and more government control, which has been repeatedly and overwhelmingly rejected by voters of the 6th Congressional District,\" Barr spokesman Rick VanMeter said.\nGray will face at least three other people for the Democratic nomination: former fighter pilot Amy McGrath, state Sen. Reggie Thomas and Geoff Young, a former state employee who has run for the seat twice before.\nOf them, McGrath seems to be in the best position to challenge Gray. She has raised more than $800,000, of which she has just over $550,000 in the bank. But McGrath has never run for office before, while Gray is finishing up his second term as mayor of the district's largest city. Plus, he just finished a statewide Senate campaign in 2016. He lost to Republican Rand Paul, but won the 6th Congressional District by 4 percentage points.\n\"I may not be a big-city mayor, but I know we need someone who will fight for people in every city, town and county in this district,\" McGrath said. \"That's the kind of campaign I'm running and that's the kind of representative I'll be.\"\nGray's announcement means he won't be able to run for a third term as Lexington's mayor, which could create an opening for Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes.\nGrimes became well known nationally for her unsuccessful 2014 Senate campaign against now-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. She won re-election as secretary of state in 2015, and term limits bar her from seeking a third term. Grimes lives in Lexington.\n\"Sec. Grimes loves Lexington. It's her home. She's flattered she is being asked to consider the race, but right now, she's focused on her job as Secretary of State,\" Grimes spokesman Bradford Queen said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle":

Profit Agency", "text": "Home / Affiliate Marketing Tips / How To Blog Successfully 07 Dec 2017 by profitagency \nBefore I get into how to build a successful blog, I want to share a story with you. \nLast week told my three kids that writing was going to be an essential part of their lives and I wanted them to write in their journal three times a day. \nMy two boys King and Zahran immediately wave me a struggle because they did not want to do it. As a matter of fact, King, the nine year old claimed he was being punished and asked why I punishing him by making him write. \nHere She Saved The Day \nAmidst the crying and pleading not to write, my sixteen year old emerged for her room to shed some calm to the situation. She explained to the boys that when she was there age, I made her do the same thing and that she responded much like they were. \nHowever, something she said absolutely blew my mind and made me very proud at the same time. She began to highlight all of her major accomplishments the boys, starting back from when she was their age. She explained that her rebellion to write back then made her not document many of those memorable events in her life. She further explained that she wished she had kept a log of off of those accomplishment AS IT HAPPENED. \nShe expressed to the boys that they would thank me later. Yes, Sometimes it's great to having a sixteen year old to save the day. \nTime To Build A Successful Blog \nLike my boys, there are quite a bit of people who are somewhat turned from by the idea of \u200b\u200bhaving to write, or as I put, freely express themselves everyday. The reason for that is due to the many misconceptions about writing or blogging. Here are just a few of the many misleading views I have personally encountered about blogging. Blogging is time consuming Blogging requires you to be an expert at what your blogging about Blogging is a waist of time My favorite, I am not ready to \"put myself out there\" like that \nOnce you are able to rid yourself of those limiting thoughts, its very easy to build a blog successfully. \nSo How Do You Build A Successful Blog? \nSharing your thoughts with the world is probably one on the most liberating activity one can engage in. It is at that very moment you are committing an act of letting your thoughts go freely to connect with other like minds. \nHere are some of my favorite suggestion that will help you build your blog and experience some success in the process. Express With Confidence: Share your thoughts with no inhibitions. Readers will connect with you and your confidence level will sky rocket, trust me \u2026 Help Others: Hold the intention of helping your readers with your words.

If so, boy, should you be excited, because a company in Brisbane, Australia is making a whole slew of vibrators, dildos, bondage gear and more, all \"inspired\" by the films, and, uh... well, just see for yourself. \nImage: Geeky Sex Toys A long time ago, in a fantasy far far away.... STAR TOYS! Available now????! https://t.co/qAK6moJIoU ????We've spent many many moons working on these products and are absolutely thrilled with the final results.???? Go check em' out! #handsolo #darthvibrator pic.twitter.com/m0VakOG1Fg \nThe company, Geeky Sex Toys, has a history of making... geeky sex toys. Last year, as Mashable noted , it produced a series of Pokemon-inspired sex aids . There are also toys based on Rick and Morty ( Dick and Horny ), Power Rangers ( The Mighty Moaning Anal Rangers ), and Guardians of the Galaxy ( Orgasms of the Galaxy ). But the new \" Star Toys \" line is on another level and inspires some... questions. \nLike, some of the toys are pretty tame - the lightsaber vibrators especially, but also the C3P0 anal plug seen up top. And this Dark Side bondage kit seems pretty vanilla for, you know, bondage kits: \nA perfect gag gift. \nSure, the Death Star ball gag is right up Moff Tarkin's alley, but that I guarantee you what Kylo Ren and Darth Vader wear day-to-day is a helluva lot kinkier than that mask and collar. \nBut then things take a turn with the Hand Solo male masturbator and the 13cm Dildoda. \nWhy would you want to stick your penis in carbonite? Carbonite is cold. Why would you want to be thinking about sub-zero temperatures when engaging your junk with a particularly nerdy fleshlight? The Yoda dildo, on the other hand, despite being 13cm long, just seems... optimistic. \nBut my biggest question is reserved for the Hitachi Wand-like R2-V2, Darth Vibrator and Vibe Trooper: \nThese are just vibrators that happen to look somewhat like very popular characters from Star Wars . Clearly these are not meant to allow you to relive your favourite fantasy from Archive of Our Own . Mainly because I don't think many people look at Vader's shiny dome and think, \"AW YISS.\" \nBut my biggest question is: How on Earth is this legal? Is Disney handing out licenses to sex toy makers? (Note: They are not.) Do the good people of Australia's Geeky Sex Toys just not give a damn? Or is this supposed to be the toy equivalent of Axel Braun 's porn parodies, like Justice League XXX ? Braun's films are purposely characterised as parodies to avoid copyright infringement - can toys be considered parodies? With a name like \"Dildoda\", the Yoda wang is clearly not trying to be taken seriously, either. \nWe reached out to Geeky Sex Toys for comment but had not heard back at time of writing.

I have (sort of) practised it, I enjoy it, I find it comforting and feel it would be beneficial for me to do it more often BUT isn't there always a \"but\" somewhere rearing its ugly head. The guilt. I feel guilty for \"doing nothing\". Especially now, on the verge of retiring from a job I have disliked for years and have been counting the days to leave.\nIt maybe just me...but there seems pressure these days to accomplish things, to strive, to try something new, and for me just now questions like \"What are you going to do with yourself? you will be bored. You must keep yourself busy. Take up new interests. Don't just sit at home. You are too intelligent and active to do nothing...\" etc etc and they keep on coming.\nto listen to meditative music, quiet my mind, particularly looking into a candle (I am a candle freak, have lots) and try to achieve a peaceful place..is not acceptable..it's lazy, wasting my life, is the message I am getting. Hence the guilt if I dare to spend time in mindfulness.\nThere are lots of unshed tears within me that I feel need to come out. When I am busy interacting with others all day, they can't come out. I find when I begin meditating, they rise to the surface. I let them come. I don't feel guilty about this. I have been in pain....pain hurts. to cry when you are hurt is normal and healthy I reckon.\nSurely sitting doing nothing but letting the pain rise to the surface and come out isn't \"doing nothing and being lazy\"....or is it? Why don't others mind their own business and let me heal myself in ways that I choose? Do I have to \"check with anyone\" first? Get their permission?
