We looked like a team that came back from a road trip even though we had days to recover,\" said Babcock, who watched him team get outplayed for large chunks of the night and outshot 48-29.\n\"I thought we'd get traction and take over but that didn't happen... In the end our goalie was better.\"\nClutch stops Both teams had scoring chances in the extra period, with 3-on-3 play opening the ice. But Andersen came up with some clutch stops at the right moment to give Nylander a chance to win in it the shootout.\n\"In particular in overtime we gave up some Grade-A chances,\" said Babcock.\n\"I just want to take it one game at a time, real important to be able to flip the page,\" said Andersen, who has a .954 save percentage in his last nine games.\nMorgan Rielly scored for the Maple Leafs (18-10-1), who also downed Calgary 4-1 on Nov. 28.\nMark Giordano scored for the Flames (14-12-2), who have dropped three in a row. Smith stopped 28 shots in a losing cause.\nToronto Maple Leafs centre William Nylander (29) celebrates his game-winning overtime goal. (Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press)\n\"We did exactly what we wanted to do, played with energy, put pucks on the net,\" said Giordano. \"If we play like that we'll get two points more often than not.\"\nToronto centre Tyler Bozak was back in the lineup after missing two games and was placed on a line between James van Riemsdyk and Mitch Marner to start the game.\nCalgary had control early in the contest when Toronto's Matt Martin went to the box midway through the first period.\nAnd Giordano made Martin pay for his hooking penalty when his wrist shot from the point went through traffic and beat Andersen for the game's first goal at 10:37.\nTkachuk at it again Later in the period, Martin checked Troy Brouwer into the boards between the benches, leading to a brief scrum. Flames forward Matthew Tkachuk appeared to spear Martin from the bench while the altercation ensued, but it went undetected by officials. Martin said post-game that he didn't feel it and was told about the play by a staff.\n\"You can play with an edge for sure, I think he's an effective player, good player,\" said Martin. \"Whether the league wants to look at it is up to them. I don't think it's a good hockey play but I'll be all right.\"\nSean Monahan almost doubled Calgary's lead seven minutes into the second only for Andersen to turn him away from between the hash marks.\nAndersen was there again to bail out his teammates late in the period on a Toronto power play when Calgary had a 2-on-1 short-handed break after Marner turned the puck over at the Flames blue line.\nRielly finally evened the score with 1:13 to play in the second, with his shot from the sideboards beating a screened Smith blocker side.\nTkachuk continued to agitate as the game went on and took a couple shoves from Andersen after crashing the net late in the second. On his final shift of the period, he drew a cross-checking call on Jake Gardiner in the corner that set up a Flames power play to start the third.\nMonahan thought he regained the lead for Calgary 5:10 into the third but a video review confirmed the officials' original no-goal call because the net was off its moorings before the puck crossed the goal-line.\nThe Flames took it to the Leafs in the final 20 minutes, at one point outshooting Toronto 14-3, and held a 43-28 shots advantage heading into overtime.\n\"I thought it was a good hockey game, I look at how our team played start to finish I like our game,\" said Flames coach Glen Gulutzan.\n\"From our [defence], all six, to all four lines, I thought contributed. It was a good road game for us. We'd like the two points but it didn't happen.\"\n\u00a9 The Canadian Press, 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"],

We were there with friends, and rented a car for 2 days to do a road trip to Valladolid. On the way back from the car rental, my husband and friend were stopped at a police road block ( just after the Red Cross Building, by the traffic circle) He was told he was speeding in a controlled zone ( he most definitely was not) Cop couldn't peak English, they spoke no Spanish. He threatened to confiscate his driver's License- said he's have to go to Playa Del Carmen to pay a fine and reclaim it. After some minutes of intimidation ( a gun is always a bit intimidating) cop walked around to the passenger door, and asked our friend to see is \"pocket\" Our friend cut to the chase, and said \"how much?\" Handed the cop his wallet. He has 2000 Pesos in there- Cop helped himself to all the cash, and waved them through. No ticket issued, it was pretty blatant. They were worried that if they refused, or pushed back something bad could happen; like a car search where the police \"find\" planted drugs or similar . Nobody hopes to end up in a cell on their Mexican holiday. It just left a really bad taste- until now we had felt pretty safe in Tulum. Between the rapid development and commercialization of the beach road ( Shopping malls?!?) , the violent evictions of hotels and their guests in June 2016 ( still really miss Coqui Coqui) it feels like Tulum has gone off the boil and this may well have been our last visit. Too bad, I love that beach, it's still beautiful.

BREAKING DOWN 'Beige Book' \nThe Beige Book is published two weeks before each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) , the Federal Reserve body that sets interest rates, in order to inform members of changes in the economy since the previous meeting. The report is qualitative: each of the 12 regional Fed branches conducts interviews with local business leaders, economists and market participants, and each contributes a chapter to the Beige Book. Each chapters is in turn divided into sections by economic sector. \nThe Beige Book supplements the quantitative data reviewed by the FOMC. Of the three reports that the committee's members receive prior to meetings \u2013 the Beige Book, Blue Book (monetary policy alternatives) and Green Book (economic forecasts) \u2013 only the Beige Book is available to the public. It can be accessed through the Board of Governors' website . \nThe report was not available to the public until 1985, when a former Dow Jones reporter asked to see it, spurring his competitors to do the same. The book was first compiled in 1970, and until a 1983 change in color scheme, it was called the Red Book.

After we came to power in Uttar Pradesh, and through personal interest of (BJP chief) Amit Shah and (Union minister) Smriti Irani , development in Amethi started. Our national president had laid foundation stone of the district headquarters in Amethi, and started different schemes there\u2026 now, the true development of Amethi has started,\u201d said Mahendra Nath Pandey, BJP president in Uttar Pradesh and MP from Chandauli. \nHe said: \u201cThe reason for bringing elected local representatives from UP, especially Amethi, to Surat is that we wanted to show people clear picture of development in Amethi. After seven months of development, people there voted BJP in the local body elections.\u201d \nThe BJP leader noted that a large number of people from Uttar Pradesh live in Gujarat, most of them in Surat, Vapi, Umargam, Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Jamnagar, Surendranagar, Kalol and Halol. \n\u201cWe have come to Surat to meet people from Uttar Pradesh, and appeal them to vote for the BJP,\u201d he said. In Surat, there are around 13 lakh migrants, whose votes would be crucial for the BJP to overcome Patidars\u2019 and traders\u2019 anger and win the Assembly elections in the district, which has 16 Assembly seats. \nAhead of the last day of campaigning on Thursday for the first phase of Assembly elections on December 9, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was also in Guajrat and held poll rallies. \nThe mayors joining the BJP campaign in Surat are Sanjiv Valya (Saharanpur), Asha Sharma (Ghaziabad), Vinod Arya (Moradabad), Umesh Gautam (Bareilly), Navin Jain (Agra), Mukesh (Mathura), Nutan Rathod (Firozabad), Premila Pandey (Kanpur), Ramtirth Sinhal (Jhansi), Abhilasha Gupta (Allahabad), Sanyukta Bhatiya (Lucknow), Rushikesh Upadhyay (Faizabad), Sitaram Jaiswal (Gorakhpur) and Mrudula Jaiswal(Varanasi). \nMahesh Pratap Sonkar, chairperson-elect of Jais Nagarpalika Parishad in Amethi, and Rajesh Masala, the husband of Amethi nagar panchayat head Chandrama Devi, will also join the campaign. \nSpeaking with The Indian Express, Sonkar said, \u201cOn my seat, over 60 per cent voters are Muslims, while nearly 35 per cent are Dalits. The reason they voted for BJP is that they wanted development. Majority of the voters feel that under BJP rule, they will see development in the area. The Congress leaders come and go\u2026 they never try resolve issues faced by the locals.\u201d \nHe further added, \u201cTheir forefathers got elected from Amethi, and became PM\u2026 what development they have done in our areas? They have not started factories and industries in Amethi and as a result thousands of people from Amethi come to Surat to work\u2026. There is no hospital, no road connectivity and no education facility in Amethi. I have come here ask people in Surat to compare development in Surat with that in Amethi.\u201d For all the latest Elections News , download Indian Express App More Related News ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sura", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nutan rathod", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "premila pandey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rushikesh upadhyay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asha sharma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yogi adityanath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "navin jain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrudula jaiswal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chandrama devi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahesh pratap sonkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanjiv valya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rahul gandhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umesh gautam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jais nagarpalika parishad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amit shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahendra nath pandey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vinod arya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smriti irani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sitaram jaiswal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramtirth sinhal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abhilasha gupta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rahulji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajesh masala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mukesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanyukta bhatiya", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indian express", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmedabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamnagar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucknow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bihar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allahabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guajrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorakhpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surendranagar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jhansi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bareilly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vadodara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kanpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kalol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chandauli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moradabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mathura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amethi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ghaziabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vapi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uttar pradesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faizabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saharanpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umargam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varanasi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "firozabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lok sabha", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:14.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a844285d87ad3a462235a7d71c308643c0a4168", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw37pM0ts6wo4wks9yqTFoNwVlMVC.Atgx2rNurEyWZD6mjpP19pn1sjBR.eiKZIZE3CPpYIattHpsbm6JHrfEfB0F6DZZzZjiuYSPtUEmAA--", "site_full": "www.gumtree.com.au", "site": "gumtree.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-boats-jet-skis/c18420", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "tech"], "section_title": "Boats for Sale - New &amp;

Data confirm smart beta funds are getting in on that act. Actually, year-to-date inflows to smart beta ETFs listed around the world shattered previous annual records and that is as of the end of October, meaning with two month's left in 2017, this year's smart beta asset growth should trounce prior years' asset growth. \n\u201cYear-to-date, through end of October 2017, Smart Beta equity ETFs and ETPs listed globally saw net inflows of $59.7 billion; 53.% more than net inflows for the same period during 2016, and 6% more than net inflows for the whole of 2016,\u201d according to ETFG I, a London-based ETF research firm. \nAs is the case with the broader ETF space, a concentrated number of funds currently dominate total smart beta assets. On its own, the Vanguard Value ETF ( VTV ), the largest smart beta ETF trading in the U.S., had $34.4 billion in assets under management at the end of October, or more than 5% of all smart beta assets. \nThe 20 largest smart beta ETFs account for nearly half of the assets allocated to fundamentally-weighted ETFs, according to ETFGI data. Of those 20 ETFs, nine are either growth or value funds while three are dedicated to the low volatility factor. \nWhile single-factor and dividend funds are among the giants in the smart beta space, some multi-factor funds are experiencing rapid growth, too. Multi-factor funds are increasingly popular with advisors and investors that are realizing factor leadership varies over different time periods and factor timing is difficult. \nFor example, the JPMorgan Diversified Return U.S. Equity ETF ( JPUS ), which debuted in September 2015, had about $316.6 million in assets under management as of the end of the third quarter, of which $155.5 million has flowed into the fund just this year. \n\u201cJPUS tracks an index that aims to deliver higher risk-adjusted returns than a traditional market cap-weighted index through broad diversification of risk across sectors and stocks,\u201d according to JPMorgan Asset Management . \u201cThe index uses a multi-factor stock screening process that has historically driven strong performance.\u201d \nProving that the multi-factor story translates well to international stocks, the JPMorgan Diversified Return International Equity ETF ( JPIN ) had almost $1.1 billion in assets under management at the end of the third quarter, of which $526.4 million has arrived in the fund this year. \nMore than 20 smart beta ETFs have debuted in the U.S. just in the month of November.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "todd shriber", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jpmorgan asset management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanguard value etf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jpmorgan diversified return international equity etf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jpmorgan diversified return u.s. equity etf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vtv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:14.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba472caef5c60c3990942c12e00b2e69f230d9dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJ.QCkcXJvcBiWhQ2Q7Md1Ia2pL7DcNKOlvY9inT3vf40mpwBSbZQAV5FfeMwDS.irNhKTwN3KLHbtqESHgIDBo9RmTylkN4L5g.B3coYBRKS_wTwCp5QarA09dDUuwWpQV8Izua0lT0c-", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Appliances-Refrigerators-Top-Freezer-Refrigerators/N-5yc1vZc3ns/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Magic Chef 24 in.

Using the form, which has been released by Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), consumers would be able to complain against cases of inadequate commensurate reduction of prices of goods or/and services even after a cut in GST rate or availment of benefit of input tax credit by companies/service providers. \nAffected consumers may file the application before the state screening committees if the profiteering is of local nature or standing committee on anti-profiteering if the profiteering is of all-India character, the CBEC said. \nThe three-page form has columns for consumers to fill in their details along with details of the registered supplier who has not passed on the benefit. Among the mandatory information needed to be filled by the complainants is the actual price/value charged per unit before and after GST, the form showed. It also asks for details pertaining to the tax levied on the good/service before and after GST and the post-GST reduction in amount of tax per unit. \nThe release of the form comes after last week\u2019s appointment of Chairman and members of the National Anti-Profiteering Authority, which is the apex body to look into anti-profiteering complaints. Headed by Revenue Department\u2019s senior IAS officer B N Sharma, the national anti-profiteering authority has been empowered to order reduction in prices, return of the amount not passed on to the consumers with an interest rate of 18 per cent to the recipient, imposition of penalty and cancellation of registration of the supplier. \nThe Authority has been set up for a two-year period, which would begin from the date Sharma assumes charge as chairman. The anti-profiteering framework under the new indirect tax regime consists of the National Anti-Profiteering Authority at the top, a standing committee, screening committees in every state and Directorate General of Safeguards in the CBEC. \nThe move comes in the backdrop of the GST Council\u2019s announcement last month of a cut in the rates of over 200 items, as well as a cut in the GST rate for all restaurants, barring those in starred hotels, to 5 per cent. The GST Council had cut GST rates for 178 items, mostly consumer items of daily use, from the highest tax slab of 28 per cent to 18 per cent and now only 50 items remain in the 28 per cent slab. The new GST rates came into effect from November 15. \nAfter the GST rate cut on over 200 items last month, many consumer goods companies had instructed their trade channels to immediately cut prices for stock in trade. Last month, Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia had said that the companies have to ensure an immediate cut in prices across the retail chain to avoid facing anti-profiteering action by the government.

As part of the programme, everyday five multiple choice questions (MCQs) related to different subjects and current affairs are sent to schools which are then displayed on schools\u2019 notice boards. In April next year, Punjab government plans to conduct general knowledge competitive exams, which will culminate in a state-level competition for students clearing Bal Sabha, Block and district-level hurdles. \nThe project with the same name was originally started by three teachers of Government Senior Secondary School, Benra in 2012 with their individual efforts in district Sangrur. It was adopted as a project by the government in April 2013 itself, but was closed down after four months. Also, no competitive exam was conducted at that time by the Punjab government. \nJarnail Singh, Deputy Director, State Council of Education and Research Training (SCERT), said, \u201cWe took details from Sangrur-based Mathematics teacher and hence thought of introducing it in the whole state. We aim to run it on a regular basis. It is in three groups. The first group comprises of Class 6 to 8, second group has Class 9 and 10, while the third group has Class 11 and 12. All the questions will be asked in the form of MCQs and 60 per cent of syllabus will be from within the text books and 40 per cent will be current affairs. The daily MCQs are also being sent in the same format. Monthly exams can be conducted by schools in their Bal Sabhas, while Block-level and district-level competitive exams will be conducted in April. It will be optional for students, it will, however, help them to prepare for competitive exams after Class 10 and Class 12 in which normally government students lag behind.\u201d \nDevi Dayal, the Mathematics teacher of Government School Benra who was behind this project\u2019s idea, said,\u201dWe aim to give wings to the students so that they can fly high. This is the reason, we named it as \u2018Udaan\u2019. We had conducted exam in 2012-13 and even prize money was also distributed through voluntary donations, later I switched to Mathematics competitive exam which I am organising even now. It has been named as \u2018Ramanujan awards\u2019 which aims to sharpen the mathematical skills of students. Ramanujan awards will be conducted this year on December 17 in Sangrur district and now Patiala has also joined in. It is an exam only for government schools for students of Class 4 to 12.\u201d \nHe added, \u201cI felt elated after the \u2018Udaan\u2019 project was adopted by Punjab government. I hope that it will help the students a lot in excelling in different fields. Students in our school note down the daily five questions in their notebooks, answer keys are given the next day.\u201d \nInterestingly, the daily five MCQs are being made by this Sangrur teacher for Class 6 to 10 even now. He sends them to the SCERT, which then uploads them on its website.

I agree that one day there will be a place for banks which offer an alternative to the fractional reserve system, but currently the idea of paying a bank to hold your money in a world of extremely high returns from equities, bitcoin, real estate and other prospects make this untenable. Heck, even corporate and municipal bonds sold before maturity in a rising rate environment probably still offer a better IRR than full-reserve banks would.\nWhen will your idea actually happen? Actually, in a way it already did. In the aftermath of 2008, banks hoarded money to the point that their reserves were 100% of M1 (from 2% prior to 2008). This is the main reason why the predictions of hyper-inflation caused by a negative real fed rate and QE 1,2,3 never happened: The banks just shored up their books and didn't lend much of it out. Classic liquidity trap, no incentive for banks to lend and every incentive to take the money the Fed was offering and store them in reserves or \"risk-free\" treasuries.\nFast forward to 2012. Equities are on the rise and banks see a new opportunity to invest thanks to the good 'ol repeal of Glass-Steagall. So where does that liquidity buildup go? Exactly. The cycle comes full circle. The boom and bust that the Fed was supposedly mandated to decrease in variance (by way of steady inflation and low unemployment) has turned into the hidden monster you cannot quite yet see because of poor fiscal policy and a desire to keep Wall Street afloat.\nSo to your point, It is almost inevitable that one of the next downturns will cause negative NOMINAL rates (which were, from an academic perspective, theoretically impossible until Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Japan experienced them) to such an extreme that full-reserve banking will be more attractive than taking the risk of paying the banks interest to put your money in a broken fractional reserve system that could potentially experience bank runs. The governments of the world, burdened by debt obligations that they can never hope to pay interest on, and much less pay back, will be unable to bailout anyone this time because the escalating risk of sovereign debt will cause treasury yields to actually increase despite the central banks' best efforts. Governments will be forced to either take control of the printing press from the central banks to inflate their way out or else default. Historically speaking, governments prefer the former, but obviously neither option is a good one.\nIf the governments do take control of the money supply, no need to worry about those student loans or credit cards, though that expensive education won't really matter because you probably won't find a job. The equity holders and banks will be screwed as well of course. The default vs. inflation conflict is going to be interesting. A test of who has the real power: Banks and corporations or the government. Time will tell.\nTL;DR: Everything is fine, no need to read silly long posts about what you probably can't control anyway.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:16.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db408b0ec88b10a07294a94a60f55f0d0e78c3b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Coq3pbPWfWX3AYrIFIpK9LWyn3QyogtiBWupKDVoe295CgPAf1Ojb58LzBzbGfOxsEI4Jk79p3VPzARjOYXFh", "site_full": "www.pubacct.org.au", "site": "pubacct.org.au", "site_section": "http://www.pubacct.org.au/feed/", "site_categories": ["tax_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "Public Accountant", "title": "ASBAS to allocate $18m to get small business online", "title_full": "ASBAS to allocate $18m to get small business online", "published": "2017-12-07T14:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.pubacct.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/money-cash800.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "db408b0ec88b10a07294a94a60f55f0d0e78c3b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Coq3pbPWfWX3AYrIFIpK9LWyn3QyogtiBWupKDVoe295CgPAf1Ojb58LzBzbGfOxsEI4Jk79p3VPzARjOYXFh", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jotham Lian", "published": "2017-12-07T14:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "ASBAS to allocate $18m to get small business online", "text": "ASBAS to allocate $18m to get small business online Jotham Lian December 7, 2017 Share: \nOver $18 million in grants have been allocated to small businesses as part of the government\u2019s redesigned Australian Small Business Advisory Service (ASBAS) program. \nAccording to Minister for Small Business Michael McCormack, the ASBAS program will allocate $18.02 million in grants over three years to deliver low cost, high quality, digital advisory services to Australian small businesses in metropolitan and regional areas. \nAdvisory services will include assessments of small businesses\u2019 needs, tailored digital engagement plans, and support in relation to one or more of the priority digital capabilities including websites and selling online, social media and digital marketing, using small business software, and online security and data privacy. \n\u201cAustralian small businesses are looking for opportunities to grow their domestic and international customer base, but are often confronted by hesitation or doubt when it comes to getting online,\u201d Mr McCormack said. \n\u201cThe ASBAS program has been overhauled to focus on helping small businesses to get online and reach out to new markets for their goods and services. \n\u201cBy having digital skills and access to expert advice, small businesses can take advantage of the endless opportunities the digital economy provides here in Australia as well as internationally.\u201d \nThe ASBAS funding round will begin from 2 July 2018 to 30 June 2021, with $6.09 million allocated for NSW and the ACT; $5.68 million for QLD, the NT and WA; and $6.25 million for SA, VIC and TAS. \nSmall businesses will have to qualify under the eligibility criteria before being selected through a competitive merit test. Applications open from 23 January 2018 and close on 6 March 2018. \nMr McCormack said there were proven benefits for small businesses which adopt digital technologies and missed opportunities for those not engaging with the digital economy. \n\u201cDeloitte research shows small businesses which reach advanced levels of digital engagement are one-and-a-half times more likely to be growing revenue and eight times more likely to be creating jobs compared to those which have basic digital engagement,\u201d Mr McCormack said. \n\u201cOn the other hand, Commonwealth Bank research shows up to 80 per cent of small and medium businesses are delaying the adoption of digital technologies which could provide long-term benefits to their business.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael mccormack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccormack", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nsw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commonwealth bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deloitte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "small business advisory service", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:16.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5415dadd3ca0f436ff7066bc8a5d944c6941f667", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qMusYjKb8WCK85zSw4CqKKGq1.4LXX4eeUyDYU1nIVo80AVZ6gj6_JmP_UK8JYHKgFj71SwpHkuzu40GP8waBsFqUck2WFWugBFL3W1bYBx7RDOAlEqrvJw7NCNwkWXNc4-", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u2018Hitmen\u2019 in Khanna police custody, UK national Johal sent to 5-day police remand | The Indian Express", "title_full": "\u2018Hitmen\u2019 in Khanna police custody, UK national Johal sent to 5-day police remand | The Indian Express", "published": "2017-12-07T05:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.291, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/12/hitmen-chd-759.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5415dadd3ca0f436ff7066bc8a5d944c6941f667", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qMusYjKb8WCK85zSw4CqKKGq1.4LXX4eeUyDYU1nIVo80AVZ6gj6_JmP_UK8JYHKgFj71SwpHkuzu40GP8waBsFqUck2WFWugBFL3W1bYBx7RDOAlEqrvJw7NCNwkWXNc4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Express News Service", "published": "2017-12-07T05:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u2018Hitmen\u2019 in Khanna police custody, UK national Johal sent to 5-day police remand | The Indian Express", "text": "Centre offers Rs 2.5 lakh for every inter-caste marriage with a Dalit \nA local court in Ludhiana ended the police remand of UK national Jagtar Singh Johal alias Jaggi in the RSS shakha firing case and ordered judicial remand on Wednesday.

Among the most seasoned and successful funds that are fundamentally-weighted are growth, value and dividend funds. \nIn fact, all of the 10 largest US-listed smart beta ETFs are either growth, value or dividend funds. Of those 10, four are dividend funds, one of which is the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF ( SDY ). SDY is not only large, it is seasoned. The dividend ETF recently turned 12 years old and has over $16.6 billion in assets under management, proving investors are fans of dividends in the ETF wrapper. \nSDY tracks the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. While the name of that benchmark implies a high yield, SDY's dividend yield is 2.32%, which is not alarmingly high. The S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index mandates that member firms have dividend increase streaks of at least 20 years, a trait that has made SDY a hit with income investors. \nFortunately, SDY belies the high yield implications of its index's name. \nSDY \u201ceffectively mitigates some of the risks associated with high-dividend-paying stocks by screening for highly profitable companies with a long track record of increasing dividend payments,\u201d said Morningstar. \u201cThis dual focus reduces the fund's exposure to firms with weak fundamentals that may not be able to sustain their dividend payments, which is a risk that often accompanies a narrow focus on yield.\u201d \nDue to its emphasis on length of dividend increase streaks, it can be argued some of SDY's 107 holdings meet the criteria of the quality factor. While definitions vary, hallmarks of quality often include strong management teams and solid balance sheets. Additionally, SDY reflects the often less volatile nature of dividend stocks relative to non-dividend payers. \nOver the past three years, SDY's standard deviation is slightly higher than the S&P 500's, but the dividend ETF's maximum drawdown over that span is 210 basis points less than the S&P 500's. \nSDY's holdings are weighted by yield, giving the ETF's member firms a smaller average market value than rival dividend funds. \n\u201cDespite its smaller market capitalization, the fund's tilt toward more-stable stocks has helped it shine during market downturns,\u201d according to Morningstar. \u201cIt held up better than the Russell 1000 Value Index and landed in the top quartile of the large-value category during the market drawdown from October 2008 to March 2009. The fund outpaced its category by 3.2% during the trailing 10 years through October 2017, primarily because of greater exposure to utilities stocks, smaller exposure to energy stocks, and more favorable stock exposure within the financial sector.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "todd shriber", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "morningstar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "morningstar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spdr s&p", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sdy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:16.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df25805e442d9923a3c9b7ecab313381b9820424", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHME_02n3Qs439A73hWnbM9AvKtXz8beW5ZsbwFfv7QMh7qL0NWRqC338yX24YxmB6tM20tnu6fHWXFn_dIMzAFPy1UC5YaqL92XQH5M2mkkcgbI0SfUf_MyJ1mp5wGAp3TmPEKKRcpvArnncsx1BqhBWORBPg7h_Q6A--", "site_full": "www.ebay.co.uk", "site": "ebay.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.ebay.co.uk/b/Humidifiers/71240/bn_2317463", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Humidifiers | eBay", "title": "4x-Kontrol-Hanging-Ceramic-Moisture-Radiator-", "title_full": "Reviews: 4x-Kontrol-Hanging-Ceramic-Moisture-Radiator-Humidifier- | eBay", "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.037, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "32feec7f2854b0fdd6e7e0b06f047e4817c0d735", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHME_02n3Qs439A73hWnbM9AvKtXz8beW5ZsbwFfv7QMh7qL0NWRqC338yX24YxmB6tM20tnu6fHWXFn_dIMzAFPy1UC5YaqL92XQH5M2mkkcgbI0SfUf_MyJ1mp5wGAp3TmPEKKRcpvArnncsx1BqhBV02rCq61puRIpd1pHBzUu8IqiojcRIxqcbrITMv_jb7Q--", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "margaretdestiny", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Thank you got here on time", "text": "Thank Got here on time", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:16.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4bde7dcbf4511c1e2626a930e0c30b97b041f9e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhRi9rUVe42r28LWebNy8kOUQQS1J4.rTRtn_RFiscZGwCoOnQr6dGtVwK7fIgG4WIb94Wi9o9bfVAdaMswBK6LMGH7YGMsEi0T2X0Mr5HFeYlevqPGagadQnZ0N4dOG.Pd1XbrhdiCx7lr_T6vcs1ji1z7ipbaeKzM07U18TiDXFTyn3D2XSCBX", "site_full": "www.chennaiclassic.com", "site": "chennaiclassic.com", "site_section": "http://www.chennaiclassic.com/feed/1/posts", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "Chennai  -

Subsequently, Sebi began probing a letter by a whistleblower highlighting alleged corporate governance lapses at the information technology firm during the tenure of its former chief executive officer, Vishal Sikka. \nSikka resigned from the post of CEO in August following differences with some founders of the company, including Murthy. \nThe anonymous letter of the whistleblower alleged that Panaya was bought for over $200 million despite the firm being valued at $162 million during an E-series funding a month prior to the purchase. The letter alleged that the Panaya deal benefitted Hasso Plattner, the co-founder of SAP \u2014 where Sikka was the CTO before joining Infosys in 2014. Plattner had 8.33 per cent stake in Panaya. Venture firm Israel Growth Partners were the series E investors. \nThe letter alleged that the Infosys board failed to see governance issues involved while clearing the Panaya deal and that Bansal\u2019s exit was linked to differences over the Panaya acquisition. \nOn Wednesday, Infosys said its settlement application process is based on the undertaking that it will \u201cneither admit nor deny the finding of fact or conclusion of law\u201d. \nInfosys said it will provide an update \u201cupon the conclusion of the confidential settlement process\u201d.

ILOM is an adapter card in each compute node and storage cell that operates independently of the operating system. The ILOM boots up as soon as power is applied to the server and provides web and SSH access through the management network. Using ILOM you can perform several tasks remotely that would otherwise require physical access to the servers, this includes access to the remote console, attach diag.iso image, power server on and off, and rebooting or resetting the server. Also ILOM monitors the configuration and server internal hardware components. \nIn this article I will demonstrate step by step procedure on how to boot Exadata Compute node with the diagnostic ISO image using Web ILOM Remotely. \n\nSteps to Mount diag.iso On An Exadata Compute Node Using ILOM Console: \nCopy/Download diag.iso to desktop machine You can copy the diag.iso image from a good working compute node or storage cell to the desktop as shown below.

According to the Colombian beauty and mother of one, women need to redirect all their energy to working on themselves and achieving their goals, instead of dedicating all their entire existence to finding a husband. Read what Mrs Ogbonna wrote below\u2026 \u201dThe biggest mistake a woman can do is dedicating her entire existence into \u201cfinding a husband\u201d. My sister, if your every outing is about desperate \u201chusband hunting\u201d\u2013 you need to stop. Redirect ALL THAT energy into working on yourself instead, challenge your capacities, extend your ambitions, work on achieving your goals \u2013 invest into becoming the best possible version of yourself, into becoming a FULFILLED woman who is proud of herself, in love with herself. Find yourself first. And then HE will find YOU.. As A QUEEN ??that you are! I promise you.

And going by the increasing number of companies putting in their nominations, the grand finale this year promises to be a swell event \u2014 the number of entries by companies for the first time has surpassed 500. \nSo, brace up for a plethora of surprises under the watchful gaze of the chief guest, none other than Niti Aayog chief executive officer Amitabh Kant, a major policy wonk and a key driver of a slew of initiatives such as \u2018Make in India\u2019 and \u2018Startup India\u2019 that positioned the country as a leading manufacturing destination. \nTo keep up with the changing times, the Express IT Awards has ushered in some changes in the category of awards. For the first time, the \u2018digital\u2019 category has been introduced as this has become a trending theme for the IT industry countrywide and the rush of nominations too vouch for its popularity. \nHowever, the dominant theme for the Express IT Awards since its inception in 2013 has always been innovation, consistently witnessing the highest number of entries. \nScrutinising the achievements of the companies is no easy task. Over the years, the knowledge partner for the Express IT Awards, PwC, has admirably sifted through the entries to prepare the final shortlist of the jury panel. \nThis year, the panel, comprising Rajan Anandan, Sharad Sharma, S Sadagopan, Ravi Gururaj and Umang Bedi, had the onerous task of deciding the winners who would make the final cut across the nine categories. \nAnd needless to say, the bar is always set high in terms of selecting the winners. In fact, in one particular year, the award was given only in the \u2018silver\u2019 category as nobody could claim stake to the \u2018gold\u2019. In essence, the jury felt that no one came close to the gold standard. \nAt the Express IT Awards, expect nothing short of the best in class IT companies vying for algorithmic supremacy. Apart from behemoths amid past winners, such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Cisco , SAP and IBM , the awards have thrown up hidden gems too. They have given smaller companies the much-needed platform to \u2018Express\u2019 themselves. \nKeeping in line with the ever evolving facet of the Indian IT industry, even the e-commerce space and the software products segments were brought into the fold. The Flipkarts, Olas, Paytms and Oyos and their ilk have rightfully competed and won awards. \nOver the years, the awards have not just recognised technology companies but also the outstanding individuals who made their lifelong contribution to the industry. The portals of these awards have witnessed the presence of doyens of the industry such as NR Narayana Murthy, S Ramadorai, Nandan Nilekani and Ashok Soota. \nThe Express IT Awards also recognises the luminaries of companies who have reported outstanding contribution in a particular year. Past winners in the \u2018Newsmaker\u2019 category are N Chandrasekaran, the then CEO of TCS, Cognizant CEO Francisco D\u2019Souza, Hike founder Kavin Mittal and former Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka. \nThe Express IT Awards also serves as a seminal point for discussion, debate and thought leadership. As Nandan Nilekani had observed in his keynote address: \u201cMuch like the internet and GPS, which were initiated by public spending and resulted in the creation of multi-billion dollar companies, Aadhaar might be able to do the same.\u201d \nLest we forget, the Express IT Awards has always received unstinting support from the government, be it the Centre or the state. As Union IT minister Ravishankar Prasad, who was the chief guest in 2015, elaborating on the government\u2019s digital plans, said, \u201cIndia is waiting for an explosion in IT.\u201d \nFor 2016, the chief guest was the then Union commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman. \u201cIndia\u2019s digital prowess will strengthen the economy. India cannot become a superpower with 50 per cent of the economy running on cash,\u201d she declared. \nCome December 7, once again, the Express IT Awards 2017 will continue with its tradition of honouring the best in technology keeping in line with meritocracy.

It is heartening to note that the RBI has also communicated greater clarity on the liquidity framework indicating that it is ready to deploy both short term and durable tools to absorb or inject liquidity as the need arises,\u201d she said. The RBI has retained the growth forecast at 6.7 per cent for 2017-18 even through the gross value added (GVA) in the second quarter rose to 6.3 per cent. \nDinabandhu Mohapatra, MD & CEO, Bank of India, said, \u201cfor the banking sector as a whole, credit growth is slightly higher than deposit growth, signaling an end to easy liquidity conditions. Taking a cue, some banks increased the rates on wholesale deposits. Both domestic and global growth is on a rising trend. However, higher growth overseas also carries the risks of upward movements in commodity prices, not really good news for a major oil importer like India.\u201d \nAccording to him, the MPC would have probably kept this aspect in mind as well. Moreover, interest rate policy should also ensure that yield generating opportunities available to overseas funds are not wiped out significantly or else there is a risk of fund outflows and a steep rupee depreciation. \n\u201cThe $ 31 billion forward position built up by RBI may be seen as a cushion against such an eventuality. Growth estimates, however, has been kept unchanged. India is now at a juncture where on the real sector, Government is undertaking reform measures while the MPC ensures monetary stability through its rate setting policies,\u201d Mohapatra said. \nBankers welcomed the RBI decision to permit the overseas branches and subsidiaries of Indian banks to refinance external commercial borrowings (ECBs) of \u2018AAA\u2019 rated corporates as well as Navratna and Maharatna public sector units by raising fresh ECBs, stating that the move will help banks to \u201cretain quality good assets\u201d. Currently Indian corporates are permitted to refinance their existing ECBs at a lower all-in-cost. The overseas branches and subsidiaries of Indian banks are not permitted to extend such refinance. \n\u201cThe decision to allow overseas subsidiaries of domestic banks to refinance AAA-rated corporates will provide a fair and just opportunity to banks to book and retain good quality assets,\u201d Kumar said. \nMohapatra said the proposal to rationalize MDR charges and permitting overseas subsidiaries and branches of Indian banks to refinance ECBs of AAA rated/ Navaratna companies are welcome developments.
