Same-sex marriage campaigners and volunteers cheer as they call on politicians to pass marriage equality legislation during rally outside Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017. Gay marriage was e... \nCANBERRA, Australia (AP) - The Latest on Australia's vote to allow same-sex marriage (all times local): \n6:15 p.m. \nFive lawmakers have registered their opposition to Australia's bill allowing same-sex marriage across the nation. \nThe bill passed Thursday by a majority that was not challenged, though the five lawmakers' positions opposing the bill were recorded. \nThe bill changes the definition of marriage from a union between a man and a woman to \"a union of two people.\" \nAfter royal assent and other formalities, the law will likely take effect in about a month. \n___ \n5 p.m. \nThe Australian Parliament has voted to allow same-sex marriage across the nation, following a bitter and divisive debate settled by the government polling voters in a much-criticized ballot survey that strongly endorsed change. \nThe House of Representatives passed the bill to change the definition of marriage from solely between a man and a man to \"a union of two people.\" The votes were not counted because the majority wasn't questioned. \nThe Senate passed the same legislation last week 43 votes to 12. After royal assent and other formalities, the law will likely take effect in about a month, with the first weddings expected about a month later. \nAmendments meant to safeguard freedoms of speech and religion for gay-marriage opponents were all rejected, though those issues may be considered later. \n___ \n3 p.m. \nGay rights advocates have celebrated outside Australia's Parliament House in anticipation of same-sex marriage being legalized within hours. \nScores of men and women joined in singing on Thursday ahead of what is scheduled to be Parliament's final sitting day of the year. \nThe House of Representatives is widely expected to vote to allow same-sex marriage across the nation. \nThe Senate passed the same legislation last week 43 votes to 12. \nThe only potential obstacle to the law passing on Thursday would be if marriage equality opponents managed to amend the legislation. The amended legislation would then have to go back to the Senate for ratification. \nGay marriage was endorsed by 62 percent of Australian voters who responded to a government-commissioned postal ballot last month.

Never miss a local story. Sign up today for unlimited digital access to our website, apps, the digital newspaper and more. SUBSCRIBE NOW \nHis new statement says that \"it is our responsibility to tell Mr. Trump that he is wrong.\" \nHe adds that \"God does not discriminate\" between people of various religions and that \"those who claim divine rights for themselves to physical property on earth are false prophets.\" \n___ \n6 p.m. \nA man holding a Palestinian flag smashed the windows of a kosher restaurant in Amsterdam before being detained by two police officers. \nThe vandalism Thursday came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump enraged the Arab and Muslim worlds by announcing he would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nThe man is captured on video smashing the windows using a white implement before going into the restaurant and then coming out carrying the Palestinian flag and an Israeli flag. \nTwo police officers initially watch him without intervening before subduing him using pepper spray. One of them wrestled him to the ground. \nIn a video statement posted on Twitter, police spokesman Leo Dortland says the suspect was a 29-year-old Amsterdam resident with a temporary residency permit. Dortland did not give the suspect's nationality. \n___ \n5:15 p.m. \nThe Palestinian president says he is rallying international opposition to President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, which he called an \"unacceptable crime.\" \nAt a meeting with Jordan's king, President Mahmoud Abbas said Thursday that he rejects Trump's decision and believes America has hurt its credibility in the region. \nAbbas says the Palestinians have been rallying Arab support as they formulate a response. He says he has been communicating with other world leaders. \n\"Fortunately, there was a positive response from all the countries in the world, from Europe and from Africa and countries close to America that don't support the U.S.,\" he said. \"These all are messages to Trump that what he did is an unacceptable crime.\" \n___ \n4:40 p.m. \nPalestinian officials say dozens of protesters have been lightly wounded in a number of demonstrations in the West Bank. \nClashes broke out Thursday between Israeli forces and Palestinian protesters following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nThe Palestinian Red Crescent says dozens of people have been wounded, mostly from tear gas inhalation. It says six people were wounded by rubber bullets and one person from live fire. The Israeli military denies that live fire was used. \nThe Palestinian Health Ministry says the injuries are all minor. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nAn Israeli city plans to name a park after U.S. President Donald Trump in honor of his decision to declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel and move the embassy there. \nDavid Even Zur, the mayor of the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Yam, calls Trump's move \"historic.\" He says it was \"a brave, unprecedented step which none of his predecessors were prepared to do.\" \n\"Donald Trump proved to the entire world that Jerusalem is in his heart and we will prove to him in this way that he is in our hearts,\" Even Zur said in a statement Thursday. \nThe park, which will include a children's playground and will be located in the city center, is set to be inaugurated next year. \nThe move reflects the positive Israeli response to Trump's declaration, which was widely denounced by Arabs and Muslims. \n___ \n3:30 p.m. \nLebanon's Hezbollah says the U.S. declaration of divided Jerusalem as the capital of Israel has closed all paths to negotiations, calling it a \"treacherous and malicious aggression\" against the rights of Palestinians. \nHassan Fadlallah, the spokesman for the militant group's parliamentary bloc, said Thursday that the U.S. announcement reaffirms that the only way to restore rights is through armed \"resistance.\" \nLebanon is technically at war with Israel. Hezbollah attacks forced Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon in 2000, and the group went to war with Israel again in 2006. \nFadlallah said the decision is likely to have \"catastrophic repercussions\" on regional and international stability, urging Arabs and Muslims to move fast to respond. \nHe said President Donald Trump's decision \"intentionally\" bypassed the United Nations and international resolutions and was a \"rude belittling of the Arab and Muslim worlds' people and states.\" \n___ \n2:55 p.m. \nEU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini says U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is worrying and could send the region back to darker times. \nMogherini said on Thursday that Trump's Jerusalem announcement \"has a very worrying potential impact.\" \nShe says that \"the announcement has the potential to send us backwards to even darker times than the one we are already living in.\" \nMogherini called for calm and appealed for the \"the status quo of the holy places\" in Jerusalem to be preserved. \nShe also warned that Trump's \"move could diminish the potential role that the United States could play in the region and create more confusion around this.\" \n___ 2:50 p.m. \nThe Russian Foreign Ministry has expressed concern about the U.S. administration's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and warned that it could destabilize the region. \nThe ministry reaffirmed Moscow's view that the status of Jerusalem could only be settled through talks between the Palestinians and Israel in line with the United Nations resolutions. \nIn a statement released on Thursday, it said that the U.S. move has caused a \"serious concern\" in Moscow. \nIt said that \"a new U.S. position on Jerusalem risks exacerbating the situation in Palestinian-Israeli relations and in the region as a whole.\" The ministry called on all parties involved to \"show restraint and refrain from actions fraught with dangerous and uncontrollable consequences.\" \n___ \n2:40 p.m. \nHundreds of Islamists have rallied in major cities across Pakistan, condemning President Donald Trump for declaring the city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nThe demonstrators dispersed peacefully after Thursday's rallies in the capital, Islamabad. Similar anti-U.S. rallies were also held in Karachi, the country's largest city, and in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, as well as in the city of Multan in Punjab province. \nThe rallies came a day after Trump's announcement angered the Muslims across the world. Islamabad has asked the United States to reconsider any move that alters the legal and historical status of Jerusalem. \nMuslim-majority Pakistan has already reiterated its support for the Palestinians, who claim east Jerusalem as the capital of their hoped-for state \n___ \n1:45 p.m. \nThe al-Qaida-linked extremist group al-Shabab is urging Muslims to take up weapons in response to President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nThe group's spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud says it calls \"on all Muslims to raise arms and defend the blessed al-Aqsa from the Zionist occupiers supported by America, because what was taken by force can only be restored by force.\" \nHis message was carried by the Somalia-based group's news agency. \nAl-Shabab, the deadliest Islamic extremist group in Africa, calls the U.S. decision on Jerusalem as \"evidence of an escalation in its aggression against Islam and Muslims.\" \nAl-Shabab was blamed for the massive truck bombing in Mogadishu in October that killed more than 500 people and was one of the world's deadliest attacks since 9/11. \n___ \n1:15 p.m. \nHundreds of Palestinians are protesting in cities across the West Bank and Gaza Strip against President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nThe demonstrators are burning posters of Trump and of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as American and Israeli flags. Clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian protesters were reported at several locations. \nRallies were underway on Thursday in the West Bank cities of Hebron, Ramallah, Nablus, Jenin and Bethlehem. A demonstration was also being held outside the Damascus Gate of Jerusalem's Old City. \nPalestinians have called a general strike on Thursday and are preparing for more mass protests on Friday. \n___ \n1 p.m. \nThe Afghan Taliban have denounced the U.S. administration's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital as a \"reckless step\" and say President Donald Trump's decision will \"fan the flames conflict in the entire world especially the Middle East. \nA Taliban statement to the media on Thursday says that with the decision, America exposed its \"colonialist face and declared enmity toward Islam as well as support for policy of occupation and colonization of Muslim lands.\" \nThe statement also called on Muslims world over and Islamic countries to back the \"oppressed Palestinian nation.\" \nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani, meanwhile, says his government is \"deeply concerned\" over Trump's move which \"hurts the sentiments of the entire Islamic world.\" \n___ \n12:45 p.m. \nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has responded to criticism over President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital by saying that he U.S. president is merely recognizing reality. \nTillerson defended Trump's move on the sidelines of an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe conference in Vienna. Foreign ministers from the OSCE nations are roundly condemning the decision. \nTillerson says the United States would still support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \"if that's the desire of the two parties.\" He says Jerusalem's final status is still for Israelis and Palestinians to workout. \nTillerson says \"the whole world\" wants a peace process and the U.S. still believes there's an opportunity. \n___ \n12:40 p.m. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron says he disapproves of the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, calling it a \"unilateral decision.\" \nHe says the status of Jerusalem should be part of an international decision between Israel and the Palestinians. Macron spoke to reporters in Qatar on Thursday, during a one-day visit to the country. \nMacron says: \"I don't share in this decision, and I disapprove.\" He added that France remains attached to \"a solution of two states, Israeli and Palestinian, with Jerusalem as the capital for both of them.\" \nHe also stressed that the \"question of Jerusalem is a question of international security. The solution can only be found via negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians under the aegis of the U.N.\" \n___ \n11:45 a.m. \nIraq's government has decried the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, calling it \"unjust\" and urging the United States to revoke it. \nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in a statement on Thursday warned of \"dangerous consequences\" for the region's stability and the world. \nHe says the U.S. should \"retreat from that decision in order to stop a dangerous escalation that leads to extremism and creates an atmosphere which helps terrorism.\" \nMeanwhile, hundreds of Iraqis are gathering in Baghdad to protest President Donald Trump's move. \nThe protest leader, Abdul-Latif al-Himaim from Iraq's Sunni Religious Endowments, told the protesters: \"Jerusalem is our identity, Jerusalem is Arab.\" \nHe says: \"You can uproot a palm tree from a grove, but you will not be able to uproot Jerusalem from our hearts and from Palestine.\" \nIraq is a key U.S. ally in the region, with more than 5,000 American troops remaining in Iraq, according to Pentagon. With the backing of the U.S.-led coalition, Iraqi forces have retaken nearly all territory held by the Islamic State group since 2014. \n___ \n11:35 a.m. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says President Donald Trump \"bound himself forever\" to the history of Jerusalem by recognizing the city as Israel's capital. \nNetanyahu claimed other states are considering following the U.S. lead and recognizing Jerusalem. He spoke on Thursday at the Foreign Ministry. \nNetanyahu says that \"we are already in contact with other states that will make a similar recognition.\" \nHe says the \"time has come\" and expressed confidence that others will follow suit and move their embassies to Jerusalem. \nMeanwhile, the Israeli military said it will be deploying additional troops to the West Bank ahead of Friday, when mass Palestinian protests are anticipated in response to Trump's move. \nThe army statement on Thursday says it will deploy several battalions to the territory while other troops have been put on alert to address \"possible developments.\" \nPalestinians went on strike across the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip on Thursday and protests are expected on Friday after midday prayers. \n___ \n11:25 a.m. \nThe top leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas is calling for a new uprising against Israel in the wake of President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nIsmail Haniyeh spoke to his followers in the Gaza Strip on Thursday and called the U.S. decision an \"aggression on our people and a war on our sanctuaries.\" \nHe says the uprising should begin Friday, the Muslim holy day. \nHaniyeh then added: \"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision.\" \nHamas killed hundreds of Israelis during an armed uprising in the early 2000s. But Hamas' ability to carry out attacks is more limited. Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, and many of Hamas' supporters in the West Bank have been arrested. \nEven so, Hamas possesses a large arsenal of rockets in Gaza capable of striking many areas in Israel. \n___ \n10:30 a.m. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, are condemning the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nIt's a rare public rebuke by the royal court of U.S. ally and President Donald Trump. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. \n___ \n9:40 a.m. \nSchools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nErdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nErdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nErdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nPalestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdullah ii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king salman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammad bin salman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:56.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "445a21e629ec22548efa02dd7d5fed2a2e468619", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ29wS.q06hQvdJ7ZqjKQJPMkjemGmEU7ZHPY7wuFl4G5l5J8x36kDrUub.LFcr2pk_.p0IbE9dkAVUQ4W2IIitY4Uxdw_paE9xs4Slh6_Iyg--", "site_full": "tvmbreakingnews.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Stable 8.0 Oreo (VoLTE) LineageOS 15 on Redmi Note 4 | Fog News", "title_full": "Stable 8.0 Oreo (VoLTE) LineageOS 15 on Redmi Note 4 | Fog News", "published": "2017-12-07T03:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IL", "spam_score": 0.028, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "445a21e629ec22548efa02dd7d5fed2a2e468619", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ29wS.q06hQvdJ7ZqjKQJPMkjemGmEU7ZHPY7wuFl4G5l5J8x36kDrUub.LFcr2pk_.p0IbE9dkAVUQ4W2IIitY4Uxdw_paE9xs4Slh6_Iyg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Photo News", "published": "2017-12-07T03:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "Stable 8.0 Oreo (VoLTE) LineageOS 15 on Redmi Note 4 | Fog News", "text": "Stable 8.0 Oreo (VoLTE) LineageOS 15 on Redmi Note 4 Stable 8.0 Oreo (VoLTE) LineageOS 15 on Redmi Note 4 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:56.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e915220466b7711a554027dc61b9c0004cba74d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm2HvjNxdW3sNFjNMXIpiwXc", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=stanford", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "stanford News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "Former Stanford student files appeal in --- assault conviction Video - ABC News", "title_full": "Former Stanford student files appeal in --- assault conviction Video - ABC News : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-12-04T00:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e915220466b7711a554027dc61b9c0004cba74d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm2HvjNxdW3sNFjNMXIpiwXc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABC News", "published": "2017-12-04T00:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Former Stanford student files appeal in --- assault conviction Video - ABC News", "text": "Adrienne, thank you.

No one could do such a thing unless his moral nature was completely warped. To such a person the fundamental distinctions between good and evil were completely obliterated. They were blind to the core and there was no hope of repentance. No ordinary appeal could reach such a person. For to him good seemed evil and evil seemed good. The possibility of winning him back is practically gone; hence, he is beyond the hope of forgiveness, because in a spiritual sense, God had \u201cabandoned\u201d him (\u201cgave them over,\u201d Rom. 1:24, 26, 28) to the doom of their own sinful nature. Here the person places himself beyond the possibility of attaining to that state of mind which is the essential condition for divine forgiveness. \nIn essence, what is the unpardonable sin? It is \u201cunbelief.\u201d  This is the one sin that sends people to hell.  Jesus said, \u201c Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not  believed in the name of the only Son of God.\u201d \n\nIt is important to note that the prerogative to not forgive a particular sin is God\u2019s choosing, not ours. All sin is against God (Psalm 51:4).  But it is also important to note that God does not forgive all sin, for the unpardonable sin is a prime example. \n\nMoreover, never ever think that you have committed the unpardonable sin (the sin of unbelief) in this life time. You can be forgiven by repenting of your sin and putting your faith and trust in Christ no matter what you have done. Only God knows who has crossed the line of no return.

Neither appearance survives, even as audio off air unless someone's holding out on us.\nI do wonder if ABKCO would have the backing tracks from the 1967 London Palladium which was an ITV broadcast. Is it the case that the band recorded the instrumental tracks at Olympic and for the broadcast Mick did a live vocal ? Unfortunately we have little idea exactly what ABKCO have in their archives in terms of \"non-core\" studio work.\nI think the only fully live UK TV that survives in visual and audio from the Jones / Decca era is the Arthur Haynes Show from early 1964 (I Wanna Be Your Man and You Better Move On) and the two NME Pollwinners Shows though strictly speaking they weren't TV appearances as such. That might be it ??\nI forget if any of the surviving Ready Steady Go's feature true live performances, possibly one or two. Restored versions of those shows are well overdue in any format.

It is named as inattentive forms when inattention, disorganization and distraction emerge.\n\nImpulsive and hyperactive are identified by symptoms that included impulsiveness and hyperactivity in which it disappears as the result of growth. In association with that, the third division is characterized by combined symptoms of aforementioned types and is known as combined disorders. If you deal with that disorder, certain difficulties about your normal actions and functions together with communication are faced, hence ADHD Dallas coaching is suggested.\n\nIf left unresolved, it interrupts with your daily routines and educational tasks along with social, emotional, and interpersonal growth. Amid other situations, particular medicaments aid in sustaining your core within the shortest period. Currently, there are minimal statements proving that it alleviates relationships, behavioral issues, and educational achievements, yet it can result in different concerns.\n\nApart from that, its drawbacks pertained to major irritability, insomnia, and loss of appetite which lead to more intricate difficulties. Skilled specialists cited that those techniques are not effective in treating that disorder which elucidates behavioral and emotional difficulties. Other persons could deal with drastic improvements, still others would deal with pain during carrying out those medicaments.\n\nAs consumers, its indications may differ which surpass the profits offered by those methods and since each feedback differed, searching for effective treatments can require longer periods. Next, its highlight to be incorporated with other kinds of medicaments resulted in better effectiveness. It can require close supervision for it entails more innovated methods altogether with drinking prescriptions.\n\nIt was the responsibility of practitioners to adapt dosage, monitor side effects, and document records. But it is not closely documented, its efficiency are disturbed and limited which cause more intricate issues. Despite its incapability to resolve those conditions, discussions with practitioners is needed to outline schemes for entirely stopping your treatments.\n\nAs guardians, you may influence their medicaments, and studies indicated that healthy guides, exercise routines, and smart choices are the main steps to manage its various indicators. Because of this, it was indicated that safe medications start inside your homes with administration. In relation with that, exercise routines are named as the easiest and most sufficient mediums in reducing those aspects.\n\nAside from that, other physical ventures are filled with the capacity to boost your norepinephrine, dopamine, and brain serotonin stages which boost your thorough concentration. Specific exercise programs and medications can function in similar manners. Yet in comparison to those treatments, trainings failed to ask for drugs which eradicate the existence of different negative impacts.\n\nLikewise, programs that centralize on physical factors that included gymnastics, skateboarding, dance lessons, and martial arts are vital if you deal with difficulties associated with your sleeping practices. Searching for capable specialists and known medical institutions that match your conditions, preferences, and demands is highly suggested. As the result, it could assure better phases of relief, ease, and comfort that originated from its sufficient ends.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can get a summary of the things to consider before picking an ADHD Dallas treatment option at http://www.familycareclinicforadhd.com/family-practice-arlington.html right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael lee   generally", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "dallas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:58.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "20b5266875bc6ce72901d47e67c884d645eae07f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB54N.xO2X_.aKQo16CDEGGJ29o7mvfjk6njNc4I91_oPOFXGF5lkFqjqhFty5ay9PZMKGjKm6fbfLIpfq5VVrS.mwHZY2hrgX.L3I6V8sZgqw--", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "The Rolling Stones On Air In The Sixties Book and Album | Page 30", "title_full": "The Rolling Stones On Air In The Sixties Book and Album | Page 30 | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-12-05T20:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/26/26008.jpg?1382708821", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a14d8743700e4444191ded796815996dfe96eacf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB54N.xO2X_.aKQo16CDEGGJ29o7mvfjk6njNc4I91_oPOFXGF5lkFqjqhFty5ay9PZMKGjKm6fbfLIpfq5VVrS.mwHZY2hrgX9L2GQUudUfe0gywKMQ.y3j", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "ash1", "published": "2017-12-06T17:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "TonyCzar said: \u2191 Has anyone discussed the post-1965 content in the CD booklet? Booklet photos and graphics (and one photo? What the heck?) kinda imply we're going to 1969. But, no.\nI'd just like to go to 1967 to get a clean 'London Palladium' 1967 performance of \"It's all Over Now\". Or were the TV appearances not strictly \"BBC\"? Click to expand... Not sure why there should be any post-65 content in the booklet given what's on the cd.\nIn terms of TV appearances, the band only made 2 fully live BBC TV appearances as far as I'm aware - Top Beat April 27 1964 (performed on TV after the BBC radio concert but with a different setlist) and Open House on May 9th 1964. Neither appearance survives, even as audio off air unless someone's holding out on us.\nI do wonder if ABKCO would have the backing tracks from the 1967 London Palladium which was an ITV broadcast. Is it the case that the band recorded the instrumental tracks at Olympic and for the broadcast Mick did a live vocal ? Unfortunately we have little idea exactly what ABKCO have in their archives in terms of \"non-core\" studio work.\nI think the only fully live UK TV that survives in visual and audio from the Jones / Decca era is the Arthur Haynes Show from early 1964 (I Wanna Be Your Man and You Better Move On) and the two NME Pollwinners Shows though strictly speaking they weren't TV appearances as such. That might be it ??\nI forget if any of the surviving Ready Steady Go's feature true live performances, possibly one or two. Restored versions of those shows are well overdue in any format.

I was skeptical that it was actually from the Joe Loss Pop Show and not the Saturday Club performance from three days later, but after comparing the two, it's clear they are different. Not just the audience, which could be faked, but it is indeed a different performance. I wonder how Ass Blaster missed this?\nThanks for your other info about the missing tracks. Click to expand... You're welcome. I'm pretty up to speed BBC-wise but I didn't know about that extra Joe Loss track till a couple of days ago when a kind chap called Alex pointed it out to me so I'm not surprised Ass Blaster missed it. All these grey market / boot cds tend to have the same old stuff so unless you buy and play them all, something like this can slip through the net pretty easily. Funnily enough, the chaps at Ass Blaster missed the Joe Loss tracks by Cream on their otherwise magnificent Cream BBC set. As some wag pointed out, maybe it was because the set needed to be \"Loss-less\".\nMuch as we're complaining about issues with this Stones set, it's way better than the official Cream and Hollies sets in my opinion. The Hollies set has some seriously excruciating intro / outro edits to remove Brian Bathtubes banter and the net result is that Bobby Elliott sounds like he can't start or end a song in time when in fact he was one of the great 60's drummers. It's a shame that collectors have to rely on someone / some people / some \"thing\" (?) like Ass Blaster to get it (almost 100% !) right. Mr (or Mrs) Blaster should be working for Universal who now appear to own all the music in the entire known Universe as it may exist from time to time.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:59.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "71c6c57e35b3ac2e3ee8e953506c3bac98adf428", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8h7fMZ_93nh4MmlO3MqhpNH6lYHRJ5OXomT5VT6_RmyE2Wes1LHxYqj3v0Kucv_KW1PxrQd65AiENSkn67pM383IVvdM5Jc7yOMGZ9qFZ_5Ez02LCPeT24owucfPIOASCbTezJH8j2Q--", "site_full": "www.honestjohn.co.uk", "site": "honestjohn.co.uk", "site_section": "http://classics.honestjohn.co.uk/askhj/rss", "site_categories": ["buying_selling_cars", "vehicles"], "section_title": "Ask Honest John - Latest Questions", "title": "Does my motorcycle qualify for the 40 year tax exemption?", "title_full": "Does my motorcycle qualify for the 40 year tax exemption?", "published": "2017-12-06T16:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20125, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "71c6c57e35b3ac2e3ee8e953506c3bac98adf428", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8h7fMZ_93nh4MmlO3MqhpNH6lYHRJ5OXomT5VT6_RmyE2Wes1LHxYqj3v0Kucv_KW1PxrQd65AiENSkn67pM383IVvdM5Jc7yOMGZ9qFZ_5Ez02LCPeT24owucfPIOASCbTezJH8j2Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T16:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "Does my motorcycle qualify for the 40 year tax exemption?", "text": "  Does my motorcycle qualify for the 40 year tax exemption? My motorcycle was registered in February 1977, do I still have to pay road tax? Asked on 6 December 2017 by graham dyson Answered by Keith Moody Currently, to qualify for historic vehicle exemption, you'll need to prove that your motorbike was built (not registered) before 1 January, 1977. If it was not built before this date, you'll need to wait until the exemption ticks over to vehicles built before 1 January, 1978 - this comes into effect on 1 April, 2018. Remember, your vehicle won't automatically become tax exempt - you'll need to fill in a form.

My son wants to buy a classic car in Morocco and drive it home to the UK - what are the pitfalls of him doing this? My son is a student on a year abroad in Morocco. He's fallen in love with an ancient Renault 4 (left hand drive). He wants to buy it and drive it home to the UK. What are the pitfalls of him doing this? Asked on 5 December 2017 by Liz Answered by Keith Moody If he's serious, he'll need to do some planning - stops for fuel, food, and rest are essential. He'll also need to stock up on spares and make sure the car is in good nick. There'll be additional travel costs too - a ferry over to Spain and then a crossing from France to the UK.

Then youll see who your senior is and hopefully learn some respect SON. Quote: Go to Page Top whatnameshouldi Guest\n10 Lets compare :) Mar 15th 2010, 3:49pm\nHere are the war declarations so far (LAW's, though it isnt the official one for the bashing rule also included as has been long discussed). Just for the sake of having all of them in one post and comparing:\nQuote: : Hello, my name is Thoin and I'm the diplomat of CKA.\nCitizens of Gamma, today I bring to you A DECLARED WAR !!!\nOh how it will be fun for us all!\nAs diplo of CKA yadda yadda yadda, we hereby declare war against LAW.\nreasoning:\nLAW-CKA relations never really recovered after the last little tiff we had going is a big part I suppose. Outside of that, our warriors have been starved for pillaged goods combined with this weeks diplomatic situation involving both alliances and you get a near war state. We started out having a few fun volleys and skirmishes, pretty minor kinda like last time. But I've heard through the grape vine (by quantity it would qualify as a vineyard) that LAW want to lay into us full force now. How Fun! We can play that game too. With that in mind, although trash talk and CRs and calling into question someone elses internet-manliness are all good fun parts of war, they have their limits and a :cenzored: throwing match isn't much fun at all.\n...oh yeah, and Barron turned me into a newt.\nEven though we're pillaging each other dry and making people cry all the way back to their wings, there's no reason we can't be civil.\nAnd with that ends the Pre-amble...ON TO THE CONDITION OF WAR.\nWe have very few stipulations here:\nWar will end when:\n1) A 30 day limit is reached. This is subject to change should we be having too much fun and re-declaring, as always, is an option.\n2) All former THR members are shown the door from LAW\n3) LAW is no longer the #1 alliance on gamma (this is just tradition)\n4) LAW permits myself (Thoin), Pyra_Cantha, High Voltage, and any other willing CKA member to collaborate and create a tasteful external page for them which will be posted for no less than 72 hours.\n5) LAW merges with THR creating Lawthril (TAR), the uber-#1 alliance. At this point, the current war will end and a new one will emerge along the same lines as WW2\n6) We feel like it\n7) (this is the part where the fans can have a bit of a laugh and fill their own out and then later be disappointed when we don't follow them)\nGood luck to all, lets hurt people.\nPS: FTLAW and other LAW wings are also going to be hit; none of this feeding business.\nQuote: : It takes a while for our voting to get done so I'd put together our declaration because votes for war were >70% here it is:-\nLAW vs CKA\nOh HAI!\nHave you seen them?\nThe moose are loose!\nThey keep coming into our towns and eating our res\nWe know who to blame.... CANADA!\nWell, we're gonna sort out why these moose are loose, and we're not gonna stop until they are all under control.\nLAW will be performing compulsory inspections of all CKA farms, removing res for sampling to see if this is why the moose are not staying in their homes. This \u201cWarrant for Analysing Resources\u201d (henceforth known as \u201cWAR\u201d) will be enforced with very sharp sticks.\nWAR will be rescinded if any of the following conditions are met:-\nCKA change their name to \u201cWhere's my Moose, eh?\u201d\nPyra_Cantha posts a video on YouTube singing Monty Python's Lumberjack song.\nIkariam v0.3.3 is released\n4 weeks have passed from this post.\nGood luck!\n(Hey guise! Why the long face???)\nQuote: : I DoomDrake (300s Leader) am declairing war on LAW.\nReasonings:\n1 - 300 has been looking for a good war for awhile and since CKA has declaired 300 has disolved our treaty with LAW and decided to join in on the fun.\n2 - LAW has been absorbing many many players to include 300 enemys from THR which was a touchy issue when it happened. LAW has been on the sidlines for many of the recent wars and I believe its time to allow the players they took from everyone to run once again to hide in new alliances.\n3 - 300 members are hungry for easy unprotected goods which LAW seems very willing to provide.\nWar ending stipulations :\n1 - LAW disbans (not likly)\n2 - LAW losses 1/2 of there members to other alliances, not sending them to sub alliances to end it.\n3 - LAW drops to at least 3rd Rank on the alliance leaderboards\nGood luck to all involved and lets have some clean good old fun.\nNOTE : All LAW wings are free game also but we wont be declairing on them unless totaly nessacary.\nTerm has already drawn his conlussions from this, so ill leave you to think it over too. Just a thing 300, if you are joining an ongoing war that is about fun you should at least respect the current situation and go on with the set mood about it. That's all.\nGood luck to all\nFed\nP.S.: Quote: : See, Brasco has the right idea.\nThe reason THR is brought up twice i believe in the declaration is because of how many refugees went to LAW and as a bit of humour. we don't actually care about THR in the slightest, we just care about having a good laugh.\nEdit: I posted this one while Doom was answering, so te be fair dont consider it an answer to his but for all the previous ones. Yep, i was sniped Quote: Go to Page Top 1ShaGGy1 Guest\n11 RE: Lets compare :) Mar 15th 2010, 5:23pm\nTerm has already drawn his conlussions from this, so ill leave you to think it over too. Just a thing 300, if you are joining an ongoing war that is about fun you should at least respect the current situation and go on with the set mood about it. That's all. To be honest, most of LAW guys forgot about the CKA war in the past couple of hours and turned against 300. So, it is not kinda they have 2 wars ongoing. It is more like, they have one war with 300 and CKA is using that advantage and is biting their meat, slice by slice.\nIt was funny tho, in the first couple of hours of this declaration. It was looking like a double penetration :wth:\nVerbal Warning : 5:C Immoral content\nPlease read board rules again.. board rules\n~~PrincessKari Quote: Go to Page Top Slash Guest\n12 Mar 15th 2010, 10:50pm\nmost LAW guys forgot about us?\ntell that to the CR that should be coming in soon that is still going, started on saturday night (in eastern Canada anyway), has lasted more than 115 rounds and is 17 LAW members vs 6 CKA.\nThe reason we at CKA declared and are conducting ourselves in a way that we see as mutually fun is because that's just the way we feel like fighting. 300 are under no obligation to follow our lead on the way we conduct wars.

But again, that is for them to freely decide. Ill keep the good mood as i did until now.\nGood fight,\nFed Quote: Go to Page Top Pyra_Cantha Guest\n14 Mar 16th 2010, 4:08pm\nWow, what a great birthday gift doom, thank you very much.\nIn 300's defense there is no reason to drill them for joining an ongoing war, CKA never approached them (that I know of) asking if they would like to declare war on law at the same time. Quote: Go to Page Top DoomDrake Guest\n15 Mar 16th 2010, 4:35pm\nNeedless to say when 300 started talking about the CKA vs LAW war we had a large number of people wanting to fight also. The only question was what side to fight. A quick poll helped to decide that and here we are. Quote: Go to Page Top Brasco Guest\n16 Mar 16th 2010, 8:43pm\nI think most alliances have been feeling a bit bored, and it is good to have a decent size war going on. If the options were LAW + 300 v CKA or LAW v CKA + 300 then I think what you have voted for is the fairer of the two. CKA have some good warriors, but I really don't think they'd have much fun being so outnumbered.\nIt's been a good war so far, lots of tactical skirmishes, getting lots of good experience with the navies and now a battle that's at about 180 rounds (and no bugs!! )\n:rockon: Quote: Go to Page Top 1ShaGGy1 Guest\n17 Mar 16th 2010, 8:53pm\nQuote: : I think most alliances have been feeling a bit bored, and it is good to have a decent size war going on.

We all know what he did for us. He's got pace, power, he can score goals, it's as simple as that.\" \nSaturday's clash at Turf Moor sees the Premier League's two surprise packages so far go head-to-head. \nWhile Burnley have made a flying start to the campaign, with 25 points collected so far, Ward believes there is still more to come over the next 23 games, although the first target remains collecting a further 15 points to nudge the Clarets past that mark of 40 for safety. \n\"We're very pleased with the start but we know that we can still get better and play better,\" Ward said. \n\"It's like that with every team, you always think there's more to come. That's why we work so hard every day on the training pitch, to try and nudge ourselves that little bit higher and get better at more things. \n\"We'll keep doing that, we'll keep working hard, we've not come here and been turned over in a bad manner. We've given everything and given a good performance and we were probably a little bit unlucky not to come away with something. \n\"We need to keep it going. There are no easy games in this league. We've got Watford to come and they got a good result against Tottenham. They're a very creative side and it'll be another test for us. We'll go in to it head on as we always do. \n\"It's great but first and foremost we'll look to get to 40 points and then we'll set ourselves a new goal. That's always the way with our manager - get the next points on the board as quickly as possible and that's what we'll look to do against Watford next week.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephen ward", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gray", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ward", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "andre gray", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "claret andre gray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean dyche", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "watford", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brentford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turf moor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "premier league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burnley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tottenham", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "burnley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vicarage road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east lancashire", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:01.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe3cda730591c88dda89b81500899fb6ebf441d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFTYhNWHVqlgIbbuTBVRa.mt32QOzVC3dC6KbWhyoGxlwSaTO1YY8IzVDer3libG_t", "site_full": "community.babycentre.co.uk", "site": "babycentre.co.uk", "site_section": "http://community.babycentre.co.uk/groups/a3886135/first_trimester_rainbows&rlogin=failure", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "First Trimester Rainbows - BabyCentre", "title": "Baby clothes shrinking - BabyCentre", "title_full": "Baby clothes shrinking - BabyCentre", "published": "2017-12-07T13:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://community.babycentre.co.uk/img/bclub/birthclub_logo_baby_5.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8006, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fe3cda730591c88dda89b81500899fb6ebf441d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFTYhNWHVqlgIbbuTBVRa.mt32QOzVC3dC6KbWhyoGxlwSaTO1YY8IzVDer3libG_t", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AmyK1569", "published": "2017-12-07T13:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "Baby clothes shrinking - BabyCentre", "text": "Has anyone else found that their baby's clothes shrink in the dryer?\nMy LO (little one) is in 6-9 month clothes and is about 66cm long.

X Garden shed becomes top TripAdvisor London restaurant after fake reviews Prankster fools ratings site with fake web page, fake food and fake reviews 16 minutes ago \nA screen grab of the TripAdvisor page for The Shed at Dulwich A garden shed became the top-rated restaurant on TripAdvisor after a writer tricked the popular review site by submitting fake reviews. Oobah Butler , who writes for Vice , created the fake restaurant in his garden by setting up a website with photographs of food, which were in fact made from shaving foam, bleach and extra texture provided by using his bare foot as a backdrop. He based his meals on moods in a bid to set it apart from other restaurants. Mr Butler, who said he had previously written fake reviews for TripAdvisor for #10 each, posted on his own website: \u201cAn appointment-only restaurant located in south London, The Shed has been operating privately for years. \u201cIn 2017, it decided to open its doors. As of November that year, it was TripAdvisor\u2019s top-rated restaurant in London.\u201d He bought a mobile phone and registered the number as the restaurant\u2019s while refusing to give an address as it was \u201cappointment-only\u201d, enlisting the help of friends to meet people nearby and guide them to the premises. Trip Advisor's no 1 restaurant in London that wasn't. Welcome to the Shed, Dulwich (or as I described it when they first got in touch, the second best shed based eating experience, after my own, natch.) A brilliantly executed piece of work. https://t.co/AfLF7cs5EK \u2014 Jay Rayner (@jayrayner1) December 6, 2017 The restaurant slowly climbed the rankings on the back of reviews from friends. Guardian restaurant critic Jay Rayner even tweeted: \u201cAt last: a restaurant that recognises food is all about mood. \u201cOf all the shed-based eating experiences out there this one sounds like the best. \u201cOr at least second best. (I have my own shed, hence). Personally I\u2019m keen to try \u2018contemplation\u2019.\u201d Mr Butler writes in his article: \u201cI realise what it is: the appointments, lack of address and general exclusivity of this place is so alluring that people can\u2019t see sense. They\u2019re looking at photos of the sole of my foot, drooling. Over the coming months, The Shed\u2019s phone rings incessantly.\u201d After his restaurant made it to number one, he held a special event for guests at which he served, for free, heated ready meals from a discount supermarket. On leaving, one couple asked if their attendance would allow them preferential bookings in future. Mr Butler concluded: \u201cSo there we go: I invited people into a hastily-assembled collection of chairs outside my shed, and they left thinking it really could be the best restaurant in London, just on the basis of a TripAdvisor rating.\u201d TripAdvisor said in a statement: \u201cGenerally, the only people who create fake restaurant listings are journalists in misguided attempts to test us. \u201cAs there is no incentive for anyone in the real world to create a fake restaurant it is not a problem we experience with our regular community, therefore this \u2018test\u2019 is not a real world example.\u201d \u2013 PA ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "oobah butler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay rayner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "butler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tripadvisor london", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tripadvisor", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dulwich", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:01.033+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "efe25de63e374b585f5f6f884d8030062727abc5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz_2WCFUvvxVUHwbOHKl3RovuqtFCAHMileTzLAILdV_usofWuGVFo3CAx52Y5iCe3UROiYjorRl8zC57DBJK1vbm6YZ4dHkdo-", "site_full": "freekabalance.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://freekabalance.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Ka Balance", "title": "Women Clothing (Biba,HRX & More)", "title_full": "Women Clothing (Biba,HRX & More)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "efe25de63e374b585f5f6f884d8030062727abc5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz_2WCFUvvxVUHwbOHKl3RovuqtFCAHMileTzLAILdV_usofWuGVFo3CAx52Y5iCe3UROiYjorRl8zC57DBJK1vbm6YZ4dHkdo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Freekabalance Blog (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "Women Clothing (Biba,HRX & More)", "text": "\n\nFlipkart has Women Clothing (Biba,HRX & More) on sale for Min 80% Off .\nHow to get this deal Click Grab the deal button Add the Product of your Choice to cart No Coupon Code required Make Payment  \nDetails Get Min 80% Off On Women Clothing (Biba,HRX & More) Shipping Charges may vary \n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "biba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flipkart", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:01.047+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "484a59a52de1ae219e9f3babd2aec8e4f7489825", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog669nc0y8UFH_Jf1oX8QNCaYzYY7xsapGd16coXeGNSUY90M1nJmb63Dy1JaJumVUDyZUUp7w1KJGss46qwTnKzSw2_tl_6ut2v6q6Dw8tE3EFGlATeLvDfOHuNzwrw4tpg--", "site_full": "community.myfitnesspal.com", "site": "myfitnesspal.com", "site_section": "http://community.myfitnesspal.com/en/categories/fun-games", "site_categories": ["health", "exercise"], "section_title": "Fun &amp; Games \u2014 MyFitnessPal.com", "title": "Have YOU ever crushed on the poster above??

I think he was playing his best football since he arrived and was full of confidence.

However I don't think it's a huge blow. \nIf Brady will be missing from the team for a while, it's a massive opportunity for the fringe players such as Scot Arfield.
