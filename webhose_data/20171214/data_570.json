Reduce stress, this helps for a quicker recovery.Recommended by Veterinarians.Alternative to Cone Collars. I have a cat who has been obsessively licking her side to the point of baldness. I bought this as an alternative to the cone of shame. Similar thoughts to what other reviewers have expressed - the neck hole seemed a bit snug at first but it fits her fine. She's kind of confused by the whole thing still - she's walking around and shaking her legs every few steps - I don't think she likes that the leg holes are pretty form fitted (i.e. she can feel them rubbing when she walks). But it fits well and serves it's purpose so far - which is to stop the obsessive grooming. I'm hopeful that she'll figure it out and get used to it.She's 13\" from neck to tail base, 10 lbs. I bought the XXS and it fits her well. I had a heck of a time figuring out what size to go with based just on back length - I would've liked to have seen a weight component on their fitting guide too just to have both values. I went ahead and made a table of all of the values people had been kind enough to put here in their reviews regarding what they ordered for their pets and how it fit. Hopefully other people find it useful! ByAsundran - April 20, 2015 When my two kittens got spayed at the same time, I knew the recovery time was going to be a pain, but I didn't realize just how much of one. They came home in soft cones from the vet's office, but even the XS size was huge on my babies and they were tripping over them when doing anything other than basic walking, and especially had trouble using the litter box, resulting in me cleaning up poop several times that first day. In addition, while the cones kept them from licking/worrying at their suture sites, it did not offer any protection for when they wrestled and kicked each other in the stomach, which of course they wanted to do all day, because it's one of their favorite activities.So I got on Amazon to see if there was any better solution and these suits were one of the first hits! The adorable model kitten caught my eye, but the price made me hesitate. If these really worked, they would be worth the outlay (I had to buy two, after all), but if they didn't, that was kind of a hefty price to write off. So I read the reviews, looked at a couple other similar type suits, and came back here and decided to give it a go. The main thing in this item's favor over the other suits I saw was that it has Prime next-day delivery. I wanted these as soon as possible! My kittens were about three months old and weighed about four pounds, and were about 11.5-12 inches from nape to tailbone (hard to measure a wriggling kitten), so I ordered two of the XXXS suits, hoping they would fit.Just one day of trying to keep an eye on them and deal with all this was exhausting, and the thought of doing it for two weeks until they had their stitches out seemed impossible, especially since that first day I just happened to have off from work, but the day after I would be back at work full time and my wife would be taking care of the two kittens alone. Thankfully, with the Prime shipping, the suits arrived mid-afternoon and we were able to get the kittens suited up. They were surprisingly easy to get on, though it was definitely better to do it with two people.At first the kittens just flopped over and refused to move, but soon they were able to walk around, although awkwardly. They also were able to use the litterbox with no problems, which was a huge relief. Over the next few days the kittens got more and more used to the suits and while they never loved them (I didn't expect them to), within just a day or so they were at normal activity level and were able to run and jump freely (which they shouldn't have been doing since they'd just had surgery, but you try telling a kitten that). They were also able to wrestle without me worrying they were going to tear each other's stitches out.They did have trouble getting their arms stuck inside occasionally, and in one memorable occasion, one kitten was seen hopping across the floor with not just one arm stuck inside, but the opposite leg as well! I don't think they were getting stuck because they were really trying to get out of the suits, but rather just because their arms could easily slip inside. I did wake up a couple mornings to find one kitten with both arms stuck inside, trapped and unable to move, and once or twice they managed to get out of the suits altogether, but for the most part these things worked great and were really a life-saver.I don't know how these would work as a long-term solution, but for something short-term like spaying or any other surgery where the wound would be covered by the suits, these are absolutely worth the money and I would recommend them to anyone. Asundran - August 10, 2015 The particular cat I bought this for has a compulsive grooming disorder and this was to keep him from licking the hair off of his torso, mostly his back. I bought size x-small. He measures 15.5 inches from the base of the neck to the base of his tale and weighs 14.8 pounds. Read the chart for weight AND length to make a proper fit, don't just go by other reviewers.There are two adjustable snaps on the back legs on each side, the front leg holes are elastic.The neck is elastic and on the snug side, so I stretched it out a bit while putting it over his head to make it a little more comfortable. He's used to it now, but when I first put it on him I only left it on for a few minutes each time to let him get used to it. It also seems to calm his anxiety, which seems to be the trigger for the over grooming in the first place. ByTravis Anderson - March 13, 2015 my cat just got fixed and she is six months and weighs 5.6 lbsthe smaller size was stil a bit too big but i took the top ties and made a higher knot and it worked perfectlyshe is SOOO much happier then she was with the conea simple idea and design that .. really made a huge difference in my cats happiness - October 19, 2017 My cat had a mastectomy due to breast cancer. This worked great. She adjusted well to it, and it was fairly easy to get on. However after a couple days, the edges began to fray. I ordered a second one to get us through this painful two weeks. It also would ride up a little bit and needed to be adjusted once a day. This beats the cone by far, and I highly recommend it! - October 27, 2017 In less than an hours time my cat removed this suit and licked his belly until it was bleeding. - October 3, 2017 Internet, I have a cat. My cat is a wily crotchety jerkface who will sabotage any efforts to bring good to his life.This glorious soft collar foiled his efforts after he obliterated his anal glands and we had to express them.Oh, but did he try to chew! Alas, his attempts to wriggle out of this were futile, and his booty healed up much to his chagrin.I can't speak for the other sizes, but my cat is a tiny little hellbeast and the size we got fit him beautifully. - June 24, 2016 Let me just start off by saying that I gave this collar 5 stars mostly to rate how much better it is than your conventional hard plastic collar. I don't think this collar is perfect, but it is the best alternative there can be to the dreaded cone.I want to write this review because when I was debating whether or not it would be worth my money to purchase this, the few reviews there are for this only served to confuse me more. Some people hate it, and others love it, and then there's obviously the picture someone posted of this collar having been chewed through by their cat. I'm hoping this review will address some of the things people may be wondering before purchasing this.I ordered this because my cat has an injury on her paw and she keeps licking the scab and drawing blood. I only wish I had ordered this collar immediately after she got spayed so that I wouldn't have had to go through the pain of constantly readjusting the bodysuit I made for her to make sure she couldn't take it off. I had to get crafty, because the hard cone she was supposed to wear stressed her out so much. The cone was making her disoriented on top of how weakened she was from surgery. If I had this collar, I would have had a much easier time and not have had to devise alternatives to the cone.Here are some things to keep in mind when buying this:1) MATERIAL: It is soft and bendy, but not flimsy; it will remain in a cone-like shape around the cat's head. I have not experienced a problem with the drawstring clip yet. The inside of it is reinforced so that a relatively calm cat, who doesn't go wild when a cone is placed around its head, wouldn't be able to figure out a way or have the drive to chew through it. Based on the way the cone fits around my cat's head, I don't think she would be able to get it in her mouth in such a way that she could chew it, which brings me to the size of the cone.2) SIZE: I have a very small cat. She has most likely reached her adult size, as she is almost a year old, but she maintains a weight of 7.7 pounds. So you can imagine that her neck is tiny. The extra small size fits her quite snugly. If you have a cat who is larger than 10 pounds, I would suggest going with size small. I've read one review written by someone who says size small was too big for their cat who weighs 13 pounds. While the cone itself might be too long or whatever, the neck size of extra small probably will not fit a 13 pound cat.3) DESIGN: One of the biggest problems with this cone, perhaps, is that the only way to put it on your cat is to put it over their head. It's sort of like putting your head through a t-shirt with a really small neck. Except with this, you're putting it over a cat's head. Obviously, because your cat won't want anything to do with this strange object being placed around its head, it will struggle. I would suggest having another person hold the cat while you slide it over its head. I understand that for this sort of collar, there's not much that can be done differently in terms of design, but it is something to take into consideration when determining size. My cat has a small head. If your cat doesn't have a small head, the extra small size simply won't go over its head.4) COMFORT: After I put this on my cat's head, she actually went to her water bowl and began drinking. With the plastic cone, she cannot eat or drink. The bendiness of this allows cats to be able to eat which is a big plus. And later, I saw her lying down on her cat tree, which she never does with the plastic cone, because it's too bulky and she can't jump on while she is wearing it. She usually sulks and becomes limp with the plastic cone. With this one, she is walking normally. Also, note, that any type of e-collar, unless it is completely transparent is going to hinder the cat's peripheral vision. This one has more of a problem in that sense, because it is green. This takes away from the comfort factor, obviously, but here I am comparing the comfort level of this collar to the plastic cone. When wearing the plastic cone, cats will frequently bump into walls and doors and get more freaked out as a result of that. With this one, even if the cat bumps into something, it does not make a scary noise and the fabric does not crinkle either. Also the plastic cone my cat was wearing (I guess it was worse than others) sort of hung on the top of her head, so she felt as though there was a weight on her head, so she would walk with her head hung low, almost dragging the collar. This one stays perked up on its own, and does not put weight on my cat's head.The last thing I want to say is that this review is based on the relief I am feeling only a few hours after putting this on my cat. I just started using it a few hours ago. If I find that she was able to chew it or take it off, I will update, but so far, it doesn't look like she'll be able to remove it or anything.UPDATE: My cat wore this for one week without any problems. Once we got the hang of putting it on and taking it off her, it became super easy for everyone. She did develop this strange tendency to constantly scratch at it with her hind leg claws and surprisingly, this cone stood up to a week of her doing that without tearing. So I would highly recommend this for cats or small dogs. The recovery process for pets is stressful enough to begin with, so if you want them to be comfortable, I would definitely opt for this over the hard e-collar for small pets. - March 23, 2012 Bought this item for a diabetic foster cat who overgrooms herself.

It's a bit shorter too so she can eat without much trouble. - July 9, 2014 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "suitical recovery suit for cats camo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cone collars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cotton / lycra", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:42.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af7b29c04755379fe5d79ceb99be4e813b959ec0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_YTfUMt1HBm3Ums1QNZdZ15JJBkrX7xETBYJUIDN0L7M4wAJtb60g7yK.XF8.LYCtoNeU7mld91Mn7uNC5prLmlcA6PJnFl4Acr2jMZtJnDg--", "site_full": "www.miningbusiness.net", "site": "miningbusiness.net", "site_section": "http://www.miningbusiness.net/front-page/rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Mining Breaks", "title": "THAILAND: COAL MAJOR BANPU TO LIFT PRODN TO 60Mt BY 2020", "title_full": "THAILAND: COAL MAJOR BANPU TO LIFT PRODN TO 60Mt BY 2020", "published": "2017-12-07T10:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.miningbusiness.net/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/default_images/avatar_1.png?itok=unL06Iy9", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af7b29c04755379fe5d79ceb99be4e813b959ec0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_YTfUMt1HBm3Ums1QNZdZ15JJBkrX7xETBYJUIDN0L7M4wAJtb60g7yK.XF8.LYCtoNeU7mld91Mn7uNC5prLmlcA6PJnFl4Acr2jMZtJnDg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mark", "published": "2017-12-07T10:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "THAILAND: COAL MAJOR BANPU TO LIFT PRODN TO 60Mt BY 2020", "text": "THAILAND: COAL MAJOR BANPU TO LIFT PRODN TO 60Mt BY 2020 Bangkok , Dec 7 \nThailand\u2019s Banpu Pcl plans to raise annual coal production from around 40Mt to 60Mt by 2020 and could consider more acquisitions in US shale gas after an initial $US500M investment, CEO Somruedee Chaimongkol has told Reuters.

That all changed Wednesday night.Fresh off a Saturday victory over Providence College, the Wildcats came back from an early deficit to beat Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 6-3 in a non-league game at Houston Field House. UNH improved to 9-5-1 overall.\u201cAfter a slow start I thought we battled back in the second period,\u201d UNH coach Dick Umile said. \u201cI\u2019m pleased with the way we battled back. It was a good game. We knew that RPI had been playing well. Overall, from second period on we played solid.\u201dThe Wildcats trailed 1-0 and 2-1 in the first period before rattling off three straight goals in the second to take the lead permanently. The rally was energized by the play of Jason Salvaggio, a senior winger. Salvaggio, who hadn\u2019t scored a goal since Oct. 14, scored a pair of power-play goals 2:01 apart to put the Wildcats ahead early in the period. Salvaggio added an assist in the third period.The first goal for Salvaggio was his 50th career point in a Wildcat uniform.\u201cI think it was just moving my feet and using my assets, which is my shot,\u201d Salvaggio said of finding the scoring spark. \u201cIt was a couple of frustrating months, but I\u2019m glad it\u2019s behind (me).\u201dShane Eiserman added a goal, rifling home a shot while falling down in the faceoff circle, late in the frame to open up a 4-2 lead after two periods. RPI of the ECAC, now 3-11-3 overall, closed the gap to one, but goals late in the third period from Michael McNicholas and Max Gildon put the game on ice. Anthony Wyse scored in the first for the Wildcats. UNH scored on all three of its power-play opportunities.Again, senior goalie Danny Tirone was outstanding, especially down the stretch for New Hampshire. He made 29 saves, including 22 stops on the final 23 Engineers shots.\u201cHe gives us a chance to win every night,\u201d Umile said of Tirone.The Wildcats are in the middle of a stretch of five games in 10 days. After splitting a weekend series with Providence last weekend, and beating RPI Wednesday night, the Wildcats finish the stretch hosting Army West Point on Saturday night and Merrimack on Sunday afternoon at 4 p.m. The Merrimack game is the last game for the Wildcats before the Christmas break.\u201cIt\u2019s a busy week,\u201d Umile said. \u201cNow we got Army who\u2019s playing well, and Merrimack, who is always tough to play, in our building. We\u2019ll be at home and the guys will go on break. It\u2019s a big opportunity for us.

We see a trend in the rise of the digital workforce who prefer to work seamlessly across locations. \n\u201cMore companies in Malaysia are considering flexible work arrangements, such as working out of their offices, as the value of this work style has been proven to increase performance,\u201d he told reporters here today. \nVijayakumar said this after the opening of Regus\u2019 third flexible work spaces in Malaysia here today. \nThe workspaces, dubbed the Regus Business Centre, was opened by Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng at Wisma Boustead in George Town today. \nRegus will also open another business centre in SPICE Arena, which is close to the Penang International Airport soon, bringing its total investments in Penang to RM9 million. \nThe new two centres will bring Regus\u2019 presence in the country to 30. \nVijayakumar said Regus\u2019 expansion was due to its faith in Penang, as its economy was fast growing, especially in the shared services sector or Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) sector. \n\u201cWe think our presence here will help drive more investors into the state, especially through the BPO industry,\u201d he said. \nRegus began operations in Malaysia in 1999 and currently boasts of 30 centres in Kuala Lumpur, Petaling Jaya, Shah Alam, Kota Kinabalu and Penang.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "predeep nambiar", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vijayakumar tangarasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lim guan eng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kota kinabalu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shah alam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vijayakumar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "regus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "business process outsourcing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petaling jaya", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wisma boustead", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penang international airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spice arena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george town", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumpur", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:42.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e885bfcdf1851b24f5deb7947a9c94e59b4b0a37", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvNS32Ok_lphnuZj1EMFof2TmGeGyKaflQi6Dd.HtyqOhhJlJVS0iXRk9WeIPmwcVlWjUtgYON5bYK_i8Q3iGAEyKDW2L67s7SDnKpTx5p0VMOpkOBrArekzKMNRcR1RjnEOaDAl8zDCCzW96SjDsh.CR2A3htVMnyTQbPkF2S2Z4agSvNnRqFYNc2J6Mf5HBVupUQCTlNNi3P3BxTkcWep6kRACDQxdWppzZbnjl.1cWdohka3E79kg--", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news -

Photo: Mohd Rasfan / Pool / AFP \nRAMSTEIN - Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met US military officers on Wednesday to prepare for a trip to better coordinate American security and diplomatic strategy in Africa. \nTillerson plans to make the trip in the first quarter of 2018, the State Department said, after he dismissed reports that the White House wants him to resign within weeks. \nWashington's top diplomat touched down at Ramstein air base in Germany to be briefed by officers of the US European and African commands to prepare for the journey. \n\"The secretary will set an agenda of priorities that the Department of State and Department of Defense will work on prior to the trip,\" senior Tillerson aide R.C. Hammond said. \n\"The goal is to align the two departments' efforts in the region,\" he told reporters travelling with Tillerson. \nThe US military footprint in Africa has grown rapidly in recent years, with missions training local troops and fighting Islamist militants in several countries. \nBut some critics have argued that the American civilian diplomatic effort to support partner countries has not kept pace with what has become a Pentagon-led strategy. \nWith political and media attention focused on the fighting in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, the build-up had not until recently gained a lot of attention in Washington. \nBut the dangers of the campaign were thrown into sharp relief in October when insurgents ambushed a US special forces patrol in Niger and four soldiers were killed. \nTillerson stopped off at Ramstein for a little under two hours while travelling to Vienna from Brussels, where he had attended a meeting of NATO foreign ministers. \nBefore leaving, he angrily dismissed reports that members of US President Donald Trump's White House team want him to resign and be replaced by CIA chief Mike Pompeo. \nMedia reports citing anonymous White House officials suggest Tillerson may be gone before he has time to lead his planned African trip. \nBut Tillerson retorted: \"This is a narrative that keeps coming up every six weeks, and I would say you all need to get some new sources, because your story keeps being wrong.\" AFP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tillerson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "r.c. hammond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike pompeo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohd rasfan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "department of state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "association of southeast asian nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of defense", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manila", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vienna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:43.045+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a916ee2d4debe9d0587a14239926c3a34bd88e45", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQibUEKmojPZsf1fwTnSMtk.ZeB7NykVqASLQ0Df065o5HVvQnDaoiG6VMKrGFstXbLkXu0JlRgNzn9CBSVc3YX", "site_full": "www.f150forum.com", "site": "f150forum.com", "site_section": "https://www.f150forum.com/f118/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "2015 - Present Ford F150 - Ford F150 Forum - Community of Ford Truck Fans", "title": "2017 F 150 5.0 Owners Come On In!", "title_full": "2017 F 150 5.0 Owners Come On In! - Ford F150 Forum - Community of Ford Truck Fans", "published": "2017-12-06T15:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33477, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0a5059c629ec34e3b5808991500748ca42f287ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQibUEKmojPZsf1fwTnSMtk.ZeB7NykVqASLQ0Df065o5HVvQnDaoiG6VMKrGFstXbLkXu0JlRgNzwrQLD9C1jGT8lXhinTdAY-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "nampa45", "published": "2017-12-06T07:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : Welcome to the club!

Additional acquisition in other areas is planned for 2018. \nAccording to CGG, the newly acquired Perdido Fold Belt data has shown an interesting correlation of significant discoveries along the flanks of basement topography. The data and interpretation will help explorers map crystalline basement, which is not well imaged by seismic, to construct an improved Earth Model, the company said. The airborne survey also collected continuous data through the \u201ctransition zone\u201d from the marine environment to onshore. \nThe comprehensive interpretation, combining this new data set with available geologic and geophysical data, was undertaken by CGG\u2019s in-house interpretation team in Houston. CGG noted that a full geophysical interpretation report, which includes mapping of basement, sediment and any intrusives or salt which may be present, will provide important insights to exploration and de-risking of prospective areas by oil companies. \nGreg Paleolog , Senior Vice President, Multi-Physics, CGG, said: \u201cThe results of this first survey in our wider airborne GravMag program offshore Mexico reinforce our belief that this extensive new program, when combined with our other seismic, geologic and satellite multi-client data in Mexico, will give the industry access to a unique geoscience library to support the future exploration and economic development of this high-potential area.\u201d Share this article", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "greg paleolog", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "basler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cgg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perdido fold belt", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "perdido fold belt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexican gulf of mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earth model", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:44.068+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4996893da2b5cfc5b2904dc82b3b2d36e1bf4f8f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nZOCJivZzescL.JpS5yLU1ZQBoeYJpx.Y1IkiziVZsnj8I.vYFbnOr9yUGi5dcDkN3jP2KdTeS1NyNBTP_ycVtX3mUqphGTDTXaCRYkDZL1m9QZl4lnum_Hri6DjVD6HG0cR8qASdC.M-", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/commentisfree", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Opinion | The Guardian", "title": "The DUP hasn\u2019t scuppered \u2018soft Brexit\u2019.

Photo: Sia Kambou / AFP \nIVORY COAST \u2013 A huge fire ripped through a paint factory in the Ivorian capital of Abidjan on Wednesday, causing multiple explosions, destroying nearby businesses and leaving two people in hospital. \nA factory employee suffered severe burns and a firefighter was poisoned by gas fumes in the blaze, which sent a thick column of smoke high above the city's industrial zone. \nSeveral other people were slightly injured in the fire at the Drocolor paint factory, according to police sources. \nDozens of firefighters were deployed to tackle the blaze, which also spread to the nearby shops and boutiques, gutting at least 12 stores. \nREAD: Plane crashes in Ivory Coast, leaving four dead: witness \nGroups of young men ran with buckets and bowls of water in a bid to put out the fire in small shops, and others frantically sought to remove petrol cans, crates and other flammable material. \n\"The fire started around 8am, 9am -- there were flames, then about a dozen explosions. Then the fire spread very quickly,\" said Dieudonne Ghakobi, who runs a small upholstery business. \n\"The fire was impossible to stop. The firemen can't do anything, they don't have the means,\" said blacksmith Bema Kone, who told AFP that responders had carried out a fire drill at the same factory just two weeks ago. \nFirefighters eventually brought the blaze under control at around midday and security forces were deployed in the area to prevent any looting. \nIn tears, Abu Bama, who also works in upholstery, said his entire livelihood had gone up in flames. \n\"They warned me there was a fire. But by the time I arrived it was too late -- I've lost everything. The shop, my stock, the armchairs I was repairing,\" said the distraught 32-year-old.

They are a great organisation, who have a brilliant understanding of The Albion Foundation and the work that we do. \n'They have become proud partners of our Womens, Girls and Basketball teams. London Midland have made a massive difference to The Albion Foundation and helped us go from strength to strength. We would like to thank them for their continued support.' \nMichael Fabricant, Conservative MP for Lichfield : 'Around 10 years ago London Midland inherited a rail franchise fraught with staff shortages and an unhappy industrial relations environment. This lead to cancelled and delayed trains and unhappy passengers. \n'Over the period of 10 years, London Midland has transformed itself. With new rail carriages, wifi on trains, and increased services with better time keeping, London Midland has left the franchise in better order than when it inherited it. And London Midland's community engagement - including sponsorship of the Lichfield Festival - is something I hope the new rail franchisee will wish to emulate.' \nIain Stewart, Conservative MP for Milton Keynes South: 'As we near the end of the London Midland franchise, I would like to pay a big thank you to the team for all their work in improving services on the line serving my constituents. \n'Under their tenure, the full new fleet of Desiro trains was introduced, replacing the tired and uncomfortable Class 321s. They also raised the operating speed to 110mph, allowing for faster journey times, and increased the number of services and seats to and from London Euston. \n'When there have been problems, I have found the management team to be attentive and keen to rectify them. They have also engaged well with the communities they serve and worked with local organisations to help promote local attractions, such as Bletchley Park in my constituency. \n'As a railway buff, I have also been keen to see the revival of the London Midland name, reminiscent of the the old London Midland and Scottish Railway, one of the famous Big Four railway companies (the others being Southern, LNER and Great Western Railway) that existed before nationalisation in the 1940s. It will be sad to see that go. So I thank the London Midland team for their service and I wish their successors well.' \nAnthony Smith, chief executive, Passenger Focus: 'London Midland passengers have seen a steady rise in punctuality and reliability - the key thing we know from our research that they want from the railways. In addition, staff visibility and the appearance of the whole network have improved. How do we know? Our National Rail Passenger Survey provides the facts and figures. \n'In addition, London Midland have provided a credible alternative route to and from Birmingham and London. Choice and competition drive change and some really great value for money deals are now available.' \nGo-Ahead Group plc published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:46:07 UTC . \nOriginal document https://www.go-ahead.com/en/media/news/2017/go-ahead-hails-a-decade-of-success-as-london-midland-bows-out.html \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/2CE618272B85D5AF10F5930415771279098DE70B", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jonathan ward", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "lichfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael fabricant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iain stewart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milton keynes south", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "west bromwich albion football club", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "albion foundation", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "go-ahead group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scottish railway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conservative", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national rail passenger survey", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london midland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london euston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "great western railway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bletchley park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:46.009+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15101047, "moreResultsAvailable": 15100947, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512640606009&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 366}
