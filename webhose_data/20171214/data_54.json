CD4s are NOT a measure of \"health\" but simply a snapshot of the immune system at the time of the blood draw. there is a lot of variability to cd4 counts (the \"normal\" range is very wide from basically 400-1500) and except for the above/below 200 mark, we know now after all these years that there is little diagnostic use to the cd4 count as it climbs above 300\nThere is currently no way to measure how strong/effective a person's immune system is and that is not what the cd4 count reflects and why the cd4 count is not as important once a person gets above 200, and even less important when the count reaches 500 or higher.\nThe most current HRSA/HAB guidelines extended the testing range for those who are virally suppressed to once every 6 months in a 24-month period. The word is that the next update will extend VL testing to once a year with cd4 testing optional for PLWH with consistently suppressed viral loads.\nQuote: the current guidelines are:\nAfter 2 years of ART, VL consistently suppressed and CD4 consistently 300-500:\nTime between viral load test can extend to every 6 months for patients with consistent viral suppression for >=2 years.\nWith the cd4 test done every 12 months\nAfter 2 years of ART, VL consistently suppressed and CD4 consistently >500 cells/mm3:\nthe CD4 test is Optional\nhttps://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/html/1/adult-and-adolescent-arv-guidelines/458/plasma-hiv-1-rna--viral-load--and-cd4-count-monitoring\n\"Table 4.

Alano (The Philippine Star)   12:00am Myrna Segismundo shares her passion for Filipino food with The Maya Kitchen Culinary Elite Series participants. \nYep, it\u2019s beginning to smell a lot like Christmas! The air is laced with the glorious aroma of lemon-scented morcon baking in your kitchen. As in many delicious Christmases past, you\u2019re dreaming of your favorite holiday treats from your cherished heirloom family recipes. Just like what chef Myrna Segismundo grew up with, Christmas after Christmas, in her hometown Lipa, Batangas. \nThis morning at the Maya Kitchen in Makati, Myrna shares some of the Segismundos\u2019 treasured Christmas recipes that bring back many heartwarming childhood memories. \n\u201cHaving worked in restaurants, corporate dining, I feel very lucky that to this day, my family continues to enjoy the family meals and traditional recipes we grew up with,\u201d Myrna relates as she rolls up her sleeves and prepares to regale us with a home-cooked Filipino Christmas feast. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to be the youngest in a family of 12. Maybe when my daddy was singing the 12 Days of Christmas, he meant something else. My parents, both pure Batangue\u00f1os, came from the pre-war generation when raising big families was very welcome. To this day, our food is very simple but I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s very flavorful. We come from a very rich land where a lot of dishes like the calderetas , the adobos , the bulalos , and fresh fish like the maliputo and tawilis , the sinaing na tulingan , make our food \u2014 although very simple \u2014 very unique to us and also very flavorful.\u201d \nBeing the youngest of 12 children, Myrna would often be left in the kitchen with her yaya, who eventually became the cook, and mayordoma. And having grown up in a family who ate well (\u201cnot necessarily expensive food,\u201d she clarifies), Myrna started developing her taste buds \u201cbased on what was served to us at home.\u201d \nAnd then there were the fiestas when all the kusineros from the farm would cook all day and there was an open house. \u201cWithout realizing it, I was imbibing all these traditions and my cooking, whether it\u2019s international or Filipino, is based on the development of my taste buds,\u201d says Myrna. \nNot formally schooled as most chefs are but a proud graduate of the Segismundo kitchen, Myrna declares, \u201cMy taste is based on all those flavor profiles and memories from childhood. I create food on the basis of what tastes good for me. A schooled chef would have a formula but a chef who didn\u2019t go to culinary school would have his taste, his own personal touch. As they say in the teleseryes , may hugot !\u201d   \nMyrna feels lucky she\u2019s still able to cook her family\u2019s traditional Christmas recipes, whereas the younger generations may encounter difficulties looking back at traditions and what they grew up eating. Luckily, during those Christmases when her mother was still alive, she was able to document step by step her mother Emilia\u2019s prized beef morcon recipe. \nShe relates, \u201cDefying the proper principles of cooking, I decided I would follow exactly the way she did it, hoping I would be able to duplicate the taste. From the results, I might have accomplished 95 percent of my mom\u2019s cooking. I leave the five percent to your imagination. And I hope by the time the sauce and morcon are heated up, my mother would have blessed it and said, \u2018 O , 100 percent!\u2019 From my taste recollection, I\u2019m proud to say I might have achieved it. But I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll say, \u2018 Ako pa rin!\u2019\u201d \nFor The Maya Kitchen Culinary Elite Series, Myrna whips up, before our delighted eyes (and taste buds), her Christmas table menu: adobo pat\u00e9 with pepper jelly and toast points; salad of young ubod and pomelos with honeyed- patis dressing and kinilaw of shrimps; Beef Morcon a la Emilia (stuffed with sweet pickles, chorizo, pork fat, queso de bola , ham strips, boiled eggs, etc. and garnished with potatoes and olives); and Turrones de Manila with Vanilla Gelato Spazzacamino (spiked with a dash of whisky and dusted with coffee powder); pears and apples poached in red wine. \nMyrna tells us that these recipes are not really complicated and the flavors are familiar to us all. \u201cLike, who doesn\u2019t know how to cook adobo? Don\u2019t you dare raise your hand! But I will not attempt to give you a traditional adobo \u2014 I will tweak that recipe and give you an adobo pat\u00e9, which we created by virtue of the fact that sometimes, you have your lazy moments deciding what you would feed your family. There\u2019s the French influence in your cooking, Mediterranean, Asian, and what have you. So, you decide to put together the principles of cookery, apply French cooking technique to a classic Filipino recipe called adobo, and we have what we call adobo pat\u00e9, which you can replicate in your own kitchen, or you can make your own personal recipe to share with friends or members of your family.\u201d \nWhere to find the ingredients for your Christmas feast? Why don\u2019t you scrounge around your pantry or fridge? You just might find all the ingredients you need! Myrna believes that the morcon was created by someone who saw all the leftover stuff in the kitchen and decided to put them all together. \nShe stresses, \u201cEvery time I work with dishes, I always think of ingredients that are readily available, in my pantry or the market. Sometimes, I can\u2019t stand that I fill up my shelves and refrigerators with half bottles of honey, half bottles of olive oil or mustard and you never know what to do with them, they start to get crusty on top, nanghihinayang kang itapon. Just think of all the basura in your pantry, concoct something with what you have there, and you will be surprised to discover you have invented something. Start with 40-percent formula and 60-percent imagination. Believe me, this is how I created my ubod and pomelo salad with honey- patis dressing. I decided to add a kinilaw because kinilaw is a very memorable dish for me because it was our first attempt to promote Philippine cuisine abroad, in Madrid Fusion, when we were invited for the very first time to present a dish that would introduce our cuisine to the world.\u201d \nSi, the chefs attending Madrid Fusion were very interested in our ingredients, they marveled at our calamansi, our patis, and our suka \u2014 sukang may sili, paombong, pinakurat, sinamak ! Spanish chef Elena Arzak of the Michelin-star restaurant Arzak thinks we have the best vinegars in the world, beating even the balsamic vinegar. \nTo cap Myrna\u2019s Christmas table menu is the turon. \u201cWhen the turon is served vs. the cakes, the No. 1 dessert is always the turon . I tried to teach this to the cooks everywhere I go, but nobody can do it. So I think I\u2019m blessed and I will go down in culinary history as the turon maker, although it\u2019s really very easy.\u201d \nWhatever you\u2019re serving this Christmas, be it ever so humble, do it with lots of love for some of the happiest memories are those shared by members of the family at the dining table.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ching m. alano", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "myrna segismundo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "batangue\u00f1os", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elena arzak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arzak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "myrna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emilia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lipa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid fusion", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "batangas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "makati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mediterranean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maya kitchen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turrones de manila", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:35.167+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "617a4a6f8917b2e71a3e569738571f8ddca2cbaa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR7uQh0j1j7zdAUCss5RKv7cPiOrYwPJTL0sfTl5OWZNkh7bZI4OUE.", "site_full": "nfdcv.livejournal.com", "site": "livejournal.com", "site_section": "http://nfdcv.livejournal.com/data/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "nfdcv", "title": "\u041c\u043e\u0438 \u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044b", "title_full": "\u041c\u043e\u0438 \u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044b", "published": "2017-12-07T11:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/sign.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "617a4a6f8917b2e71a3e569738571f8ddca2cbaa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR7uQh0j1j7zdAUCss5RKv7cPiOrYwPJTL0sfTl5OWZNkh7bZI4OUE.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u041c\u043e\u0438 \u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044b", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:35.168+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c844903927d755dbc4bb666bd624ed8abafc8b2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwrlKEagknWD2k4gGKhKwFCf27y01aD_KnXgarDqIF1_XVTmhbFbcZPHUN9DY5K5_8-", "site_full": "forums.d2jsp.org", "site": "d2jsp.org", "site_section": "http://forums.d2jsp.org/forum.php?f=27", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "General Chat -

Hosting duties are always fun but not always easy, as the \u201cber\u201d months also mean piled-on work and tying up loose ends before the end of the year. Here are some great ideas for virtually hassle-free entertaining, where you barely have to lift a finger and everything you need is just a call or click away! The luxurious merienda \nBring out that inherited silver tea set and invite your old school friends over for a boozy and luxurious afternoon get-together. Make little bite-sized sandwiches using Nicole Ortega\u2019s latest spread under her new luxe label \u201cSilver Platter.\u201d Nicole\u2019s newest creation is a delicious and decadent take on a classic chicken spread using generous pieces of chicken whipped into a creamy cheese base dotted with sweet cranberries and a heady mix of fresh truffle. You can also order a batch of her famous Cheese Pimiento for that satisfying, comfort-food fix. Throw in some mini-eclairs and sweet tarts from Eric Kayser and you are good to go! Don\u2019t forget a well-chilled bottle of bubbly! For orders, contact 0927-485-3399. The apero hour \nMake it \u00e0 la Parisienne and forgo the heavy meal or even plates and cutlery, for that matter. Take inspiration from the City of Lights\u2019 practice of winding the day down and beginning the evening with drinks and nibbles, ultimately getting full enough to just carry on drinking to the wee hours of the morning discussing politics, philosophy, love and conquest. \nAperitif offers beautifully presented \u201cgrazing\u201d platters customized to fit the size of your group and budget \u2014 an assortment of cheese, cold cuts, nuts, honey and jams, crackers, breads, and other delightful bites all ready for immediate nibbling. And because we can\u2019t seem to escape our sweet tooth, they offer dessert stations as well. \nAperitif has such an amazing, Instagram-worthy presentation that you don\u2019t even need to buy flowers! The only thing missing is the booze. Pick up a few bottles of a crowd-pleasing New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, an easy-drinking Grenache-based red and your favorite beer. \nHaving a big crowd over? Call Engkanto Brewery and inquire about their keg setups at 0998-998-2017 or email . Contact Aperitif PH at 0917-573-7171 or IG @ aperitif.ph .   Raclette night \nWho doesn\u2019t love that ooey, gooey, stinky, melty cheese over potatoes? One of my secret weapons for last-minute hosting duties is to bust out my raclette maker and let guests cook for themselves. Don\u2019t forget the traditional condiments: boiled potatoes, cornichons and pickled onions. You can also add some air-dried beef or bresaola and some grilled sausages if you\u2019re looking for something heavier. I almost always have a green salad on hand just to refresh the palate. Arrange things nicely for easy serving. If even boiling potatoes is too much of a hassle, you can simply call Raclette Manila and they\u2019ll do it all for you. Try serving a Chenin Blanc or Pinot Noir with your raclette. Contact Raclette Manila at or IG @raclettemnl. The intimate wine & cheese-pairing party \nThis is a great idea for smaller groups of 10 or so people. Have a selection of six cheeses aptly paired with wines. Ch\u00e8vre with a Sauvignon Blanc, Roquefort with a Sauterne, Manchego with Rioja... all it takes is a bit of quick research on the Internet to find some classic pairings. Aim for a different variety of hard and soft cheeses from different kinds of milk and even different countries. Create mini tasting stations with the cheese next to the corresponding wine, along with some tasting notes or funny quotes. \nTo make things more interesting, serve them with these artisanal cheese-pairing jams by Grace Baja, a.k.a. \u201cThe Spoiled Mummy.\u201d Her latest line, called \u201cTaste by Grace Home\u201d also carries two delicious cheese spreads: Quattro Formaggio with Pink Peppercorn and Manchego Curado with Almonds, as well as a buttery-smooth Chicken Liver P\u00e2t\u00e9 with Pistachios. Don\u2019t forget to serve a big bowl of green salad for digestion! Contact Taste by Grace Home at 0906-361-8374. The porchetta party \nSome of us can\u2019t live on cheese and cold cuts alone and need heftier nosh. Also, there isn\u2019t any real celebration if you don\u2019t have that iconic lechon , right? Here\u2019s a fresh take on that tradition: order the scrumptious Roast Pork Belly of Dulce Magat Gibb. Golden, crisp skin that crackles and crunches, yielding to a super-soft, falling-off-the-bone meat. Absolute heaven. Presented on a chopping board adorned with leaves and with bottles of mustard, applesauce and lingon berry preserve, all you really have to do is carve. \nServe this with some sliced ciabatta and a big bowl of arugula for guests to make their own yummy little porchetta sandwiches. You could throw in an Asian option with cuapao buns, some hoisin sauce and Sriracha, fresh cilantro leaves, spring onions and cucumber. I would serve this with a crisp, dry Riesling for a refreshing contrast to the rich pork. Contact A Table by Dulce Magat Gibb at 0917-862-1800. \nIf you don\u2019t even have time to go out and buy wine, you can order online at www.manilapremierewines.com and www.boozy.ph . \nBecause it\u2019s always nice to have something that you\u2019ve made yourself, try serving a homemade caviar terrine, always a hit at my parties and incredibly easy to make! Recipe File: Caviar Terrine \n225 grams plain cream cheese \n2 hardboiled eggs, cold or room temperature \n1 package of black lumpfish caviar \n1 small red onion, finely minced \n2 lemons \n1 bunch of fresh dill \nCrackers or Melba toasts for serving \nProcedure: \nIn a food processor, whip together the cream cheese, hardboiled eggs and some fresh dill leaves. You may season with some ground black pepper if desired, but it\u2019s not necessary. Transfer the mixture into a bowl and fold in the minced red onion. Assemble the pie using a ring mold, directly on the serving plate or on top of an appropriate-sized cake board. Place a layer of the cream cheese mixture, then top with a layer of the caviar. Cover and chill. Before serving, carefully remove the mold. Cut one of the lemons in half lengthwise and make thin, half-moon slices. Use these to garnish the sides of the caviar pie. Garnish with a large sprig of dill on top and serve with some lemon wedges and crackers or Melba toasts. \nFor an even simpler version, use a nice glass or silver dish and make a caviar terrine instead by spreading the cream cheese mixture on the bottom, then topping with caviar, a lemon slice and dill garnish. That way guests can just dip their crackers directly into the bowl.

The new CFP (C form-factor pluggable) optics is now a revolutionary step as one form factor of 100G optic transceiver. The CFP modules offer the enabling step for cost-effective and successful 100G deployment. So what is it? And how does it work in 100G network? This article would give a comprehensive introduction to CFP modules.\n\nCFP Wiki Abbreviated as CFP transceiver, C Form-Factor Pluggable transceiver is a multi-sourced pluggable transceiver used in the transmission of high-speed digital signals. It is specified by a multi-source agreement (MSA) between competing manufacturers. The c stands for the Latin letter C used to express the number 100 (centum), since the standard was primarily developed for 100 Gigabit Ethernet systems. It is a hot-swappable input/output transceiver that is used in the data communication and telecommunication networks.\nThe CFP transceiver was designed after the small form-factor pluggable transceiver (SFP) interface, but is significantly larger to support 100 Gbit/s. While the electrical connection of a CFP transceiver uses 10 x 10 Gbit/s lanes in each direction (RX, TX) the optical connection can support both 10 x 10 Gbit/s and 4 x 25 Gbit/s variants of 100 Gbit/s interconnects (typically referred to as 100GBASE-SR10 in 100 meter MMF, 100GBASE-LR10 and 100GBASE-LR4 in 10 km SMF reach, and 100GBASE-ER10 and 100GBASE-ER4 in 40 km SMF reach respectively.)\nCore Features of CFP Modules \u2013 Support to 103 Gbps and 112 Gbps aggregate bit rates.\n\u2013 Connector Interface\n\u2013 Operating Case Temperature\n\u2013 Diagnostic Monitoring\n\u2013 RoHS6 Compliant\n\u2013 Single 3.3V Supply for Power and a Power dissipation < 12W\nOne distinctive feature of CFP modules is that they support digital diagnostic monitoring functions or the digital optical monitoring. This is the feature that gives users the ability to monitor the real-time parameters such as the optical output power, the optical input power, the temperature, the laser bias current and the transceiver supply voltage.\nInner Structure of CFP Modules The basic CFP modules consist of the following parts.\n1. An Integrated Coherent Optics Transmitter which sends the TX optical signal.\n2. An Integrated Coherent Optics Receiver which receives the RX optical signals.\n3. The CFP connector\n4. Coherent DSP\nMost of the CFP optical transceivers adhere OIF CFP-ACO (Analog Coherent Signals) and are connectable to multiple DSP\u2019s. The biggest engineering challenge that CFP2 faces is the adoption of the high-speed 25 Gbps electrical interface due to the reason that the CFP was based on the third generation.\nIt can be a multimode parallel optic transceiver module that is designed to offer high-density 100G Ethernet and Optical Transport Network (OTN). The device is designed to offer maximization of the delivery of the 10G data channels for the 100G networks that support 100 Gbps SR10 and 10 X 10 Gbps.\nDevelopment of CFP Modules The original CFP specification was proposed at a time when 10 Gbit/s signals were far more achievable than 25 Gbit/s signals. As such to achieve 100 Gbit/s line rate, the most affordable solution was based on 10 lanes of 10 Gbit/s. However, as expected, improvements in technology has allowed higher performance and higher density. Hence the development of the CFP2 and CFP4 specifications. While electrical similar, they specify a form-factor of 1/2 and 1/4 respectively in size of the original specification. Note that CFP, CFP2 and CFP4 optical transceiver are not interchangeable (but would be inter-operable at the optical interface with appropriate connectors).

An athlete is monitored 365 days a year. (Doping control officers) can show up any time and take a sample,\u201d R-Sport news agency Quote: d Mutko as saying.\nMutko said earlier on Thursday that he was ready to resign over the Olympic ban if it was deemed necessary. Mutko said the same thing before the 2016 Rio Olympics when Russia\u2019s participation was in limbo over allegations of state-sponsored doping, and did not resign.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday declined to say whether officials involved in organising the 2014 Sochi Games, including Mutko, would be punished. He said such reprimands were not a priority.\nEchoing earlier comments by President Vladimir Putin, Mutko said the Russian authorities will support athletes who wish to compete at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games as neutrals.

A friend of mine took physics without maths and did struggle but managed to come out with a B at AS so it's just something to consider.\nI take biology, chemistry and psychology (Year 13) and I thoroughly enjoy both biology and psychology. Psych is really interesting but you have to consider that it is a VERY content heavy subject and will require a lot of revision but if you enjoy it then it is a great subject to do. Biology is also fairly content heavy (not as much as psych) but I also find it very interesting for the most part (a few topics we do bore me to death tho).

One way this will be achieved is through the roll out of the national solar water heater programme. Residents will not only benefit from having hot water available to them, local labour will also be employed in the project. While the areas where the programme will be implemented are still to be decided, the most deserving and neediest residents will be considered. Previously, about 30 000 heaters were installed in eThekwini homes in an earlier roll out of the project in 2012. An overview of the new programme was discussed at an Executive Committee meeting on 21 November. The programme, to roll out solar water geysers, will be funded by the national Department of Energy and will be installed through the utilisation of local resources. The report tabled by the Executive Committee stated that the national Department of Energy approached the Municipality to participate in the national programme for the generation of job opportunities. The programme will have two components namely the Social Programme and the Load ReductionProgramme. The Load Reduction Programme will target higher income homes and will only be partially subsidised and will not be offered to low income suburbs. Meanwhile, the Social Programme will be fully subsidised and will be free to recipients. Work will be carried out by local labour and local contractors trained by the Department of Energy. The participation of local labour is in line with Municipal procedures which is integral to this programme.Furthermore, the City will ensure all installations are of good quality. Chairperson of the Human Settlements and Infrastructure Committee Councillor Mondli Mthembu said: \u201cWe will ensure that the distribution will target the poorest of the poor to ensure we put geysers where they are needed most.\u201d WEATHER Cannot retrieve the URL specified in the XML Link property.

Vaccinating calves is the best protection against this highly fatal disease. Blackleg disease may be ancient, but calves need vaccinations Calves are most vulnerable to Blackleg; vaccination prevents the highly fatal, bacterial disease. Dec 07, 2017 \nAs mom and I were working calves one weekend this fall, it occurred to me: \u201cWhy were we giving the same vaccines all these years?\u201d \nI am not ignorant as to the purpose of the vaccines and the importance of a good vaccination protocol, but the long-term process made me curious. We\u2019ve given the 7-way Blackleg vaccine to our registered Angus calves at four and six months of age for longer than I\u2019ve been alive (nearly four decades). \nOn this fall weekend we processed 23 heifers and bull calves and administered their booster, or second shot, of Blackleg. Mom and I gave the calves a shot at four months of age and again, this most recent time, after they passed the six month old mark. \nWe\u2019ve always treated for Blackleg, and I realized this fall that I needed a refresher on what the disease is all about. Here\u2019s what I found out. Blackleg is a highly fatal disease of young cattle caused by spore forming, rod-shaped, gas producing bacteria called Clostridium chauvoei. The spores of the organism can live in the soil for many years. A calf can become infected when it eats from the soil, which allows the bacteria into its body via small holes in the mucous membrane of the digestive tract. \nThe spores enter the bloodstream and cling to muscle tissue throughout the animal's body. Then the bacteria spores lie dormant in the muscle tissue until stimulated to cause disease once it has been activated in a low oxygen environment, such as damaged or bruised tissue. \nIt\u2019s not the sickly, skinny calves who are at the highest risk for Blackleg. Ironically, calves that are between six months to two years old, rapidly gaining weight and have a good source of nutrition are most susceptible. Very rarely do mature cows get Blackleg. The disease may be more prevalent on farms that have recently done excavation, or in areas that have been flooded, which allows the spores to rise to the surface of the ground. \nBlackleg is a silent killer. When a calf becomes infected with Blackleg the owner won\u2019t see immediate signs of the disease. The disease is not transmitted directly from sick animals to healthy animals by mere contact. And sadly, animals infected with this disease die rapidly without signs of illness. \nThe first glimpse of Blackleg is lameness and loss of appetite. Ranchers will also notice rapid breathing, depression and a high fever. Swelling will also develop in the animal\u2019s hip, shoulder, chest, back and neck, and it will be hot and painful. As the disease progresses, the swelling enlarges and becomes spongey and gaseous, and can be felt under the calves\u2019 skin. At this point, the animal will die within 12 to 48 hours. Most often the calf is found dead with no observations of it being sick. Since Blackleg kills so rapidly, treatment is virtually useless. \nThe good news is that Blackleg is almost entirely preventable via vaccination, thus making my family\u2019s annual effort to treat for the disease worthwhile. The most common vaccine is 7-way type, which protects against Blackleg, two forms of malignant edema, black disease and three types of enterotoxemia. Vaccines are available at most farm stores, developed by noted pharmaceutical companies, and should be kept at room temperature \u2014 although we store ours in the refrigerator in the barn. \nBlackleg is only one of the calfhood diseases a rancher should treat. All farms and ranches should follow the advice of their local veterinarian, but on BRR Angus Farm we treat for Blackleg, brucellosis, anaplasmosis, pinkeye and leptospirosis. Throughout the year we use a pour-on for grubs, lice and ear tags, or rubs for flies. We also administer medicines upon veterinarian recommendation, and only if the animal is sick. \nPrevention is key. Although science and technology have provided us with new, effective protocols, the anatomy of a cow or bull hasn\u2019t changed. So we\u2019ll keep giving Blackleg vaccinations to our calves and hope you do, too. \nMcCurry writes from Colwich, Kan.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "blackleg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccurry", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "brr angus farm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "colwich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blackleg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:39.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ab6f96a27437321cc70cfd2219efe1c0c18f22c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZMngqaIQTWlu522HT6g69w4jqxWTyVHsSYBrVGVGmEdWCujEi8j1Xh3wf4gL.mYGDKtb6XZXvgKRCq2O4OS7DzKFaTEikWAzQmsi1SLFIzEqvfBMN1JE9", "site_full": "www.dakotafarmer.com", "site": "dakotafarmer.com", "site_section": "http://www.nebraskafarmer.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nebraska Farmer", "title": "Sunflower market needs to replenish stocks, meet demands in 2018", "title_full": "Sunflower market needs to replenish stocks, meet demands in 2018", "published": "2017-12-07T15:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.nebraskafarmer.com/sites/nebraskafarmer.com/files/Link%20-%20sunflower-2018-market-outlook-1204H1-1203A.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ab6f96a27437321cc70cfd2219efe1c0c18f22c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZMngqaIQTWlu522HT6g69w4jqxWTyVHsSYBrVGVGmEdWCujEi8j1Xh3wf4gL.mYGDKtb6XZXvgKRCq2O4OS7DzKFaTEikWAzQmsi1SLFIzEqvfBMN1JE9", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T15:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Sunflower market needs to replenish stocks, meet demands in 2018", "text": "Tips for winter pesticide, sprayer storage Nov 14, 2017 MORE INTEREST: Industry analyst says farmers are expressing more interest in growing sunflowers this year than they have in the past. Sunflower market needs to replenish stocks, meet demands in 2018 2018 looks like it will be another challenging year in terms of marketing commodities. Dec 07, 2017 \nBy John Sandbakken \nWhat a difference a year makes. The overall U.S. sunflower yield was the highest yield on record in 2016. But in 2017, both drought and extremely dry conditions occurred in much of the Dakotas and parts of Minnesota, which lead to a difficult growing season and left many in the trade scratching their heads about where the overall final yield would end up. \nIn its October estimate, USDA pegged 2017 sunflower production at 1.81 billion pounds, down 32% from the revised 2016 production of 2.65 billion pounds. \nNo estimates are out yet on 2018 oil-type sunflower acres, but industry analysts believe that acres will increase given the interest they are hearing from producers. Based on current demand and historical usage, a 15-20% increase in acres in 2018 can be easily absorbed in 2018 without impacting present prices to a great degree. \nSeveral new domestic customers have added sunflower oil to their product mix. Export markets are growing as well, giving several market options to sell oil. Obviously, world events can change markets in a hurry. Based on the reduced 2017 oil-type production and product demand, though, the sunflower market should be aggressive in 2018 to get acres to replenish stocks and meet demand. \nI know I will sound like a broken record, but from the looks of it, 2018 will be another challenging year in terms of marketing commodities. Margins will be tighter, so producers are going to have to buckle down and watch their marketing in the year ahead. You will also have to sharpen your pencil when it comes to figuring out the bottom line, as crops that were profitable last year may not be in 2018. It will also be important to watch the markets carefully to take advantage of market rallies when selling old crop and locking in new crop prices. \nCrushers in the Northern Plains are offering both 2018 cash and Act of God contracts for NuSun and high oleic sunflower. NuSun is around $17.00-$18.15 per cwt. with high oleic in a range of $17.25-$18.25. \nSomething else to consider is the oil premiums that crush plants pay on sunflower. Sunflower is the only oilseed that pays premiums for oil content above 40%. Premiums are typically of 2% price for each 1% of oil above 40%. The gross return on sunflowers with 45% oil content would be 10% higher per cwt with the premium.

The liberation of the city is seen as a symbol for defeating IS in Iraq, and there is international pressure to achieve this. Both the Obama administration and the prime minister of Iraq, Haider al-Abadi, have been pushing for the liberation of Mosul for political reasons. 2 There is the perception that Obama would like to end his term on a high, and victory over IS in Iraq would provide just that, at least temporarily. Additionally, Abadi promised to defeat IS before the end of 2016 and, as his political position is weak at the moment, this is a promise he needs to deliver on. 3 The flurry of activity in September 2016 \u2014 with visits from the British and German defense ministers to Erbil, 4 a high-level delegation from the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) visiting Baghdad 5 as well as a tripartite agreement among Baghdad, Erbil and Washington for the Mosul liberation \u2014 made it clear that the Mosul battle was imminent. 6 Indeed, on October 17, 2016, Abadi announced the beginning of the operation to retake the city of Mosul from IS. 7 However, no political agreement has been reached for the future governance and security of Mosul and the wider province of Nineveh. 8 Liberating Mosul without adequate planning with regard to post-IS dynamics will only result in a short-lived victory that the people of Iraq will pay for in the years to come. A political agreement should have been reached prior to the launch of the offensive, and it is now imperative that political action be taken before the end of the offensive.\nThis article argues that the political and security marginalization of the Sunnis is partly responsible for the rise of IS; thus, any liberation would be counterproductive if not paired with a political and security agreement for Mosul and the wider province of Nineveh. It thus lays out the issues that need to be, and should already have been, addressed. As the battle for Mosul is likely to take as long as three months, 9 and possibly even more, it is vital that negotiations begin and agreements be reached for the political and security elements of the liberation before it is completed. I will first contextualize the political failures in Iraq by examining the marginalization of Sunnis. Following this, I will analyze why it is essential for a political and security deal to be reached prior to the completion of the liberation of the city of Mosul and what role the coalition forces, particularly the United States, can play in facilitating this arrangement. The fieldwork for this research, undertaken between June and August 2016, involved semi-structured interviews with the key political actors in Nineveh.\nThe deep structural and political failures in Iraq are indicated by the way in which the security forces gave up Mosul so easily. If they are not dealt with, any military defeat of IS will be pointless; IS will merely be replaced by another radical entity looking to represent the marginalized Sunni population. Lessons must be learned from the actions of the post-Saddam era. Failure to create a political, civil and security system that represents the entire population of Iraq led to radicalization and disengagement from the Iraqi state. If these same mistakes are not to be repeated post-IS, substantial planning is needed. 10\nThe governance system in Iraq has failed to adequately represent its various communities, and since 2003 the government has been unable to deliver economic and security stability. Under these circumstances, IS grew and thrived in Iraq, making it clear that a political solution needs to come before any military decision. Because IS is the grotesque manifestation of the marginalization of the Sunni population, defeating it militarily will not solve the issue that brought it to life in the first place. It needs to be defeated politically. Once a political settlement is achieved, there will no longer be a void to fill; consequently, IS will lose its mandate to exist. 11 In order to understand the need for a political deal, it is important to first examine the marginalization process in Iraq.\nIS AND MALIKI'S RULE As a result of the process of de-Baathification and the political sidelining of Sunnis, al-Qaeda was able to gain a significant foothold in Iraq. The response to al-Qaeda's rise was the creation of the Sunni Sahwa forces, which finally produced an active engagement with the Sunni community.12 This led to an increased participation in the political process, which in turn led to the secular al-Iraqiya bloc's winning the most seats in the 2010 national elections. 13 This could have been a turning point with regard to Sunni political participation in post-2003 Iraq. However, due to Iraq's political system and fraught post-election negotiations for power, Nouri al-Maliki and his State of Law bloc managed to maintain power. 14\nThe period of Maliki's second term is seen as largely responsible for the complete marginalization of the Sunnis that led to the rapid rise of IS. 15 Maliki's growing authoritarianism and amalgamation of power were decisive. First, alongside his role as prime minister, he became minister of defense, minister of interior, minister of state for national security and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Second, Maliki eliminated a number of his political opponents through accusations and arrests. 16 Third, he disbanded the Sunni Sahwa forces without properly incorporating them into the security services, thus ridding himself of (Sunni) military opposition. 17 Fourth, he replaced high-ranking military officials with his allies and began giving them direct orders. Additionally, Maliki created provincial command centers with generals loyal to him and placed both the army and police under these generals' control. This led to his effectively running the Iraqi Security Forces both on the ground and in the parliament. 18 Finally, Maliki sent in the army to deal with those Sunnis protesting against his governing methods. The resulting violence caused many deaths. 19\nThe marginalization of Sunnis in the central government transferred to the local level. According to one Sunni Nineveh Provincial Council (NPC) member, the policies adopted by the federal government of Iraq \"led to the complete breakdown of the communications of the central government and the local government, which in turn led to the complete destruction of the communication between the local government and the security apparatus.\" 20 The direct link between the rise of IS and the marginalization of Sunnis is evident.\nAdditionally, the marginalization of the Sunnis went beyond politics, transferring to the Maliki-controlled military's behavior with regard to their treatment of the local population. This is highlighted in the following two Quote: s from NPC members:\nThe security apparatus in the city became corrupt and they were extorting the people of the city, including doctors, businesses, etc. Even at the time when there were violations people did not feel comfortable to report these to the security apparatus. 21 We have the case of the Iraqi troops going to shops, for example goldsmiths, taking things by force and not paying and badly treating the people of the town. They were coming to the towns and taking whatever they wanted, filling their cars. If you voiced your concerns, the next day you would be on the terror list and be taken away. The people were fed up with this treatment and it created a very fertile ground for extremism in the city. Both sides, the local government and contributed to the escalation of the crisis and planting the seeds of extremism in the town. 22 Consequently, the marginalization of the Sunni population and the acts of the military against it created the dynamics that enabled IS to gain a foothold in Mosul, a point highlighted by a former governor of Nineveh Province:\nWhen those people demonstrated and asked for their rights, the Iraqi government used force against them. Some of them believe that there is no way to get their rights through political means and they joined Daesh and used weapons against the government. 23 Unfortunately, despite the fact that Maliki is no longer prime minister, the marginalization of Iraqi Sunnis continues. Two recent events illustrate this point. First, Abadi stated that the Hashd al-Shaabi 24 will participate in the liberation of Mosul, which has since become a reality. 25 Second, the Sunni minister of defense, Khaled al-Obaidi, was recently impeached under accusations of corruption. 26 The participation of the Hashd al-Shaabi is important. The NPC voted unanimously that the group should have no role in the liberation of Mosul; because they represent the people of Nineveh, the vote should be respected. For Obaidi, who is from Mosul, losing his post is significant as this harks back to a time under Maliki when political opponents were forced out through politically driven accusations. If corruption is to be tackled in the Iraqi parliament, it has to happen across the board and not be used as a political tool to get rid of opponents. For Sunnis, particularly those from Mosul, Obaidi represented their community in the higher rankings of the government. This demonstrated, on the surface at least, that the government had changed since Maliki's time, when the armed forces came completely under his control. This fact was particularly evident in the interviews with Sunni political actors in Nineveh. When asked which forces should participate in the liberation of Mosul, the participants routinely said the Iraqi army. When asked the follow-up question of why, considering that the Iraqi army abandoned the city to a force of only 800 IS fighters, the importance of Obaidi became apparent. According to many of the interviewees, the army changed under Obaidi and ceased to be the force of corruption and violence they had witnessed in Mosul during Maliki's rule. 27\nBoth of the developments mentioned above demonstrate that Iraq has not changed and that the marginalization of Sunnis continues. The conditions that led to the rise of IS still exist; thus, the defeat of IS will do little to solve the underlying issues. For a Sunni living under IS in Mosul, what is going to instill trust in this government? If Sunni political representatives are not being listened to and are being sidelined in Baghdad, are Sunnis not going to fear what will replace IS? Therefore, it is important to reach a deal for the future of Nineveh.\nTHE NEED FOR A DEAL The marginalization of Sunnis created a power vacuum, one that was easily filled by IS through force and a separation from the central state system. The removal of IS will, yet again, create a power vacuum in Mosul; therefore, it is essential that this does not result in a fight for power among rival local groups or, once again, sidelining by the central government of the local population. For example, following the liberation of Fallujah in June 2016, there were large political disagreements within the provincial council over leadership roles and council positions, as well as over the reconstruction process and divisions of funds and contracts. 28 These elements should have been agreed upon prior to any liberation; failure to do so has only slowed down the process of reconstruction, ultimately causing the most suffering to those who have been displaced. Lessons must be learned from Fallujah, to avoid repeating mistakes. Political deals covering governance, security and post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation must be made.\nAs highlighted above, the lack of political will to address Sunni grievances has played a major role in the creation of radical entities in Iraq. Therefore, it is vital that political agreements on who will govern, how they will do it and on what structure governance will be built are made prior to the completion of the liberation of Mosul. IS represents an ideology as much as it represents Sunni marginalization, the fact that Sunnis have been denied the opportunity to address their concerns through political means. None of these elements can be dealt with effectively through combat. Without establishing political agreements for political structures to ensure not only that Sunnis are part of the political process, but also that minorities are protected and have adequate participation in the governance of Nineveh, IS will not be defeated. Without having political agreements prior to Mosul's liberation, its people will fear what will replace IS. Without having political agreements in place, inter- and intra-community violence will inevitably occur, as various groups vie for positions of power. This will only be exacerbated by the growing number of militias operating within Nineveh. Thus, any political arrangement also needs to include an agreement on the future security forces in Nineveh. Without a political agreement in place, zero-sum games will be the main political behavior of community leaders.\nPOLITICAL AGREEMENT There are deep roots to the political issues that need to be addressed, calling for drastic changes to governance. At the central level, the political system has long been failing, and reforms promised by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi have not come to fruition. There are numerous issues at the central level, but, due to the multiple parties involved and the current state of Iraqi politics, solving them will have to be a long-term project. It is essential to make reforms at the central level, however, as failure to do so will reproduce the conditions that led to the rapid rise of IS and may lead to its return or the establishment of another radical entity that will address Sunni grievances through violent means. Although this will have to be undertaken for the whole of Iraq, its basic elements can be dealt with through decentralization and by addressing governance issues at the local or provincial levels.\nThus, it is important to develop a governance agreement for Nineveh in order for all the communities to feel represented and to prevent the Baghdad-based centralization that led to many of the dynamics that allowed IS to grow. It is equally necessary to have all the local groups on board for the new governance program; it is pointless to have decentralization if it only leads to domination at a local level. The importance of having an agreement among local groups stems from the fact that there are a number of factions within Nineveh and in Mosul itself. Although they agree on the need for decentralization, they have different ideas about what that entails. Within the NPC there is current Governor Nofal Hammadi and his alliance, but there are also various opposition groups within the NPC, as well as various minority groups. Then there is former Governor Atheel al-Nujaifi and his followers, who are backed by Turkey and who \u2014 as numerous interviewees from the NPC claim \u2014 are planning to use their military force, Hashd al-Watani, to take power, or at least exert influence after the liberation. It is, however, important to note that Nujaifi denies there is any plan to occupy a formal position after the liberation. 29\nThere are also numerous other groups, both within and outside the NPC, with strong links to the KRG \u2014 particularly the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) \u2014 that would have different ideas about the governance structures and future of Nineveh. There is also Baghdad and those linked to it, as well as Iran and the Arab Gulf states. Then, of course, there are the coalition forces, which exert great influence on the entire process.\nAs is evident, there are numerous groups with different aims and goals for the governance and future of Nineveh. Without a political agreement prior to Mosul's liberation, there is the potential for conflict as these factions try to gain power or exert influence; the proliferation of armed militias only heightens the tensions. Therefore, an agreement for the governance of Nineveh is intrinsic to the future stability of the province. However, as the disputed territories are a flash point that could lead to future conflict, they also have to be addressed in the political agreement.\nDISPUTED TERRITORIES There needs to be an agreement for a new mechanism to deal with the disputed territories, 30 as Article 140 has failed to solve the issue. 31 Continuous delays and unfulfilled promises have done little to develop trust in the process; Kurds are clearly dissatisfied with the entire affair. However, the future of the disputed territories must be decided through political means, using the processes developed within Article 140 as a guideline. The issue with Article 140 is not the content but the means to implement it. As long as Baghdad maintains complete control over Article 140 as the method to deal with the disputed territories, nothing will happen. Removing Article 140 and starting fresh negotiations among the territories actually affected by the process will not only bring in the communities whose future is being decided, but also reignite the process of dealing with the disputed territories. 32\nThere is, it should be noted, the potential for the KRG to take the disputed territories by force. The Peshmerga are liberating these areas; without a political consensus, they could refuse to withdraw, thus occupying the territory. Statements such as the following by KRI Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani have been widely used by non-Kurds to support these fears: \"We will decide the extent of our borders by what has been liberated with the blood of our Peshmerga.\" 33 Moreover, Abdulrazaq and Stansfield suggest that the KDP wants to annex these territories for internal Kurdish reasons. One is to counteract the effect of Kirkuk's joining the KRI, as the city's majority adhere to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). 34 Additionally, the current political crisis in the KRI heightens the need for the KDP to gain more territory under its sphere of influence in order to boost its hand in future negotiations with the PUK and Gorran. These factors increase the possibility of the KRG's taking the disputed territories through force.\nHowever, taking over these territories rather than negotiating their future politically will only lead to further violence in the region. There has to be a political solution to the issue, and this can only be negotiated once there is stability in Nineveh and elections have enabled the population to choose new representation. This does not mean the Peshmerga have to withdraw from the disputed territories they took control of in their advances against IS, but that the governance of these areas should fall under the \u2014 decentralized \u2014 NPC until such time as negotiations begin. However, international supervisors will be necessary to ensure that there is no coercion of the local population to join the KRI. Negotiations should then happen between the NPC and the KRG with the participation of Baghdad and the facilitation of the United States. It is crucial that an agreement for these negotiations to replace Article 140 be reached before the liberation of Mosul is complete. Both the political agreement and agreement on the disputed territories will have to be underpinned by controlling the number of forces operating in Nineveh; therefore, a military agreement is also necessary.\nARMED-FORCES AGREEMENT The current proliferation of armed forces in Nineveh is of major concern. The multiple political actors often have diverging plans for the future of the province, and they are all linked to different militias. Without an understanding of the future security structure in Nineveh, the individual forces can fill the power vacuum left by IS or direct their attention to smaller localized conflicts. Having numerous active forces under different commands with different objectives could lead to both inter- and intra-community conflict and acts of revenge that would only further the cycle of violence in the region, a fact highlighted by a Sunni member of the NPC:\nThe very big factions in Nineveh, I can see that they have this tendency to create military groups to implement their political will and show their political force. 35 One member of the NPC opined that failure to reach an agreement and to get rid of all these factions will lead to \"warlords\" as in the case of Afghanistan. 36 The fact that many of these forces lack legitimacy, proper training, equipment and even money for salaries creates the opportunity for the Iraqi government and coalition to influence them to amalgamate and unify under one command structure.\nSECURITY MATTERS It is essential that there be a local element to the liberation of Mosul, particularly for the fighting within the city, a point continuously raised in interviews with NPC members. Thus, there should have been support and capacity development of local forces in order for them to participate. As already highlighted, this also needs to include a deal for these forces to come together under a proper command structure. Although the Government of Iraq promised to help the NPC develop a force of 15,000 troops, members of the council have highlighted many times the lack of actual support to bring this to fruition:\nWith regards to the local forces' capabilities, it is not that great\u2026.They are also in the diaspora and there is no logistical support and there is no military camp for training. 37 We are now actually in negotiation with the central government and the Americans to put together a force of 15,000 of the people of Nineveh. But I think in these circumstances we will face many difficulties and obstacles. 38 Bringing together the multiple groups will be one way of creating a large local force, but this also has to involve training and the development of a proper command structure. There is still time to develop the security capacity of the local population, as it is not only intrinsic to the liberation operation; it is also necessary to ensure peace and stability following the defeat of IS.\nOnce liberated, the local communities have to work together to take control of both the political and security systems in Nineveh. In order to avoid a proliferation of armed militias in post-IS Nineveh, these groups need to be incorporated into the new security system. Worryingly, when this potential problem following the defeat of IS was posed to members of the NPC, there seemed to be a nonchalant, almost cavalier, attitude among the majority of the participants towards this concern, with very little reflection on the real possibility of conflict. Many did voice the concern, however, that former Governor Atheel al-Nujaifi would use his force, Hashd al-Watani, to gain influence and power in post-IS Mosul \u2014 a point he denied. But both Nujaifi and his force are seen as illegitimate by the central government and some members of the NPC, so there is a real possibility of conflict between them. The fact that all these militias operating in Iraq have different regional backers is additional cause for concern, further compounding the need for both a political and a security agreement prior to liberation and for the territorial integrity of Iraq to be respected post-IS.\nIt is imperative that these forces come together under one umbrella, within the Iraqi army's domain. The following statement highlights this point:\nWe have this agreement that there will be 15,000 volunteers from all the components of Nineveh and this Hashd will be responsible for holding the ground. If all the components of Nineveh participate in this Hashd and we will find a name that does not represent any one group, but rather the entire province, so we can get rid of all these name games and separation. We have Hashd Da Nawada that represents the Shabak, Hashd al-Watani that represents Atheel, we have a Hashd from all the Jabouri tribes etc\u2026. We have to bring them all together under one name to bring all the communities together and not have a name that favours one group. 39 Bringing the various militant groups under one command will help ensure the future stability of the region and give the minorities a sense of protection, as they will be represented within the security apparatus. Having a unified force is also important for security post-IS. If local groups hold the ground, as opposed to those identified as foreign, it will speed up normalization and give all communities a connection to the liberation process.\nPARTICIPATING FORCES Beyond the need for local forces to participate in the liberation, it is also important to understand the role of the participating forces. The recent battle in Fallujah is an example of how not to liberate a city and provides lessons to be learned from failure. Questions can be asked about the lack of a post-conflict plan, the participation of the Hashd al-Shaabi and the rush to begin the operation. There are numerous reports of torture and murder having been carried out by the Hashd al-Shaabi, as well as of the unnecessary destruction of the city. 40 These actions must not be repeated. It is important not just to defeat IS militarily, but to overcome the need of some Sunnis to seek representation outside the political system. Acts of torture, murder, false accusations and unnecessary destruction by a force backed by the government do nothing toward this goal.\nAs already highlighted, the NPC has voted against the participation of the Hashd al-Shaabi in the liberation of Mosul. The former governor claims that the \"Hashd al-Shaabi will never be accepted at all [by the people of Mosul.]\" 41 NPC members really fear for the people if the Hashd al-Shaabi participates, as evident in the following Quote: s:\nI think their participation will be very negative and the outcome is catastrophic\u2026.If they are part of the liberation forces of Mosul, I think some people will stand with Daesh against any liberation force. Not because they like Daesh's mentality, but in hatred of the Shiite militias, especially after the violations they have committed against Sunnis. 42 I don't see the necessity of having the Hashd al-Shaabi as part of this coalition; it will give it a sectarian look and will lead to people being accused of being Daesh members. It must be clear of sectarianism. 43 When discussing the Hashd al-Shaabi with members of the NPC, apart from the fear of what they would do to the people, most respondents also voiced concern about Iranian encroachment into Iraqi territory. The way they articulated this demonstrated that Iraqi nationalism still persists strongly among many Arab Sunnis.\nWith the forces available for the liberation of Mosul, it appears unnecessary for the Hashd al-Shaabi to participate; their participation is political rather than a tactical move by the central government. Jabar Yawar, secetary general of the Peshmerga, stated that, although the Hashd al-Shaabi will participate, they will not be allowed to use Kurdish territory as a staging area for the battle. 44 Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, leader of a weak government, is over-reliant on the Hashd al-Shaabi and other Shiite militias \u2014 and, by extension, on Iran. However, the participation of the Hashd al-Shaabi has to be managed extremely carefully, and by no means should they be allowed to enter the city. Letting them do so would be extremely short-sighted; it will fuel the cycle of sectarian violence and make the defeat of IS a hollow victory. Part of managing the role of the Hashd al-Shaabi relates to managing the unwelcome role of Turkey in the offensive, and vice versa, as each has threatened to increase its participation based on the role of the other. 45 This is a delicate balancing act that Baghdad needs help from the coalition forces to maintain.\nIt is important to note that many of the militias within the Hashd al-Shaabi consist of extremely experienced fighters and have not carried out any unlawful acts. However, to the residents living in Mosul, the Hashd al-Shaabi is all the same; there is no differentiation between the forces. Therefore, their participation has to be limited.\nMoreover, IS would use the entrance of the Hashd al-Shaabi into the city for propaganda purposes, to make the population think it is a sectarian war, as evident in the following Quote: :\nThis is something Daesh has been preparing for. Daesh has been showing the people of Mosul the abuses committed by the Hashd al-Shaabi to make them fear their arrival. 46 This is where the role of the United States in the process is of paramount importance. Washington is in a position to influence the role the forces play. The U.S. role in deciding the participating forces was highlighted by one NPC member when the participation of Hashd al-Shaabi was mentioned to him:\nI think the only ultimate decision maker when it comes to what forces can participate or not is the Americans, who will have the final say in who can participate. 47 Thus, it is important that the United States use this position of power to prevent the Hashd al-Shaabi from participating in the battle within the city and Turkey from participating at all. However, due to the nature of the Hashd al-Shaabi and the fact that much of it is under Iranian rather than Iraqi influence, this may have to include brokering a deal with Iran.\nNevertheless, most local leaders agree that their forces must play a leading role, alongside the Iraqi army, in entering the city, backed up by the Peshmerga from the north and east, while receiving air and logistical support from the coalition forces. It is also important for the population of Mosul to know that local forces are involved in liberating them. First, this mitigates the sectarian element and any notion of an invasion rather than a liberation. Second, having local forces involved can somewhat diminish the fear of retribution and revenge. Finally, following the battle, there will be a period of holding the city, and local forces will be key to this effort, to lessen any fear of occupation. This point was highlighted by the chair of security in the NPC:\nWe do need forces that can hold the ground after the liberation, and that has to be regional forces. Representation should also be equal and just, and be based on the representation of the communities within the province. I think this is one of the solutions so that the people of Nineveh don't feel as if they are misrepresented. 48 Alongside local forces, the Iraqi army has been highlighted as the next-most important actor and one that should enter the city. In addition, the Peshmerga have been praised continuously in interviews with NPC members; their role in the operation was never questioned. At the same time, it was made clear that their role should be limited and that it is unnecessary for the Peshmerga to enter the city. This is an opinion shared by the de facto president of the KRI, Masoud Barzani; 49 therefore, on the surface at least, there is no fear of the Peshmerga's entering the city. 50 However, the Peshmerga do have a very important role to play in securing the northern and eastern fronts and in vetting and sheltering those who escape through these routes.\nDespite complaints about the historical role of the United States in Iraq, all but one participant was positive, even insisting on U.S. involvement in the liberation of Mosul. The international coalition forces are playing a major role in planning, as well as in providing air and logistical support. Without their participation, the battle would be far more difficult. However, there have been calls for them to play a bigger role on the ground as a supervisory force to prevent the types of abuses witnessed in Fallujah and Tikrit. 51 In the opinion of one NPC member:\nI would like for the international community to have a peacekeeping force for the liberation of Mosul and to prepare the ground for reconstruction and for fair and transparent elections, and then for the transference of power between the international force and the local representatives and local force made up during this time. 52 By taking a larger role on the ground, the international forces (particularly the United States) can help to ensure the safety of civilians and that a proper process is in place for dealing with suspected members of IS.\nCONCLUSION There is an argument that the people of Mosul have lived under IS for too long, thus the liberation had to begin as soon as possible. Or that the longer it took for the liberation to begin, the longer IS had to prepare and to continue developing chemical weapons. 53 However, lasting damage can be caused by not planning properly for the post-offensive era. If the political and structural failures in Iraq are not addressed, the underlying issues will not be solved, and IS will return in one way or another. It is disappointing that almost two-and-a-half years have passed, during which a political and security deal could have been forged prior to any liberation. That time has not been used wisely.\nIt is essential that prior to the completion of the liberation these political and security deals be made. There needs to be an agreement for decentralization of Nineveh Province to remove the prospect of marginalization, one of the leading causes of the rise of IS. Additionally, there needs to be an agreement among local actors for the governance structure of a decentralized Nineveh. Closely linked, there needs to be an arrangement for the multiple militias to come together as a single force, particularly for the post-IS security of the province. Finally, there needs to be a deal among the local actors, the KRG and Baghdad for a new mechanism to decide the fate of the disputed territories.\nAlthough this article has only addressed the need for a political and security deal, and the make-up of the participatory forces, there are multiple other factors that need addressing. More preparation is needed for IDPs, as are agreements for the reconstruction and redevelopment of the province. Additionally, plans for justice and reconciliation need to be formulated and agreed upon by all the actors. Finally, assistance that allows the society to move on \u2014 deradicalization and PTSD programs, education systems, and so on \u2014 also need to be implemented. All of this should have been developed a long time ago, but it is imperative that as much as possible be done prior to Mosul's being liberated, however soon that may be.\nIS has created one positive element: it has brought Iraqis together in the face of a common enemy. There is an opportunity for the rebirth of Mosul, and perhaps addressing the issues raised in this article will foster new life for that historic city.\n1 Although referred to as the Islamic State in this article, this term only came into being after a caliphate was declared on June 29, 2014, and it was formerly known, and is often still referred to, as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). It is also often referred to as Daesh (the majority of the interviewees used this term), which is based on the Arabic acronym of its name and has negative connotations.\n2 Dylan O'Driscoll, \"And the Marginalisation Goes On: Iraq and the Politics of Domination,\" MERI Policy Brief 3, no. 14 (September 2016).\n3 Stephen Kalin and Maher Chmaytelli, \"Iraq to Defeat Isis in 2016, Says Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi, as Army Retakes Ramadi,\" The Telegraph , December 28, 2015.\n4 See \"British Defense Minister Discussed Looming Mosul Operation During Erbil Visit,\" Rudaw , September 22, 2016; and \"Germany 'Will Take Part in the Battle for Mosul,'\" New Arab , September 24, 2016.\n5 See \"Top-Level Kurdish Delegation in Baghdad ahead of Looming Mosul Offensive,\" Rudaw , September 29, 2016.\n6 Delshad Abdullah, \"Washington, Baghdad, Erbil Agree on Mosul Battle,\" Asharq Al-Awsat , September 20, 2016.\n7 See \"Mosul: Iraqi Army Battles ISIL in 'Historic Operation,'\" Al Jazeera, October 17, 2016.\n8 In conversations between the author and high-level Iraqi and coalition officials it has not only been highlighted that a political deal has not been reached, but also that there has not even been an attempt to bring the rival political actors to the same negotiating table.\n9 Michael Knights, \"Islamic State Conflict: How Will the Battle for Mosul Unfold?\" BBC News, October 4, 2016.\n10 Dylan O'Driscoll. \"The Future of Mosul: Before, During, and after the Liberation.\" MERI Policy Reports, September 2016.\n11 Dylan O'Driscoll, \"Autonomy Impaired: Centralisation, Authoritarianism and the Failing Iraqi State,\" Ethnopolitics (2015): 1-18.\n12 The Sahwa forces were a Sunni force created in 2005, although only formalised in 2006, to fight al-Qaeda in the Sunni region of Iraq.

But never purple wind. Until now.\nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\"\n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\"\nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow.\nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday.\n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\"\nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away.\nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger.\nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero.\nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive.\n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\"\nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee.\nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles.\nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes.\nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said.\nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday.\nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses.\nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again.\n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\"\n___\nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

The food is expensive as noted in other reviews, but they also add fees to everything which makes it even more expensive. My suggestion is bring snacks and request a mini-fridge and buy some of your own beer and liquor locally. Also the Daq Shack is a short walk from the property (across from the Meli\u00e1) and they have great inexpensive and strong daiquiris and beer as well as lunch items and the owner is fun and so nice. There is a small straw-market near here which might save you a trip for souvenirs. Night life for us was the Baha Mar casino. The casino is nice and had plenty of $10 and $15 tables. The dealers were nice and knowledgeable and most nights we had good vibes and won some money! The jewel of the entire casino for us was Ron. He works at the casino sports bar and he always greeted us with a smile and our drink of choice. We spent extra time playing the bar poker machines and talking to him he was great. Not all alcohol in the casino is free but if you ask they will help you find what is and not complimentary. Locally we ate at Sharkey's Bar and Luciano's of Chicago. Sharkey's was typical tourist bar food with big drinks and Luciano's of Chicago was excellent local food mixed with Italian pasta and steakhouse I highly recommend it.

In the next 10 years, it is predicted soybean demand will increase 100 million metric. Trade missions help expand Nebraska soybean markets LEAD Comment: Trade missions have been instrumental in growing export markets and marketing Nebraska soybeans. Dec 07, 2017 \nBy Lisa Lunz \nThe value of U.S. soybean exports has increased dramatically in the last 20 years. In fact, Nebraska farmer Jim Miller recently returned from a trip with President Donald Trump to China, where the U.S. Soybean Export Council signed a letter of intent with Chinese officials to export 8 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans to China. As a former Nebraska Soybean Board chair, you have participated in several trade missions to countries like China and Japan. What role have trade missions played in expanding these export opportunities, and what are some growing export markets for Nebraska soybeans? \nTrade missions to other countries and bringing soybean buyers from these countries to the United States and Nebraska has played a key role in the increasing global demand for soybeans and soybean exports. I had the opportunity to promote Nebraska soybeans in China, and pork and beef in Japan while serving on the Nebraska Soybean Board. \nOther countries value relationships and knowing where their soybeans are coming from. Nebraska continues to host soybean buyers from China, Vietnam, Philippines, Mexico, Thailand and the Americas. The buyers and users of Nebraska soybeans have been able to visit farms and meet with different farmers from across the state. Some farmers may question the value of these trade missions, but they have been instrumental in the growing export markets and marketing Nebraska soybeans. \nThis past year, the Nebraska Department of Agriculture signed letters of intent with nine soybean processing companies from Bulgaria. This agreement will promote Nebraska soybeans, and these companies visited Nebraska to begin the relationship building. New markets are important to the state, along with established markets like China, Indonesia, Mexico and Japan. These four countries are the top importers of soybeans. The Nebraska Soybean Board also participates in a trade mission to the Philippines and Vietnam in cooperation with a Nebraska soybean processor Ag Processing Inc. to help open up new markets. \nAs we all know, agriculture is important to Nebraska, and according to the USDA, exports are responsible for 20% of our farm income. In the last 20 years, exports have continued to increase along with the global demand for soybeans. The export market in the U.S. has increased from 1 out of 4 rows to every other row of soybeans today. China, our No. 1 customer, imports 50% of the U.S. soybean exports, which is about 30% of the total U.S. soybean production. At the present time, China uses 67% of the total world supply of soybeans. China's middle class continues to grow and so does their demand for protein. It is predicted in the next 10 years, if the trend continues, soybean demand will increase 100 million metric tons (3.67 million bushels). The USDA is forecasting the global demand to increase by 14.09 million metric tons (517.7 million bushels) just in the 2017-18 marketing year. \nThe Nebraska Soybean Board and the Nebraska Department of Agriculture continue to focus on Nebraska and the benefits of using soybeans from our state. The Department of Agriculture is working hard to brand Nebraska agriculture commodities because of their quality. The U.S. Soybean Export Council and the United Soybean Board have the role of promoting U.S. soybeans. The U.S., Brazil and Argentina are the top producers of soybeans in the world, and there is always competition in the export market.

When inheriting a farm or ranch, there are often differing opinions on how much the asset is worth. Management > Land Management First-time landowner? Consider getting a third-party appraisal For those who have recently inherited a farm or ranch, it can be difficult to know how much the asset is worth. Tyler Harris | Dec 07, 2017 \nFor first-time landowners who have recently inherited a farm, it isn't always easy to know how much the asset is worth. The value of assets changes over time \u2014 whether it's the land itself, the farm or agricultural equipment. \n\"Buildings on a farm or agricultural equipment can depreciate over time as they wear and tear, but other kinds of assets like a 1967 muscle car may appreciate in value due to being vintage,\" says Jim Jansen, agricultural economist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. \"That's why we want to get a third-party opinion. Because in addition to the land, we may have different kinds of improvements to the farm or ranch. If they're the kind of improvements for working cattle, the value of these things has changed and will continue to change aside from the physical depreciation. We also have functional obsolescence with some equipment on the farm.\" \nThat's one of the reasons Jansen advises land heirs to get a third-party appraisal of their property \u2014 whether or not they plan to sell the asset, as certain legal or financial needs may require a fair market value on the asset. \nBut there's another big reason. A third-party opinion gives not only a professional opinion of what the market value is at that point in time, but also an objective opinion. Jansen encourages landowners to use resources like the American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers website , which includes a public list of appraisers. \n\"Some of the conflict in dealing with estates comes about because on-farm and off-farm siblings may disagree on certain aspects if they're trying to figure out what some of these assets are worth,\" Jansen says. \"The extended family members that are going to be the heirs of the asset are dealing with the stress of negotiating what something is worth, due to lack of knowledge from either party.\u201d \n3 appraisal approaches So, how is land appraised? Jansen says there are three ways to calculate the value of an asset. \nOne of these is the market comparison or sales approach, which uses recent transactions for comparable assets in a given region to appraise the asset. \"For example, if you're appraising an irrigated quarter, you'll look at an irrigated quarter with similar attributes \u2014 a well with similar gallons per minute and those kinds of things,\" Jansen says. \"If you're appraising a farm site, you'll look at another farm site with a similar setup in terms of grain bins, equipment sheds, things like that.\" \nSecond, the income approach evaluates the income-earning potential of the asset and capitalizes it over time. \"On cropland you would be looking at what would be a reasonable return per acre for a typical crop grown on a parcel of ground divided by the current market capitalization rate, which is somewhat similar to what the rate of return is,\" Jansen says. \nThird is the cost approach, which evaluates the asset based on the cost of building a similar asset, and accounting for functional depreciation or obsolescence. \n\"These are the most common three approaches,\" says Jansen. \"Depending on the scope and purpose of what you're appraising, the land professional will most likely arrive at using one of these three approaches to determine the final market value of the asset, but most often all three approaches will be included in the appraisal process.\" \nTo learn more, contact Jansen at [email protected] or visit asfmra.org .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim jansen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jansen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyler harris", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of nebraska-lincoln", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american society of farm managers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:39.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "85af8f2d9f6095b164c340139f11059ee6ade1b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_UI0PlzfyPHQs.IECCVEmrophGvdLanIW7KPmvkSh0qKHqQlikpD1826i_vft0irgnT9lrwayk4M", "site_full": "forums.att.com", "site": "att.com", "site_section": "https://forums.att.com:443/t5/AT-T-PREPAID/bd-p/prepaid", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "AT&amp;T PREPAID - AT&amp;T Community", "title": "Solved: account number", "title_full": "Solved: account number - AT&T Community", "published": "2017-12-06T15:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forums.att.com/html/assets/att_globe_rgb_pos2.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 335, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "85af8f2d9f6095b164c340139f11059ee6ade1b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_UI0PlzfyPHQs.IECCVEmrophGvdLanIW7KPmvkSh0qKHqQlikpD1826i_vft0irgnT9lrwayk4M", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "brendalee", "published": "2017-12-06T15:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Solved: account number", "text": "in need of my account number and password so i can transfer my number to straight talk\nSolved by: Go to Solution.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:39.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "78c196de093356f495220d020f2aaba3744bfcd8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2547XlBiMTYTWs0XB8NfPA-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "78c196de093356f495220d020f2aaba3744bfcd8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2547XlBiMTYTWs0XB8NfPA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "dbms_job.submit(1, 'proc;
