(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of registered voters and ensured that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott barbour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george brandis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "parliament approves same-sex marriage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images members of parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the sydney morning herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "federation square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images  australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:13.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "900b68b3ef1a0b5b259b505f108db1a441e1a427", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQWtwq_4QcUiLbZ9gsUDwYt_4FyNYR5L8VasRh6NU399oJtnaGoub6swgvYvn4TTM2G_DJ.eo64O4rJU88e3y6Sv4Ncy8dhJKtaI8L0uRAJuENa4reBo34fa5oxYN.EdPuqmb8_LaUpjQ--", "site_full": "nmusba.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://nmusba.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Interest and Co-operative Societies By Shaykh Mufti Ahmed Bemat [r.a] \u2013 AhleSunnah Library", "title": "Interest and Co-operative Societies By Shaykh Mufti Ahmed Bemat [r.a]", "title_full": "Interest and Co-operative Societies By Shaykh Mufti Ahmed Bemat [r.a]", "published": "2017-12-07T11:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "900b68b3ef1a0b5b259b505f108db1a441e1a427", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQWtwq_4QcUiLbZ9gsUDwYt_4FyNYR5L8VasRh6NU399oJtnaGoub6swgvYvn4TTM2G_DJ.eo64O4rJU88e3y6Sv4Ncy8dhJKtaI8L0uRAJuENa4reBo34fa5oxYN.EdPuqmb8_LaUpjQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "nmusba", "published": "2017-12-07T11:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "Interest and Co-operative Societies By Shaykh Mufti Ahmed Bemat [r.a]", "text": "Read Online \nVersion 1 \n\nDownload \nVersion 1 [17.3 MB] ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shaykh mufti ahmed bemat", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:13.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "33359bea748c924a4cd76c220426a632780b08df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS28CfmYeJcRgzxX4E8ROcuo_ys8xZe1MFt67jAkeN7QAKWTUm56EpESj2hLPxr2k6oEUD05i00rqLdE_lLkKmik97PnWqE0m.KqGL2EGywGdD7PMwaws0tiZhXBHyL3Nl", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Makeup Addiction", "title": "CCW please!!! \ud83d\ude05 I have a fancy graduation party to go to but something about my makeup just doesn\u2019t sit well with me.

Driving under the influence of alcohol is known to be one of the leading causes of accidents on our roads, and we can expect an increase in roadblocks and random alcohol testing across the board.\nMost roadblocks and random checks are carried out legitimately and for the safety of our roads, but there are instances where officers encourage bribes in exchange for not being prosecuted. Unfortunately, not all motorists are aware of their rights and responsibilities when they are pulled over on suspicion of drunk driving and many fall victim to corruption simply to avoid prosecution - whether valid or not. \nThe limit and charges \nThe first thing people should be aware of is what the legal limits are for alcohol while driving. In South Africa, the legal limit for private motorists is a breath alcohol content of 0.24mg per 1 000ml, or a blood alcohol limit of 0.05g per 100ml. This equates to approximately 2x330ml beers or 2x130ml glasses of wine for a person who weighs about 75kg. The limit is stricter for professional drivers, such as truck or taxi drivers, at a breath limit of 0.01mg per 1 000ml. \nWhat many motorists do not realise is that they can legally be pulled over and tested for alcohol at any time, be it during a formal or informal roadblock, or being pulled over by an individual police officer. An officer requires only to have reasonable suspicion of alcohol consumption in order to test - and although a motorist may decline to be tested, the officer has full right to detain the motorist to perform blood tests at the nearest police station or state clinic. \nAn officer may suspect a motorist of driving under the influence of alcohol for a number of reasons. However, most common are erratic driving (in the case of being pulled over by an individual officer), suspicious behaviour, and smelling alcohol on a driver\u2019s breath. You can be charged based on alcohol testing, but you can also be charged for suspicion of driving under the influence due to reckless driving. \nThe process \nWhen you are pulled over, the officer should inform you of the reason for doing so, such as for erratic driving. The officer then needs to establish objectively whether or not you are under the influence of alcohol. The officer may not necessarily have a breathalyser on hand and may ask you to do a series of cognitive tests. These involve doing things like walking on the white line or closing your eyes and touching the tip of your nose with your right hand. These help the officer to determine your sobriety and failure to successfully complete one of these tests could lead to being detained for blood tests. \nIf the officer does have a breathalyser, you will be requested to breathe into the apparatus. It is important to note that if you have to physically place your mouth on to the device, the officer needs to prove that the mouthpiece is new by showing you the closed package before conducting the test. For tests where you only need to blow on to a detector, no mouthpiece is required. The instrument must also be current. \nYou may request to see the calibration certificate for the breathalyser and, if it has passed its calibration expiry date, you may request a new test. Even so, the officer may still detain you for blood tests on suspicion of drunk driving. \nBreathalysers are extremely sensitive to alcohol consumed within 15 minutes of doing a test. If for example, you have consumed cough mixture or a few sips of alcohol within 15 minutes of being tested, your results may show you as being over the legal limit. In this case you may request to be retested following a 15-minute wait. \nShould you test over the legal limit, the officer may place you in a holding van for travel to a police station or clinic for blood tests. The breathalyser is only a screening test and most provinces use the result of the blood test for legal purposes. According to legislation, blood tests should be taken within two hours of a positive breathalyser, or initial suspicion of alcohol consumption. \nThereafter, you may be placed under arrest, and can only be released once bail has been posted. Blood test results can take weeks to arrive, so official prosecution and the subsequent court date is typically only months later. \nYour rights \nYou do not have the right to refuse any of the test methods listed above, although you may request the officer\u2019s identification as proof that he or she is of the law. Legally you have certain rights, such as the right to sanitary and safe testing (the use of clean and new instruments), and the right to a valid breathalyser test. \nThat said, Section 32 of the constitution states that when an individual does something that affects the rights of a group, the individual\u2019s rights do not take precedence. Driving under the influence of alcohol affects the rights to safety for every other road user and your rights are therefore limited if you are arrested on suspicion of drunk driving. \nUltimately, everyone has the right to safer roads and nobody has the right to jeopardise that by getting behind the wheel of a car after having consumed alcohol. Rather be safe; don\u2019t drink and drive. \n* Rhys Evans is Managing Director of ALCO-Safe. \n** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers. \nCape Argus ",

What trades will take the lead in 2018? Here is the view from SocGen? \nHere is their view, courtesy of eFXnews: \nSociete Generale Cross Asset Strategy Research is out with its top FX trades for 2018 which includes 3 trades in spot (Long EUR/USD, Long AUD/NZD, and short USD/CAD). The 3 trades are structural-based that are meant to express SocGen\u2019s thematic views through the next 6 to 12 months. \nLong EUR/USD : \u201cAfter a hiatus of a few months, we expect the euro\u2019s rehabilitation to resume, albeit unevenly, in 2018. It\u2019s cheap, and while it needs higher Bund yields to propel it higher, a 35bp starting point gives yields room to rise,\u201d SocGen argues. \nLong AUD/NZD : \u201cAUD/NZD has been stuck in a 1.00-1.15 range for four years now, but as the commodity cycle bottoms, we think there will eventually be a break higher. The RBA is closer to tightening policy than the RBNZ, even if neither is very close,\u201d SocGen adds. \nShort USD/CAD : \u201cWe think fair value for USD/CAD is closer to 1.20 and expect a gradual move back towards that level as long as NAFTA survives and oil prices remain in their current range,\u201d SocGen argues. \nFor lots more FX trades from major banks, sign up to eFXplus \nBy signing up to eFXplus via the link above, you are directly supporting Forex Crunch.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "socgen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nafta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rbnz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "societe generale cross asset strategy research", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:15.023+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15133032, "moreResultsAvailable": 15132932, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512638535023&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 776}
