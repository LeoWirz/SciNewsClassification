This year, the festival is on till December 10. \nThe daily cultural performances by the Konyaks, Angamis, Lothas, Aos, Zeilangs, Chakhesangs and others, included displays of sacrificial rituals, farewell songs, war dances, fire-making rituals and more. For those inclined to delve a little deeper into Naga art, the state\u2019s Department of Art and Culture has set up an Artists Corner to facilitate dialogues between the artists and visitors, where apart from art work for sale, there are demonstrations as well as archival photos. \nIn a shaded bamboo pavilion is the crafts section where Angami tribal shawls with animal patterns, jewellery made of beads and bones, the black pottery by the Phom tribe, thousands of bamboo products, and traditional hunting gear including knives and spears are on sale. (Express Photo by Kavitha Iyer) \nThere is also a World War II Museum that houses relics from the 1944 battle of Kohima, which first put Nagaland on the global map. Other events around the festival included a photo festival, a run and a peace rally. \nA pineapple eating contest ended in peals of laughter, while a Naga Chilli eating contest is coming up. (Express Photo by Kavitha Iyer) \nBut the real action is in the morungs, replicas of the traditional dormitories for young tribesmen. Dotting the hillside of the Kisama Heritage Village, the location of the Hornbill Festival each year, are these hubs of warmth, food and easy camaraderie where visitors can seek out a Naga meal with sticky rice, smoked pork and pickled bamboo shoots, each morung offering its own varieties of meat and spices and zutho, their fermented rice beer. \nAs temperatures dip with sundown by 4.30 pm, visitors huddle around the coal and wood fires in the morungs, tall bamboo tumblers of beer in hand, as musicians start tuning up for the evening performance at the amphitheatre.

In the same way, when you are a child and see the adults around you writing, you become a writer,\u201d Sahitya Akademi recipient Thayil told IANS in an interview. As a young boy, up till the age of 18, Thayil travelled a lot. Every time his father got a new job somewhere, the whole family would move with him. From Bombay to Patna, then to Delhi, back to Bombay, followed by Hong Kong and then New York, and back again to Hong Kong. But the inspiration too was continuous. \n\u201cThe first time I read poetry was from his bookshelf,\u201d recalls Thayil \u2014 a hardcover first edition of the Collected Poems of Dylan Thomas . \u201cI read Dylan Thomas, Ulysses and James Joyce when I was just 14 or 15.\u201d Thayil said his travels shaped his perspective of the world. \u201cWhen you are not in one place for very long and when you are exposed to many cultures as a child, I think it makes you more accepting, less judgemental; it makes you more open-minded about the world,\u201d he elaborated. The author-poet\u2019s self-discovery as a writer came at the age of 14 when he first read the English translation of a French poem Le L\u00e9th\u00e9 by Charles Baudelaire, which translates into The River of Forgetfulness . \n\u201cI remember it had a physical effect on me, on my body. I felt it physically when I read this poem. My hair stood up. It had a very profound physical effect on me for a few seconds. I found it thrilling. And then I wanted to write something like that. Once that happened, you are changed. You are never the same person again,\u201d Thayil maintained. What followed was a \u201ctotally natural process\u201d of learning the art of writing. \u201cIn fact, it was so undisciplined because I was teaching myself. I had no idea, I just read everything that I could read. And then I tried to write. No one was there to tell me what\u2019s good or what\u2019s bad. And actually, that\u2019s the only way to do it,\u201d he added. \nThayil\u2019s literary works, particularly his poems, reflect a strong sense of grief and chaos, but he says he was very happy as a child. \u201cBut then childhood ended and so did happiness.\u201d What also stopped was his conversations with his father. \u201cWe had a lot of problems,\u201d he recalled about his late teens. \nAfter his return to India at 18, Thayil began experimenting with drugs. \u201cAnd before I knew it, it had become a habit.\u201d His addiction lasted for two long decades, the exact time that he worked as a journalist. \u201cI financed my drugs from my journalism salary. So when I quit drugs at 40-something, I quit working, I didn\u2019t need that job any more. I could just sit and write and write,\u201d he explained. Thayil was back home in India but he no longer had a monthly salary and was working on a novel that would take five years to complete. When he first finished the draft of Narcopolis , it was an 800-page book, from which he carved out the 300-page version. From the 500 pages that were left, he started working on a new book. And split them into two other books, the first of which is The Book of Chocolate Saints. \n\u201cIt was much bigger than it is now; I deleted about half of the book and then wrote new stuff because once I started working on this, it became a totally different thing from it had been. And there was a moment in 2014 when I thought it was done. But it was nowhere near done. It was only in this last year that it really took its final shape,\u201d he elaborated. \nOf course the father-son relationship is back to normal now. The only difference is that it is George who very often asks for Thayil\u2019s feedback on his works these days. And why not, Thayil has come a long way! He won the DSC Prize for South Asian Literature in 2012 and a Sahitya Akademi award in 2013. He has also been shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize, the Man Asian Literature Prize and the Commonwealth Prize. \nOne can just imagine the accolades that will come his way for arguably his best work so far \u2014 The Book of Chocolate Saints.

The 173-page document was dictated to his aides soon after the end of the war. It was created at the request of General Douglas MacArthur, whose administration controlled Japan at the time. \nThe winning buyer was from Japan, according to Alice Lok, a spokeswoman for the auction house Bonhams. No other details were immediately provided. \nThe memoir, also known as the imperial monologue, covers events from the Japanese assassination of Manchurian warlord Zhang Zuolin in 1928 to the emperor\u2019s surrender broadcast recorded on Aug. 14, 1945. The document\u2019s contents caused a sensation when they were first published in Japan in 1990, just after the emperor\u2019s death. \nThe two volumes are each bound with strings, the contents written vertically in pencil. It was transcribed by Hidenari Terasaki, an imperial aide and former diplomat who served as a translator when Hirohito met with McArthur. \nThe monologue is believed among historians to be a carefully crafted text intended to defend Hirohito\u2019s responsibility in case he was prosecuted after the war. A 1997 documentary on Japan\u2019s NHK television found an English translation of the memoir that supports that view. \nThe transcript was kept by Terasaki\u2019s American wife Gwen Terasaki after his death in 1951 and then handed over to their daughter Mariko Terasaki Miller and her family.

The discussion between then-Republican candidate Trump and his son took place after the emails became public, Schiff said. Trump Jr. released the emails in July. \n\u201cIn my view there is no attorney-client privilege that protects a discussion between father and son,\u201d Schiff told reporters after the closed-door testimony had ended. \n\u201cWe will be following up with his counsel,\u201d Schiff said. \nRepresentative Mike Conaway, the Republican leading the investigation, said Trump Jr. had answered all of his questions. \n\u201cMr Trump was cooperative at all times,\u201d Conaway said. \nTrump Jr. arrived and left without being seen by reporters. \nLawmakers said they want to question him about a meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 at Trump Tower in New York at which he had said he hoped to get information about the \u201cfitness, character and qualifications\u201d of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democrat who was his father\u2019s presidential election opponent. \nIt was at least the second time Trump Jr. has testified to a congressional committee investigating any Russian meddling in the election and possible collusion with Moscow by the Trump campaign. \nHe arrived shortly before 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT) and was questioned for most of the next eight hours by members of the intelligence panel. \nA person familiar with knowledge of Trump Jr\u2019s testimony said Trump had said repeatedly he did not remember things he was asked about, including some details about information provided by Russians during the Trump Tower meeting. \nDepartment of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller is also investigating. He has announced the first charges of Trump associates, and Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has pleaded guilty to lying to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents. \nThe House intelligence panel also released on Wednesday a transcript of testimony last week of Erik Prince, a Trump supporter and founder of the Blackwater military contractor. A focus of that testimony was a report that Prince tried to set up a \u201cback channel\u201d for communications between Trump associates and Russia. Prince denied such a plan. \nREPUBLICANS CRITICIZE PROBES \nTrump Jr.\u2019s appearance coincided with criticism of the Russia probes from some of his father\u2019s fellow Republicans, who control both houses of Congress and accuse investigators of bias against Trump. Other lawmakers, Republicans as well as Democrats, say the goal of the investigations is to guarantee the integrity of US elections, not to target Trump and his associates. \nTrump Jr., like his father, denies collusion with Russia. US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 campaign to boost Trump\u2019s chances of defeating Clinton. Moscow denies any such effort. \nSome Republicans criticized Mueller, the FBI and the Department of Justice at a news conference on Wednesday, ahead of congressional testimony on Thursday by the director of the FBI, Christopher Wray. \nRepublican House members accused the Justice Department and the FBI of bias against the president and having been too easy on Clinton during the investigation of her use of a private email server while leading the State Department. \nHowever, Clinton has made no secret of her belief that then-FBI Director James Comey\u2019s announcement just before the election that the bureau was investigating potential new evidence in the lengthy email probe cost her the White House. \nAlso on Wednesday, Representative Bob Goodlatte, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, announced a hearing next week with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, citing \u201cserious concerns\u201d about reports on the political motives of staff on Mueller\u2019s team.

After one of the deepest recessions in its modern history, the largest corruption scandal in Latin America and more than a year under what may be the most unpopular president in the world, Brazilians are desperate for something different _ so desperate that some are calling for the return of a military dictatorship. \nBut a handful of new organizations are trying to channel that anger into reinvigorating the country\u2019s democracy by luring fresh faces into a political establishment widely seen as closed off and unrepresentative. \n\u201cThe idea was simple: how to turn indignation into political action,\u201d said Jose Frederico Lyra Netto, a co-founder of Acredito, one of the new non-partisan movements. \nAcredito and another group called Agora! hope to each field about 30 candidates in next year\u2019s elections who have never held office before. They\u2019re asking people across the country to help create their platforms by suggesting solutions to Brazil\u2019s thorniest issues: inequality, crime, failing schools and an aging population with a faltering social security system. Their efforts focus on state and federal legislatures. \nA third organization, RenovaBR, is offering training and living expenses to about 150 newcomers, who are being selected from thousands of applicants who want to run for office. It says they must commit to close ties with constituents by, for instance, publicly justifying every vote they cast. \nThe movements are taking aim at a system they say has ceased to represent the Brazilian people. \nEven though President Michel Temer\u2019s popularity ratings have dipped close to the margin of error above zero, his allies in Congress have twice been able to block efforts to have him tried on corruption charges sought by federal prosecutors. Many lawmakers are wary of such trials because many of them, too, have been implicated in corruption scandals. \nPart of the disconnect between politicians and their constituents stems from the way Brazilian parties now choose _ or exclude _ candidates. \nParty leaders keep tight control over who can run, as well as the funds they need to campaign, making it nearly impossible for newcomers who challenge the status quo. Existing politicians often designate a successor _ many times a child or at least a protege, as was the case when former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva championed Dilma Rousseff. The byzantine party system and rampant corruption have also turned off many younger Brazilians, leaving the country still largely in the hands of the generation that took power when Brazil returned to democracy in the 1980s. \nA new system of public campaign financing favors the big, traditional parties while penalizing smaller ones and newcomers. And independents are banned. That means these new groups will have to negotiate with existing minor parties to put their neophyte candidates on the ballot, and talks have already begun. \nThe growing fury at traditional politicians has helped lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro, who lauds the country\u2019s 1964-1985 military regime and has been ordered by courts to pay fines for racist, homophobic and sexist comments. He has risen to second place in preference polls ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election. \n\u201cThis environment is opening a Pandora\u2019s box of very dangerous things,\u201d said Ilona Szabo, who co-founded Agora! and is one of Brazil\u2019s most recognized activists and intellectuals. \u201cWe want to offer hope.\u201d \nNext year\u2019s elections are wide open due to unprecedented revelations of corruption perpetrated by the country\u2019s elite, new rules that prohibit corporate campaign financing and the possibility that the poll leader, da Silva, could be barred from running because of a corruption conviction. \nDavid Fleischer, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Brasilia, said he expects about 70 percent turnover in the seats in Congress, up from about 50 percent in a typical election year. \nThe uncertain atmosphere has many buzzing about the prospects of outsiders, and the new movements have won the backing of big names, such as Luciano Huck, a popular talk-show who is involved with Agora! and Renova. \nEduardo Mufarej, an entrepreneur who is one of Renova\u2019s founders, said those who hope for change can\u2019t just sit back. He said he came at the question of fixing Brazilian politics with \u201calmost a venture capital mindset.\u201d \n\u201cIf we don\u2019t support people, (a change is) not going to happen by magic,\u201d said Mufarej, who started the investment firm Tarpon Investimentos. \nA recent Agora! event in Campo Limpo, a low-income neighborhood of Sao Paulo, underlined the challenges of building a movement from the ground up. \nThe 15 people who sat in a circle were initially reluctant when asked to talk about problems with Brazil\u2019s education system. But once they got going, it was hard to stop them. The moderator tried to steer the discussion toward solutions _ ideas that could eventually be part of the group\u2019s platform _ but the complaints kept pouring out. \nFor Cristiane Borges, who attended a recent Acredito event in another low-income neighborhood called Capao Redondo, this process of asking people what they want from their politicians is already a step in the right direction.

Elections in newly-created local bodies with wide-ranging power were concluded in September. Today, for the first ever, elections to the seven provinces in addition to the national parliament, will be concluded. \nAs much as 40 per cent of the national and provincial parliaments will be chosen through proportional representation, which is determined by the share of different ethnic groups in the country\u2019s population. Most importantly, with these elections Nepal has completed its transition from a unitary state to a federal republic. \nThese changes seemed improbable just a decade ago. Certainly, it will take many years for the impact of these changes to make their mark on the society. Today\u2019s elections are the first under the new Constitution, and proof of the fact that, at least on theory, Nepal\u2019s political system is modernizing. \nIn practice, not so much. The federal model is meant to address the marginalization that Nepal\u2019s diverse religious and ethnic groups \u2014 from Limbus in the east to Tharus in the west \u2014 have long felt by the rulers in Kathmandu. For decades, perhaps even centuries, the capital\u2019s politics has been dominated by high-caste Hindu men with roots in the hills \u2014 defined in the new Constitution as Khas Arya \u2014 that has tended towards monopolizing power at the exclusion of women, Dalits, Madhesis and janjatis or indigenous peoples who live in different parts of the country. The great promise of the federal system was that it would address at least some of the imbalances and make Nepal a more inclusive democracy. \nThe burden of that promise was heavy. How to federalize Nepal was the dominant issue in the Constitution-making process, except that the first Constituent Assembly dissolved in 2012 without framing a Constitution, leading to the second Assembly which was elected in 2013. \nBut is the new federal set-up, whose foundation is being laid by these elections, being gerrymandered to continue the dominance of the Khas Arya, in the new Nepal? That is the biggest fear of the less powerful communities, among them Madhesis and Tharus. These two groups had most fiercely opposed the provincial boundaries of the new constitution in 2015, a protest which led to a virtual blockade of goods in large parts of the Madhes and in which more than 50 people were killed. \nIn the state-led crackdown that followed, security forces carried out several human rights violations without impunity. For example, in the Tharu-majority Kailali district in the Terai, the crackdown by security forces after eight of their compatriots were killed by unknown masked men was so severe, that villagers protested the state persecution as being worse than during the \u201ccivil war\u201d period in Nepal. The republic acted just like the monarchy. With the transitional justice mechanisms to address war-time crimes in continued disarray, Tharus remain traumatised by those memories. \nThe situation was worse in the eastern and central Terai, where the Madhesi blockade, unofficially backed by India, backfired and fizzled out despite the fact that more than 50 Madhesi protesters were shot dead by security forces. \nNeither the Madhesis nor the Tharus have, in the new Constitution, secured the right to representation according to their population, which is a basic principle of democracy. \nCertainly, Constitution-making is the time a country takes to establish its most cherished principles. But in Kathmandu, the Constituent Assembly ratified the constitution in such a hurry, with the Speaker rattling off hundreds of articles in a day with no time for discussions, that the scene appeared rather more fitting for a dictatorship. \nDomestic and international pressure weighed in, compelling all parties to amend at least some of its most glaring inconsistencies, such as proportionately including all ethnic groups \u2013 allocating them quotas \u2013 in the state apparatus. But other equally disturbing features, ranging from the sexist and restrictive provisions on women\u2019s rights who cannot pass on citizenship rights to their children (only fathers can do so). \nThe essential problem, of changing state boundaries to reflect ethnic and language diversity was not touched, as the politically powerful Khas Arya in the \u2018pahad\u2019 wondered if the populous Madhesi would consolidate power if provincial boundaries were redrawn on the basis of ethnic populations. \nThe political parties seeking amendment to that provincial boundary clause in the Constitution, particularly the Madhesis, had a choice \u2013 boycott the elections and embark on a long struggle with the state or participate in the elections and hope for a share of state power. They chose elections. \nFor now, the new chapter looks suspiciously like the old. The dream of inclusion appears elusive in the new federal republic. The current prime minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, for example, is in his fourth stint and campaigning to get the post for the fifth time. Five former prime minister are also contesting, each aspiring to the same goal. All of them are Khas Arya \u2014 the same high-caste Hindu group that comprises one-third of the population that has held power in Kathmandu for more than two hundred years of the country\u2019s history. \nWith the exclusion of minorities, women, and sometimes even the young people in the major political parties, the run up to the election has been dull. All the big parties, controlled by men, have repeated the same development slogans Nepalis have been hearing for decades. Despite rampant discrimination and disparities, social justice just doesn\u2019t feature on their agenda. \nNeither does the terrible state of public education, health, or the raging crisis of unemployment that has made migrants out of millions of Nepali youth toiling in India, the Middle East, and Malaysia. In fact, the major parties have such low regard for the masses and public opinion that they have even fielded some well-known gangsters. This is not surprising. As the anti-corruption crusader Dr Govinda KC points out, the politicians \u2014 not to mention the power wielders in other state organs \u2014 have invested heavily in for-profit education, healthcare, and labour-exporting companies. \nNevertheless, given how rigid and centralized political power has operated in Nepal, today\u2019s elections are an important milestone. For the first time history, the institutional design favors devolution of power. With time, provinces and local bodies will realize the extent and limits of their power and bargain hard with rulers in Kathmandu for more policy autonomy to manage resources and development planning. \nIn the context of the politics of the last decade, no matter how reluctant the reactionary establishment was in delaying the state restructuring promised in the peace agreement that ended the civil war, these elections represent a victory for those seeking a more inclusive democracy. For the new federal system to yield results for the poor and the marginalized, one can only hope that the people who get to vote \u2014 for millions of internal and external migrants are disenfranchised \u2014 vote wisely to choose a new generation of leaders.

The team also revealed the full map of Miramar, which contains eight cities varying in size and layout. More details about the cities can be found here .\n\u2018We are excited beyond words that we can finally share the name of our new desert map and tell you a little bit about some of the places you can visit. When we decided to create a new map, we focused on creating an environment that is very different from Erangel . We wanted to go the opposite direction of having lush fields and forests and arrived at the harsh and unforgiving desert of what we can now reveal is Miramar. The unique terrain and dense urban areas of Miramar will create a new Battle Royale experience where the old strategies may no longer work and new tactics are required. \u2018 \nCheck out the map of Miramar below:\nIn terms of a release date, Bluehole says that it will be playable during the final test round before the full PC release. This means that it, unfortunately, won\u2019t be ready for the Xbox One launch on December 12. PUBG is out now for PC, and will release for Xbox One December 12th.

This feature provides protection to investors by shielding them from changes in the underlying index. The bond's cash flows are adjusted to ensure that the holder of the bond receives a known real rate of return . \nAn index-linked bond is also known as a real return bond in Canada, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) in the US, and a linker in the UK. BREAKING DOWN 'Index-Linked Bond' \nA bond investor holds a bond with a fixed level of interest rate. The interest payments, known as coupons , are usually paid semi-annually and represent the bondholder\u2019s return on investing in the bond. However, as time goes by, inflation also increases, thereby, eroding the value of the investor\u2019s annual return. This is unlike returns on equity and property, in which dividend and rental income increases with inflation. To mitigate the impact of inflation, index-linked bonds are issued by the government. \nAn index-linked bond is a bond which has its coupon payments adjusted for inflation by linking the payments to some inflation indicator, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the Retail Price Index (RPI). These interest-bearing investments typically pay the investors a real yield plus accrued inflation, providing a hedge against inflation. The yield, payment, and principal amount are calculated in real terms, not nominal numbers. One can think of the CPI as the exchange rate that converts the return on a bond investment to real return. \nFor example, consider two investors \u2013 one purchases a regular bond and another buys an index-linked bond. Both bonds are issued and purchased for $100 in November 2017, and have the same terms \u2013 4% coupon rate, 1 year to maturity, and $100 face value. The CPI level at the time of issuance is 204. \nThe regular bond pays annual interest of 4% x $100 = $4, and the principal amount of $100 is repaid at maturity. At maturity, the principal and the interest payment due, that is, $100 + $4 = $104, will be credited to the bondholder. \nAssuming the CPI level in November 2018 is 207, the interest and principal value must be adjusted for inflation with the index-linked bond. Coupon payments are calculated using an inflation-adjusted principal amount, and an indexation factor is used to determine the inflation adjusted principal amount. For a given date, the indexation factor is defined as the CPI value for the given date divided by the CPI at the original issue date of the bond. The indexation factor in our example is 207/204 = 1.0147. Therefore, the inflation rate is 1.47%, and the bondholder will receive $104 x 1.0147 = $105.53 when it matures. \nThe annual interest rate on the bond is [($105.53 - $100.00)/$100.00] x 100% = 5.53%. The investor\u2019s approximate real return rate can be calculated as 5.53% nominal rate \u2013 1.47% inflation rate = 4.06%. \nThis type of bond is valuable to investors because the real value of the bond is known from purchase and the risk involved with uncertainty is eliminated. These bonds are also less volatile than nominal bonds and help investors to maintain their purchasing power.

Qualcomm\u2019s latest chip features a range of improvements to help it deal with artificial intelligence tasks like recognizing and categorizing images, Keith Kressin, a senior vice president at the company, told Reuters in an interview. \nFor the first time, Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon chip also features physically separate processor called a \u201cSecure Processing Unit\u201d for storing information like fingerprints and iris scans, similar to the technology found on Apple\u2019s iPhone. Previous Qualcomm chips had a \u201ctrusted zone\u201d that was not physically separate from the rest of the processor. \u201cWith biometric identification on the rise, it was important to take (security) to the next level,\u201d Kressin said. \nThe company tweaked various parts of the chip for so-called machine learning applications. While that includes things consumers might notice like image recognition, it also includes behind-the-scenes improvements. For example, the chip will help ensure that a user\u2019s fingers do not accidentally register as taps when gripping the sides of an edge-to-edge display. \nKressin said the chip will also help phones register touch screen inputs when wet. That is a critical improvement because even though many top phone models from Samsung and others are now water resistant, they are difficult to operate with water on the screen. \nThe newest Snapdragon also has features aimed at virtual and augmented reality headsets. One feature called \u201cAdreno foveation\u201d will let the edges of a headset screen operate at lower resolutions while the center of the screen is sharper, similar to how human peripheral vision is fuzzier than central vision. The technique can save battery live, Kressin said. \nQualcomm does not disclose revenue figures for its Snapdragon chips. But they are an increasingly important part of its business because its lucrative patent licensing business is under attack in a series of legal actions from Apple. Qualcomm is also facing a $103 billion takeover bid from Broadcom Ltd, which earlier this week said it would nominate a slate of directors to Qualcomm\u2019s board.

The \u201cSouth-South Human Rights Forum\u201d drawing some 300 participants from over 50 mostly developing countries, which follows a conference of political parties, took place last weekend in Beijing attended by hundreds of delegates, some of whom sung the praises of Communist Party rule. \nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the recently concluded Communist Party congress had \u201cidentified the goal of forging a new field in international relations and building a community of shared future for mankind.\u201d \n\u201cThis is China\u2019s answer to the question of where human society is heading, and it has also presented opportunities for the development of the human rights cause,\u201d Wang said. \nThe approach comes as the US turns inward under President Donald Trump, who has set aside traditional US advocacy of democracy and human rights in favor of an \u201cAmerica first\u201d program. That has seen Washington withdraw from key forums from the Paris climate agreement to negotiations on a UN migration compact. \nChina\u2019s growing confidence on the world stage on issues like human rights are related to the broader global trends, said William Nee, an Amnesty International researcher on China. \u201cObviously we\u2019ve seen the Trump administration deprioritize human rights, we\u2019ve seen issues like Brexit, and China is kind of stepping in the field and void,\u201d he said. \nParticipants in the forum were mostly government officials, diplomats and academics from developing nations, along with representatives from the United Nations, the Arab League, the African Union, World Bank and World Health Organization. \nChina has long rejected traditional notions of human rights as defined by the Universal Declaration and Western constitutions, redefining the concept along the more prosaic lines of the right to development, health and housing. \nThe forum comes at a time when Chinese authorities are overseeing the most severe crackdown on activists and dissidents in decades that has drawn criticism from Western governments. \n\u201cChina has tried to promote the idea that first you must have development, and only if your country develops, can you then meaningfully have human rights,\u201d Nee said. \n\u201cFreedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, these are things that have come under severe constraints in China recent years,\u201d he added. \nThe city of Beijing has also been criticized domestically over the evictions of tens of thousands of Chinese migrant workers over recent weeks. Officials have said they are addressing safety hazards after a fire killed 19 people, but the efforts have drawn attention to unfairness in a system that controls where people may live and denies rural Chinese migrants access to education, housing and medical subsidies that are granted to residents of the wealthier cities. \nRecent years have seen the party advocate a wholesale rejection of \u201cuniversal values\u201d as merely a weapon to undermine China\u2019s socialist system. Universities have been told to drive such concepts from the classrooms and writers and scholars who argue otherwise can find themselves shunned and unemployed. \nThe ideological push dovetails with China\u2019s economic strategy of outward expansion, spearheaded by Xi\u2019s signature \u201cbelt and road initiative\u201d that seeks to bind China to the rest of Asia, Europe and Africa through a trillion-dollar program of ports, roads, railways, power stations and other massive projects. Rare is the occasion on which Chinese officials from Xi on down fail to mention the plan in front of an international audience.

Moving towards developing our learnings and the learnings of others. This was evident at an event we had yesterday: a graduation ceremony for interpreters that provide interpretation to the clinical team in their therapeutic work with clients who speak French, Swahili, Kinyaruwandi, Lingala, Amaric and Somali. The event followed the interpreters completing an introductory course in interpreting skills at the WITS Language school.\nI recall the beginning of this journey, as interpreters were filled with feelings of anxiety and concern. \u2018im too old to go back to school\u2019, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can do this\u2019, \u2018if I fail I have to pay back the money, where will I get this money?\u2019. Concerns around time commitments and being able to pass were noted.\nThis may seem like normal concerns and anxieties before one embarks on an academic venture, but what you need to understand is this is no ordinary group of individuals. These are individuals that come from war torn countries and have been able to survive in an environment often known for its xenophobic sentiments. They face many challenges as they navigate personal, family and communal life on a daily basis. So embarking on this journey was no easy task. Our Executive Director (Nomfundo Mogapi) captured the perseverance of their human spirit best by acknowledging their endurance in their home country, coming to South Africa which has given them good and bad experiences and making a life despite the bad experiences. Contributing to a country which has been unwelcoming at times and being a part of the change they want to see in the world and in South Africa.\nAs I watched them go through the course and there life journey, I marveled at their spirit. Their willingness and ability to engage with the content and be present and still do life. It made me reflect on my own resistance to re-entering the academic realm or creating change in my status quo, and yes I feel-\u2018l im too old\u2019, \u2018I got a lot on my plate\u2019 (kids, family responsibilities, bills), \u2018how will I manage to study and work at the same time\u2019 and \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can do this now\u2019. And then I think about these women and men, whom have been dealt a bad hand, not of their own choice and continue to persevere, continue to find meaning in life, continue to seize opportunities and work towards a better future. Continue to give life their all and all my reasons seem mundane. And so these words come to mind: The power of the human spirit prevails, it is self- doubt that keeps us stagnant.\nWritten by: Sumaiya Mohamed", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nomfundo mogapi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sumaiya mohamed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amaric", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "study of violence and reconciliation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lingala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kinyaruwandi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:58.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2cd013fbfccdc0a2aa36ffaf7414fd40b2bfb19f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjKETTmcQmnvKbL_.a9nluxzQkQEOlwDecBN9kamqDlbla9OHePmrE9iAyU4IM__V__S765jjuwz4vjRPR1xC12nb9lEhk.DPXeUILjHT3bbTPwONpCyndrMvrAx_XK2BSX9avttyQX2g", "site_full": "www.startribune.com", "site": "startribune.com", "site_section": "http://www.startribune.com/opinion/index.rss2", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Opinion", "title": "Opioid crisis \u2014 the human cost: Pharmaceutical companies must be held accountable", "title_full": "Opioid crisis \u2014 the human cost: Pharmaceutical companies must be held accountable - StarTribune.com", "published": "2017-12-06T01:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 47, "participants_count": 26, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_151251660577376.jpg?h=630&amp;w=1200&amp;fit=crop&amp;bg=999&amp;crop=faces", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4035, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8a42fd0e42d68c61e57f13b7042c35a6495d0c0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjKETTmcQmnvKbL_.a9nluxzQkQEOlwDecBN9kamqDlbla9OHePmrE9iAyU4IM__V__S765jjuwz4vjRPR1xC12nb9lEhk.DPXeUILjHT3bbTPwONpCyndrMvrAx_XK2BSbQ9plCU_8ijBrnal4ljXLg-", "ord_in_thread": 21, "author": "mdachs", "published": "2017-12-06T19:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "@ birchtree Completely disagree with you.
