We have a tremendous amount of respect for LAW because they have become the #1 highest rated alliance on gamma, and have held that position for a sustained period of time. We at ORION wish to hold that spot now.. well... at least to get closer to it than we are.\n2. We like the fact that LAW has been nice about our farming their inactives; therefore we wish to get more goods from their active players.\n3. Our MDP partner, QED declared as well and we wish to support them in their effort.\nWe will end this war when one or more of the following conditions are met:\n1. Half of LAW's membership joins ORION.\n2. LAW's leader or diplomat posts in this thread that ORION is #1 on gamma, regardless of what the points show.\n3. Our MDP partner, QED, gets tired of fighting and calls quits to the war.\nWe like LAW a lot... seriously... in spite of our tongue-in-cheek trash-talking in that other thread. Hopefully, we will get a chance to show LAW just how much we like them by taking lots and lots of stuff so we can upgrade our buildings!\nSee you all on the battlefield.

Quote: Go to Page Top Bobuido Guest\n10 Oct 30th 2010, 8:29pm\nThe point is not always being at war but being at war enough to stop the game stagnating\nI fully support LAW in not starting wars or picking on the little guys - That's totally fine, in fact it's great\nWhat I don't support them in is not helping the little guys - Or even the big guys that have the whole server on them\nFor the biggest alliance in the game to not come to the aid of the underdog is just totally weak IMO\nAs for Orion, we fought QED in addition to our wars with WAR and EG. Does it get much tougher on Gamma?\nWhile it pains me somewhat to say it, WAR probably have more dedicated fighters than LAW. They may have been slightly smaller than Orion but they put on a dam good show and I respect them for that - Despite my individual issues with some of their guys\nI hope that answers your questions Kev' Quote: Go to Page Top kevin jan2 Wanderer\nPosts 1,676 11 Oct 30th 2010, 8:45pm\nok when I talked to one of the leaders in ORION a while ago he said they didn't have plans to declare on QED thats not to say you fought undeclared Idk.

I'll be happy if we there are good fights because it shows the server is more active than I think and that LAW can fight and I'll be happy if there aren't any fights and only pillages.\nAren't we placing a deadline or something?

Notice the out come was not the same as THR.\nOrion simply couldn't fight LAW alone - We never claimed we could\nI guess you can say the same for QED as your presence in the fight confirms.\nEven farmers and builders have the ability to take up arms. Whether farmers and builders (LAW) can take on a seasoned military alliance of a similar size (QED)\nPlus Orion and other allies. SO you say that QED verses LAW seems like an even match. Then why do you jump the fight?\nWell...that's what we're here to find out\nIf you want to be number one and QED wants to be number one then when do you turn on each other? I am guessing when and if QED hits the number one spot.\nI find it funny how it always takes 2 or more \"MILITARY ALLIANCES \"(QED+ORION for now) to take out the \"FARMERS\"(LAW) the whole time stating they want to be number 1 but cant get the spot with out the aid of others. I saw this happen with THR. THR however dug their own grave by thinking they could just out last the war alliances and didnt fight. Had they chose to do so I recall a few alliances saying they would have joined on THR's side. LAW however has shown the ability to fight. This caused the restructuring of QED and its finding of allies to aide in taking down LAW. So to be the big dog in Gamma means to have the fleas and ticks work as one to achieve their goal. Its all good in the end, just be sure you write the history the way it goes and dont give all the credit to one alliance.\nRaven Quote: Go to Page Top Bobuido Guest\n18 Nov 1st 2010, 6:03pm\nDude take your head out the sand for a second and order your farm hands to stop digging your alliance's grave\nLook at the CR reports. How many Orion attacks on LAW do you see? On military matters I speak for Orion and I can wholeheartedly say I, Orion's General, have not been fully participating in this war. Not yet. I want it to be a fair fight. In fact, I've personally attacked two empty ports - To try and downsize my fleet.That's it! I have organised zero attacks. I have been an observer. As Orion have had no attacks, I have responded in kind and put little effort in thus far. What I have been gauging is, does QED actually need our help? Don't forget you're the ones saying don't underestimate LAW! So QED didn't - They got security! My answer so far is, no, QED does not need Orion.\nWithout my frothy mouthed rallying calls and organisation you will not see the full force of Orion. An attack here or there from a bored warrior maybe. So way to go aggravating the only person who's holding back the tide. I'm sure LAW will thank you.\nI was originally planning to do exactly the same with CER and The League. If The Ls prove themselves to be utterly incompetent I'm not going to go all out on them. I have nothing against them...yet. Contrary to popular belief I do have more important things to do than spend every waking hour organising people in a virtual war.\nGiven The League, your allies, are actually 5 alliances - I fail to see why you're crying about this being an unfair fight. I am deeply insulted that you compare your war to THRs. For a start THR were not given the opportunities that have been so kindly laid out before you. Secondly we had QED, EG, WAR, 300, CKA vs THR. How in any of the infinite dimensions does that compare? Let me also remind you - Your alliance sat on its ass and did absolutely nothing to help THR. So if you want to bring up what's fair! I'll slap you around with \"Bob's History of Gamma\" all day long. In case you care, it would be volume one and the hard bound edition.\nAs for the stirring, how stupid do you think Orion and QED are? Again, do you seek to insult and aggravate? Of course both alliances understand there is a real possibility that in the future we will be at war... some day. Firstly, it doesn't have to happen that way - LAW certainly didn't fight their way to the top! What makes you think we have to? Secondly, who the hell cares if we do. Unlike some people, we both understand what this game is about. If we do clash it will be with exactly that element of mutual respect and we will both live to fight another day. The score boards are forever changing. Of course one day we might step over friends and allies to move up but it will be done with care, respect and also with a lot less whining.\nIt seems to me most alliances that get utterly destroyed often have a hand in it themselves.\nCongratulations on trolling for my most spectacular rant yet. You win my undivided attention. Quote: Go to Page Top faythwalkerhsl Guest\n19 Nov 1st 2010, 6:10pm\nGood points by Bobuido. We have been trying to keep this from being a one-sided everyone against THR type of feel. WAR is one of our main alliaes and hasnt even declared. Cer declared but ONLY against the league. Orion has declared but has been holding back.\nSo far we have been handling it pretty well. LAW definitely has big numbers both in players and generals and also in resources. They are aquiting themselves fairly well, when you consider many havent fought much. The biggest battle of the war however was with nearly all the major players in L-KLK hitting one town. You will notice that even with minimal QED participation we won 29k generals to 20k generals. And there were a dozen battles surrounding that one with us winning by huge margins. Given that most LAW are either not aware there is a war yet or are trying to lay low, and most KLK are improperly deploying their troops, there is no need to bum-rush people. If Orion and our other allies decide to play a larger role, great, if not, thats cool too. QED doesnt expect anyone to hand it first place. We need to go out and earn it. Quote: Go to Page Top Brasco Guest\n20 Nov 1st 2010, 10:23pm\nGuys, guys, guys... you seem to be jumping to conclusion. Raven is a WoH player, not LAW!\nApologies for not addressing you sooner, it's hard to think of Orion as an enemy, so we have been neglecting our war with you. You are quite right, QED are a handful, as anyone would expect, but so were 300 and CKA together. We are quite used to fighting opposition a similar size to us, in fact we are much more comfortable with that.\nThings get messy when you start mixing up the flow of the two wars. You have both declared on us independently and for different reasons, so it makes sense to try cross the stream as little as possible That is just a request, but I think the casual observer would prefer that issues weren't repeated on both threads. We have the Gamma public to entertain after all.\nQuote: : Cer declared but ONLY against the league.\nNot strictly true, they have declared on L-KLK. LAW is actually part of the League.\nQuote: : So far we have been handling it pretty well. LAW definitely has big numbers\n205million FTW!\nQuote: : Given that most LAW are either not aware there is a war yet or are trying to lay low\nThis is a fascinating comment, not even I know what proportion of LAW are reading the circ. I hope it's true, because if they really aren't battle ready, or asleep, I'm really looking forward to our General's score once they wake up\nSame as Bobuido I did half-heartly hit an empty Orion town on the first day, but I'll be honest, it just felt wrong. I've always liked Orion and they have acquitted themselves admirably after coming under constant attack from a much larger alliance. They have my respect for that and I have always been on friendly terms with my Orion neighbours, so it all seems a bit weird. I really hope we can have a friendly war with you guys sometime... I'm trying now with the best of intentions, but there seems to be some inertia to just having a laugh. Maybe I'm just being paranoid. Anyway, I know you guys are quite good at doing war without complaining (CKA were too) so hope you can help with that\nP.S. Just checked, and this is actually the first post by a LAW player on this thread. Apologies for that, it's been kinda busy lol The post was edited 3 times, last by Brasco ( Nov 1st 2010, 10:56pm ).\nQuote: Go to Page Top 1 Page 1 of 9 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Share Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Google Plus 0 Reddit 0 Users Online 1 1 Guest\nIkariam EN \u00bb Forum \u00bb Archives \u00bb Ikariam - The Old Worlds (Archive) \u00bb Ikariam - World Gamma \u00bb Conflict Archive \u00bb Legal Notice Terms of Use Privacy Policy Go to Page Top Dec 8th 2017, 11:36am\nGameforge Forum Software: Burning Board\u00ae , developed by WoltLab\u00ae GmbH \u00a9 2008 by Gameforge 4D GmbH.

Eric Buschow says flames have been creeping closer and slowly surrounding the town of Ojai (OH\u2019hi), and on Tuesday night increasing winds brought them close enough to expand evacuation orders there. \nFlames, now about 4 miles away, were visible from the city\u2019s downtown for the first time on Tuesday night, and ash was raining down. \nParts of Ojai were already under evacuation orders, and the entire valley surrounding it had been under a voluntary evacuation advisory since the fire broke out on Monday. \nThe new evacuations meant most of the town of about 7,000 people was under mandatory orders. \nNearly 30,000 people are under evacuation orders for the fire. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n7:50 p.m. \nThe largest and most destructive wildfire in Southern California has grown to 140 square miles and fire officials say the worst may be yet to come. \nThe 90,000-acre fire burning in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles has swept through ridges and canyons to the sea and Santa Ana winds that drove it are expected to return with a vengeance overnight. \nState fire director Ken Pimlott says winds that eased in the afternoon could return with gusts up to 80 mph Thursday that would make it impossible to fight the fire. \nDozens of homes have burned since the blaze erupted Monday. Nearly 1,800 firefighters and a fleet of aircraft are fighting the flames but the blaze is only 5 percent contained and an estimated 12,000 buildings are in danger. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n6:20 p.m. \nA wildfire in a wealthy western area of Los Angeles has reached the estate and winery owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch. \nRoxanne Langer at Moraga Vineyards in Bel Air says a temperature-controlled wine storage shed burned after the fire erupted before dawn Wednesday but it\u2019s unclear how much wine was lost. \nShe says firefighters stepped in to douse the flames with the aid of helicopters and that other storage sheds, the winery itself and the estate\u2019s unoccupied house are not damaged. \nThe winery has been evacuated. \nMurdoch bought the property for about $30 million in 2013. \nLanger says it appears the 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines suffered only slight damage and the grapes already had been harvested. \nIn a Facebook statement, Murdoch says some neighbors suffered heavy losses and his thoughts and prayers are with them. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n3:45 p.m. \nFirefighters have stopped the spread of a wildfire that has destroyed homes near the world-famous Getty museum in Los Angeles. \nDeputy Fire Chief Charles Butler says firefighters and aircraft stopped the growth of the 475-acre (192-hectare) blaze in the Bel Air neighborhood. \nThere are currently few visible flames and crews are concentrating on the southwest corner of the fire. \nButler says four homes have been destroyed and 11 damaged since the blaze erupted before dawn Wednesday in an area that includes many hilltop mansions. \nAbout 700 homes, an apartment building and a school have been ordered evacuated. \nNortheast winds driving the flames eased by afternoon but are expected to return in full force Wednesday night. Firefighters are struggling to ring the blaze before that happens. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n3:15 p.m. \nCalifornia\u2019s top firefighter says the state is in for the worst Santa Ana wind conditions it\u2019s ever seen. \nKen Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, says the wind wildfire threat to Southern California for Thursday is purple. The has color has never been used before, means there is extreme danger and that fires that erupt will burn uncontrollably. \nBelow that is red, meaning high danger of fires that burn rapidly and intensely and are difficult to control. \nPimlott says the winds could hit 80 mph (129 kph) and make it impossible to fight Southern California wildfires that have destroyed at least 200 homes and buildings. \nFive wind-driven flames continue to threaten homes in Ventura and Los Angeles. Some 200,000 people are under evacuation orders. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n1:25 p.m. \nThe University of California, Los Angeles, has canceled classes for the rest of the day due to difficult traffic problems stemming from a wildfire. \nThe university\u2019s website says many students, faculty and staff have been unable to reach the campus Wednesday, so classes from noon onward are canceled. \nThe athletics department says a night men\u2019s basketball game and all other team workouts and practices are canceled. \nThe fire erupted before dawn in the Sepulveda Pass, just up Interstate 405 from UCLA. The fire has destroyed some homes as it spread into the Bel Air area. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n10 a.m. \nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti says at least four and possibly six homes have been destroyed by a wildfire in the city\u2019s Bel Air area. \nThe fire erupted before dawn Wednesday in Sepulveda Pass, a major commuter route between the west side of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to the north. \nThe fire burned up hillsides on the east side of the pass into expensive neighborhoods that are now under evacuation orders. \nThe mayor says the fire is now 150 acres with zero containment. \nSome 500 firefighters are battling the fire along with water-dropping helicopters and airplanes laying down streams of fire retardant. \nThe dangerous Santa Ana winds that have fanned fires across Southern California this week have diminished over the new LA fire but conditions are very dry, with just 9 percent relative humidity. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n9:15 a.m. \nPresident Donald Trump says his thoughts and prayers \u201care with everyone\u201d in the path of California\u2019s latest wildfires. \nTrump in a tweet is also encouraging everyone \u201cto heed the advice and orders of local and state officials\u201d and thanking first responders for their \u201cincredible work!\u201d \nWind-driven fires have raced through California communities for the second time in two months, leaving hundreds of homes feared lost and uprooting tens of thousands of people. \nThe most damaging fire is in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, where more than 100 square miles (259 sq. kilometers) and numerous homes have burned. \nDeadly fires tore through Northern California earlier this year. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n8:03 a.m. \nThe biggest and most destructive of several wildfires burning in Southern California has scorched more than 101 square miles. \nState fire authorities say the fire burning in Ventura County about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles is also considered a threat to 12,000 structures Wednesday. \nDozens of homes have burned since the fire erupted Monday amid fierce Santa Ana winds. \nA new fire burning among ridges and canyons on the west side of Los Angeles has also burned several homes while snarling morning commuter traffic. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n7:35 a.m. \nTwo homes are burning in a wildfire that has erupted in an exclusive ridge-top neighborhood in Los Angeles, the latest to hit fire-plagued Southern California. \nThe fire broke out before dawn Wednesday on the east side of Interstate 405 in the Sepulveda Pass and raced up steep slopes into neighborhoods at the top. \nThe Los Angeles Fire Department has deployed hundreds of firefighters and called in helicopters and airplanes. \nEvacuations have been ordered and a wider area has been told to be ready for orders to leave. \nIt\u2019s the same region of Los Angeles where hundreds of homes burned in the famous 1961 Bel Air Fire. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n6:52 a.m. \nMandatory evacuations have been ordered in an exclusive ridge-top neighborhood in Los Angeles as a dangerous new wildfire burns in Southern California. \nThe fire erupted before dawn Wednesday on the east side of Sepulveda Pass, which carries heavily traveled Interstate 405 through the Santa Monica Mountains on the city\u2019s western side. \nHelicopters are making water drops and more than 200 firefighters are battling flames close to homes. \nIn addition to the mandatory evacuations, Los Angeles Fire Department spokeswoman Margaret Stewart says a wider area on the east side of the pass has been advised to get ready in case of evacuation orders. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n5:35 a.m. \nA brush fire has erupted on the west side of Los Angeles along Interstate 405 in Sepulveda Pass. \nFire Department spokesman Margaret Stewart says the fire was reported at 4:52 a.m. Wednesday and is burning uphill, driven by topography rather than winds. \nStewart says 47 firefighters are on the scene, setting up protection for homes at the top of the steep slopes. Two firefighting helicopters have been assigned. \nSepulveda Pass carries heavily traveled Interstate 405 through the Santa Monica Mountains between the western neighborhoods of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to the north. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n12:40 a.m. \nThe same vicious winds that made three Southern California wildfires so destructive are also making the firefight itself more difficult. \nThe water-dropping planes and helicopters essential to fighting massive fires have been mostly grounded because it\u2019s too dangerous to fly in the strong gusts. \nCommanders hoped to have them back in the air on Wednesday morning, but all indications are the winds will be whipping then too. \nThe blazes brought evacuation orders for nearly 200,000 people, destroyed nearly 200 homes and have remained mostly out control. \nThe largest and most destructive of the blazes, an 85-square-mile wildfire in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, had nearly reached the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday night after starting 30 miles inland a day earlier. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "langer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric garcetti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pimlott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murdoch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roxanne langer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles butler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rupert murdoch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric buschow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stewart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken pimlott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margaret stewart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "butler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fire department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california department of forestry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles fire department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sepulveda pass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bel air", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ojai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moraga vineyards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa ana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa monica mountains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bel air fire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san fernando valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:17.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "54a257d3ec6ad0cafa841e3e0e48dcb954f933c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRPR28g.CHL1oaJqG5mp6WZp50_52vry0v4HrW3nGddl_kG4CHl6VicCVPO8X7V0R8DCWTAiTK.7_EwRCXUm0_oEBxwMNca8e70XLT1IzFJdTD8rzEP1reYQdXR5aOvBJ5NG6g1.S498A--", "site_full": "bilingualproject.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://bilingualproject.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Proletariats(the working class) in the Industrial Revolution \u2013 bilingualproject", "title": "Proletariats(the working class) in the Industrial Revolution", "title_full": "Proletariats(the working class) in the Industrial Revolution", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "54a257d3ec6ad0cafa841e3e0e48dcb954f933c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRPR28g.CHL1oaJqG5mp6WZp50_52vry0v4HrW3nGddl_kG4CHl6VicCVPO8X7V0R8DCWTAiTK.7_EwRCXUm0_oEBxwMNca8e70XLT1IzFJdTD8rzEP1reYQdXR5aOvBJ5NG6g1.S498A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JaviOV", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "Proletariats(the working class) in the Industrial Revolution", "text": "Hi people!

December 7, 2017 13:10 GMT Fergie has opened up about her past addiction with crystal meth Kevin Winter/Getty Images \nFergie is one of the most famous solo female artists in the world following her successful stint in pop group The Black Eyed Peas, but she also battled with addiction during her rise to fame. \nThe 42-year-old singer, real name Stacy Ann Ferguson, suffered from symptoms of psychosis and dementia due to her drug addiction to methamphetamine \u2013 commonly known as crystal meth. She begun the drug habit while performing with Wild Orchid, and her addiction followed her after she left the band in 2001. \nThe mother-of-one, who was reported to have separated from her husband of eight years Josh Duhamel in September, gave an honest insight into her mental health troubles, including dependency issues and life after her split from the Las Vegas actor. \nRaising awareness about the consequences of drug addiction, Fergie told i newspaper: \"At my lowest point, I was [suffering from] chemically-induced psychosis and dementia. \n\"I was basically hallucinating on a daily basis. It took a year after getting off that particular drug for the chemicals in my brain to settle so that I actually stopped seeing things. I'd just be sitting there, seeing a random bee or a bunny.\" \nFergie conquered her demons and now lives a healthy lifestyle. She continued: \"The drugs thing, it was a hell of a lot of fun... until it wasn't. But you know what, I thank the day it happened to me. Because that's my strength, my faith, my hope for something better.\" \nThe LA Love hitmaker, who shares son Axl with Duhamel, also touched on how she is coping as a single mother, and was candid about juggling work with the separation. \nShe said: \"I've just released my first solo album in 11 years, and I'm out promoting it. So there's really a lot going on. That's why we wanted to find our footing with our separation before we announced it publicly: to make sure we really got it together for our kid.\" \nProving that she is just like any other working mother who feels guilt while spending time apart from her son, Fergie is grateful for modern technology to keep them connected. Actor Josh Duhamel and actress/singer Fergie announced their separation on 14 September Alberto E. Rodriguez / Getty \nShe added: \"Thank the Lord for FaceTime! Because both Josh and I are working full-time right now. If you're a full-time working parent, you'll know what we're experiencing. \n\"It gets tough and we get tired, but we're trying our hardest to make sure that kid feels nothing around him but love.\" \nFergie began dating Duhamel in 2004 after she met him when The Black Eyed Peas filmed a cameo for an episode of his show Las Vegas. They became engaged in 2007 and married in a Catholic ceremony in January 2009.

But destroyed some other threat. It also seems to be suggesting that atleast Jin and Malos (Possibly Akhos as well) were around 500 years ago. As well as Cole/Minoth. So they somehow have the ability to extend their lives. Whether this is due solely to the Ether manipulation they discussed or something else I'm not sure.\nNow combine the knowledge from earlier that Blades revert to crystals when their Driver is killed. And the fact that people from 500 years ago are still alive and suddenly it seems likly Pyra's original Driver Addam is still alive.\nI think Addam is Jin. He was around 500 years ago. He doesn't seem to have his own blade. He's also masked and hasn't interacted with Pyra yet.\nWhich makes me think Torna is basically trying to reenact their actions of 500 years ago and push back some other threat at the cost of mass destruction of continents. Pyra seems to suggest with Cole that she wants to avoid having to do this but seems willing to do so if there is no other option.\nNow we'll see how long until the game throws a curveball that throws out most of that speculation.\nHeh, you must've just found the theater and not played like 10 minutes after that part. Biggest, longest series of cutscenes I can remember in a recent game, and I really enjoyed it.\nYou may not want to read this yet if you haven't progressed, but for me, still just having crossed over into chapter 4, this is my speculation/observation:\nJin looks like the guy who climbed the world tree and brought back Pyra and Malos's cores. It's probably him but these games tend to have identical twin brothers and stuff so who knows.\nI believe that Addam is somehow related to Rex, considering at the start they had to break the seal from whichever hometown Rex was from. I mean this is kind of obvious but I take the game at face value on this.\nCole said something about how being a blade mixed with human cells was supposed to give them special powers...I'm not sure at this point if Cole's driver is actually still alive, or if the implication is that he is his own driver, and so the botched experiment was supposed to make him immortal. Anyway, his deal reminded me of what happened to Rex to save his life, so I assume Rex is sort of considered half-driver-half-blade at this point and has special powers because of it. It'll shield him from something at a clutch moment.\nThe scenes only showed Jin activating Malos, but who activated Pyra? Why would he do one and not the other? I'm curious whether he actually activated both and somehow she rebelled against him to fight against Malos, and her unique status as a godlike blade allowed her to bond with Rex too. Because then that sets up a great conflict for endgame - if they kill Jin, yeah it'll save the world, but Pyra will lose all her memories and it will be super sad. But then it will turn out that because she shared half her life with Rex, she remembers all the time spent with him, even though she lost everything before that point, so she gets to forget the terrible destruction from 500 years earlier and can be at peace.\nYeah sounds about right. I kinda figured there would be another bunch of plot after the bit at the inn but I needed sleep. I guess I'll find out more tonight.\nI did however make time for Tora's play. Because this group clearly has their priorities in order\nSteam ID", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sin01108273"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:18.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "374ad91f62688ce7848cf105249f13df4ddbc9ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMlzClsRkXd0SzSbTlgcvXI_lx3CBNxGIYo7sRQQS1x.pJ2puynDNAx2FyS_BQ0iO5q3Odsh2laKm8xsILv9qJ08tUxGyVeh09kQ--", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[Xenoblade Chronicles 2] Launching on Switch on December 1st! 28", "title_full": "[Xenoblade Chronicles 2] Launching on Switch on December 1st! - Page 28 \u2014 Penny Arcade", "published": "2017-12-07T05:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/8DDBNVR065TV.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8253, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7790af588e0ab940bd1e934f5e7d33ca7ae53628", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMlzClsRkXd0SzSbTlgcvXI_lx3CBNxGIYo7sRQQS1x.pJ2puynDNAx2FyS_BQ0iO5q3Odsh2laKm8xsILv9qJ08uWH301ecfJlEsd0kLBLBs6", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "Donnicton", "published": "2017-12-07T08:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Level 4s activate a different way than filling the bar.

Close Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho offers solution to Romelu Lukaku's goal drought Hayters \nVincent Kompany was withdrawn from the Manchester City squad ahead of their Champions League tie against Shakhtar Donetsk just days before the derby clash with Manchester United . \nKompany, 31, made the 2,000 mile trip to Kharkiv this week with the rest of the City squad after being rested in the 2-1 victory over West Ham United on Sunday (3 December) \u2013 with Pep Guardiola perhaps also choosing to take him out of the firing line having collected four bookings this season. \nThe skipper was expected to start at the heart of defence in City's final group game on Wednesday but was instead a notable omission from the squad, with midfielder Fernandinho dropping back to partner Eliaquim Mangala as the Premier League leaders suffered their first defeat of the season. \nKompany's omission will spark fears over his availability for the trip to Old Trafford on Sunday. Guardiola explained post-match: \"Kompany didn't feel good,\" the Manchester Evening News report . \"I wanted to make him play, but he didn't feel good so it was an opportunity for the others to play.\" \nFabaian Delph was another notable absentee on Wednesday night. The former Leeds United starlet has impressed on the left in the absence of Benjamin Mendy and was set to start against Paulo Fonseca's side only to be ruled out by illness. \n\"Fabian Delph was going to play but vomited yesterday,\" Guardiola said. \nNicolas Otamendi and Kyle Walker meanwhile both travelled and were named on the bench but were not called upon by their manager. \nDavid Silva meanwhile did not make the trip to Ukraine. The Spain international suffered a knock after scoring the winner against David Moyes' side last Sunday with Guardiola revealing earlier this week the decision to leave him back in Manchester was an enforced one. \n\"David Silva has a little problem \u2013 I don't know whether he will recover for Sunday,\" Guardiola said . \"He felt uncomfortable after his goal [against West Ham]. He felt something. Hopefully he can play on Sunday.\" \nManchester United meanwhile will be without Paul Pogba, who will begin a three-match ban on Sunday. Mourinho could also be without Phil Jones and Eric Bailly, who have not featured since before November's international break. Kompany was named in the travelling squad for Shakhtar but did not make the match day squad.

Let\u2019s enter the ceremonial prayer circle and see what evil spirits we can drum up, shall we? \nThe film begins with a young child who thinks he\u2019s hearing Mommy in the heat of passion, only to stumble in and find something equally as damaging to his eyes (and soul). We then cut to a Tarantino-esque dinner conversation between a bunch of amped-up, douchier-than-douchey cops spilling the details on their sexual conquests, among a myriad of other topics, when they receive a call about another group of police officers in trouble at an abandoned building. Yet, once they respond, no one is found. \nIt\u2019s not long before the horrific discovery is made of several dismembered bodies and some rather nasty satanic lunatics practicing the black arts right inside the building itself, leading our beloved (that\u2019s a stretch) band of boys in blue to fight to survive against the demonic practitioners. Only problem is, these characters do absolutely nothing to form an empathetic boundary for themselves, so by the time the butchering begins, you\u2019ll most likely fight to stay awake, even during their endless screams. \nEvrenol uses the most out of limited lighting and an excess of the crimson waves to enhance what is a narrative that is as devoid as the thought pattern in any Kardashian\u2019s skull. Don\u2019t get me wrong; there are more than a few good scares contained within, but the unfortunate thing is after the frights have long worn off, there simply isn\u2019t anything else to fall back on other than another copious pile of viscera. Unless you\u2019re a hardcore gorehound with a penchant for some heinous acting and uninspired storytelling, this is nothing more than a giant pile of straight Legos without one single connecting piece in sight. \nBypass it if it slithers your way, and clean up all those damn black candles and goat heads before the guests come over!

Det finns omfattande seri\u00f6s kritik mot denna rapport. \nI. Brev till World Anti Doping Agency och Internationella olympiska kommitt\u00e9n (IOK) om McLaren-rapporten och politiseringen av dopning i idrott av den k\u00e4nde, unders\u00f6kande journalisten Rick Sterling 27 mars 2017 Rick Sterling \nRyska idrottsut\u00f6vare, plus hela Paralympics laget, var f\u00f6rbjudna fr\u00e5n att delta i OS i Rio de Janeiro 2016. Detta baserades p\u00e5 den f\u00f6rsta McLaren-rapporten som best\u00e4lldes av World Anti Doping Agency (WADA). \nDen andra McLaren-rapporten publicerades i december 2016 och accepterades omedelbart av den v\u00e4sterl\u00e4ndska media och det politiska etablissemanget som \u201dbevis\u201d p\u00e5 anklagelserna om institutionell korruption och dopningskonspiration i Ryssland. McLaren \nF\u00f6ljande \u201d\u00f6ppna brev\u201d \u00e4r en kritisk granskning av den andra McLaren-rapporten och anklagelser om \u201dstatssponsrad dopning\u201d i Ryssland. \nTill: WADA:s Ordf\u00f6rande Sir Craig Reedie och dess Executive Committee Till: IOC: s president Thomas Bach och dess verkst\u00e4llande utskott \nJag hoppas att Ni kommer att forts\u00e4tta och \u00f6vervinna skillnaderna och oenigheten mellan WADA och IOK och Ryssland. Den omtvistade situationen fr\u00e5n OS i Rio verkade undergr\u00e4va m\u00e5len f\u00f6r den olympiska stadgan mot nationell diskriminering. \nRysslands president Putin har sagt att medan de inte accepterar anklagelsen f\u00f6r \u201dstatligt sponsrad dopning\u201d, erk\u00e4nner de doping\u00f6vertr\u00e4delser som m\u00e5ste f\u00f6rebyggas i framtiden genom samarbete med WADA. Vissa WADA-tj\u00e4nstem\u00e4n har svarat positivt. USA:s kongress h\u00f6ll nyligen en utfr\u00e5gning f\u00f6r att ytterligare politisera situationen. Samtidigt har Institute of National anti-doping organizations motsatt sig f\u00f6rslag till oberoende testning och aggressivt kritiserat IOC. Som Ni vet \u00e4r f\u00f6rbudet mot ryska idrottare fr\u00e5n OS i Rio och Paralympics i stor utstr\u00e4ckning baserad p\u00e5 privata uttalanden och den f\u00f6rsta rapporten fr\u00e5n Richard McLaren. Beviset som st\u00f6der dessa anklagelser s\u00e4gs vara i McLaren Report nr 2 fr\u00e5n i december 2016. Det \u00e4r viktigt att titta p\u00e5 fakta objektivt. Det finns v\u00e4sentliga inkonsekvenser och felaktigheter McLaren Report # 2. \nSituationen har blivit politiserad. \nFelaktigheter och snedvridningar i den slutliga McLaren-rapporten inkluderar: \n(1) McLarens rapport nr 2 p\u00e5st\u00e5r felaktigt att den f\u00f6rsta rapporten inte ifr\u00e5gasattes. P\u00e5 sidan 7 i McLaren s\u00e4gs att den f\u00f6rsta rapporten inte varit f\u00f6rem\u00e5l f\u00f6r kritik. Det \u00e4r inte sant. H\u00e4r \u00e4r n\u00e5gra exempel: \n* Forbes publicerade en kortfattad men f\u00f6r\u00f6dande redaktionell titel \u201dRyska klagom\u00e5l om McLaren-rapporten om p\u00e5st\u00e5dd statlig sponsrad dopning har meriter\u201d. F\u00f6rfattaren, Ron Katz, en v\u00e4lk\u00e4nd idrotts- och etnisk advokat, identifierade tre s\u00e4tt p\u00e5 vilka McLaren Report # 1 kr\u00e4nkte en korrekt process:\u201dDetta (korrekt process) \u00e4r intgen tom fras. Det borde kr\u00e4vas innan en stor idrottsnations idrottare blir utest\u00e4ngda fr\u00e5n OS och Paralympics. \u201d * British Sports Integrity Initiative publicerade en detaljerad kritik av McLaren Report # 1 med f\u00f6ljande slutsats: \u201dWADA har en viktig uppgift som f\u00f6rtj\u00e4nar st\u00f6d, men inte om det blir en politiskt partiskt korst\u00e5g. Som framg\u00e5r av ovanst\u00e5ende har McLaren-rapporten stora brister. Inriktningen p\u00e5 Ryssland och deras idrottare \u00e4r ett f\u00f6rr\u00e5d mot den olympiska andan. \u201d * Italienska Dirito Penale Contemporaneo publicerade en kritisk analys av rapporten fr\u00e5n Richard McLaren. Den 13-sidiga analysen drar slutsatsen att McLaren Report # 1 har \u201dinkonsekvenser och \u00f6verdrifter\u201d och \u00e4r \u201dpartisk och obest\u00e4md\u201d. IOK (2) McLaren \u00e4r inkonsekvent i sina anklagelser mot ryska idrottare och vet att bevisen kan vara svaga. \nP\u00e5 sidan 2 s\u00e4ger MacLaren \u201d\u00d6ver 1000 ryska idrottare kan identifieras som involverade eller drabbade manipuleringar f\u00f6r att d\u00f6lja positiva dopingtest. P\u00e5 sidan 20 s\u00e4gs \u201d246 idrottare kan identifieras som potentiellt medvetna om manipulering \u2026\u201d P\u00e5 sidan 18 McLaren erk\u00e4nner bevisen kan vara svaga. \nNu f\u00f6ljer avsnitt p\u00e5 engelska f\u00f6ljt av slutsatser \u00f6versatta till svenska. \n(3) Sports Federations are now confirming that McLaren\u2019s evidence is weak. \nThe lack of evidence is confirmed in the recent findings by different athletic federations. For example, the International Biathlon Union recently evaluated McLaren\u2019s information and cleared 22 of 29 Russians who had been implicated. Investigation of the other 7 continues. Even if all 7 are ultimately found guilty that means that 76% were not and suggests that McLaren\u2019s accusation of 1000 complicit Russian athletes was a huge exaggeration. \n(4) McLaren accuses Russian officials and institutions without providing evidence. \nOn page 20 he states: \u201cThe cover up and manipulation of doping control processes involved officials in the Ministry of Sport (\u201cMofS\u201d), CSP , and Federal Security Service (\u201cFSB\u201d) as well as other sport officials and coaches. Also included were both the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (\u201cRUSADA\u201d) and the Moscow Laboratory.\u201d It is widely known that Rodchenkof and the Moscow Laboratory were at the center of doping violations. What is new and requires evidence are the accusations that officials from the Ministry of Sports, Security Services and RUSADA were part of a conspiracy. \nWhen this author contacted Richard McLaren asking where the evidence is, he replied: \u201cThe EDP is divided into categories so you can locate the documents you are looking for.\u201d The \u201cEvidence Disclosure Package\u201d contains 1,031 evidence documents. A chart assigns each document among twelve general categories. McLaren\u2019s major accusations do not reference a specific document. In effect, the Independent Person tells readers to find it for themselves. This is a very curious way to persuade or convince anyone. It raises the question whether the evidence is weak or non-existent. McLaren admits that there is \u201cno direct evidence of ROC (Russian Olympic Committee) involvement in the conspiracy.\u201d \nBy contrast, when McLaren explained why he declined the request of the Vice Chairman of the IOC Ethics Commission, he refers to a specific letter which documents the communication (EDP1164). When McLaren describes the WADA directive telling Moscow Laboratory to save samples, he documents the communication (EDP1160). If McLaren has evidence of the \u201cinstitutional conspiracy\u201d, why does he not identify or present the evidence? \n(5) McLaren smears all Russian athletes, innocent and guilty alike. \nOn pages 46-47 he says \u201cdoping manipulation and cover up of doping control processes was institutionalized \u2026 It is unknown whether athletes knowingly or unknowingly participated in the processes involved. However they may be part of the conspiracy\u2026 Together, all of these parties were implicated parts amounting to a conspiracy\u2026.\u201d With this logic, McLaren says all Russian athletes are guilty \u2013 whether or not they knew, whether or not they participated. \n(6) McLaren claims that Rodchenkov followed the directions and instructions of high officials in the Ministry of Sports but provides no evidence. \nFor example, on page 82 McLaren says: \u201cOn Deputy Minister Nagornykh\u2019s instructions, the first phase in developing the sample swapping technique was launched.\u201d On page 83 he says \u201cAt the direction of the MofS, these athletes would collect clean urine in baby bottles, Coke bottles or similar containers and supply it to the CSP.\u201d On page 84 he says, \u201cBy direction of Minister Mutko and Deputy Minister Nagornykh all pre-competition washout samples for testing were to be collected only \u2018under the table\u2019 in unofficial containers.\u201d If this is true, why does McLaren not provide the evidence in the form of emails or other communication? \n(7) McLaren suggests without evidence that the Ministry of Sports was responsible for distributing performance enhancing drugs (\u201cPEDs\u201d). \nOn page 64 he says: \u201cCentralizing and controlling distribution of PEDs to athletes became an increasingly important element of the doping control system and manipulation.\u201d This is contradicted by the fact that Rodchenkov was previously arrested for possession and distribution of PEDs and his sister was convicted for this activity. It is contradicted by the fact the Rodchenkov and coach Melnikov received payments for the drugs and falsified tests. Many piece of evidence confirm the guilt of McLaren\u2019s principal witness, Dr. Rodchenkov, but none give proof of collusion or direction by the Minister of Sports or another high official. In a footnote on page 68 McLaren says \u201cit appears that athletes had to pay Coach Melnikov and Rodchenkov for positive samples to be clean.\u201d This suggests a profit making or extortion scheme rather than state organized. \n(8) McLaren makes sensational accusations based on erroneous or misleading references. \nFor example on page 74 he refers to the \u2018hijacking of the London 2012 Games\u2019. To substantiate this extraordinary claim, McLaren refers to the 2016 IOC media release \u201cIOC sanctions eight athletes for failing anti-doping test at London 2012\u201c. It is implied these are some of the Russian athletes who \u201chijacked\u201d the London Games. This is misleading because only two of the eight disqualified athletes were Russian. \n(9) McLaren bases his \u201cforensic analysis\u201d on the findings of a \u201cworld renowned expert in firearms and toolmarks examinations\u201d but mysteriously keeps his identity secret and does not cross-check or validate his investigation results. \nRichard McLaren says his conclusions are based on \u201cimmutable facts\u201d and \u201cforensic analysis\u201d. The lofty words largely boil down to this: \n\u2013 A toolmarks expert determined there was a way to open the supposedly tamper-proof urine sample bottles to allow exchange of dirty urine with clean urine. However, the clandestine bottle cap opening would leave some slight marks. The marks were found to be of two types. \n\u2013 Based on advice from Rodchenkov, McLaren did an investigation of select Russian sample bottles from the Sochi Games and afterwards and found that the samples were contaminated and either had mismatched DNA or impossible salt content. \n\u2013 The toolmarks expert studied a small number of sample bottles from during and after the Sochi Games, again based on Rodchenkov\u2019s suggestions, and determined that most of them had the \u201cmarks\u201d suggesting they had been clandestinely opened. \nGiven the importance of the investigation, and the fact that it was presumed to be impartial and objective, it is reasonable to ask some questions: Why is the expert anonymous? How was his evaluation and testing cross-checked and validated? Why was the Swiss manufacturer of the sample bottles (Berlinger) not involved in the examination and testing? That should have been done for two reasons: \n(a) because Berlinger has technical staff who are the most knowledgeable about these urine sample bottles; and, \n(b) to assist in correcting any flaw in the design, if it actually exists, to prevent future abuse. \nIn addition, it is important to note the highly selective nature of this examination. The Sochi Olympic and Paralympic athletes\u2019 samples that were investigated were selected by the person who was said to be at the heart of the corruption. (10) McLaren distorts the findings of the \u201ctoolmarks expert\u201d. \nOn page 103 McLaren says: \u201cThe forensic testing, which is based on immutable facts, is conclusive\u2026 The results of the forensic and laboratory analysis initiated by the IP establish the conspiracy that was perpetrated at the Sochi Games.\u201d However, the toolmarks expert makes no such claims. The findings in the \u201cForensic Report\u201d (EDP0902) are much more qualified: \nMcLaren asserts that \u201cmarks\u201d on the inside of the urine sample bottle confirm tampering. However, the expert does not say that. Regarding \u201cType 1 marks\u201d, the expert concluded that \u201cthese marks were reproduced and found to be present after screwing the lid on forcefully\u201d. This means that if a user over-tightened the bottle cap trying to insure no urine leakage, it would cause similar marks. \nRegarding \u201cType 2 marks\u201d, the expert found that: \u201cIf there was manual manipulation of the metal ring and spring steel washer before the lids were screwed on for whatever reason, marks similar to some of the Type 2 marks were reproduced. This could for example result from fingers or cloth being used to wipe the inside of the lid to clean it.\u201d \nOn page 22 of the \u201cForensic Report\u201d, the expert concludes with the following warning: \u201cThese marks on their own should not be considered to be conclusive evidence of opening the bottles or attempts to open the bottles \u2026.\u201d. (underlining added). This is opposite to what McLaren claimed. \nSlutligen noterar jag f\u00f6ljande: Om m\u00e5let var att uppt\u00e4cka huruvida det fanns omfattande manipulering med provflaskor fr\u00e5n ett land, skulle det kunna ske genom att unders\u00f6ka slumpm\u00e4ssiga urval av provflaskor fr\u00e5n m\u00e5nga olika l\u00e4nder f\u00f6r att se om det endast finns m\u00e4rken fr\u00e5n endast ett land. Det skulle ocks\u00e5 vara en stark indikator p\u00e5 att m\u00e4rkena var av manipulering och inte fr\u00e5n de oavsiktliga orsakerna som experter varnade f\u00f6r. Detta har uppenbarligen inte skett. Slutsatser / Rick Steling. \nDet \u00e4r uppenbart att det fanns dopingbrott av vissa ryska idrottare med insatser av Moskvas laboratoriedirekt\u00f6r Rodchenkov och n\u00e5gra andra. Trots McLarens anklagelser om \u201dstate sponsored doping\u201d och en \u201dinstitutionell konspiration\u201d, har han presenterat f\u00f6ga eller inga bevis p\u00e5 detta. Om det finns tydliga bevis varf\u00f6r \u00e4r det inte identifierat? Vad s\u00e4ger det om integritet och r\u00e4ttvisa hos n\u00e5gon i auktorit\u00e4r st\u00e4llning som g\u00f6r sensationella anklagelser som f\u00e5ngar rubrikerna medan man vet att bevisen \u00e4r svaga och m\u00e5nga av de anklagade kan vara oskyldiga? Vilken typ av etik och \u201dfair play\u201d visar detta? Det verkar tydligt att det m\u00e5ste finnas en oberoende och INTE nationellt baserad testmyndighet som kan genomf\u00f6ra gemensamma standarder och f\u00f6rhindra dopning, skatteflykt och falska anklagelser. \nTillslutningsvis uppmanar jag ledarna f\u00f6r WADA och IOC att finna ett s\u00e4tt att minska politiseringen av dopning i sport och motst\u00e5 kraven hos dem som s\u00e4ger att de vill \u201dskydda rena idrottare\u201d genom att ta bort r\u00e4ttigheterna f\u00f6r andra rena idrottare baserat nationell diskriminering. \nBest regards,", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

but lessons can be learned from both parties Im not here to lecture or judge or anything so please take this reply with all the positivity you can because im only here just giving advice im not trying to be a jerk or anything negative just trying to help give options Another thing you could try is sitting down with him and simply have a chat maybe play a board game and during the process tell him how you feel and even though he is 11 and may not fully \u201ccompute\u201d what you are saying to him parents have an emotional connection so maybe he will hear the pain in your voice Maybe yelling or screaming (not saying this is what your doing) isnt getting through to him so maybe passionate conversations with inside voices may?

You'd be surprised how much you can find out what your child is going through on what you find. You are right in being concerned about his behavior especially that even with being caught, he continues. Maybe he needs to see a counselor to get down to the root of him stealing. More than ever today, we have to start early in setting rules that need to be obeyed, if not as he reaches the teen years, it will get harder. Stay strong. Your role as a mother is to be his guidance. Last but not least. No matter what is going on, Always, let your child know that you love him and that it's his behavior you do not like.
