Sometimes innocent women and children are harmed and often killed because guys with guns don't aim properly. This can make a war very unpopular, especially when CNN shows pictures of mangled children's bodies being pulled out of bomb sites. Ugh! Bad publicity!!\nWe have a similar situation with our war with LAW.\nLAW has retaliated against ORION by going after our lower-lvl players.\nThis is a completely legitimate activity, especially in the light of the fact that it was ORION who declared war on LAW, not vice versa.\nBut here's the thing: LAW's lower lvl players are all in a detached wing. ORION is not large enough to warrant a detached wing.\nTherefore, as the leader of ORION, we declare that a state of war exists between our alliance and LAW-G.\nThe following are reasons for this declaration:\n1. LAW-G deserves to be part of this large world war currently being waged.\n2. We don't know the LAW-G people very well and would like to get to know them on the battlefield.\n3. Some of them have piles and piles of stuff that our lower lvl players can make good use of.\nThis war will end when one of the following conditions are met:\n1. The parent alliance (LAW) publicly declares in the gamma diplo forum that it will no longer attack ORION members below 250,000 points.\n2. The war between LAW and ORION ends\n3. Artemis states that ORION is the best alliance on gamma and joins us (this condition is the easiest to fulfill!)

I have lost any and all respect for you guys. Below 250k points :loll:\nSmall is any one below 100k points not 250k If they can't handle it send them to QEDA they are a wing and they can come back after the war.

Nice respectful wars. You guys got it all going on. And great you try to change another unspoken rule. Its always been a given that 100k is the cut off point just as inactive are always fair game. Well, one excuse is as good as another. Now I am going to play with the noob of QED-A\nI hear the school bell....\nHey, wasnt THRs wing declared on as well???

Are you scared that those low level players won't come back to ORION? If you are, then it's best they not comeback because they weren't loyal to begin with.\nRST script (shortcuts 1.8.1 ) is active.

Assuming the resources situation can be resolved from that one isolated incident we have no interest in fighting wings. Mutchopzzz you may want to realize QEDA and Orion are not the same before you hit QEDA. Attacks on QEDA will bring the situation farther from resolution and will result in many wings being brought in. We still wish to avoid that.\nWe understand Orion's situation is different given the lack of a wing and wish them luck, but at this time do not join in the declaration.\nFayth Quote: Go to Page Top kevin jan2 Wanderer\nPosts 1,676 7 Nov 14th 2010, 7:51pm\nI strongly urge fellow members of LAW not to attack QEDA members.

Nov 14th 2010, 7:55pm\nNo really, I have been waiting for you to respond with this exact message. You see, You need to step back and take your own advice. You lumped LAW-G and WOH-B into one group when KLK which is a different alliance to the first two hit a QED-A player. Since then I believe LAW-G has been hit by others as well of your allies. Now I see a war declaration by your ally on a wing alliance. Just so happens they themselves do not have a wing alliance so like you I am going to target the closest thing they have. TARGET LOCKED, ahhhh QED-A. I do admit that Orion have a 109k total point player right next store, no hideouts, a fair bit of goods, and low level walls. What was it that lazygamer of EG said about wings or FARMS\nQuote: : I think we will indeed refrain from attacking LAW-G, but if they have zero spy-defence and is ripe targets, I for one would say they're open farms for anyone, regardless of alliance-status.\nregards,\nlazygamer - EG General\nYour ally and since you hold others responsible for their allies actions then I say, GAME ON.

Now, what about KLK and QED-A and QED holding LAW and WoH responsible? Either they are fair game or not but it goes for both sides. We are not going to protect both alliances so lets just start the buffet line.

Quote: Go to Page Top Mutchopzz Guest\n15 Nov 14th 2010, 8:53pm\nYea, we wouldnt want KlK, LAW, WoH, L-SNO and all the other side hitting QED-A. Let them have a free pass to change the rules. Especially after QED has tried so hard to protect the wing alliances. I just find it funny how QED has been threatening the wing and Orion declare. QED and Orion declare on Law. I bet QED isnt behind this in the least. OK I AM WoH, A different alliance from LAW. If I hit QED-A then by QED leadership you cannot hold LAW accountable or LAW-G.

He is entitled to his opinion but it is going to affect much more than himself. I know that LAW, and the leadership of KLK and WoH do not want the wings attacks and do not want people run off this server, but if anyone thinks for a moment QED will allow attacks on QEDA when we have not ONCE attacked LAW-G as retribution for Orion and LAW's issues is insane.\nYou guys all think pretty low of me, so what do you think I will do when Mutchopzzz starts attacking QEDA???? Guess what, QED will stop attacks on LAW and focus everything on LAW-G until they are all gone from the game. Do I want this? No. But will I do it to make a simple point? Of course I would. Haha. Mutchopzzz I suggest you check with your leadership before you go rogue. There is no reason to make the babies suffer because QED picked a fight with LAW.

Now your ally do the same and who call foul. Honestly, I could careless what you say or do. Call off you allies and I will stop my search. You cant keep trying to bully the server to be number one. I will leave WoH if need be but if LAW-G goes to war for your search for number for # I will hunt QED-A. Simple as that. You want fair then play fair.

Now we've gotten together and come up with a plan. These are two of my closest friends and I do trust them so I don't believe there's anything to worry about regarding that.\nThe two of them are going to attend a local university while I stay at the apartment and work online like I have been doing for the past few years. I'm a freelance writer and I should be making a solid $200 per week to start off.\nHopefully my friends will land good part-time jobs, too. They're both receiving financial support from their families, I'm not.\nWhy\nIn my case I need to leave the toxic environment that is my house. My parents are completely inept and don't really give a shit about me or what I do anyway. Being able to have my own space to work and occasionally go out sounds amazing right now.\nAfter all, I never bothered with school because I was making so much money (for someone my age living in South Africa) working online anyway.\nWhen\nWe're planning to move there on the 20th of January or so. Not too long from now, but long enough for me to make at least $1000 by working and selling my old stuff.\nWhat\nLuckily my grandparents will provide me with a car. I guess until my friends get theirs, I'll have to drive them to school and they'll cover the fuel costs. Its not a long drive from the apartment we're planning to rent.\nIts a really nice 3 bedroom place in a secure complex with a big lounge, kitchen, dining room etc. Its either that or a similarly specced two-story house with 2 bathrooms as opposed to one. Both are reasonably close to the university, with the latter being the furthest at 15 minutes away. I'm sure fuel won't end up being much.\nIts supposed to cost around $500 per month (including water, electricity, sewrage, etc) , which split between the 3 of us (equally) isn't much. Especially for me. There might be a larger deposit first but I can easily cover that as it won't be much more than the first month's rent from my research.\nOnly other costs I can think of are food, internet (for my online work, probably like $50 per month for 1MBps uncapped because fucking monopoly ISP's in South Africa) and all that other stuff like toiletries and laundry. Also car insurance (my parents are forcing me to pay it, supposed to be around $100 per month) and I need to spend about $400 getting my license.\nProblem\nThe thing is, the work I do is so goddam inconsistent as I generally work with the lower end clients. I'm not a great writer after all so I can't charge quality rates.\nAlso, can you even rent an apartment at 18 anyway? I mean, how does that work? I don't even know how to pay taxes.

Historically, interference has been used to contrast quantum mechanics with classical physics, but recently experiments have been performed that test quantum theory against even more exotic alternatives. A physically motivated family of theories are those where the state space of a two-level system is given by a sphere of arbitrary dimension. This includes classical bits, and real, complex and quaternionic quantum theory. In this paper, we consider relativity of simultaneity (i.e. that observers may disagree about the order of events at different locations) as applied to a two-armed interferometer, and show that this forbids most interference phenomena more complicated than those of complex quantum theory. If interference must depend on some relational property of the setting (such as path difference), then relativity of simultaneity will limit state spaces to standard complex quantum theory, or a subspace thereof. If this relational assumption is relaxed, we find one additional theory compatible with relativity of simultaneity: quaternionic quantum theory. Our results have consequences for current laboratory interference experiments: they have to be designed carefully to avoid rendering beyond-quantum effects invisible by relativity of simultaneity.

Is he crazy? (Of course he is!) Are we to be spared nothing? (Of course we aren\u2019t.)\n\nOh yes, the pundits are up in arms a lot these days: attacks of hysteria, on an almost daily basis, are one of the major symptoms of Trump Derangement Syndrome . And so when the President goes into one of his stream of consciousness riffs \u2013 will Joyce scholars ever recognize their literary provenance? \u2013 they take to Twitter, alarm bells ringing. \n\nIgnore them.\n\nAs Trump would put it, it\u2019s \u201cfake news!\u201d Because \u201crecognizing\u201d Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is a concept without content: Congress has already voted on several occasions over the years to proclaim such \u201crecognition,\u201d and to demand that the US embassy be moved there from Tel Aviv. Every president since Reagan has vowed to do precisely that \u2013 and wound up leaving the embassy right where it is. Trump will prove to be no exception, and here\u2019s why :\n\n\u201cPresident Donald Trump will recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital on Wednesday, while also delaying moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city, officials said. \n\u201cThough Trump will not relocate the embassy any time soon \u2013 one White House official told reporters it could take years \u2013 the president still intends to fulfill that promise made early in his administration. \n\u201cSenior administration officials called Trump\u2019s expected recognition of Jerusalem an affirmation of \u2018reality\u2019 \u2013 both historical and current, pointing out that the city is already home to Israel\u2019s parliament, supreme court and other government sites.\u201d \n\nWhat in the real, actual, physical world will change as a result of this empty \u201crecognition\u201d? The answer is: nothing. The embassy will stay where it is. The Palestinians will remain in their prison-like condition, and their Israeli jailers will continue to praise the President in public while continuing to guard their own interests even when it comes at the expense of the Americans.\nAny questions?\n\nThe same people who scoffed at the very idea that Trump could ever be the GOP nominee, and then confidently foretold Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory, have predicted disaster at every turn in the road to the end of the first year of his presidency. Remember how his election meant an inevitable war with China ? The doomsayers couldn\u2019t explain his recent love-fest with Hu Jinping , so they just ignored it and moved on to the next bloodcurdling and equally wrong prognostication \u2013 war with North Korea. Trump\u2019s fire-and-fury rhetoric was so incandescently hot that his words alone would ignite a war on the Korean peninsula. Except it hasn\u2019t happened, and it isn\u2019t going to happen, for the same reason the Korean stalemate has persisted since 1953. For both sides, the price of aggression is too high \u2013 war means millions dead, and the Korean peninsula rendered virtually uninhabitable\n\nOh, and don\u2019t forget the war with Iran that was supposed to be already in progress by this time because Trump was going to rip up the Iran deal . Except that never happened, either. Despite all the election-year rhetoric, the solemn vows that the \u201cbad, very bad\u201d deal \u2013 the \u201cworst deal in our history, folks, the absolute worst\u201d \u2013 was going to be rectified and even nullified, upon taking office Trump simply kicked the issue over to Congress, where it will be kept in reserve for the Israel lobby to exploit at their convenience. In any case, the Iran deal is intact, and is very likely to remain so the longer the issue sits on the back burner.\n\nBy now the wrong predictions of the Trumpocalypse school of recent history are piling up so high that they overshadow whatever credibility these people once had. In the foreign policy realm their record is especially abysmal, and I\u2019m not just talking here about the neocons, the Clinton gang, and the Davos crowd, but also some prominent anti-interventionists, such as Stephen Walt and the Beltway libertarians largely funded by Charles and David Koch. These armchair anti-interventionists, perhaps thinking of their long-term economic prospects, not only stayed on the sidelines while Trump made \u201cisolationist\u201d noises, they openly disdained his candidacy. After the election they joined the chorus of disaster-mongers, their voices indistinguishable from the bipartisan Washington consensus that decried Trump precisely for his virtues. That these people could have made a difference inside the Trump administration is one of the great tragedies of the Trump era. \n\nSo the pundits were wrong \u2013 but why? What is it about Trump that they have consistently missed that has caused them to miscalculate at every crucial turn where real judgment was called for? The irony is that it\u2019s an element of the Trump-haters\u2019 own critique of the President\u2019s character, which they fail to give the prominence it deserves: he\u2019s full of hot air. He\u2019s a narcissist who likes to hear loves the sound of his own voice. He\u2019s an actor, at heart, and both his critics and his fans mistake his theatrical performances for policy pronouncements. He actually has both his supporters and his enemies taking even his most casual off-the-cuff words literally \u2013 and remembering them selectively \u2013 and for both friend and foe that has proved to be a major mistake.\n\nIn the balance of things, his foes suffered the most from their self-induced blindness: it made them badly overstate the alleged dangers of a Trump presidency. I mean, by this time, according to the Future History imagined by the NeverTrumpers, shouldn\u2019t we all be living under martial law, with Russian tanks rolling through the streets of Washington? According to them, we should already be at war with China, Iran, North Korea, and perhaps even NATO. Sadly, that last possibility never came about, but then again the good news is that neither did any of the others, despite the supposed immediacy of these alleged serial crises.\n\nYesterday, the world was ending: today, not so much. Was it Gore Vidal who called us the United States of Amnesia ? I think this applies especially and specifically to the political class, i.e. the President\u2019s mortal enemies, whom America\u2019s premier historical novelist wrote about with such brutally insightful realism.\n\nNo doubt the capacity for self-deception is unlimited in some elements of #TheResistance, but even the strongest faith is shaken by repeated debunking. The inevitable end to this process of being consistently wrong is that the popularity of what started out as a widespread misconception begins to shrink, until its adherents are marginalized to the point of being reduced to the status of a tiny idiosyncratic cult.\n\nThis pattern is dramatized by the history of those millennialist cults that have prophesized the end of the world occurring on a specific day and even predicting the exact time. When the destiny of the universe failed to conform to their precise requirements, and the end failed to come, disenchanted believers began to leave. In response, the church\u2019s top theologians conferred in solemn conclave until they could pluck a rationalization out of a hat.\n\nThe doomsayers\u2019 great problem was that there were only two possible explanations consistent with their worldview for why the prophesized end failed to manifest itself, neither of which boded well for recruitment purposes. First, because they got the date wrong, due to a technical issue too intricate for the mere layman to understand. So they moved the date up \u2013 ah, but they could never move it up enough. There were only so many times they could get away with this tactic, and so eventually these cults went kaput, or nearly so. I say nearly because the second possible explanation \u2013 that the end of the world had come, but we\u2019re too sinful and/or deluded to notice it \u2013 takes us into Louise Mensch territory.\n\nThe prophets of doom mistake belligerent words and style for action and substance, and this is the worst error our would be Doctors of Trumpology fall into. These literalists fail to see the Trumpian usage of language as negotiation, as a starting point rather than the final word, with his more \u201cextreme\u201d pronouncements meant to stretch the limits of what can be debated as well as to throw \u201cred meat\u201d to his base.\n\nAs an example, take Trump\u2019s long distance \u201cdialogue\u201d with North Korean despot Kim Jong-un, widely misinterpreted as the rhetorical prelude to war. From calling down fire and fury to speculating as to whether Kim wants to be his friend , Trump\u2019s side of the conversation certainly describes a range of possibilities, rather than a fixed position. Yet the bombast drowned out the more conciliatory overtures and the pundits heard only what they wanted to hear. Their one-dimensional analysis also ignored the realities on the ground, which effectively rule out war as a death sentence for millions of Koreans, South and North, as well as Japanese and quite possibly others. Yet the very scope of such a disaster is precisely what convinces the ultra-alarmist faction of our Trump-hating doomsday cult that it\u2019s inevitable.\n\nThat\u2019s because, according to their religion, Trump is the equivalent of Satan, whose reappearance on earth is a sign of the End Times. Oh, but don\u2019t worry, folks: if you\u2019re Saved, and you\u2019re With Her, after Saint Michael Mueller corners the Devil in a courtroom called Armageddon and a Democratic House draws up a Bill of Excommunication, you\u2019ll be Raptured up into the Kingdom of Eternal Hillary alongside the blessed ranks of #TheResistance. \n\nAs time goes on, even the congenital hysterics among the NeverTrumpers are going to have to come down to earth, stop with the virtue-signaling hyperbole, and come to grips with really existing Trumpism, which is neither fascism triumphant nor the restoration of our old republic but an ambiguous mix of new and old, the revolutionary and the counterrevolutionary, embodying both continuity and change. It is, in short, like most important shifts in the American political landscape, not enough to bring down the house, but in Trump\u2019s case enough to shake up a complacent, hideously wealthy, and brazenly decadent ruling class that had long since lost contact with the rest of the country. \n\nWhat has been brought down is the house of the two-party monopoly, the political and operational linchpin of our foreign policy of global intervention, which has always been predicated on solidly bipartisan support. What Trump has done is to found a de facto third party, separate from and opposed to the old GOP Establishment as well as the Democrats, both of which have effectively marginalized their \u201cisolationist\u201d wings. If there is to be any challenge to the interventionist consensus, which currently dominates Washington, this third force in American politics is bound to be its vehicle and voice.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "justin raimondo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david koch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong-un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reagan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louise mensch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joyce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen walt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gore vidal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hu jinping", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump theatre trumpism", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "end times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korean peninsula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:24.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ded93e6f3dbc45192a8beb243a19ae04ad93e09d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyMW6wIj7_pnO6AgP4oBPnAz6hPyxDYgLyCRc4CH_A5nB.6_7kZ0PuLiYsloze9oLV2C9F4R3ydH2YM_RehRMwY7tmvBgZqiNkBsHm4WEGujw--", "site_full": "forums.freeskier.com", "site": "freeskier.com", "site_section": "http://forums.freeskier.com/forums2/index.php?p=/categories/off-topic/feed.rss", "site_categories": ["shopping", "business"], "section_title": "Off Topic Forums on Freeskier Magazine Forums", "title": "eqilamaluj", "title_full": "eqilamaluj", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ded93e6f3dbc45192a8beb243a19ae04ad93e09d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyMW6wIj7_pnO6AgP4oBPnAz6hPyxDYgLyCRc4CH_A5nB.6_7kZ0PuLiYsloze9oLV2C9F4R3ydH2YM_RehRMwY7tmvBgZqiNkBsHm4WEGujw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "eqilamaluj", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "eqilamaluj", "text": "eqilamaluj 4:06AM Posts: 1 Member To nexium 40 mg suspected;

In these instances and many others, leaders\u2019 options for righting the economy were only as palatable as the political consequences they would incur. \n\nA case in point is the United States today. Like so many other countries, the U.S. is still coping with the social and economic fallout wrought by the 2008 financial crisis. The crisis may not have created Washington\u2019s economic problems, but neither did it resolve them. And as those wounds continue to fester, it appears as though the U.S. is headed for recession. \n\nEvidence to that effect is the flattening of the yield curve for U.S. Treasuries \u2013 a curve that is the flattest it\u2019s been in 10 years. Usually, long-term debt has a higher interest rate to compensate investors for tying their capital up for longer. Declining interest rates on long-term debt, or higher rates on short-term debt, result in a narrower spread in the yield curve. \n(Visually, this looks like it is becoming flat.) The rare occurrence of an inverted yield curve \u2013 when short-term rates are higher than long-term rates \u2013 has on several occasions heralded a recession. \n\nYield vs. Security \n\nA yield curve can flatten or become inverted in two ways: through higher short-term interest rates and through lower long-term ones. Both are now occurring at the same time. Since the 2008 recession, the Federal Reserve has maintained low interest rates, prompting investors to \u201csearch for yield.\u201d In other words, they searched for higher returns in riskier investments. \n\nInvestors are now flocking to long-term treasuries to reduce risk, a sign that they believe the economy will fare poorly in the future. After 2008, when the Fed lowered interest rates, stocks and \u201cjunk bonds\u201d \u2013 bonds with a low credit rating and higher interest rates \u2013 were purchased in greater numbers. Investors have since begun to sell stocks and junk bonds in exchange for more secure assets. CalPERS, the United States\u2019 largest pension fund, which manages nearly $350 billion in assets, is reducing its exposure to stocks and overweighting high-rated debt. Similarly, capital from debt investment funds has begun to flow out of those in the high-risk category and into more secure ones. \n\nThe other way that a yield curve can flatten \u2013 higher short-term interest rates \u2013 is driven by monetary policy. The Fed has begun to raise rates, thanks in part to low unemployment, though inflation has remained below its target of 2 percent. The Fed typically adjusts its rates based on employment and inflation metrics. Too much inflation is dangerous because it lowers the value of money, but too little inflation is also dangerous because it can create unsustainably high levels of debt. Otherwise it can send an economy into a deflationary spiral, whereby prices constantly decrease and therefore discourage consumer spending. Rising interest rates in a low-inflation environment increase the risk of such a spiral. \n\nInvestors and the Fed are concerned that low inflation will play its part to suppress economic growth. \n\nThe causes of this peculiar brand of low inflation, however, tell us something deeper about the U.S. demography. \n\nAdequate Wages \n\nInflation is simply a measurement of price increases. The Consumer Price Index is frequently cited to determine inflation. It stands to reason, then, that if inflation is low, consumer spending is also low. \n\nThis is in fact the case. Since the end of the 2008 recession, consumption expenditure growth \u2013 which tends to be a leading indicator of inflation, albeit a slight one \u2013 has generally stayed within a range of -1.5 percent to 2 percent. Consumer spending growth since 1980, on the other hand, rarely dipped below 0 percent and generally stayed between 2 percent and 4 percent. \n\nWhy is consumer spending \u2013 and therefore inflation \u2013 so low if the U.S. unemployment rate is likewise so low at roughly 4 percent? Shouldn\u2019t employed people be spending money, and therefore driving higher inflation? The answer to that question lies both in the size of the labor force and the quality of the jobs that people are finding. \n\nThe unemployment rate, generically understood as the percentage of people without jobs, is a useful but sometimes misleading metric. It only calculates employed people as a percent of the labor force. \n\nIt excludes people not actively searching for jobs (as determined by a number of criteria). This means that the unemployment rate can fall even as people leave the labor force. Participation in the labor force declined over the past decade, from 66 percent to 62.7 percent, which some have attributed to the retirement of baby boomers. This is only partly true. The labor force participation rate for workers in their \u201cprime\u201d years \u2013 25 to 54 years \u2013 declined from 83.3 percent in 2008 to 81.6 percent today. In fact, the participation rate for workers of all ages declined over the past decade except for those over 55 years of age. \n\nWhile the increase in the participation rate for those over 55 may seem counterintuitive \u2013 given that they are the retiring baby boomers \u2013 participation rates for those over 55 and 65 are much lower than for younger workers. Further, retiring baby boomers make up a larger portion of the population than they did a decade ago, so you can actually have an increasing participation rate in older categories with fewer actual workers in the market. The result is a shrinking labor force, and slow growth in consumption expenditure. \n\nThe second factor has to do with the quality of employment. The U.S. personal savings rate, declining since 2012, is at a near-record low of 3.1 percent. Despite low and relatively steady consumer expenditure growth, people are still not able to save as much as they did before 2012. (In fairness, the lowest savings rate in the past 50 years came just before the 2008 crisis.) \n\nTaken together, these two metrics suggest that people have jobs \u2013 just perhaps not ones that can cover their living expenses. \n\nThe flattening yield curve, therefore, illustrates what\u2019s going on in the economy. Low inflation \u2013 the indicator that both debt investors and the Fed fixate on \u2013 stems from mild consumption growth, caused by a declining prime-age labor force and an inability of those in the labor force to secure adequate wages. Lower long-term interest rates, combined with the Fed increasing rates, are signs that the U.S. economy is heading for a recession. Though that recession may not be as bad as the 2008 recession, the inherent social divisions aggravated by the 2008 recession are still here. A recession that makes life more difficult for those who have suffered for the past decade \u2013 but not for the elite \u2013 is inherently political.

Initially i chewed on what I thought was a firm thickly pepperoni until a tongue rotation exposed my inside Cheek to the not chewing other end which was a cutting instrument I went back immediately and the employee where eager investigate the matter.

Red's harness of arms had come unfastened and lay half on and half off of her, the arms hanging down. Most of the arms had come completely loose during their good-natured scuffle, and they mostly lay on the floor around Black, but she had two of them in her hands. The star and the antlers had long since fallen off their heads, and Black's red nose was in some far corner of the room somewhere.\"Are you done playing now?\" said Violet? \"Have you two got your breath back?\"\"Oh, man, that was fun,\" said Red. \"That may be the best workout I've had in a while.\"\"So you're ... conceding, are ... you?\" said Black, still panting. She had really put her all into their little sparring match.\"Fine, yes,\" said Red. \"You win.\"\"Ha-hah!\" said Black, raising her arms into the air. \"To the victor, the spoils!\" She held two of Red's duplicated arms as trophies.\"You need help getting up?\" said Green.\"In a minute,\" said Black. \"I'm just going to lie here for a minute first.\"\"About the spoils thing, though,\" said Blue. \"It looks like your Christmas tree's starting to shed some needles, Orange. You have a plan for dealing with that?\"\"Seriously,\" said Red. \"It was fun for a but, but I really don't need twenty-four extra arms cluttering up the place.\" She gestured around the scattered pile of arms, and all of the hands moved in synch. She was winded enough that she was losing her concentration on keeping them distinct.\"Well, there must be something we can do,\" said Yellow. \"I'm sure Orange and I can come up with something.\"\"I think I can do something about that,\" said Violet. \"I've been working on an idea that I think could come in handy here.\"\"Oh yeah?\" said Orange. \"What you got for us?\"\"Well, all of the extra arms are duplicates that you made of Red's original arms, right?\" said Violet.\"Yeah,\" said Yellow.\"Well, I've been working on some new algorithms for the B-T device, and one of them ought to be able to reverse the effects of a duplication,\" said Violet. \"The arms don't have any subjective experiences or individual perceptions or anything, so the reverse procedure should work no problem. It won't be quite enough, though.\"\"Why not?\" said Red. \"You couldn't just merge them back into my own arms?\"\"In order to do that,\" said Violet, \"we'd have to separate your arms again in exactly the same way as before so they match the duplicates precisely.\"\"Oh, yeah, you're right,\" said Orange. \"I made that cut by hand. I wouldn't be able to do it the exact same way again. Hope you like having two extra arms, Red.\"\"Well, not necessarily,\" said Violet. \"That was the other idea I had. I mean, unless Red really doesn't mind having two extra arms.\"\"Yeah, no thanks,\" said Red. \"It's fun for parties, but I don't think I'd like it for always.\"\"Then yeah, it should be possible to disconnect the entanglement from Red,\" said Violet, \"if it can be transferred to someone else.\"\"You're saying you can give Red's extra arms to someone else?\" said Green.\"Maybe,\" said Violet. \"I haven't tested it yet.\"\"Then I call dibs,\" said Green. \"I believe I would like extra arms please. Four, if possible.\"\"So we're putting a hold on the Christmas party, then, huh?\" said Black, getting her breath back. \"Back to the science?\"\"Well, if we're going to get this all cleaned up, then yeah,\" said Violet. \"You guys gather everything up and take it over to Orange and Yellow's B-T, and I'll get my algorithm loaded into it.\"Green helped Black to her four feet, lifting her under the arms since Black wouldn't let go of her trophies. Blue gave Red a hand up, and everyone started gathering up loose arms and carrying them around the corner to Orange and Yellow's workstation where Violet was busy making some adjustments, referring to her notes and making some brief calculations.Once all of the extra arms were gathered together, sorted by rights and lefts, and once Black had been persuaded to relinquish her prizes, Violet selected two left arms and loaded them into the output chambers.\"Okay,\" she said. \"Here goes nothing.\"The doors closed, the machine hummed and clicked again, and the center door opened, revealing one single left arm.\"Okay, good,\" said Violet. \"The math still works in both directions. I'll just plug this into Orange's automation protocol, and it should run the whole process in reverse. We should have just the two original copies left at the end.\"\"Yeah, but can you stop it before the end so there are four arms left?\" said Green. \"I believe I made a very reasonable request.\"\"Right, sure, fine,\" said Violet. \"You got it, Green.\" She coupled her algorithm onto Orange's, and a set of conveyors and robotic arms began feeding arms into the B-T and withdrawing them when each cycle completed. Before long, only four arms were left.\"Thank goodness,\" said Red. \"That feels better already. Now how about the second part?\"\"Yeah, I'm pretty interested in that part myself,\" said Green.\"Well, we already know that a detached part will reattach on its own if you hold it against where it was cut off,\" said Violet. \"Blue, you've played around with separation more than the rest of us. Have you tried swapping parts around at all?\"\"A little,\" said Blue. \"Enough to know that it doesn't work to just stick the part onto someone else. You remember, I was trying a lot of different stuff when I was working on the monofilament cutter. I needed to test it out in different circumstances.\"\"Yeah, that's it,\" said Yellow. \"You had to test it. That was obviously the only reason.\"\"Well, what of it?\" said Blue. \"It's neat.\"\"So you're saying that the entanglement doesn't automatically collapse if you try it on a different person, right?\" said Violet.\"Right,\" said Blue. \"If you want two different quantum signatures to link together, you have to do more than just rub them together.\"\"I think I might be able to do that,\" said Violet. \"That's where my other new algorithm comes in. It should be possible to link cells of different quantum signatures together by using the B-T to blend them together on a geometric level. If parts from two different sources are decomposed, shuffled together, and recombined, then the geometric shuffling should be enough to cause the quantum connection to assert itself. Once that happens, the original connection should dissolve.\"\"What if the original connection doesn't dissolve?\" said Green. \"Are we talking about a potential voices-in-my-head situation?\" She suddenly seemed less excited about volunteering.\"Well, that's why it's called a test,\" said Violet. \"It's valuable data either way.\"\"What if you tested the blending algorithm on two parts from the same source?\" said Black. \"Would that help you figure if the connection would transfer properly?\"\"If they have the same source, then they connect on their own,\" said Blue.\"Only if you replace the part where it was,\" said Black. \"What about if you put it in a different place?\"\"It wouldn't be conclusive, but it should still help,\" said Violet. \"If the new part felt like it was properly connected in the new location, then that would mean - oh.\" Violet suddenly realized. \"Are you suggesting what I think you are?\"\"Yeah, I'm kind of getting used to this,\" said Black. She ran her hands down behind her, along her second midriff. It was still held in place with straps against her rear end. \"I think I'd like to keep it around.\"\"Do you have to cut a bare patch in your jumpsuit first?\" said Red.\"No, I can account for that in the algorithm,\" said Violet. \"That's an easy variable to control for. So you're up for it, then?\"\"Sure,\" said Black. \"Go for it.\"\"All right,\" said Violet. \"Step on in.\" She held the input door of the B-T device open, and Black stepped inside.\"Okay,\" said Violet. \"If this works, then the device will probably particulate you entirely, but everything except for the joined area should just be put back how it was. The area around the join will be shuffled and blended together so the cells of one part fade smoothly into the other. Are you ready to start?\"\"All ready,\" said Black. \"Hit me.\"Violet began the procedure, and the door closed. There was a longer sequence of clicking, and the center door opened again. Black stepped out, loosened the straps, and let them fall to the floor. Where her original rear end had been was now a smooth transition into an extension of her back. She turned a slow circle to give everyone a look, making a few swaying motions back and forth to show off her new moves.\"How does it feel?\" said Violet.\"It feels so smooth,\" said Black. \"I think I'm going to like this.\"\"Hang on,\" said Green. \"Before we can go on, we've got to test the most important thing.\" She stepped over to Black, placed her hands on Black's lower back, and pressed down, lifting herself onto Black and turning over so she was sitting sidesaddle on Black's back.Black flexed her knees a couple of times to test Green's weight. \"Well, how about that,\" she said. \"That's actually not as hard as I thought it would be.\"Green leaned against Black's shoulders and wrapped an arm around her. \"Okay, I think I'm ready to give it a go now.\"\"You sure?\" said Blue. \"You don't want to trot around on your pony a couple of times first?\"\"Okay, fine, spoilsport,\" said Green, hopping down to the floor. \"Besides, don't knock it till you try it,\" said Black. \"You only have to ask.\"\"So where do you want me?\" said Green.\"Just step into the chamber,\" said Violet. She laid Red's four extra arms on the floor of the chamber, and Green stepped in and stood between them. Violet made a few adjustments to the protocol on the screen, and then she pressed the button and the door closed. There were even more clicks and hums this time, but when the door opened, Green was standing there with four extra arms at her sides. The new arms were still sleeved in red, but there was a dark brown smear of color at the base of each one where the red sleeves blended into green.Green stepped out of the chamber and gave her arms a test wave. Black ran her hands up and down the new arms to help Green start distinguishing them. \"How about that, Red?\" said Black. \"You feel that?\"Red closed her eyes and held her arms still. \"No, I don't feel a thing,\" she said.\"Green? You feeling anyone else trying to control your arms or mess with your brain?\"\"No more than usual.\"\"There we go, then,\" said Black. \"We have a successful test.\"\"So you're saying that we can swap parts back and forth now?\" said Blue. She had snuck to the back of the group during the various procedures.\"Looks that way,\" said Red, turning to see what she was up to. She looked around for a second before she found Blue. \"Really, Blue?\" she said. \"You couldn't wait, could you?\"Blue was leaning against a table with her head under one arm. The slicer was sitting on the table next to her, and her neck was sliced even with the top of the collar of her jumpsuit.\"What?\" said Blue from down near her own hip. \"It's handy! It gives me a useful vantage point when I'm testing the slicer on myself.\"\"We have cameras, you know,\" said Black.\"Nah, too boring,\" said Blue. \"But you said we can swap parts, and we can reattach them in different places as well.\"\"And what?\" said Green, gesturing with her middle left arm while she felt Black's shoulder with her upper right and stroked her back with her lower right. \"You want your head put on backward or something?\"\"No, I was just wondering if anyone wanted to swap,\" said Blue.\"Actually, it would be a helpful experiment, too,\" said Violet. \"We've successfully transferred a spare part from one to another. We haven't tried swapping parts back and forth between people. If her head was switched to Red's body, what would happen to Blue's body? What would Red feel before she got swapped over? Now I'm curious about this.\"\"Wait a minute,\" said Red. \"Why am I a part of this experiment all of a sudden?\"\"It was just an example,\" said Violet. \"I'll do it, if you don't want to.\"\"Well, I didn't say I didn't want to,\" said Red. \"I'm just saying.\"\"So, it's settled,\" said Blue. \"Red and I will switch bodies. Or is it me and Violet?\"\"Maybe we should all three switch,\" said Violet. \"It sounds like we're all open to it, and more data is more data.\"\"I think we're all missing a kind of important point,\" said Green, raising her upper left hand with a question. \"If you all separate your heads like Blue's, what are we going to call you?\"\"What do you mean?\" said Blue.\"Oh, wait, she's right,\" said Red. \"We call each other by the color of our jumpsuits. If we swap bodies, we'll be exchanging the one part of us that's actually distinguishable by eye. It'll get confusing real quick.\"That actually threw all of them for a loop for a moment.\"Wait, that's an easy fix,\" said Violet. \"All I have to do is divide everyone so part of the suit goes with the head. Like a deep V-neck or something.\"\"Oh, good,\" said Blue. \"I can still watch from outside, then. Here, Green, hold onto this for me, will you?\" She walked over to Green and handed her head over, and then she walked over to the table where she'd been leaning and grabbed the slicer like she maneuvered around the lab headless all the time. She probably did, for that matter.\"No, if we're going to be swapping, we can't make the cuts manually, remember?\" said Violet. \"We'll need to rig the slicer into the CNC so the cuts are identical every time.\"\"Well, go for it, then!\" said Blue, calling out from Green's cradling hands while her body stood in front of Violet and gestured impatiently.\"It's your slicer,\" said Violet. \"You rig the slicer into one of the Waldos, and I'll get the algorithm ready. Red, you're still up for it, right?\"\"Sure,\" said Red. \"I guess I wouldn't mind a change of clothes.\"Blue took the slicer and replaced the handle with a mounting bracket so it could be attached to one of the lab's overhead robotic arms. As easily as she did it, it was easy to forget that her head was watching from a few feet away. Everyone started to wonder exactly how much time she had spent without her head on. When she was ready, Violet had the B-T programmed and waiting for her. Blue stood next to Red, and Violet pressed the start button on the console and quickly stepped next to the two of them.Three large robotic arms with padded grips moved in and gripped each of their bodies from behind, and three smaller ones gripped their heads, or rather, Violet and Red's heads and Blue's neck stump. The slicer arm glided over and performed one smooth, identical slice on each of them, curving from shoulder to shoulder below their collarbones. Then the smaller arms lifted up, and Blue's body was positioned inside the B-T, along with Violet's head. The doors closed, and the machine started its clicking hum.\"Oh,\" said Blue. \"Oh, that's weird.\" \"What is it?\" said Green, tilting her head so she could look her in the eye.\"I just lost all feeling below the neck.\"They looked over at the robotic arms. Violet's body was completely limp.\"Well, it makes sense,\" said Black. \"Your body is kind of in a transitional period right now.\" She felt under Blue's jaw for a pulse. \"Huh. You're still getting blood from somewhere. How's your breathing?\"\"Kind of labored,\" said Blue, \"like I'm under a big pile of comforters. I can still breathe, though.\"\"Weird,\" said Green. \"We'll have to tell Violet when she comes out.\"The door of the B-T opened, and Violet stepped out. She had a stripe of indigo swooping along her neckline where the two colors shaded together. She stepped over to Green and Black while her former body was loaded into the B-T with Red's head, and they filled her in on what Blue had told them.\"Interesting,\" said Violet. \"Maybe you were getting a tentative link with my old body, or maybe you still have a lingering link with this one. We'll have to do some more in-depth testing later on. Hold on, here comes Red.\"The door opened again, and Red stepped out, with a magenta stripe across her chest just like Violet's. She tried a few moves to see how her new body felt.\"Huh,\" she said. \"It feels pretty much the same.\"\"Well, yeah,\" said Blue. \"What were you expecting?\"\"I don't know,\" said Red. \"Something.\" She twisted back and forth. \"Well, I guess if I had wanted something really different, I would have gotten an extra knee or some more necks or something.\"Blue took a deep breath. \"Okay, there we go,\" she said. \"That's better.\"The door opened a third and final time, and Red's body stepped out with Blue's neckline on top of it, with a purple border between the two. The body walked over between Violet and Red and put her arms around their shoulders.\"You want this back?\" said Green, offering Blue's head back to her.\"Yeah, sure, thanks,\" said Blue, taking her head back but leaving it separated. \"Now I have a whole new body to try out.\"\"What's the difference?\" said Violet. \"We literally have the same body. We're duplicates.\"\"Well, I won't know for sure until I try,\" said Blue. \"That's just good science.\"At that moment, they all realized that Orange and Yellow had been awfully quiet. They looked around and found the two of them talking something over at the far end of the room. Black and Violet went over to see.\"You two have something you'd like to share with the class?\" said Black.\"Yeah, we've been talking over something we'd like to try,\" said Yellow. She looked up and saw Violet. \"Wow, so that worked pretty well, huh?\"\"As far as I can tell, yeah,\" said Violet. \"The transfer seems to have worked pretty smoothly.\"\"So you can attach extra parts to a person,\" said Orange, \"and you can attach different people's parts together. What about attaching two whole people together?\"Black and Violet gave each other a look. \"What do you mean?\" said Violet.\"We'd like to see what it would be like,\" said Yellow. \"Could you use your new algorithm to bond our bodies together?\"Violet thought about it for a moment. \"I mean, I guess I could. How bonded are we talking? I assume you want something more than just sticking you two side to side.\"\"Yeah, a little more,\" said Orange. \"Could you bond us all the way together? Everything but the heads?\"Violet let out a slow breath. \"Whoa. That's a lot of overlap. I don't know if the algorithm can blend that much.\"\"Well, it should be possible,\" said Black. \"You'd be blending their bodies together in a one-to-one ratio, so the corresponding parts would match up. The only concern is how to accommodate so much extra mass.\"\"We could do it easily if the final result was just proportionately bigger,\" said Violet. \"Does that work for you two? Would you mind being about a foot and a half taller?\"\"Ooh, unexpected bonus,\" said Yellow. \"Works for me.\"\"Then I'm willing to try it,\" said Violet. \"Give me a minute to reconfigure the B-T, and then let's give this a try.\"Violet went over to the console to adjust her figures, and Yellow and Orange joined everyone else to admire their alterations. Green got back on Black's back and just lounged, with her upper arms over Black's shoulders, her middle arms around her middle, and her lower arms stroking her front thighs. Yellow and Orange looked like they might have wanted to try something similar, but after all, they have something more extreme in mind already.When Violet was ready, she opened the two output chambers and invited Yellow and Orange in. \"I needed you to be in separate chambers for this one, since I don't think you'd both fit in the center chamber together in the right position.\"\"What's the right position?\" said Yellow.\"I'll need you both to crouch down on the floor of the chamber,\" said Violet, \"since you might end up too tall for the center chamber. We may want to rebuild one of the B-Ts if we want to explore this kind of thing in the future. This should do for now, though.\"Yellow and Orange squatted down in their respecting chambers and hugged their knees as Violet made her final calculations. When she was done, she pressed the button, and the doors closed.The machine clicked and hummed away, a little louder than usual, and when it was done, the center door opened, and Yellow and Orange stepped forward and ducked out of the machine.Each of them had an area of jumpsuit around their neck in the original color, but the rest of their shared body was clad in a smooth shade of marigold. Their heads were the same size as before, but everything else was a bit bigger, from their shoulders down to their feet. They were almost seven feet tall. The two of them took a deep breath at the same time, and then they let it out.\"That is weird,\" said Orange. \"This'll take some getting used to,\" said Yellow.\"I think it worked,\" said Black.\"How do you feel?\" said Violet.\"Do you feel the uncanny need to finish each other's sentences?\" said Green.\"Oh, come on,\" said Yellow. \"We do that anyway.\"\"It definitely feels different,\" said Orange. \"I can control my own body parts, but I can feel her influence, too.\" Their right hand stroked up and down on their belly, and both of them smiled at the touch, as though each of them was giving the other a little special attention at the same time.\"Well, it wasn't as though they weren't working together all the time, anyway,\" said Blue. \"At least now we have one less pair of hands around here.\"\"Says who?\" said Green, waving at her with all six hands from on Black's back.\"Yeah, being shorthanded has never exactly been our problem,\" said Violet. \"But I have lots of good data now, so I can start developing some more new algorithms. In fact,\" she said, snapping her fingers, \"Yellow and Orange have just given me the idea for something really interesting...\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "violet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "black", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "orange and yellow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "black", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:26.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6027d7b3b42109a84f30adade32bf3be9956df6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju36gnIXCJI8O74wlZ23DXN4F9cOQ7ot16iePfjZx0XGS3kJiPtV7QM.c17R8fPlp5psCVc9WhaXBmtYP_3aw5Lo9I3qiXQcn_PtGubVAQ8elFvGJRauN.L_eDjkn0GPhdzg-", "site_full": "www.ign.com", "site": "ign.com", "site_section": "http://www.ign.com/boards/forums/the-vestibule.5296/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "The Vestibule | IGN Boards", "title": "MAYDAY MAYDAY! i got high.. and im suppose to eat out my g.f after she showers but...", "title_full": "MAYDAY MAYDAY! i got high.. and im suppose to eat out my g.f after she showers but... | IGN Boards", "published": "2017-12-06T19:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 30, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.ign.com/boards/styles/default/ign/ign-logo-100x100.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 383, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0a538ae225d7e141ad06149bc2f27c62febf5bd6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju36gnIXCJI8O74wlZ23DXN4F9cOQ7ot16iePfjZx0XGS3kJiPtV7QM.c17R8fPlp5psCVc9WhaXBmtYP_3aw5Lo9I3qiXQcn_PtGubVAQ8elFvGJRauN.L_eLb.bBFtC_xbm9RCtoLTIcQ--", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "Analy_Gr3at_4lif3", "published": "2017-12-06T19:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I might just chill here for a bit then wake her up with one when i sober up, girls love being waking up with a lick.

In particular, we characterize orbitally stable vortex configurations in a symmetric harmonic trap due to a cubic repulsive interaction and a steady rotation. The ODE system is analysed in detail and the PDE model is approximated numerically. Good agreement between the two models is established in the semi-classical (Thomas\u2013Fermi) limit that corresponds to the BECs at large values of the chemical potential.

Theirs is a different kind of pain, the torment of life\u2019s cruellest question: what if? History can also be written by the vanquished, even if few people want to read their version; and though Australia have been the better team, England will reflect on their inability to either recognise or seize a number of key moments. At Brisbane they were 246 for four in the first innings , and then had Australia 209 for seven before the mysterious case of the absent Jimmy Anderson. And they will forever wonder what might have happened had they performed in the first innings at Adelaide as they did in the second. This is shaping up to be England\u2019s most frustrating tour of Australia since 1990-91, when they were competitive in all five Tests \u2013 and still lost 3-0.\nTwo down with three Ashes matches to play \u2013 is there any way back for England? | Vic Marks Read more 2) Bigger contributions needed from Cook and Root\nHope is not an abstract concept. The mind paints vivid pictures of how dreams might become real. Almost every visualisation of England retaining the Ashes had Alastair Cook scoring runs in industrial quantities, wearing down Australia\u2019s four-man attack in the baking sun as he did seven years ago. Cook looked a bit better at Adelaide but 62 runs in four innings is sadly short of par. The same is true of Joe Root\u2019s aggregate of 142, even though he is England\u2019s leading run-scorer and played admirably on the fourth evening of the second Test . Their struggles have put too much pressure on the other batsmen. The decision to move Moeen Ali above Jonny Bairstow, hard to fathom at the start of the series, now looks almost perverse.\n Alastair Cook edges behind to Steve Smith off Nathan Lyon for 37 in the first innings at Adelaide. Photograph: Dean Lewins/EPA 3) Lyon becomes a late-flowering leading man\nNathan Lyon might be cricket\u2019s Bryan Cranston, the character actor who became a leading man late in his career. He has had a profound impact on the series from day one in Brisbane , when he kept England in check on an unexpectedly slow pitch, and has since feasted on a batting line-up that could have been tailored for him: six left-handers, four of them in the top six. Ten of Lyon\u2019s 11 wickets in the series have been lefties. The right-handers have been able to survive against Lyon but no one has been able to attack him: his series economy-rate of 2.29 runs per over is the lowest of his career. He has also destroyed Moeen in both their head-to-head contests, outbowling him emphatically (11 wickets at 23 v two wickets at 98) and dismissing him in all four innings.\n4) Converting fifties into hundreds wins matches \u201cSixties aren\u2019t enough. We need 160s.\u201d Trevor Bayliss\u2019s pre-series comments sound increasingly like a clairvoyant\u2019s warning at the start of a horror film. James Vince\u2019s 83 at Brisbane \u2013 which seems an age ago, for the team and especially him \u2013 is the highest of five 50-plus scores by England batsmen. England have not only struggled to convert fifties into hundreds, they have also been unable to turn starts into fifties. An England batsman has been out between 15 and 49 on 18 occasions, twice as often as Australians have. And while Australia\u2019s record of two hundreds in two Tests is not going to inconvenience the statisticians, it\u2019s telling that Steve Smith and Shaun Marsh were the man of the match in each Test. By converting fifties into hundreds, they helped turned potential defeat into crushing victory.\nAfter the hope comes the agony \u2013 and the fear of an England Ashes whitewash | Andy Bull Read more 5) Australia\u2019s attack offer no respite\nEngland\u2019s batsmen have had three overs of respite in the whole series. Three lovely, gentle overs of part-time leg-spin bowled by Steve Smith in the second innings at Brisbane. The rest has been a relentless examination. There are no weak links in Australia\u2019s four-man attack; there aren\u2019t even any average links. Batting against them is like a cricket version of Tetris in which the demands on your skill and concentration build to breaking point. And, as in Tetris, each of the pieces do something a bit different: the way Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon complement each other brings to mind England\u2019s Fab Four of 2005. All the Australian bowlers have series averages below 30; all have, at different times, staged the kind of intervention only champions can manage. England\u2019s attack cannot compare for depth, speed or revolutions on the ball. They have struggled with the old ball, and Cummins, Australia\u2019s No9, has a higher series average than any England batsman. We thought England would miss the speed and reverse swing of Ben Stokes and Mark Wood. We didn\u2019t know the half of it.\n\u2022 Sign up to our weekly email, The Recap, here , showcasing a selection of our sport features from the past seven days.\nTopics Ashes 2017-18 England cricket team Australia cricket team The Ashes Cricket Australia sport features", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rob smyth", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jonny bairstow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryan cranston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cummins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy bull read", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe root", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh hazlewood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moeen ali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nathan lyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat cummins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben stokes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark wood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy anderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vic marks read", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trevor bayliss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shaun marsh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alastair cook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james vince", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mitchell starc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook twitter pinterest alastair cook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tetris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adelaide", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:27.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d48d0bef5f05425a153aefd71747604e17748d47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS4mlWRaQOV30AHBjwgH78HaLneCKktrsXm9.rT3o.P6Bf_jilfZExLYhJkKAdyNgGzmQc8E2mq0hwcy1xqtsZi1mkqBX80fUWza5GOIb4IaHkV5Odf9SQPXrA7MsDkvRC", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : personalfinance", "title": "With $63K in 2017 income, what are some uncommonly known tax deductions or loopholes that can lower my Federal Tax burden?", "title_full": "With $63K in 2017 income, what are some uncommonly known tax deductions or loopholes that can lower my Federal Tax burden? : personalfinance", "published": "2017-12-07T09:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.169, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d48d0bef5f05425a153aefd71747604e17748d47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS4mlWRaQOV30AHBjwgH78HaLneCKktrsXm9.rT3o.P6Bf_jilfZExLYhJkKAdyNgGzmQc8E2mq0hwcy1xqtsZi1mkqBX80fUWza5GOIb4IaHkV5Odf9SQPXrA7MsDkvRC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "point51", "published": "2017-12-07T09:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "With $63K in 2017 income, what are some uncommonly known tax deductions or loopholes that can lower my Federal Tax burden?", "text": "How is that even possible?
