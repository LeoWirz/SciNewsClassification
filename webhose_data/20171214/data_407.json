Hackers accessed the personal information, including names, social insurance and credit card numbers, as well as usernames, passwords and secret question/secret answer data of 19,000 Canadians and 145.5 million Americans. \nCurrent detection systems tend to only recognize improper activity based on past events, often long after the damage is done. \nAn example of this is Equifax, which discovered the breach in July, months after hackers first infiltrated the system.

Hackers accessed the personal information, including names, social insurance and credit card numbers, as well as usernames, passwords and secret question/secret answer data of 19,000 Canadians and 145.5 million Americans. \nCurrent detection systems tend to only recognize improper activity based on past events, often long after the damage is done. \nAn example of this is Equifax, which discovered the breach in July, months after hackers first infiltrated the system. It only notified the public in early September. \nNiranjan Mayya, founder and CEO of Toronto-based Rank Software, said it takes on average 143 days for a breach to be detected. \nThe challenge is growing as the number of connected devices in the world continues to soar. \n\"Clearly the old style techniques of looking at cybersecurity threats and having people go through each threat aren't working anymore, so automated means of detecting threats has become more and more important,\" he said. \nDavid Masson, Canadian manager for U.K.-based Darktrace, said artificial intelligence will help to keep up with threats by quickly identifying and stopping attacks by picking up on subtle markers that identify bad behaviour. \nHe said his company's systems map a customer's entire network, including every user and device, to discern even the slightest deviations as they emerge. \nMasson said AI is needed to keep up with threats by automating defence responses to growing machine-on-machine attacks launched by sophisticated hackers. \n\"You're kind of looking at a cyber arms race,\" he said in an interview. \n\"If you want to keep up with this threat and put the advantage back in the hands of the defenders you're gonna have to use AI.\" \nOntario-based utilities company Energy+ Inc. said installed Darktrace technology alerted it to a user going to a malware site in Russia and uploading undisclosed sensitive data to a third-party cloud provider that its existing security was unable to catch. \nSome observers temper the current exuberance about AI, saying it's not a silver bullet and these are nascent days for the technology. \nReceptiviti CEO Jonathan Kreindler says the hype around artificial intelligence has accelerated and has almost become a branding exercise for some companies that aren't even offering truly leading edge technology. \n\"The term AI is now being applied to any sort of algorithmic reasoning unfortunately,\" said Kreindler. \nHis firm uses AI to scour writings for unconscious use of language to understand the psychological state of company insiders who are responsible for 80 per cent of cybersecurity issues. \nCanada's largest IT company, CGI Group, said artificial intelligence is a growing field of interest for customers, although the average client is in the fairly early stages of considering AI adoption in cybersecurity. \nCGI cybersecurity expert Andrew Rogoyski said that still puts them one step ahead of most hackers, who are typically interested in stealing data using the cheapest tools possible. \nRogoyski added that he expects a strengthening of defensive mechanisms might force hackers to also adopt innovative techniques such as AI. \n\"There's a race, it's been going on for 20 years plus and the race just keeps evolving.

They were making a political point about small business taxes, an issue they're pushing to be front and centre in South Surrey-White Rock. \n\"People are saying, 'I'm paying a lot higher taxes than I was before. I'm being called a tax cheat because I'm an entrepreneur with a small business,' \" said Findlay, 62, a former national revenue minister. \nThe riding is one of four across Canada where a byelection will be held Monday, but it's anticipated to be the closest race. Conservative Dianne Watts won by just 1,400 votes over the Liberal candidate in 2015, while the NDP placed a distant third. \nThe vote arrives midway through Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's term and it's expected to test his popularity, as well as the potential of rookie leader Scheer, ahead of the 2019 election. Both men have visited the riding twice and both have suggested the outcome will indicate whether the Liberal surge of 2015 is continuing or waning. \n\"Two years ago, in the election, Canadians didn't randomly or suddenly change who we are,\" Trudeau said at a recent rally to support Liberal candidate Gordie Hogg, 71. \n\"We have always been progressive, forward-thinking, open, compassionate, ambitious people,\" he said. \"It was just about getting a government that recognizes that.\" \nSouth Surrey-White Rock has older, wealthier and whiter demographics than other ridings in Surrey, which is the fastest-growing city in Metro Vancouver. It's home to a picturesque waterfront and an array of restaurants, shops and other small businesses. \nIn July, Trudeau's government announced plans to close loopholes that it said have allowed high-earning business owners to avoid higher taxes. The measures included changes to \"income sprinkling,\" which allows owners to split income among family members. \nAfter a backlash, the government said it would cut the small business tax rate from 10.5 per cent to nine per cent by 2019. \nHogg said he and Trudeau are committed to cutting taxes for small businesses, while the Conservatives voted against a tax cut in 2015 for \"middle-class\" Canadians earning between about $45,000 and $90,000 a year. \n\"To me, their record is more important than their rhetoric,\" said Hogg. \"This byelection is about electing the strongest positive voice for our community, and only Justin Trudeau and I have a positive plan to strengthen our middle class and offer real help for families.\" \nThe seat became vacant after Watts resigned to run for leader of the B.C. Liberal Party, an informal coalition of federal Conservatives and Liberals. \nByelections will also be held in Battlefords-Lloydminster in Saskatchewan, previously held by the Conservatives; Bonavista-Burin-Trinity in Newfoundland, a Liberal seat; and Scarborough-Agincourt in Ontario, also won by the Liberals in the last election. \nIn South Surrey-White Rock, Hogg has name recognition and deep roots. He was White Rock mayor for 10 years before being elected to the B.C. legislature for two decades. Findlay, meantime, represented Delta-Richmond East in Parliament from 2011 to 2015. \nAsked about her connection to the riding, Findlay said her parents lived in the community and she has also lived there at various points, including after she was widowed at 34 and was raising her children alone. She said she moved to White Rock this summer. \nThe NDP candidate is Jonathan Silveira, 40, a real estate agent and founder of advocacy group Surrey Kids Matter. He said the byelection was an opportunity to train new volunteers and strengthen relationships, but added he was serious about winning. \n\"There are two big sharks fighting here. I am not afraid of the fight as well,\" he said. \nNew Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh has not joined Silveira in the riding. \nTrudeau's recent rally with Hogg in Surrey drew hundreds.

5:00am Last Updated December 7, 2017 - 5:10am \nOTTAWA \u2014 The Liberal government wants to lift the mystery surrounding the G7 summit as it prepares to host the gathering next year, in hopes that Canadians will feel more included and, perhaps, less inclined to protest on the periphery. \n\"The idea is to get input from Canadians,\" Peter Boehm, the Canadian G7 summit sherpa, said in an interview with The Canadian Press. \n\"What are they thinking about some of the big themes in the world, whether it's economic inclusion, what the jobs of the future might look like, climate change, energy and, indeed, some of the big foreign policy and security questions that might be out there?\" said Boehm. \nThe efforts to open the process up to Canadians includes Boehm speaking at a public event Thursday night, organized by the Toronto branch of the Canadian International Council and the G7 Research Group at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto. \n\"A lot of this is listening and then feeding it through, but also a chance for us to demystify what the G7 is,\" said Boehm, who is preparing for Canada to assume the G7 presidency in January, six months before it hosts the summit at a resort in La Malbaie, Que. \n\"It's not just a big gathering where you see a lot of people and even more security.\" \nHeavy \u2014 and armed \u2014 security presence is a common sight on the edges of G7 summits, where the need to protect the leaders of powerful countries takes on added urgency due to crowds gathered for demonstrations, which have sometimes turned into violent clashes with police. \nThe turbulent Toronto G20 summit in 2010, which included mass arrests and cases of police misconduct, reverberated for years. \nBoehm suggested involving Canadians along the road to the G7 summit is one way to get ahead of the issue. \n\"We all have the right to express our views and we fully expect that there will be people who will be expressing their views,\" said Boehm. \"My own view is that it is best to do that from an informed perspective, so that's part of the reason for the outreach.\" \nStill, Boehm said the summit organizers will nonetheless be prepared for protests. \n\"In the past at large gatherings there has also been infiltration by less desirable elements who do not want to express views nor hear views, but they want to create mayhem,\" he said. \"So, on the security side, we will certainly be ready for that.\" \n\u2014 Follow @smithjoanna on Twitter", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trudeau", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "peter boehm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boehm", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "canadian international council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the canadian press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "g7 research group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "munk school of global affairs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ottawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la malbaie", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:53.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "39ef28771d57ef1132b75e24f54b880d890d07ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Q.mD6qQ5T7ZW8Oktf9_bOY3edjJ6YVuJUMDUXpi1LmsShfB0nwv2l2TW5p.AS0ls-", "site_full": "www.cntvboxnow.com", "site": "cntvboxnow.com", "site_section": "http://www.cntvboxnow.com/forum-387-9.html", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "\u5176\u4ed6\u96fb\u53f0\u7bc0\u76ee\u5c08\u5340 -

Numbers form a totally ordered Ring. Note that in view of Theorem 8 and the distributive law, we can assert, for example, that $x \\geq 0$, $y\\geq z$ together imply $xy\\geq xz$, and that if $x\\neq 0$, we can deduce $y=z$ from $xy=xz$. \nI can't wrap my head around the second part, probably because I'm missing some obvious fact about rings or fields. Background \nSo let's see what he references here. On page 29 he writes \nTheorem 7. For all $x,y,z$ we have the identities $x0 \\equiv 0$, $x1 \\equiv x$, $xy\\equiv yx$, $(-x)y\\equiv x(-y)\\equiv -xy$, and the equalities $(x+y)z=xz+yz$, $(xy)z=x(yz)$. \nwhere \"identity\" means the actually used forms are identical and \"equality\" means the equivalence classes (of relation $=$) are identical. $\\equiv$ implies $=$. Furthermore \nTheorem 8. (i) If x and y are numbers, so is $xy$ (ii) If $x_1=x_2$, then $x_1 y = x_2 y$ (iii) If $x_1\\leq x_2$ and $y_1 \\leq y_2$, then $x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1 \\leq x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2$, the conclusion being strict if both the premises are. \nAll thats left out from the book between these citations are the proofs and corrolary Theorem 9 ($x,y$ positive implies $xy$ positive). Note that in the next part of the chapter, $\\frac{1}{x}$ gets defined in the form $\\{L|R\\}$, but the existence of the multiplicative inverse has been established above and I want to know how. My approach \nI can prove the uniqueness with the given theorems without problem. Let $y,z$ be two inverses of $x$ (i.e. $xy=1$ and $xz=1$). Then $$y\\equiv y1 = y(xz)\\equiv (xz)y = (zx)y \\equiv z(xy) = z1 \\equiv z$$ \nI fail to see its existence. We basically want to prove $x_1 y=x_2 y \\Rightarrow x_1=x_2$ (other direction of 8(ii)) using only the theorems above and the addition on surreal numbers as a abelian group. I doubt that the definitions of negative, addition and multiplication on surreal numbers are of importance here, it seems to be a pure algebraic problem. For simplicity say $x=x_1, z=x_2$. Surely I have $$0\\equiv x 0=x(y-y)\\equiv (y-y)x = yx + (-y)x \\equiv yx - yx \\equiv xy - xy = zy - zy \\equiv yz - yz = (y-y)z \\equiv z(y-y) = z0\\equiv 0$$ but of course this proves nothing. Multiplying with $1$ doesn't seem to help either (because without given existence of inverses this doesn't solve anything) and adding seems to be unhelpful, too. \nYou probably can see at once why this work or doesn't work, but if it doesn't, can you prove it? \nEdit: A colleague just gave me a hint that it suffices to prove $xy=0 \\Rightarrow x=0 \\vee y=0$, but I can't see this either.

I have advised him but I need your thoughts. \nHe met a lady around March this year and they became friends. He is an Accountant and works with a Federal Government Agency in Abuja. Along the line he asked her out and she insisted he finishes his ICAN before they can start dating. \nLong story short, she later accepted to date him. Probably because he passed all but one of the exams in the Professional stage of ICAN. He recently invested some huge sum of money into a biz deal. He told me it was actually all of his savings and he would become a multi millionaire if the deal works out. \nHe decided to test this lady to find out if she will stick with him if the going ever gets tough (as a result of our insistence that the lady isn\u2019t really into him). And so he told her that the deal he was working on had failed and that he has become broke. He said he will like to marry her and try to sustain themselves on his current salary of about 180k pending when things become better but she replied that she can\u2019t marry someone who is earning 180k monthly. \nShe feels it would make her drop from her standard of living as she wants to live inside the city of Abuja and not in the outskirts like Karu or Kubwa. Mind you, her parents live in one of these places and the guy is not even thinking of living in anywhere beyond these places like Nyanya/Mararaba. \nThis guy loves this girl so bad and is a very hardworking guy. He is hoping to get promoted when he completes his ICAN and is even looking at getting a better job in a bigger Government Agency or a Multinational company. He is so distraught at what the lady said. We have advised him to forget about her and move on, but he is considering opening up to the lady that what he said about the deal was just a test in the hope to make her re-consider him. \nPlease, were we wrong with our advice? Meanwhile, this guy\u2019s ex loves him like there is no tomorrow and she will gladly marry him even if he was earning 30k monthly but due to family pressure on him to marry a graduate and an Igbo lady, he broke up with her. Me thinks he can still persuade his parents to accept the lady. \nIf you were in our shoes, will you advice your friend differently? \nThanks for your comments. The lady earns around 180k but she mentioned that she spends around 300k when going shopping and she is scared she would no longer be able to do that if she marries him as she would have to contribute almost all her salary to maintaining the family.

I kind of see your point. He hadn't actually done anything but fantasize, however it was bit more than calling a mate to say you'd f**k a hot 14yr old. He was mingling with pedos and stated he was a boy loving pedo who'd love to f**k an 11yr old himself. It was probably only a matter of time (if he hadn't already) until he dipped into kiddy porn.

Philpott said later she still needs to discuss precise funding levels with Finance Minister Bill Morneau. \nOutstanding concerns about chronic underfunding of First Nations child welfare services has been at the centre of a protracted legal battle at the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, which issued multiple rulings urging the government to make more resources available. \nPhilpott also cited the government\u2019s decision last week to withdraw its bid for a Federal Court review of a case focused on Jordan\u2019s Principle, a policy named after a special-needs First Nations child who died in 2005 in the midst of a jurisdictional squabble between Ottawa and the Manitoba government. \nHowever, it will take more than money to solve the child welfare crisis, she added. \n\u201cA systemic problem of this magnitude calls for systemic reform,\u201d Philpott said. \u201cReform must focus on prevention: on keeping children in their families and communities, and returning children who are currently in care.\u201d \nBoth the AFN and the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society want the federal government to earmark more money for the problem, pointing to a unanimous motion passed last month in the Commons calling for an immediate $155-million cash infusion. \nCaring Society executive director Cindy Blackstock, who has been lobbying various governments on the child welfare issue for more than a decade, said the effectiveness of whatever action the government ends up taking will have to be measured at the grassroots level in terms of its impact on kids. \nShe did acknowledge, however, a \u201csignificant change\u201d since Philpott took on the Indigenous Services portfolio. \n\u201cThere\u2019s been much more openness to discussion,\u201d Blackstock said. \u201cI definitely see a difference in tone, and now I want to see differences in children\u2019s lives.\u201d \nThe federal government has said it plans to hold an emergency meeting on Indigenous child welfare in January.

(Shutterstock) \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County\u2019s computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina\u2019s most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county\u2019s computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won\u2019t significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\u201cI am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\u201d said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \u201cWe are slower, but we are up and running.\u201d \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state\u2019s largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven\u2019t affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common\u2014and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco\u2019s mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \u201ceasy targets\u201d because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\u201cOnce you\u2019re in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\u201d he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counselling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it\u2019s taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counsellors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county\u2019s 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn\u2019t able to gain access to individuals\u2019 health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county\u2019s chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \u201cpatience and hard work.\u201d Recent Articles", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jonathan drew", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irwin carmichael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dena diorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith gregg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ross rustici", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anjanette flowers grube", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cybereason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecklenburg county sheriff\u2019s office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecklenburg county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:54.063+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a1f1699157f7010345ee97a6b18b5cc4fc21b27b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwwI2uIUSts.llJU7DBb8kITxhqmDjFA3qY13AYziBOtriL67fIxYuYqTzFU3QH9SQ21EsvKlfCi_jTATS_gVQHM7CMmvJz2uSLqY.OPB59wA--", "site_full": "forums.leagueunlimited.com", "site": "leagueunlimited.com", "site_section": "http://forums.leagueunlimited.com/forums/four-corners.95/", "site_categories": ["rugby", "sports"], "section_title": "Four Corners | The Front Row Forums", "title": "Milo touring Oz in December | Page 96", "title_full": "Milo touring Oz in December | Page 96 | The Front Row Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T15:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://forums.leagueunlimited.com/data/avatars/m/5/5195.jpg?1509491654", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aa7f386ca795c09b3493471046b11ba14b6fc3b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwwI2uIUSts.llJU7DBb8kITxhqmDjFA3qY13AYziBOtriL67fIxYuYqTzFU3QH9SQ21EsvKlfCi_jTATS_gVQHM7CMmvJz2uRgclAzeaJLlLH1Uj3KnZ6d", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "Bandwagon", "published": "2017-12-07T15:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Pete Cash said: \u2191 People are allowed to like what they like but this idea that only technically proficient art is proper art is hogwash.

Huge study putting 3-D scans to the test", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray \u2014 and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer.\nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year?\nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat \u2014 overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment.\nLATEST SFGATE Free things to do in San Francisco sfgate Handout Video: Brushwood Estate Lake Tahoe sfgate How to stay safe around mountain lions sfgate The Regulars: The Performer sfgate Charter bus overturns on Hwy. 101 in SF sfgate Fun facts about Bay Area celebrities sfgate San Diego Fire Department's footage from the Lilac Fire sfgate Google Earth tour of San Francisco sfgate Spiked Eggnog Custard With Rum-Caramel Popcorn sfgate Whole Foods' first 365 store opens in the Bay Area sfgate That trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms \u2014 known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" \u2014 with standard two-dimensional digital mammography.\nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers.\n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most.\nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices.\n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\"\nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM?\nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.)\nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40.\nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, though it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram.\nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening.\nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS?\nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles \u2014 not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet the standard of care in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer.\nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts.\nHOW TO DECIDE?\nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer.\nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image.\nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death \u2014 but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening \u2014 that overdiagnosis problem.\nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost.\nTHE NEW STUDY\nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year.\nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening.\n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens.\n___\nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

That command won't actually give you any response, it's just giving fruitbox program executable status so you can subsequently run it.

That led to a deadly confrontation outside the Alberta Provincial Police barracks in downtown Coleman hours later. \nNo one knows for sure whether Picariello or family friend Florence Lassandro fired the shot that killed Const. Stephen Lawson. Both were hanged the following spring \u2014 Lassandro the only woman in Alberta to meet that fate. \n\"It gripped the nation,\" said Fred Bradley, a Crowsnest Pass heritage advocate. \"It would have been the 1920s version of the O.J. Simpson trial.\" \nWith provinces plotting out how they will manage the regulation and distribution of recreational marijuana once it becomes legal this summer, history buffs see some parallels to the waning days of alcohol prohibition in Canada. \nEvery province had its own approach to battling booze in the early 20th century. \nAnd, like the way the federal government has approached the legalization of cannabis, the rules for ending prohibition of alcohol were up to each province. \nBooze flowed freely in British Columbia three years before Alberta, so rum running between the two provinces was rampant. \nFor many in Alberta, the Lawson shooting underscored how difficult and dangerous it was to police prohibition, Bradley said. \nThe province voted to repeal the policy six months after Picariello and Lassandro were executed. Booze sales were legal again in 1924. \nOther provinces, too, grew weary of the corruption and violence that came with prohibition. Nearly a century later, the Liberal government has said one of the main goals of legalizing marijuana has been to take organized crime out of the picture. \n\"The end of prohibition was brought about because people began to recognize that the cure, as it were, was worse than the disease,\" said Vancouver historian Daniel Francis. \nProhibition had mostly ended in Canada by the end of the 1920s, but it lasted until 1933 in the United States. \nThat presented a lucrative window of opportunity to supply the U.S. market. \nThe distilling business founded by the now-prominent Bronfman family made a fortune. Fishermen in B.C. made good money transporting booze down the coast as a side business. \n\"They saw an opportunity to make a few bucks,\" said Francis. \"Most of them were small-time businessmen. They weren't big crooks.\" \nWhen prohibition ended in the Unites States, the low-level rum runners mostly got out of the illicit trade and went back to their law-abiding lives, said Francis. \n\"They had no regrets over what they'd done and no guilt that they had been engaging in criminal activity,\" he said. \"They saw themselves as a public service satisfying a quite understandable public need.\" \nSome of the kingpins, meanwhile, went on to deal in harder drugs like heroin or cocaine. And some people who served booze on the sly during prohibition became legit vendors at hotels and restaurants. \nBut Just because booze was legal didn't mean it was a free-for all, said Dan Malleck, an associate professor of health sciences at Ontario's Brock University who specializes in the history of drug and alcohol prohibition. \nAt Ontario outlets, there were no displays of products on offer. A customer had to fill out a form, line up at a counter and hand a passport-like booklet to a clerk, who would note each purchase. \nBottles were handed over concealed in brown paper bags. \nIt was no fun, but people put up with it. \n\"Most people were decent citizens who wanted to follow the rules,\" Malleck said. \nThere was a bit of a clean-up period while governments tried to nail down the right number of stores, product prices and authorized drinking locations. \nProvinces will have to find a similar balance once pot is legal, Malleck said, and its effectiveness will depend on how easily consumers can get what they want the legal way. \n\"The black market always will exist,\" said Malleck. \n\"But after prohibition that black market in booze was a fraction of what it was.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "o.j. simpson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan malleck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen lawson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emilio picariello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bradley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lassandro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coleman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "picariello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lawson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florence lassandro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malleck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred bradley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bronfman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coleman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "brock university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberta provincial police", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rocky mountains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crowsnest pass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unites states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ontario", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:55.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa1af8e33961d4cde1bc8df582bfa975454c64a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmPJr73mbL6mqEM.XF4J_9OH61kvkopg0OG3S10zTx0IB.khjuhEe.eDslTn_2hVbFCb9gwr6SkJurS2371koU23NC4A1UbeCk-", "site_full": "reason.com", "site": "reason.com", "site_section": "http://reason.com/tags/mitch-mcconnell/atom.xml", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics", "media"], "section_title": "Mitch McConnell", "title": "Mitch McConnell Says Caring About Legislative Process is For Losers.

The days are short, the nights dark, and winter is setting in. Normally I don\u2019t get excited about things like this, but when it means London is cold enough for water to freeze on the ground I start to buzz. Because I love getting my skates on, and the city has some amazing places to do it. If you\u2019re feeling the same, today I bring you inspiration in A Lady in London\u2019s guide to 5 of the best ice skating rinks in London. Best Ice Skating Rinks in London \nFrom the famous rinks in central London to the big ones further afield, the capital has an abundance of ice to glide across this winter. Some frozen spaces are adorned with Christmas trees, others feature famous landmarks in the background, and all of them are just the things to get a skater (even a bad one like me) into the seasonal spirit. 1. Ice Skating Rink at Somerset House \nThe first ice skating rink I ever saw in London was the one in the courtyard of Somerset House. As I entered through the arches, I thought I had never seen anything so magical. The giant Christmas tree and beautiful surroundings lured me in and have kept me returning every year since. 2. Ice Skating Rink at the Natural History Museum \nThe same thing happened a year later when I came across the ice skating rink at the Natural History Museum for the first time. The backdrop of the building was enough to get my heart fluttering, and the beautiful tree and colorful carousel added just the right touches of festive charm. I\u2019ve particularly enjoyed this one at sunset, when the sky turns pink and the building glows golden. 3. Ice Skating Rink at the Tower of London \nThis year is the first winter I\u2019ve been to the rink in the moat at the Tower of London. As soon as I saw it I knew it had to go on my list of the best ice skating rinks in London. The combination of floating across the frozen water and seeing one of London\u2019s most iconic historic landmarks at the same time won me over immediately. 4. Ice Skating Rink at Winter Wonderland \nI\u2019ve been ice skating in Hyde Park\u2019s Winter Wonderland a few times, and it\u2019s always fun to circle around as the Christmas market and amusement park rides buzz in the background. Given there\u2019s so much festive excitement at Winter Wonderland, it\u2019s nice to take a break and get lost in the peace of pushing one foot after the other across the ice. 5. Ice Skating Rink in Canary Wharf \nIf there\u2019s one ice skating rink in London that has eluded me these past 10 years, it\u2019s the rink in Canary Wharf. I\u2019ve heard amazing things about its size, atmosphere, and location from Londoners and visitors alike. So this year it\u2019s my goal to travel out east and get my skates on. I can\u2019t wait to see how it compares to the rest on my list. \nAnd I have a feeling it will measure up favorably.

He also said he is committed to standing up for Canadian values in a \"respectful way,\" including protecting the interests of Canadians behind bars. \n\"Canadians should be under no illusions that a free trade deal with China will be easy,\" Trudeau told reporters before returning to Canada after a four-day visit. \nBefore agreeing to formally start talks, the government wants China to agree to a broad framework that will incorporate its so-called progressive trade agenda that would place the environment, labour, gender and governance issues formally on the bargaining table. \nTrudeau acknowledged that the two countries have a lot of work to do to \"interface\" their different systems in a way that is \"mutually beneficial\" \u2014 a phrase the Chinese are fond of using. He said the two countries have already had good success in partnering on the environment. \nTrudeau suggested that getting China to agree to other parts of his progressive agenda isn't an insurmountable challenge. \n\"Trade has been an essential element in their success in lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and into the global middle class.\" \nInternational Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne stayed behind in Beijing to continue discussions over the last two days while Trudeau travelled south to China's industrial heartland to attend the Fortune Global Forum, a major gathering of international chief executives, which Canada will host next year. \nChampagne was due to return to Canada on Thursday with Trudeau with the trade discussions stalled at the exploratory phase. \n\"There was good progress made and we expect that work to continue in the weeks ahead,\" said his spokesman Joe Pickerill. \nTrudeau acknowledged that difficult discussions lie ahead in addressing concerns when Chinese state-owned companies try to buy Canadian firms. \nThe government faced criticism for allowing the takeover of Norsat by Chinese-based Hytera Communications Co. Ltd. without a full national security review. Vancouver-based Norsat makes radio systems and transceivers used by the American military and other NATO partners. \nAnd it is now weighing a proposal by a Chinese firm to buy the Canadian construction company, Aecon, which has been involved in landmark projects like the CN Tower. \n\"As a socialist economy, China has a significant role for public ownership of enterprises that is simply characteristic of their approach,\" Trudeau said. \nHe future discussions would \"reflect on the challenges, the opportunities, the advantages, the inconvenience when two systems that are different try to collaborate so we can create benefits for both groups of citizens.\" \nTrudeau said he didn't back down from raising consular cases in his meetings with Chinese leaders, including the detention of two British Columbia winery owners involved in a customs dispute. \nTrudeau said he pays closer attention to consular cases than past prime ministers \"perhaps it's because I spent a lot of time backbpacking around the world when I was younger.\" \nThe prime minister also reiterated his support for a free press when asked about a scathing Chinese newspaper editorial that chastised the media travelling with him for unfair coverage of their country. \n\"You play an essential role: a challenge function, an information function,\" he said. \n\"That is a perspective shared by many and it's one that I am very happy to repeat today.\" \nBut he demurred when asked what he thought of China banning access to websites such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and others. \n\"In Canada, we have a different history, a different approach on a broad range of things, and we will continue to stand for the way we do things, and work with people who do things differently.\" \nAs Trudeau travelled back to Canada on Thursday, analysts were underwhelmed by what he accomplished in China. \n\"The visit seemed strangely unprepared,\" said Wendy Dobson, co-director of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, who called the trip \"a missed opportunity to deepen the relationship and diversify our markets.\" \nPaul Evans, an Asia expert at the University of British Columbia, said the trip was \"successful in the minimalist sense\" because it managed to fulfil a commitment by both sides to hold a leaders' meeting each year. \nWenran Jiang, director of the Canada-China Energy and Environment Forum, said the delay in formally starting the talks \"will only further convince the Chinese side that Canada can't get anything done.\" \n\"We can't build a pipeline to the West coast when every reason is there to get it done,\" he added. \n\"We are a country of complacency, without pressure to compete with others; we tend to think we have all the high moral grounds on gender, environment, labour while others are inferior to us.\" \nDespite the differences on trade, Trudeau was warmly welcomed by President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing, as well as various other Chinese officials. And the prime minister returned the sentiment, repeatedly referring to how influential his travels 22 years ago as a student backpacker had been on him. \nHis continued affinity for China appeared undiminished on his last day as he toured a 19th Century temple and witnessed a traditional lion dance by six dancers energetically flailing in three separate red costumes. \nBefore performing a traditional eye-dotting ritual on the costumed head of one of the dancers at the Chen Clan Academy, one of his Chinese hosts declared: \n\"We will awaken the lions.\" \nMike Blanchfield, The Canadian

11:55am \nCANBERRA, Australia \u2014 Australia's Parliament voted Thursday to allow same-sex marriage across the nation, following a bitter debate settled by a much-criticized government survey of voters that strongly endorsed change. \nThe public gallery in the House of Representatives erupted with applause when the bill passed. It changes the definition of marriage from solely between a man and a woman to \"a union of two people\" excluding all others. The legislation passed with a majority that wasn't challenged, although four lawmakers registered their opposition. \n\"What a day. What a day for love, for equality, for respect. Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told Parliament. \nThe Senate passed the same legislation last week 43 votes to 12. The government later announced that same-sex couples will be able to apply to marry starting Saturday, with the first weddings potentially from Jan. 6. \nChampagne and tears flowed in the halls of Parliament House as gay celebrities including Olympic champion swimmer Ian Thorpe and actress Magda Szubanski hugged lawmakers and ordinary folk in a party atmosphere. \n\"What an amazing day, I'm a little bit delirious, it's extraordinary,\" said Szubanski, who sat in the public gallery during Thursday's daylong debate. \nThorpe thanked \"our straight brothers and sisters\" for strongly backing marriage equality in the two-month postal survey. \n\"Quite literally without them voting for us, this would never have happened,\" Thorpe said. \n\"It means that we've created an Australia that is more equitable, it's more fair, it's more just,\" he added. \nJanet Rice, a minor Greens party senator, hugged and kissed her transgender wife of 31 years, Penny Whetton, after the decision. They have been allowed to remain married because Whetton is listed as male on her birth certificate. \n\"I'm overwhelmed,\" Rice said. \"It' been such a huge thing that we've been living with for so, so long and we've finally achieved equality.\" \nAmendments meant to safeguard freedoms of speech and religion for gay-marriage opponents were all rejected, though those issues may be considered later. The government has appointed a panel to examine how to safeguard religious freedoms once gay marriage is a reality in Australia. \nLawmakers advocating marriage equality had argued that the national postal survey in November mandated a change of the marriage definition alone, so changing the law should not be delayed by other considerations. \nGay marriage was endorsed by 62 per cent of voters who responded to the postal ballot. \n\"It is now our job as members of Parliament to pass a fair bill that does not extend or create any new discriminations,\" an emotional government lawmaker Warren Entsch, who helped draft the bill, told Parliament. \"It is a strong bill that already strikes the right balance between equality and freedom of religion.\" \nMost gay rights advocates believed the government should have allowed marriages years ago and saw various ideas for a public survey as a delaying tactic. The U.N. Human Rights Committee had called the ballot survey \"an unnecessary and divisive public opinion poll.\" \nThe current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from anti-discrimination laws. \nOne of the rejected amendments would have ensured Australians could speak freely about their traditional views of marriage without fear of legal action. It was proposed by Attorney-General George Brandis and supported by Turnbull, both gay marriage supporters. \nFormer Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a high-profile advocate of traditional marriage, told Parliament that Turnbull and opposition leader Bill Shorten had failed to deliver detailed protections for freedoms of speech, conscience and religion in the bill. \n\"A promise was made by the leaders of this Parliament and the promise has not adequately been delivered on,\" Abbott said. \nAbbott pointed to an Australian teenager who lost her job for advocating against gay marriage on social media and an Australian Catholic bishop who was taken before a state anti-discrimination tribunal over a pamphlet he published extolling traditional marriage. The complaint against the bishop was dropped. \n\"The last thing we should want to do is to subject Australians to new forms of discrimination in place of old ones that are rightly gone,\" he said. \nGovernment lawmaker Trevor Evans ruled out an Australian equivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court case in which a baker who refused to provide a wedding cake for a gay couple argued he was exercising artistic freedom and was exempt from Colorado anti-discrimination laws. \n\"Let's be honest here, for a case like that to arise in Australia, it would require a gay couple who care more about activism than about the success of their own wedding, to find a business operator who cares more about religious doctrine than the commercial success of their own small business, and for both of them to commit to having a fight,\" Evans told Parliament. \n\"Typical Australians would genuinely question the bona fides of the players in a case like that and the slim prospect of that occurring doesn't warrant the pages and pages of commentary and debate that have been dedicated to it,\" he added. \nSeveral gay marriage opponents in Turnbull's conservative coalition have regarded marriage equality as inevitable and have welcomed an end to an issue that has long divided the government ranks. \nThe result is a political win for Turnbull, who became prime minister after deposing Abbott in 2015 in an internal government leadership ballot. \nAbbott was head-butted by a gay rights advocate during the postal survey campaign in September. Kevin Rudd, a centre -left Labor Party prime minister whom Abbott defeated in elections in 2013, blamed the postal ballot for an assault on his 19-year-old godson as he campaigned for marriage equality a week earlier. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to show that four, not five, lawmakers voted \"no.\" \nRod McGuirk, The Associated Press", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "george brandis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penny wong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill shorten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thorpe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janet rice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "croome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trevor evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodney croome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rod mcguirk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "szubanski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mathias cormann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren entsch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magda szubanski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin rudd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian thorpe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cormann", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "australian parliament", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labor party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.n. human rights committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:56.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "842842f5ea3eac7d606646a7d37d56e1860e401d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRD3ZWSa31se9YypCI.sz3wulZm7upUD98s__fPiD0R6odiHXKHRei4sif.jxdVXWI0yVNKg8uYcJGfWQ5dAYRCsN.TtgCJ3HOE4djRa_KCkg--", "site_full": "www.mariowiki.com", "site": "mariowiki.com", "site_section": "http://www.mariowiki.com/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Super Mario Wiki  -

But, of course, sometimes this requires a little push. It\u2019s not always a given that the man you\u2019re dating will think of you when you\u2019re away from each other; thus, you have to make him miss you. \nSo, how do you do this? How do you make him miss you so much that it improves the foundation of your relationship? How do you make him miss you so much that he wants to commit? It starts with recognizing what you\u2019re really asking. \nIf you\u2019re trying to learn how to make a man miss you, odds are high that you\u2019re really trying to become a priority in his life. You want him to long for you \u2014 sure, who doesn\u2019t want that? \u2014 but you also want him to spend more time paying attention to you and cultivating your union. \nThere are many ways you can go about achieving this desired effect, but 3 things are proven to work. And it all begins with being a safe place for him to rest his head. \nTo know how to make him miss you, you need to do these 3 things: \n1. Be his sanctuary. https://giphy.com/embed/3o6wr9y7OtpriT8q5O \nIf you were to take a class entitled \u201cHow To Make A Guy Miss You\u201d, your first quiz would be on the concept of sanctuary. \nMany men, including the ones you\u2019re likely attracted to, care deeply about their careers; they\u2019re driven by success and wealth. This can be a good thing, but it\u2019s also a stressful way to live. \nThat\u2019s why being a safe place is so appealing: a man is attracted to lightness, relaxation, and connection. After a hard day at the office, he wants to go somewhere that\u2019s the opposite. \nOffering yourself as a sanctuary has other benefits too. For one thing, many men feel as though they need to recharge so they can return to the rat race the next day. By giving him the ability to do that, you increase his confidence and vigor. Men like that \u2014 really, everyone does. \nWhat this looks like is up to you \u2014 a massage, a nice dinner, a funny movie, or maybe just an ear for him to air his troubles. \n2. Focus on the connection rather than the commitment. https://giphy.com/embed/12SvEOhOjPe3Yc Another way to get a man to miss you is to focus on your connection above all else. Focusing on the commitment first is like putting the \nAnother way to get a man to miss you is to focus on your connection above all else. Focusing on the commitment first is like putting the cart in front of the horse. \nWhat does this focus look like? It looks like getting out the proverbial cement and strengthening the connection between the two of you before you start to worry about wedding bells. Doing the opposite doesn\u2019t put a man at ease \u2014 it makes him feel pressured and unsafe. \nIn truth, it shouldn\u2019t be hard to focus on the connection \u2014 it is that intimacy that is the driving force behind any relationship. And once that intimacy is established, the commitment falls into place. \nThink about it like this: If you\u2019re a woman trying to get your guy to commit, you\u2019ve already lost the game a little bit. If you\u2019re trying to force the commitment, you\u2019ve already upset the natural polarity of allowing him to lead and allowing your relationship to play out in due time. \nStarving the connection until some sort of commitment is in place is futile: it\u2019s not fair to expect people to commit to something when they aren\u2019t yet sure if there is a connection. \n3. Give him your trust. . https://giphy.com/embed/dgoFBdwdan8NW \nThe third way to get a man to miss you is to give him something he desperately covets: your trust! \nWhen a man knows that you trust him, he knows that you are presenting him with a precious gift: the chance to be seen clearly by you. When you allow a man to lead, to plan, to handle your heart, he will want to be around you. And, when he\u2019s not, he\u2019ll miss you. \nNow, it\u2019s important to note that trusting an untrustworthy guy is never recommended. If you\u2019re with someone who has betrayed your trust over and over or lied repeatedly, there is really no reason to give him chance after chance. \nBut you should ask yourself this: why are you with someone untrustworthy in the first place? A man worthy of trust is the type of man worthy of you. \nClayton Olson is an International Relationship Coach, Master NLP Practitioner, and Facilitator.
