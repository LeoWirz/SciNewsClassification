And there's much to be said for all that sweet serenity; these are rooms both peaceful and soothing. But many parents and designers are looking to inject nurseries with a quirkier style sense, creating spaces that encourage creativity and individuality. Some want the nursery's decor to echo the decor in the rest of the home, and to have some longevity beyond the baby years. These days, a baby's room might include global elements, like Moroccan rugs and poufs; carved wooden mirrors; French light fixtures; Indian tables or wall hangings. Handmade touches might include throws, baskets, artwork or garlands made by relatives, friends or a talented Etsy.com artist. Boho nurseries tend to include imaginative prints and patterns, and the palette can range from neutral-with-a-twist to an all-out celebration of color. Eclectic, energetic and enchanting, boho nurseries are fun to decorate, and can be a visual feast for young children. Los Angeles-based Justina Blakeney is an artist, designer and founder of the blog The Jungalow. Her latest book, \"The New Bohemians Handbook\" (Abrams, October 2017), gives readers painting, decorating and lifestyle tips. \"Boho style is about tapping into your free spirit and creativity,\" she says. \"Since kids and babies have the freest spirits of all, it makes so much sense to me that their environments reflect that.\" Blakeney advises taking an exuberant, upbeat approach, creating a child's room that's full of color, pattern and (non-toxic) plants. She's just done a collection with Pottery Barn Kids that includes toy organizers, soft, plushy rugs, and a stick-on wallpaper called Jungalino. \"I also love to include things like disco balls, crystals and glow-in-the-dark elements that add sparkles, rainbows and magic to a room,\" she says. \"The artwork is based on an imaginary world I created for my daughter,\" she says. \"The world is called Glump Glump Forest, and it's where all the fanciful creatures live.\" Blakeney, who is biracial, likes bohemian style's inherent diversity, and designed a doll for the collection: \"As a child, I never had dolls that looked like me. So I was very excited for the opportunity to design a doll with brown skin and curly hair for all the little girls that might feel the same way I did growing up.\" Many mainstream retailers and smaller design studios are on the boho nursery trend. Wallpaper is one quick way to amp up the sense of adventure in a nursery. Graham & Brown has a black-and-white illustrated London cityscape that would keep little minds busy exploring, while Anthropologie has Voutsa studio's Garden Chinoiserie wall mural, full of hand-painted, oversize exotic birds, flowers and vines. Sydney Penner, an artist in Vancouver, British Columbia, with the Etsy site AneWallDecor , does moody murals of winter woods and forest creatures that might appeal to all ages. And handcrafted elements can add charm and authenticity to a boho nursery. West Elm's got a collection of decorative mirrors made by Peruvian artisans that were inspired by the intricate carpentry in old colonial homes. Los Angeles artist Kim Baise sculpts mini versions of objects like ukuleles, fruit, birds and cowboy boots out of papier mache, and strings them into playful mobiles. Also at West Elm: pretty snowglobes with colorful birds or cactus perched among the sparkles. Interior designer and HGTV contributor Erica Reitman suggests adding kilim or faux sheepskin rugs, tribal textiles, abstract art and braided baskets. \"Larger baskets can hold toys or extra blankets, and smaller baskets can store extra diapers or burp cloths,\" she says. Design studio Ace & Jig has a vibrant collection at Land of Nod that's based on antique textile patterns. A hand-tufted Indian and New Zealand wool rug features a bold, blue-and-white geometric motif. Toddler bedding comes in a black-and-white Southwestern pattern. And there's a style-savvy patchwork mat and tepee for play time.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim baise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blakeney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justina blakeney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney penner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erica reitman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "west elm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hgtv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pottery barn kids", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "etsy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthropologie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ace & jig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garden chinoiserie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west elm", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:11.081+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5290225eeb90d9210ad5f31bf5fdadb07257f23c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApv0DMcxJQqhUg5XGQxdbI7z4G1gvxwknJgzA_BwKYblhzMNM_QSZ8uJcx_thAVR7bD0exH7WzGqpXLDr3txoYZB.ocOHj7Hn0nzBdXDjkHTUV6Igf9wMUKx", "site_full": "mediaconfidential.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://mediaconfidential.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Media Confidential", "title": "Detroit Radio: Cumulus Promotes Kendall Taylor, 3 Others", "title_full": "Detroit Radio: Cumulus Promotes Kendall Taylor, 3 Others", "published": "2017-12-07T10:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5290225eeb90d9210ad5f31bf5fdadb07257f23c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApv0DMcxJQqhUg5XGQxdbI7z4G1gvxwknJgzA_BwKYblhzMNM_QSZ8uJcx_thAVR7bD0exH7WzGqpXLDr3txoYZB.ocOHj7Hn0nzBdXDjkHTUV6Igf9wMUKx", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tom Benson (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Detroit Radio: Cumulus Promotes Kendall Taylor, 3 Others", "text": "\nCumulus Media announces that it has promoted four programming professionals across its Detroit radio station group.

this year, the state was optimistic of a 6% GDP. \nHe added that Penang\u2019s GDP growth rate had surpassed the national level of 4.2% last year, with 45% of the country\u2019s manufacturing sector investments going to Penang. \nLast year, he said, Penang had also recorded the second largest investments for global establishments for services or \u201cprincipal hubs\u201d with an investment value of RM4.1 billion, after Kuala Lumpur. \n\u201cBased on this data given by the Malaysian Investment Development Authority, we have come out tops, and we feel we can hit 6% GDP this year,\u201d he told reporters at the opening of the Regus business centre at Wisma Boustead, Jalan Sultan Ahmad Shah here today. \nRegus began operations in Malaysia in 1999 and currently has 30 centres in Kuala Lumpur,

the injured.\n\nHowever, they stated that many families, numbering about 200 have been displaced due to the fighting which was said to be ongoing as of yesterday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThe problem commenced last night at about 9p.m. when the community people noticed that Fulani men had invaded their farmlands with cows, and were destroying their crops. When they went to chase the Fulani away from their farms the owners of the cows shot at them.\n\nAs I am talking to you, there is still fighting going on with the youths, young men of the community. Women and children have all left to the neighbouring communities. There are some casualties, and our community has been invaded by the Fulani herdsmen and their cows,\u201d a source from the community said.\n\nAnother source claimed that after the fighting ensued, some men in military uniform have been sighted in the community, allegedly lending some support to the Fulani herdsmen. However, the information could not be verified by THISDAY.\n\nThe police authorities in the state have confirmed the clash, but said no death was recorded on both sides.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Irene Ugbo, said a strong police contingent hadbeen deployed to restore normalcy to the area.\n\nUgbo said, so far, no casualty has been reported to the police, and that the latest information from their men on ground indicates that the situation has been brought to normal.

They are the most important equipment for electrical energy storage. In recent times the world has seen exponential growth in portable devices in critical as well as no critical functions of day to day life. This growth in portable devices has seen a tremendous growth in battery usage. Chemicals store energy in a battery and then deliver it to desired usage through a chemical reaction. In chargeable batteries this process is reversible for certain number of cycles. In non-chargeable batteries the process is not reversible. In both types of batteries once the capacity of delivering energy of the battery comes to an end it needs replacement. The new battery replaces old battery and old battery is thrown away. Due to large quantum of devices using batteries these used batteries are posing environmental concerns due to presence of hazardous chemicals. There are different ways to treat these spent batteries. These batteries can be used to extract materials, can be awarded a second life through repackaging or can be disposed scientifically.

December 7, 2017 09:23 GMT Astronomers observe two early universe galaxies on course for merger -- artist representation NRAO/AUI/NSF; D. Berry \nAstronomers using the ALMA telescope have spotted two massive, star-filled galaxies wrapped in a halo of dark matter. The galaxies, which are bound to merge into one, are seen as they appeared when the universe, which is now about 13.7 billion years old, was not even one billion years old. \nIn a paper published in the journal Nature , astronomers have painted a new picture of the early universe. According to their observations, a pair of massive galaxies existed around 780 million years after the universe formed in the Big Bang. This contradicts the current theory which suggests early universe galaxies were similar to small, low-mass dwarf galaxies we see today, while the larger ones came into existence a few billion years later. \nInitially, the galactic pair was first seen as a single object, dubbed SPT0311-58, from South Pole Telescope, but, subsequent observations from ALMA revealed that these are two galaxies, separated by several thousand light-years. \nAs a report in Seeker notes, the light from these galaxies took around 13 billion years to reach Earth, so they appear as they did when the universe was young. \nEventually, these galaxies will merge to form one of the largest galaxies known in the first billion years of the universe. \nAccording to the observations, both galaxies are likely going through a burst of star formation. The larger of the two carries about 273 billion times the mass of our sun in dust and gas, while smaller one already has about 35 billion solar masses of stars. A composite image showing the dusty glow of the two galaxies of SPT0311-58. ALMA ESO/NAOJ/NRAO), Marrone, et al.; B. Saxton (NRAO/AUI/NSF; NASA/ESA Hubble \nBut that's not the only thing that has been discovered. Researchers also found these galaxies to be surrounded by a halo of dark matter, something that suggests dark matter also had a role to play in the process of assembling the large cosmic structures of the universe. \nThe ocean of dark matter surrounding the galaxies wasn't visible, but the researchers inferred its presence through gravitational interaction with the galaxies. Further calculations revealed it is one of the most massive from that time, measuring several trillion times more than the sun. \nMoving ahead, researchers hope to find more early-universe objects like these. \"Our hope is to find more objects like this, possibly even more distant ones, to better understand this population of extreme dusty galaxies and especially their relation to the bulk population of galaxies at this epoch (epoch of reionisation -- the period when first galaxies came together).

Analysis of ancient bones claims Father Christmas did exist December 7, 2017 16:17 SGT By Sanchalita Mullick Santa Claus makes his way down Central Park West during the 91st is Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., November 23, 2017. Reuters \nIt's finally time to deck the halls with boughs of holly and jingle the bells all the way. A mushy and plump figure with a beard as white as snow, red suit and black boots with a wide buckled belt and stocking cap- that's Santa Claus for you.Though it is generally believed that Santa Claus is a myth created to amuse children, a recent discovery might add that extra tinge of reality to everyone's childhood fantasy. \nAnalysis of a fragment of bone which dates back to the fourth-century is being linked to the legend himself- Saint Nicholas. Researchers from University of Oxford radiocarbon tested the bone fragment which so long has been revered as the bones of St.Nicholas. After proper analysis of the same, it has been found that it does date back to the exact historical period to which St.Nicholas belonged, reports Mirror . \nHistorians suggest that St.Nicholas died sometime around 343 AD and the bone too belongs to the same time frame, dating back to the fourth-century AD. \nThe bone analyzed by the Oxford researchers is owned by Father Dennis O'Neill of St. Martha of Bethany Church, Shrine of All Saints, in Morton Grove, Illinois. This bone fragment is part of human pelvis. As per reports, it came from Lyon in France. \nIt is believed that St.Nicholas lived in Myra, an ancient city in Asia Minor. It now is part of Demre situated in southern Turkey. After St.Nicholas's death, his remains were collected and buried in a church in the same city. In the 11th century, his bones were removed from Demre and were taken to Bari in Italy. It was then that the Basilica di San Nicola was constructed to keep the remains of the saint. Other remains are stored in Chiesa di San Nicolo in Lido, Venice. \nThe collection in Bari has only the saint's left ilium and not the saint's full pelvis. The bone which is with Father O'Neill is from the saint's left pubis. Oxford University researchers, therefore, suggest that the bones belong to the same person. \n\"These results encourage us to now turn to the Bari and Venice relics to attempt to show that the bone remains are from the same individual,\" said Georges Kazan, director of the Oxford Relics Cluster. \"We can do this using ancient palaeogenomics or DNA testing. It is exciting to think that these relics, which date from such an ancient time, could in fact be genuine,\" he further added. \nOn studying the 500 bones fragments in Venice and comparing them with the relics in Bari it has been concluded that the sets are from the same person. \n\"This bone fragment, in contrast, suggests that we could possibly be looking at remains from St Nicholas himself,\" said Professor Tom Higham, director of the Oxford Relics Cluster at Keble College's Advanced Studies Centre. \nMysteries surrounding the Christmas legend are uncountable in number. Pretty recently archaeologists in Turkey came a step closer to finding the grave of Father Christmas. They discovered a grave which they believe to be the tomb of St.Nicholas, located below the church in Turkey's Antalya province. \nGradually walking towards the truth, only time can tell whether Santa Claus is real or just a myth.

That fanned investor concerns about debt elsewhere in the company\u2019s businesses in the South Pacific nation. Dollar bonds from wholly owned unit Adani Abbot Point Terminal Pty -- which oversees a deep water port on the coast of Queensland -- sunk to fresh lows after the news.\nWhile Adani\u2019s port business is financed separately from its mining division, the company intends to transport coal sourced from its planned Carmichael mine by rail to the export terminal at the port.\nIndustrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd., and China Construction Bank Corp. all said this week they won\u2019t loan money to develop the Carmichael mine.

They\u0092ve heard bits here and there, they\u0092re curious, they imagine they\u0092d probably enjoy it once they got involved, but they wouldn\u0092t know where to look if they walked into \u0097 oops, I mean logged onto eMusic and started poking around. My strategy is always to offer a handful of suggestions, in as wide a variety as possible. \u0093Try these,\u0094 I say. \u0093See what grabs you, and we\u0092ll work from there.\u0094\nThat\u0092s the idea behind this Dozen. Here are 12 recordings selected to entice people who have had little exposure to classical music, but who know they want more. I\u0092ve carefully contrived the list to cover a wide range of colors and styles, instruments and moods, shapes and sizes. Some pieces are light, some heavy; some charming, some imposing; some dramatic, meditative, amorous, tragic, lofty, goofy. All in all, the selections encompass 1,200 years of music history \u0097 and they\u0092ve all been chosen to make a good first impression and whet your appetite. They\u0092re \u0093gateway\u0094 works, if you will. I\u0092d be surprised if there were anyone who couldn\u0092t find something on this list that pleasured and intrigued them. Think of it as a sampler, a tapas menu: if you don\u0092t care for the stuffed olivesRenaissance Mass, try the garlic shrimp20th-century string quartet.\nAre these the twelve greatest works ever? No Wholesale Jerseys Cheap , though some of them could justly claim a place on such a list. Most of these are works I actually have suggested to people, and which have gotten a favorable response. Others I have seen appeal to newbies in ways I never expected. Others are just a few personal favorites which I proselytize for whenever possible.\nGregorian Chant For Easter\nArtist: Capella Antiqua, Munich\nRelease Date: 2006\nThe recorded history of \u0093classical\u0094 music in the Western \u0093art\u0094 tradition (so many of these terms are so problematic) begins in the medieval period with music composed for church use \u0097 settings of sacred texts in Latin for choirs singing in unison, just one note at a time. The serene meditativeness of Gregorian chant (named for liturgical reformer Pope Gregory, 540-604, who launched the practice according to legend) has made it popular in recent years, usable as a backdrop for anything from yoga to post-rave chilling. There are plenty of chant CDs out there, some with hipper packaging, but these performances by the male voices of Capella Antiqua, Munich, surrounded by a cathedral-like halo of reverb, are stately and gorgeous.\nOckeghem: Requiem\nArtist: Ensemble Organum, Marcel Prs\nRelease Date: 1993\nA friend of mine, also a musician, has played a number of classical pieces for his infant son, and reports that Allen seems to like the music of Johannes Ockeghem (c. 1410-1497) best. It could be the way this Renaissance composer weaves voices together to create a sort of ear-blanket. Or perhaps this music\u0092s low gentle murmuring reminds him of sounds in utero. Either way, the Ensemble Organum\u0092s performance of this Requiem (a Mass to honor the dead) is spacious and calm, but also possesses a sort of authoritative, virile resonance.\nBach: Six Concertos for the Margrave of Brandenburg\nArtist: Trevor Pinnock\nRelease Date: 2008\nIncomparably joyous and sparkling, these six pieces can claim to be both the greatest of baroque instrumental works and, with the possible exception of Vivaldi\u0092s \u0093Four Seasons\u0094 concertos, the most popular. Composers in the baroque era (roughly 1600-1750) prioritized a musical skill called counterpoint, the practice of combining independent instrumental or vocal lines into a complex whole. Johann Sebastian Bach had no rivals (and surely never will) in this art Wholesale Jerseys From China , giving every section of the orchestra something rewarding \u0097 and fun \u0097 to do. He built structures of grandeur and irresistible energy. Each of these concertos are scored for a different combination; if you\u0092d like a taste, try the first movement of the Concerto no. 2, in which four bright-toned soloists (violin, flute, oboe and trumpet) dance festively around the accompanying string orchestra, or the fleet finale of the Concerto no. 3, a whirlwind showpiece for strings alone.\nMOZART: Overtures\nArtist: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nAfter Bach and his contemporaries had brought Baroque counterpoint to its peak, composers of the next generation reacted by lightening the texture of their music. The melody line dominated, and the middle and bass instruments were entrusted with harmonic and rhythmic accompaniment rather than with independent lines of their own. This new style, though, was no less bubbling and energetic \u0097 see the overtures (instrumental preludes) which Mozart (1756-91) wrote for his operas. Brilliant attention-getters, arresting but never too pompous, full of catchy tunes, cheeky wind solos and stirring trumpet-and drum passages, these overtures are played with great verve by Capella Istropolitana.\nCHOPIN: Etudes Opp. 10 and 25\nArtist: Freddy Kempf\nRelease Date: 2004\nFrederic Chopin\u0092s music, full of innovations in nuances of harmony and delicate coloristic effects, pushed the boundaries of what a piano could do. In these two sets of etudes (completed in 1832 and 1836), he also pushed piano technique, making unprecedented demands of virtuosity in works that are still among the most richly dazzling ever written. Not all the pieces are finger-tanglers, though; some are studies in sensitive touch and singing melody. Though pianist Freddy Kempf\u0092s technique is precise, these etudes are for him poetry first; in op. 10 no. 3 in E or op. 25 no. 1 in A-flat, he phrases the sur\nAbington is Timberland&#37413;&#27290;.

Wireless charging is one of the emerging technologies poised to revolutionize the electronics industry by meeting the prevailing need for efficient charging with safe and portable charging. Rising demand for portable devices is one of the key factors driving the global wireless charging market forward. There is a huge demand for portable electronics with key concerns being the battery life of these devices. The wireless charging eliminates the need to carry multiple chargers, thereby driving adoption of wireless charging infrastructure for portable electronic devices. Youths are thriving towards new technologies and there has been a significant growth in the purchasing power, which are the major trends supporting the growth of wireless charging market. However, there are many challenges that the wireless charging technology is currently facing. One of the major challenges is that the wireless charging technology is not compatible with many existing devices. Relatively slow charging speed than wired charging is another challenge inhibiting the market growth. \nCurrently, North America is the largest wireless charging market worldwide. The U.S. represents the largest market for portable electronics owing to greater technology penetration, acceptance, and presence of large number of established players (Microsoft, Dell, Apple and Google) that are focusing on developing state-of-the art portable electronics. Moreover, the region has established infrastructure for the emerging technologies in terms of charging and connectivity. On the other hand, rising youth population and their evolving digital habits is expected to drive demand for mobile devices and consequent need for wireless charging in Asia Pacific during the forecast period. Countries like India and China have large base of youth population. This, coupled with rise in disposable income will further drive adoption of portable electronics and wireless chargers in the region \nTOC Of This Report : http://www.acutemarketreports.com/category/technology-market \n1.

Longtime commentator Joe Rogan views heavyweight contender Francis Ngannou as someone with that potential. \nNgannou (11-1 MMA, 6-0 UFC) picked up one of the most memorable knockouts of the year at UFC 218 this past weekend when he put former Strikeforce champ Alistair Overeem (46-15 MMA, 8-5 UFC) to sleep with a brutal one-punch finish . The performance kept \u201cThe Predator\u201d unbeaten in the UFC and set him up for a title shot against champ Stipe Miocic (17-2 MMA, 11-2 UFC). Related UFC champ Stipe Miocic \u2013 the underdog? He is against Francis Ngannou \nFighters come and go in the sport, but Ngannou\u2019s skill, attitude and harrowing backstory as an African immigrant make him a more compelling package than most. Whether that translates to mainstream attention with continued success remains to be seen, but Rogan said on today\u2019s edition of his \u201cJRE MMA Show\u201d podcast that he views Ngannou as having all the potential. \n\u201cNow they\u2019ve got a star,\u201d Rogan said. \u201cI think Ngannou, one or two more fights, you\u2019re going to be looking at Mike Tyson days. That\u2019s what I think. You\u2019re going to watch fights just to see how long these mother(expletives) can survive against this guy. That\u2019s what I think. That could be their big, breakout star.\u201d Related Francis Ngannou is getting extra bonus check, and he's using it on UFC champ Stipe Miocic \nCurrently the UFC is in a phase of uncertainty when it comes to its biggest names. Ronda Rousey is all but retired , Jon Jones can\u2019t stay out of trouble and Georges St-Pierre is dealing with health complications . The promotions marquee draw, Conor McGregor, might never fight again , according to UFC President Dana White. \nAdd all that together, and Ngannou has a real opportunity on his hands. \n\u201cConor, who knows if he\u2019s ever going to fight again,\u201d Rogan said. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know. We haven\u2019t heard Conor saying, \u2018This is my plan. This is who I\u2019m thinking of fighting. This is who I want to fight.\u2019 He\u2019s been talking (expletive) to Max Holloway, he\u2019s been talking (expletive) to Tony Ferguson, but he\u2019s not set it up.\u201d \nFor complete coverage of UFC 218 , check out the UFC Events section of the site.
