Staff Photo by Matt West prev next comments FOXBORO \u2014 Malcom Brown had a difficult time staying positive.\nThe Patriots third-year defensive tackle never missed a game because of injury in his life \u2014 not high school, college or the NFL \u2014 so a three-week absence due to a badly sprained ankle was torture.\nBut it wasn\u2019t strictly about the missed opportunities. Really, Brown has quietly become an integral figure on the Patriots defense, someone who has stepped up considerably to take on some of linebacker Dont\u2019a Hightower\u2019s leadership responsibilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m used to going out there and dealing with whatever,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt was unfortunate I couldn\u2019t go out there and help the team, and that really hurt in so many different ways that I wasn\u2019t there to help my team. I come here and try to do my job to help and support my teammates, and I was disappointed because I wasn\u2019t out there with them on the field.\u201d\nTo outsiders, Brown plays a thankless position. To his teammates, though, he has been held in high regard because they watch him organize midweek meetings, keep the front seven in check during practice, hype up the defense before it takes the field for each series and get the line in position before each snap.\nSafety Devin McCourty, a captain for the seventh time, noted it\u2019s an integral leap in Brown\u2019s development that he has been able to vocalize his message at such a meaningful level.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been huge,\u201d McCourty said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious to see how well he is playing. The thing that has been great about him is coming into his own as a leader, speaking up when needed, performance-wise always being on, practice, games, being a guy that I think everyone on defense can feed off of. He has taken the front as his responsibility to make sure they\u2019re right in the right game and with communication.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s been huge for us in a year when (Hightower) gets hurt. He was already coming into his own, and it has just picked up and gotten better throughout the season. He has been a real key part. Even the games he missed was just a little different, obviously his play but just having him in there to really be in charge of that front with him and Trey (Flowers).\u201d\nBrown has been a solid performer for three seasons, but the statistical production can come and go due to the nature of his job title. Everyone wants to hit the quarterback, but Bill Belichick often demands his space eaters contain their gaps to help others get into the backfield.\nSo it was especially sweet Sunday against the Bills when Brown had a half-sack, quarterback hit, pressure and run stuff. It was the third time this season Brown had four disruptions in the backfield, compared to one game from his first two seasons.\nIf nothing else, the performance in Buffalo validated his drive to get back to the field. Sure, he returned two weeks ago against the Dolphins, but he felt like himself against the Bills. When he was down and out for three games, only one thing really kept him upbeat.\n\u201cJust the drive to get back,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI was in there grinding and continued working to get it better. I was really motivated to get back to my teammates.\u201d\nBut Brown didn\u2019t want the praise, which is befitting of his position.\n\u201cI continue to try to come in and take a game like last Sunday and review it, and I continue to work on things that I did wrong in that game,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI don\u2019t overemphasize the things I did good. I overemphasize the things I did bad. I take what I did good humbly and try to continue to work on the things I did bad.\u201d\nIt can be easy to overlook Brown because he plays alongside Pro Bowlers like McCourty, Malcolm Butler and Stephon Gilmore and a breakout pass rusher like Flowers. Add Hightower to that group when he was healthy, too.\nBut Brown has corralled a spotlight within his own locker room. They listen when he speaks, whether it\u2019s in the middle of the week or on game day. He isn\u2019t a captain yet, but that honor appears to be in his future. Remember, when Hightower tore his pectoral muscle, a concern was the Patriots wouldn\u2019t be as in sync in the front seven, but Brown has commanded that responsibility and the trust has had a way of snowballing.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be as significant if he weren\u2019t producing, whether he is getting credit on the stat sheet or in the full-team film sessions for the so-called thankless contributions.\n\u201cHe knows he is a big part of what we need to do when it comes to stopping the run, and he has taken that challenge. It\u2019s good to see that,\u201d safety Duron Harmon said. \u201cI\u2019m excited for him because his best football is definitely ahead of him.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://embed.sendtonews.com/player3/embedcode.js?fk=KG5SCeOG&cid=4407&offsetx=0&offsety=0&floatwidth=400&floatposition=bottom-right"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "malcom brown", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jeff howe thursda", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyle van noy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill belichick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex burkhead", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob gronkowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandin cooks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick caserio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hightower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dwayne allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccourty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm butler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dion lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris hogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "devin mccourty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duron harmon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephon gilmore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt west credit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh mcdaniels", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gillette stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england patriots", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dolphins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gillette stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foxboro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foxboro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffalo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:19.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ecadf2551fdba9f5ecf50e27baaa2e576b7c142d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzuW0Up1GA78hY1rCz1aAuFGOtfAfBB.ZkNL.3EgnI6AgJX2Bt2H3pRlZctdvc1ozvU6BVSHbMZx_AUdtZGmsc9Ud6Hs1src.w_Tw54lv605sQnAa8JvgMwWZXokL9ZNID2O2GpZGPli5_SizXwsXtN", "site_full": "forums.hardwarezone.com.sg", "site": "hardwarezone.com.sg", "site_section": "http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/garage-sales-18/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "IT Garage Sales -

I have had  a lot of fun using the Elizabeth Craft Designs Snowman die set.  For this card, I used only part of the snowman's body. \nStart  with a 12x6 inch piece of Whisper Blue Soft Finish Cardstock scored across the center to create a 6 inch card. Cut a piece of white card stock 5 3/4 inches square and attach to the front of the card.  Cut a piece of the ModaScrap Let It Snow design cardstock slightly smaller and attach for the background. \nUse the third largest die in the Dotted Scallop Rectangle die set and die cut one white rectangle.  Use the fourth largest die in the Stitched Rectangle die set and die cut one rectangle.  Before removing from the die, use Faded Jeans Distress Oxide Ink to sponge on blue ink.  This will leave a white border around the rectangle die cut.  Use a white opaque marker to draw on white snowflakes to coordinate with the design cardstock.  Attach the rectangles together using a piece of dimensional tape between layers.  Attach to the lower right corner on the card. \nUse the Stylish Snowman die set and die cut the head and middle section of the snowman.  Die cut the hat, face and scarf.  If you would like a glittery snowman, die cut the pieces using Clear Double Sided Adhesive on top.  Use Basic Black Silk Microfine Glitter for the hat, Cool Diamond for the body, Orange for the nose, and Spring Peridot Silk Microfine Glitter for the scarf.  I cut a narrow piece of cardstock with Clear Double Sided Adhesive to create a hat band and added True Red Silk Microfine Glitter.  To create the polka dots on the scarf, I used a white opague pen. \nAssemble the snowman and cut off a portion of the larger body to fit across the bottom of the frame created.  Attach the snowman with dimensional tape. \nUse the Els van de Burgt Candle die set and die cut a bunch of the pine boughs using green card stock.  Arrange the pine boughs on the lower left and upper right corners of the framed snowman.  Add berries using Nuvo Crystal Drops. \nUse the Holiday Garland die set and die cut one snowflake garland.  Use a piece of white card stock with Clear Double Sided Adhesive on top when you die cut it.  Sprinkle on Cool Diamond Silk Microfine Glitter and rub in with your fingers for a sparkly finish. \nUse Susan's Garden Notes Poinsettia die set to create the flower.  Add green and yellow Prills to the center.  Shape the flower and leaves using Susan's Flower Tool Kit.  For instructions on how to shape and create this poinsettia, you can view Susan's Garden Notes Poinsettia Video at this LINK. \nUse the Garden Notes Whitepine Bough & Pinecone die set to die cut several pine boughs, using green cardstock. \nAttach the Whitepine Boughs on the upper left corner of the card.  Attach the poinsettia on top.

Then he can be happy in what he has done. He should not compare himself with his neighbor.\u201d       We are individually and uniquely made by the hand of our Creator as he knit us together in our mothers\u2019 wombs.  We have our own special styles, tastes, likes and dislikes. We have wonderful skills and talents, though similar in type are all different in degree, scope and number. We are special to God as individual works of art on his potter\u2019s wheel. It is said that God\u2019s gift to us is our talent, but our gift to God is how we use it for his glory.      As we go about the purpose of our lives and fulfill the works that God has placed along our paths we must be careful not to compare our journey with that of others. Even cars driving along on the same highway, heading in the same direction travel at different speeds going to different destinations.  Some drivers get on and never change lanes until it is time to exit; while others weave about like honey bees darting from flower to flower.       The scripture reminds us to scrutinize ourselves and to run quality control tests on our own work. As we focus on doing our best with the cards we have been dealt, we should not have time or interest in comparing our walk with anyone else.  It is good to have role models and to look up to others for examples.  It is ok to glance at the paths that others have taken so that we might learn from others' mistakes and good fortunes; but we must draw the line when we try to disregard what God has prepared for us.  Our journey is special and our way has been ordained by God.  Every walk that looks easy or better than the one we are on only causes us to sell short the benefits that God has placed in the journey we have been assigned.      Have your trips, stumbles and falls along the way been because your path has been so rough and rugged or has it been because you have your eyes gazing in someone else\u2019s lane and missed the warnings, potholes and pitfalls on your own path?.

Utterly irresistible. \nEthan Everest stole my breath the first time I saw him. He romanced me with skill, dazzled me with his charisma, and proceeded to steal my heart right after. \nI might have fallen for his easy going smile the first time we met, but I fell for him the second time. \nHoney-colored hair. Cherry-kissed lips. Captivatingly gorgeous. \nSinger Davis was the first, and only, woman to ever intimidate me. She spoke to my heart with her wit, seduced me with her eyes, and became the only thing that made sense in a world that made none. \nI let her slip through my fingers once. I won\u2019t make that mistake twice. \nSecrets broke us apart. Can a second chance bring us back together? \n\nADD TO GOODREADS \n\n\n\n\nPurchase Links \nAMAZON  US  /  UK  /  CA  /  AU \n\nFree in Kindle Unlimited \n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt \nSlipping off my shoes, I dim the lights on the wall panel. I take my clothes off and hang them on a hook near the door before returning to the tub.     The tub, warm and inviting as I step in, eases my aching feet from my high heels and the tension in my shoulders. I pour some of the bubble suds and giggle. That was so cute and showed me a whole new side to Ethan\u2014the at-home Texan who relates to his roots\u2014instead of the strong, quieter, broodier man I see sometimes.     While the suds foam and the tub fills, I look out the window. The sky is clear up here. The buildings are far enough apart to avoid spying on neighbors. It\u2019s like floating in heaven.     I hear his knock on the door, so I call, \u201cCome in,\u201d while making sure the bubbles cover all the important parts.     Ethan walks in with two glasses of champagne in one hand and the bottle in the other.     \u201cYou came prepared,\u201d I note, leaning back on one side of the tub.     \u201cI thought I might join you.\u201d He waggles his eyebrows.     I giggle and reach for a glass. \u201cCome on in,\u201d I reply and wonder if he will really take me up on my dare.     He sets the bottle and his glass down on the side of the tub. His tie was removed before he came in and I notice his shoes are long gone, along with his jacket. When he starts on the buttons of his shirt, I sit up, scooping suds over me. \u201cWait, for real?\u201d     \u201cYep. I think that tub\u2019s big enough for the two of us.\u201d     \u201cBut you said you don\u2019t take baths.\u201d     \u201cI also said I\u2019ve never used this one. Seems like an opportune time.\u201d     \u201cBut I\u2019m naked,\u201d I say, worried about everything\u2014his body naked next to mine, not shaving my legs before I went out tonight. My mind flickers through my flaws. Ugh. No. Just no. Not like that. That stuff should be shared in the dark of a bedroom under the influence of alcohol and desperate sex. We\u2019re too sober for this. I\u2019m too sober for this. What does he possibly see in me when he has women like Nicolina waiting?     He\u2019s more than I\u2019ve imagined, and in some senses, it scares me. He\u2019s the sort of man women like Nicolina land. For once though, it was as if she saw me as competition.  The feeling is exhilarating .     \u201cLike I said, seems like an opportune time.\u201d     His shirt is dropped, his undershirt following quickly behind. Good God Almighty. What does a guy who looks like that see in me? \u201cI see you like to work out.\u201d I clear my throat and want to bonk my head on the side of the tub for saying it out loud.     Chuckling, he says, \u201cI have a gym down the hall. It\u2019s how I relieve stress.\u201d     \u201cI thought that\u2019s what sex was for.\u201d I gasp and cover my mouth, wishing I could keep my crazy thoughts in my head where they belong instead of on my tongue. His eyes are heavy, a smirky smirk restraining a laugh. \u201cGod, you cannot let me talk when I\u2019m nervous.\u201d     \u201cIf this is what happens when you\u2019re nervous, I\u2019ll make you nervous more often.\u201d His pants come down and my curiosity is answered. Tonight he\u2019s in boxers. When he catches my eyes on his package, I\u2019m thankful I\u2019m wearing waterproof mascara because I immediately go underwater. Screw my makeup. It\u2019s really the only way to keep my mouth in check at this point. I count to five and then pop back up.

With caramel sauce. Made from scratch. Or not, I guess, if you\u2019d rather not? There\u2019s always those canned biscuits you could use if you\u2019re short on time (been there). Or overwhelmed with life (also been there). Or hangry (do I even need to say?).\nBut guys. Here\u2019s my pitch: I really think you should go for the made-from-scratch version this year.\nWe can handle this! Look at us, being all grown up. Adulting and all that. You will be big-time rewarded with fluffy dough and amazing bread smells for all your hard work. And hard work = 30 seconds of stirring.\nThis brioche dough that we\u2019re using is ultra-pillowy, soft, and luscious. Also: stupidly easy. Remember whose blog you\u2019re reading, okay? Bread Idiot, that\u2019s who. I have zero time for fussy bread recipes. As soon as I have to bust out any type of special equipment \u2013 a scale, a thermometer, a Danish dough whisk? First of all, no. Secondly, store-bought bread all the way.\nI ONLY do homemade bread if it\u2019s completely foolproof. And this one is completely foolproof.\nAs is the sauce! When you use Land O Lakes\u00ae Butter and Heavy Whipping Cream, you really don\u2019t need much else to get the caramel sauce of your dreams. The butter and the brown sugar alone would make a lovely caramel sauce, but you are not looking for lovely, are you? You are looking for an elevated, next level, knock-your-holiday-slippers-off kind of caramel situation, which is where that heavy cream comes in.\nI could (did) stand in front of that pan of silky caramel sauce with a spoon. A straight-up SPOON. This caramel is not messing around.\nBefore baking (um, caramel overload)\u2026\nAnd after.\nDid you guys know: monkey bread is also called \u201cmonkey puzzle bread, sticky bread, Hungarian coffee cake, golden crown, pinch-me cake, and pluck-it cake\u201d and it most commonly refers to \u201ca soft, sweet, sticky pastry served in the United States for breakfast\u201d according to Wiki? Aka what are we even doing in America. Eating buttery bread drenched in caramel sauce for BREAKFAST. For breakfast?!\nDear America, I hardcore love us right now.\nHappy holiday brunching, friends.\nGooey Caramel Monkey Bread Author: Lindsay Yield: 10 Print Recipe Pin Recipe Description This Gooey Caramel Monkey Bread is LOADED with homemade caramel sauce and made with a pillowy homemade brioche dough. Perfect made-from-scratch, crowd-pleasing recipe that is conveniently low-maintenance. Just how I like it.\nIngredients For the Dough: \n1 cup lukewarm water 1 packet instant yeast (about 2 teaspoons) 2 teaspoons salt 1/4 cup honey or sugar 4 large eggs 3/4 cup butter (melted) 4 1/2 cups flour (more for dusting) You can also just use canned biscuit dough if you prefer, but I strongly recommend making your dough from scratch! The smells! The pillowy texture! Worth it. \nFor the Caramel Sauce: \n1/2 cup butter (I prefer salted) 1/2 cup Land O Lakes\u00ae Heavy Whipping Cream 1 1/2 cups brown sugar a hit of sea salt if you like that kinda thing Instructions Make the Dough: Mix all the dough ingredients together in a mixing bowl, adding flour last. The mixture will be sticky. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Set aside in a warm-ish place to rise for 2 hours. Once it has risen, transfer to the fridge to chill so it\u2019s easier to handle. Roll the Dough: When the dough has chilled, roll out half of it on a floured surface to a medium thickness. Cut it into bite-sized pieces or roll into balls. Wrap the other half of the dough in plastic wrap and store in the freezer for next time. Make the Sauce: Melt the butter, heavy cream, and brown sugar in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, and heat for exactly five minutes. Remove from heat. Assemble: In a bundt\u00ae pan or pie pan, layer: 1/4 cup caramel sauce, dough, 1/4 cup caramel sauce, dough, 1/4 cup caramel sauce. Reserve the remaining sauce. Bake: Bake for 25-30 minutes at 350 degrees or until the top pieces are browning a little bit. Invert onto a serving plate and top with extra sauce if you want (um, yes, I DO WANT). Enjoy! Notes Ideal schedule for warm, gooey, made-from-scratch monkey bread in the morning:\n8pm \u2013 mix up the dough 10pm \u2013 pop dough in fridge 8am \u2013 make sauce and bake! This batch makes twice the amount of dough you need, so I\u2019d suggest that the remaining dough can be used for round two of monkey bread, or cinnamon rolls, or a tea ring \u2026 you name it! The dough doesn\u2019t do great in the fridge for long periods of time (it gets a fermented taste to it), so I\u2019d suggest freezing it. And then you will want to bring the chilled dough back to room temperature before baking. I usually just let it sit on the counter while I make the sauce and that seems to work fine.\nThe sauce will firm up as it cools. To use the last of your sauce on the baked bread, just gently heat it in the saucepan again and it should loosen back up.\nIt does not work to make the sauce ahead and save it. When I did this, the sauce on the monkey bread turned into more of a hard caramel. So make your caramel sauce fresh if you want it to be nice and gooey.\nThis recipe works best if your eggs are at room temperature (if they are too cold, it can affect the rise time for the dough). I usually just stick them in a bowl of warm water to warm them up and then crack them into the dough bowl.\nDid you make this recipe?

Read More Burton hospital backs high-profile 'Green bag' campaign to stop medicine mix ups \n\"By including senior sisters in the process, it also allowed us to pinpoint the exact skills and requirements we needed for our clinical teams, so that we could hire the right people for the right jobs. \n\"It is well documented that trusts are struggling to attract nurses to their hospitals and there is a national shortage. \n\"But this is a very positive time for the Trust and I am confident that our new recruits will provide the people of Burton, Lichfield and Tamworth with the high-quality care that they expect.\" \nThe good news comes just days after national figures revealed a third of workers in some NHS trusts quit their post in the last year alone. \nThe shock findings prompted bosses at Burton to reassure residents that recruitment remains \"one of the trust's key focuses for the near future.\" Read More Burton hospital removes super-sized snacks from shelves in bid to curb obesity \nAccording to national statistics, the number of full- time nurses and health visitors in England dropped between April 2016 and April 2017 by 469. \nStaff retention has been labelled as a big issue within the NHS with a leaver rate varying from under ten per cent in some trusts to more than 30 per cent in some acute and mental trusts. \nPaula insisted that the trust was firmly focused on recruitment but faced challenges similar to other hospitals in the country.

The current level of the shares currently stands at 0.34 at the time of writing. \nSAR stands for stop and reverse and it is a trend following indicator, designed to identify the turning point in price action. The parabolic SAR is shown on the charts as a series of small \u2018dots\u2019 that are placed either above or below the price. When the price is trending to the upside, the dots are below the price action and when the price is trending to the downside, the dots are above the price action. \nWhen the share price closes above the upper Parabolic SAR, a trader could interpret a buy signal. The Parabolic SAR will move from being above price to below price and the trader would cover any existing short positions and reverse direction and buy long. \nWhen the price closes below the lower Parabolic SAR, a trader could interpret a sell signal. The Parabolic SAR will move from being below price to above price and the trader would sell any existing long positions and reverse direction and go short. \nInvestors and traders using technical analysis to examine stocks may be interested in taking a look at the ATR or Average True Range. Currently, Sonoma Pharmaceuticals Inc (SNOAW) has a 14-day ATR of 0.03. The Average True Range is an investor tool used to measure stock volatility. The ATR is not used to figure out price direction, just to measure volatility. The ATR is an indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder. Wilder has developed multiple indicators that are still quite popular in today\u2019s investing landscape. The general interpretation of the ATR is the higher the ATR value, the higher the volatility. \nThe Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is another technical indicator worth checking out. Sonoma Pharmaceuticals Inc (SNOAW) currently has a 14 day Williams %R of -75.00. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. The Williams %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator except it is plotted upside-down. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. If the indicator travels under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. Chart analysts may also use the indicator to project possible price reversals and to define trends. \nThe Average Directional Index or ADX is technical analysis indicator used to discern if a market is trending or not trending. The ADX alone measures trend strength but not direction. Using the ADX with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) may help determine the direction of the trend as well as the overall momentum. Many traders will use the ADX alongside other indicators in order to help spot proper trading entry/exit points. Currently, the 14-day ADX for Sonoma Pharmaceuticals Inc (SNOAW) is 11.47. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would signal a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would indicate an extremely strong trend. \nTraders may be leaning on technical stock analysis to help with investing decisions. Sonoma Pharmaceuticals Inc (SNOAW) currently has   -86.74. Despite the name, CCI can be used on other investment tools such as stocks. The CCI was designed to typically stay within the reading of -100 to +100. Traders may use the indicator to determine stock trends or to identify overbought/oversold conditions. A CCI reading above +100 would imply that the stock is overbought and possibly ready for a correction. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally. \nTraders are paying renewed attention to shares of Sonoma Pharmaceuticals Inc (SNOAW). The current 14-day RSI is presently sitting at 42.82, the 7-day is 33.25, and the 3-day is 5.75. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index is a popular oscillating indicator among traders and investors. The RSI operates in a range-bound area with values between 0 and 100. When the RSI line moves up, the stock may be experiencing strength. The opposite is the case when the RSI line is heading lower. Different time periods may be used when using the RSI indicator. The RSI may be more volatile using a shorter period of time. Many traders keep an eye on the 30 and 70 marks on the RSI scale. A move above 70 is widely considered to show the stock as overbought, and a move below 30 would indicate that the stock may be oversold. Traders may use these levels to help identify stock price reversals. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wilder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sonoma pharmaceuticals inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sar privacy policy sonoma pharmaceuticals inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pharmaceuticals inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parabolic sar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sonoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parabolic sar", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:21.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "510ba5f62792b422b8b4ba665c3d481fbb2b6654", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_UXDMvUJZM5T_MBKJ2KpCzXV0iKVXyRvMT3vW1OPhW3FqBBbzHjhA7PfSOny5iTi6pY1H_ZNklKnlGhmbN9rYN.YSlLJZyGp3QDXfIKAX9qu5GzruMWrAQiXbdLC86XUM.TFL.FLNqOQ--", "site_full": "www.jobmail.co.za", "site": "jobmail.co.za", "site_section": "http://m.jobmail.co.za/rss?_SECTION=20&_CATEGORY=189&_REGION=", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Job Mail RSS feed | Manufacturing | Manufacturing Production", "title": "Quality Engineer", "title_full": "Quality Engineer", "published": "2017-12-07T09:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.jobmail.co.za/baracuda/images/logo_small200x200.jpg?date=20171207120001", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 18088, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "510ba5f62792b422b8b4ba665c3d481fbb2b6654", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_UXDMvUJZM5T_MBKJ2KpCzXV0iKVXyRvMT3vW1OPhW3FqBBbzHjhA7PfSOny5iTi6pY1H_ZNklKnlGhmbN9rYN.YSlLJZyGp3QDXfIKAX9qu5GzruMWrAQiXbdLC86XUM.TFL.FLNqOQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "Quality Engineer", "text": "Region : Gauteng / Johannesburg / Germiston Company : Qinani Personnel \nTertiary qualification in Engineering, Analytical Chemistry or equivalent Minimum 3 years\u2019 experience in Manufacturing, Quality environment.

I loved this. Dial H for Hero was thus amalgamated with Generation X's Husk, a mutant who would \"shed her skin\" and gain new powers with each transformation. A natural combo.\n\nSo in this reality, Paige Guthrie finds a mysterious Dial in a cave in the Appalachians, found a way to dial H-U-S-K on it, and presto changeo, it focused her latent mutant powers. Now she hangs with the X-Patrol...\n\nCase 67: X-Patrol #1 and Exciting X-Patrol #1\nDial Holder: Paige Guthrie AKA H.U.S.K.\nDial Type: The Big Dial (Amalgam Universe)\nDialing: The Dial has a slightly different appearance in this universe - it is sleeker and seems to have a triangular pattern (like a ray beam?) on the top instead of a red circle. There are no discernible finger holes or letters on it. When Paige dials H-U-S-K (which begs the question why anyone would spell out this particular word), it focuses her latent mutant ability and release her super-powered \"inner selves\". When turning into a new character, skin explodes off her like energy. She instinctively knows the name and powers of each persona, but doesn't know whether it's an aspect of herself or a mask under which the real Paige hides. Each persona has its own distinct personality. She can dial straight from one identity to another without reverting to her true self. She wears the Dial as a belt buckle for easy access. Unusually, her very first identity looks just like Paige (albeit in costume).\nName: Wonder-Girl (combines Wonder Girl with Wonder Man, but comes out sounding just like the former)\nCostume: A starfield sleeveless leotard (pinched from Troia), with a stripy belt, a big \"W across the chest, and goggles (taken from Marvel's Wonder Man). Presumably, those accessories are red, as per both amalgamated characters' color schemes. It's possible she has jets attached to her belt, though her right side is missing the pod.\nPowers: Unknown. Presumably, great strength and invulnerability. Possibly jet-assisted flight.\nSighted: Coming out of an Appalachian cave.\nPossibilities: Obviously, Amazon scientists created her out of pure ion energy so she could infiltrate the X-Patrol (sorry, that's where the Titans got Amalgamated, not very satisfying). She died, but was resurrected soon enough to become part of the team. As Donna Williams, she has a satisfying career as a movie stills photographer in Hollywood.\nIntegration Quotient: 90% (looks good, and the Titans really did get the shaft in Amalgam, so a Wonder Girl, hyphenated or not, is a no-brainer)\nName: Polaris, Mistress of Magnetism (combines the X-Men's Polaris and DC's Dr. Polaris)\nCostume: A buxom female version of Dr. Polaris, in purple and blue, with a silly magnet emblem, and a helmet with radio antennae. Rather silly.\nPowers: Magnetic control.\nSighted: In Latveria, fighting Doctor Doomsday.\nPossibilities: She seems to wear too much tech to be a mutant, so let's say that like H-U-S-K herself, the powers are latent until unleashed by her armor. Which she developed herself to fight crime. But definitely a utility player on some B-team, like the Thundersquad, or the Great Primal Avengers.\nIntegration Quotient: 15% (sorry, that costume holds no attraction)\nName: Mary Marvel Girl (this clunky moniker combines Mary Marvel and Marvel Girl)\nCostume: In dark blueish grays with yellow accents, this redhead sports a short cape, cleavage that turns into a lightning bolt, a flared and lined collar, a short cape, and a pointy domino mask. It looks good, if muted and cold.\nPowers: Telekinesis, but a reference to Minerva's wisdom suggests he has other attributes (if not powers) lent her by the Greek Gods. \nSighted: Escaping Latveria with the X-Patrol.\nPossibilities: With a hokey speech pattern and apparent link to the Gods, Mary is probably younger than she appears. Unlike the Judgment League Avengers' Captain Marvel, she does not seem to have a relationship to the Kree. How do we resolve this? Well, maybe every planet has (or could have) a champion chosen by a pantheon of gods. I bet these Champions of the Lightning could have their own series down the line.\nIntegration Quotient: 70% (some inconsistencies in the Amalgam continuity keep her at arm's length, but it's not insoluble)\nName: Artemisty Knight (a mouthful, combining Artemis - the 90s Wonder Woman replacement - and Misty Knight)\nCostume: A muscled black woman with a long, curly ponytail, Artmemisty wears blue and metal gray. Her right arm is mechanical, but not her hand. The left has lots of leather straps to create a makeshift glove. Leather leg bands encircle her high boots and are supplemented by two demonic skulls on the thighs (with spikes going around to the back). She has a headband with a circle in the middle, carries a quiver very low, and holds a greenish bow.\nPowers: The \"Bionic Amazon Archer\" has a super-strong mechanical arm she uses to unleash arrows at great speed, accuracy and power.\nSighted: Fighting Brother Brood's forces.\nPossibilities: While her name is iffy, Artemisty works fine as an Amazon who almost lost an arm, but was repaired by those Amazon scientists I made up, above. She probably rides around Man's World on a motorbike, teaming up with Shiva Wing. Together they are... the Daughters of Richard Dragon! Adopted, presumably.\nIntegration Quotient: 70% (easy to dump an Amazon into a world that has them, but the design and name are a bit baroque)\n\nNext: The Silver Age returns!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "minerva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donna williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paige", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "artemisty knight", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kree", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary marvel girl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paige guthrie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "polaris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard dragon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "artmemisty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "artemisty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary marvel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "polaris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judgment league avengers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shiva wing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "artemis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latveria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "troia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:21.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eecff17dc7bb8efc2f17fd381cd5428abc76df7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSR.hh2NLkPt1plwxBPrCHnhZqiF5FWZ9g5jRJgyELD06i2H49bMIbxrzRLWAn8Dm8imT5xinTjGbUL7MVuauGaJxHsccjol3ry_HLyTH8dfpLryWtai6pDe70bR5AeqWRruY.shBYmmLM0y7kz2y0URtySLy.Bvq0-", "site_full": "kentesafety.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://kentesafety.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BBC launches \u2018Own It\u2019 website to help under-12s navigate online risks #esafety #onlinesafety \u2013 Kent Online Safety Blog", "title": "BBC launches \u2018Own It\u2019 website to help under-12s navigate online risks #esafety #onlinesafety", "title_full": "BBC launches \u2018Own It\u2019 website to help under-12s navigate online risks #esafety #onlinesafety", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eecff17dc7bb8efc2f17fd381cd5428abc76df7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSR.hh2NLkPt1plwxBPrCHnhZqiF5FWZ9g5jRJgyELD06i2H49bMIbxrzRLWAn8Dm8imT5xinTjGbUL7MVuauGaJxHsccjol3ry_HLyTH8dfpLryWtai6pDe70bR5AeqWRruY.shBYmmLM0y7kz2y0URtySLy.Bvq0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kentesafety", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "BBC launches \u2018Own It\u2019 website to help under-12s navigate online risks #esafety #onlinesafety", "text": "The BBC have launched a new website to help 9-12 year-olds navigate \u201cthe day-to-day pressures and dilemmas of life online\u201d.\nThe site, Own It , features video clips and content by presenters and vloggers talking about issues including cyberbullying, privacy and online safety.

We will now glance at the kingdom of Judah. Jehoshaphat was a good king, but he was too friendly with the idol worshipping kings of Israel and the sad result was evil kings on the throne in Judah.    2 Chronicles 21:1; 4; 6; 18-20 1 Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Jehoram his son reigned in his place. 4 When Jehoram had ascended the throne of his father and was established, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and also some of the princes of Israel. (He followed the cruel policy of many oriental tyrants who are afraid of rivals. He put to death anyone who might rise to power through their position or influence. Jehoram\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brothers were better than he was. Perhaps this was why he was so hardened against them.) 6 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did what was evil in the sight of the L ORD . (A lot about our future depends on whom we marry. Whether for good or evil, our spouse will influence our entire life. Jehoram acted wickedly. He married the daughter of wicked Ahab. May all the marriages of our family be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the Lord.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) Jehoram\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sin resulted in his country being looted, his palace abandoned, and his wives and children carried off as prisoners. None of this caused him to repent of his wickedness. 1 8 And after all this the  L ORD  struck him in his bowels with an incurable disease. 1 9 In course of time, at the end of two years,\u00e2\u20ac\u015ahe died in great agony. His people made no fire in his honor, like the fires made for his fathers. 2 0 He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. And he departed with no one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regret. (No one placed value in his life or mourned his death.) They buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings. They did not think his body was worth burying with the godly kings. Those who despise God will not get much respect.    2 Chronicles 22:1-9 1 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place, for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned. 2 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri. 3 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor in doing wickedly. Athaliah was the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel. She married Jehoram. She ruined her husband and influenced her son to be evil. Mothers have great influence in their families. They are the queens of the household and shape the future of their children. 4 He did what was evil in the sight of the  L ORD , as the house of Ahab had done. For after the death of his father they were his counselors, to his undoing. (His father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s counselors became his advisors. Counselors to wickedness are counselors to destruction.) 5 He even followed their counsel and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to make war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead. And the Syrians wounded Joram, 6 and he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that he received at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was wounded. 7 But it was ordained by God that the downfall of Ahaziah should come about through his going to visit Joram. For when he came there, he went out with Jehoram to meet Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the  L ORD  had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab. 8 And when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he met the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brothers, who attended Ahaziah, and he killed them. 9 a He searched for Ahaziah, and he was captured while hiding in Samaria, and he was brought to Jehu and put to death. (Ahaziah had sinned like those in the house of Ahab and their overthrow also led to his destruction. His mother and his wife were both of the evil family of Ahab. He was twice cursed and the downfall of Ahab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family became his too. We should never have close associations on earth with those whom we want to be separated from on the day of judgment.) They buried him, for they said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat, who sought the  L ORD  with all his heart.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (They buried him out of respect for his godly grandfather. Otherwise his body would have been left to the dogs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked will rot.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d 2 ) 1 Proverbs 12:7 2 Proverbs 10:7 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ahab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athaliah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jehoshaphat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jehu the son of nimshi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jehoram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hazael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jehu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahaziah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joram", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "samaria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jezreel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahab\u00e2", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:22.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53f4f87bb63c179e02c44365a41fa92a1d43f7d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqa1FEjeW2baoziLEWcOYh39YWUojGUPifxzbxMxwftVRbaApuin9pAiYgQZj0k0GVbZQe4RGTd5BYH6SVw797qJdXyCRh0K.ocYB7hAtjw9al5NQz2IsyQoPDqlpE3r9I-", "site_full": "bizpr.us", "site": "bizpr.us", "site_section": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/Bizprco", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BizPR.co", "title": "Free Standing Display Units Market Explores New Growth Opportunities By 2024", "title_full": "Free Standing Display Units Market Explores New Growth Opportunities By 2024", "published": "2017-12-07T11:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bizpr.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Free-Standing-Display-Units.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "53f4f87bb63c179e02c44365a41fa92a1d43f7d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqa1FEjeW2baoziLEWcOYh39YWUojGUPifxzbxMxwftVRbaApuin9pAiYgQZj0k0GVbZQe4RGTd5BYH6SVw797qJdXyCRh0K.ocYB7hAtjw9al5NQz2IsyQoPDqlpE3r9I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "amyjames", "published": "2017-12-07T11:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "Free Standing Display Units Market Explores New Growth Opportunities By 2024", "text": "December 7, 2017 Business Internet Press Release No comments Introduction Over the last few years, there has been a change in transition in retail business structure from local stores to organized chains such as supermarkets and hypermarkets.

All political parties frequently spend a lot of their time criticising their opponents, which is a legitimate thing to do but is often overdone, and even the most normally truthful of politicians seem to have to guard against a propensity to go \"over the top\" when talking about their rivals. One of the many reasons why this is a bad idea is if you have grossly exaggerated the threat posed by your opponents in the past, it has a diminishing effect, and also leaves you with no good way to say \"look guys, we really mean it this time.\" For example, the Labour party has claimed in every election for the past fifty years or so that the Conservatives will destroy the NHS if they get into or stay in power. As the Conservatives have been in office after seven of those elections and 29 of the last 50 years, and the NHS is still here, just about everyone in the country who isn't hopelessly gullible or a total cretin has worked out that these allegations are at least an overstatement of the case. The majority of voters take them with a large pinch of salt. What on earth would Labour say in the unlikely event that they were ever up against a party which really did want to destroy the NHS? The Democrats had a problem with Donald Trump which was not dissimilar to this in 2016 and the Conservatives have more than a hint of the same issue when dealing with Jeremy Corbyn now. Now I would not for a moment accept that the Conservative campaign against Ed Miliband misrepresented the truth of his position to anything like the same extent that Labour routinely misrepresents the Conservative position and record on the National Health Service. But we do have to find a way to get over that the present leadership of the Labour party is genuinely different to anything we have seen in this country before. They stand for a much more extreme brand of a philosophy of which a mild version nearly wrecked this country half a century ago. Ironically the Labour leadership themselves and their supporters in Momentum are keen to explain the same thing. Momentum keep telling some of their own MPs and councillors to \" **** off and join the Tories \" because compared to them people like Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock look like Liberal Democrats and a good chunk of their own party do look like Tories. In the clip below from the 2016 US presidential campaign, Democrat supporter and comedian hit this issue head on: he's a comedian and what he says is meant to be funny but he's not really joking. Paraphrasing wildly, Maher more or less apologises for most of the rude things that he and other Democrats had said about Mitt Romney, John McCain and even George W Bush, calling them \"honourable men who we disagreed with and we should have left it that way\" and essentially saying that liberals had been crying wolf in their attacks on previous Republican candidates but that Donald J Trump really was everything they had said about the previous candidates. It didn't work. I can understand why. \" We were wrong before but we're telling the truth now \" is not the most persuasive of slogans. And given that Trump is now the President, let's hope that Maher was wrong about him as he now admits he was about Romney, McCain and Bush. But I cannot help thinking that he was onto something in the belief which prompted him to make the speech in the clip below, that the criticisms which he and others had made about previous republican candidates were much more true of Trump. A similar principle applies to the Corbyn leadership of the Labour party, which is why Dan Hannan's piece above felt to me as though he was channelling Bill Maher. In terms of their wish to dismantle the existing order and in a number of other respects Trump has far more in common with Corbyn that either would like to think.

The current level of the shares currently stands at 0.0030 at the time of writing. \nSAR stands for stop and reverse and it is a trend following indicator, designed to identify the turning point in price action. The parabolic SAR is shown on the charts as a series of small \u2018dots\u2019 that are placed either above or below the price. When the price is trending to the upside, the dots are below the price action and when the price is trending to the downside, the dots are above the price action. \nWhen the share price closes above the upper Parabolic SAR, a trader could interpret a buy signal. The Parabolic SAR will move from being above price to below price and the trader would cover any existing short positions and reverse direction and buy long. \nWhen the price closes below the lower Parabolic SAR, a trader could interpret a sell signal. The Parabolic SAR will move from being below price to above price and the trader would sell any existing long positions and reverse direction and go short. \nTraders may be keeping a close eye on ATR indicators. The current 14-day ATR for Jetcom Inc [F] (JTCMF) is currently sitting at 0.01. The ATR measures the volatility of a stock on a day-to-day basis. The average true range is typically based on 14 periods and may be calculated daily, weekly, monthly, or intraday. The ATR is not considered a directional indicator, but it may reflect the strength of a particular move. \nChecking in on some other technical levels, the 14-day RSI is currently at 46.46, the 7-day stands at 45.08, and the 3-day is sitting at 44.72. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a commonly used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued. \nAnother technical indicator that may be a powerful resource for determining trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970\u2019s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Jetcom Inc [F] (JTCMF) is noted at 44.77. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. \nThe Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is another technical indicator worth taking a look at. Jetcom Inc [F] (JTCMF) currently has a 14 day Williams %R of -85.71. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. The Williams %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator except it is plotted upside-down. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. If the indicator travels under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. Chart analysts may also use the indicator to project possible price reversals and to define trends. \nJetcom Inc [F] (JTCMF) currently has   -61.80. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jetcom inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parabolic sar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:22.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cd639a8145ecf0633cb7e5975c5c117a2739aa21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dlGaiyHn9kDUa_u6LiPoacx9EhguERruduwRn.rLi8pF1JeT3oVkFUTXBkimsy_OGDrDjkfMxE1CoDiZXGos3", "site_full": "www.aldeer.com", "site": "aldeer.com", "site_section": "http://www.aldeer.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&Board=11", "site_categories": ["hunting_shooting", "sports"], "section_title": "Land, Leases, and Hunting Clubs - Aldeer", "title": "Any hunters looking for club.", "title_full": "Any hunters looking for club. - Aldeer", "published": "2017-12-06T12:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.124, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f35376289821c00fdd4e1a875b58d723515c9d58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dlGaiyHn9kDUa_u6LiPoacx9EhguERruduwRn.rLi8pF1JeT3oVkFUTXBkimsy_OGDrDjkfMxEyEPc3Ex6I4KQyMtqyhm.VG2IXzBi2b14g--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "mike35549", "published": "2017-12-06T16:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "$13 or so an acre must be some really good land.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:22.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "24458a352db18039c4e3ea1f8730aa5be0140371", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYC0LVt_uHgOI1t29UBwjMT2", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp;
