Miami is given the rare chance to end their season with another home game in a very prestigious bowl game. I am going to highlight 5 things that all Hurricane fans should be watching when Miami takes on Wisconsin in the Orange Bowl. 1. Will the Hurricanes show up? This is something we became accustomed to during the Shannon and Golden eras. The Hurricanes rarely showed up for meaningless bowl games at the end of the season and time after time would get embarrassed on National Television. Last year Mark Richt proved that he can get a team ready to play in a postseason bowl as Miami took down West Virginia easily to win the Russel Athletic Bowl. While this may not seem like a huge deal, it set up the momentum Miami had at the beginning of the season. Now some of you may wonder, how is it possible that Miami won\u2019t show up to a game at their own stadium? It is easy to mail it in once you fall short of your main goal, especially in the brutal fashion that Miami did. I think it is important for Miami to be competitive in this game and show up for their final home game of the season. It will give the returning players confidence for next season, and the fans hope, that this season is something to build on for the future. 2. Malik Rosier While Malik Rosier has been our starter all season, and he lead Miami to 10 straight wins, including some late game heroics, his starting job is not guaranteed for next season. Now obviously I can\u2019t speak for Mark Richt and his staff, but if Rosier does not show any improvement with his throwing in this bowl game, his time as Miami\u2019s starter may be over. Rosier proved that he can get a great Miami team into the conversation, but his inconsistent play puts too much pressure on the defense to be elite for 60 minutes. If Malik cannot show that he can improve his game and hit open receivers, Richt and the staff might look to N\u2019Kosi Perry and any possible incoming freshman to help Miami take that next step into the playoffs.

The WR\u2019s With Berrios graduating at the end of the season, and Ahmonn Richards coming off a knee surgery, the Hurricanes are going to need someone from the WR group to step up next year. With Richards sitting out the bowl game, Jeff Thomas , Mike Harely, and Lawrence Cager will be seeing plenty of playing time during the bowl game. All three have shown some flashes of what they can do, but for the most part the inconsistent play from this group has hindered the Miami offense. With a few weeks to prepare for the game, it would be encouraging for one of these guys to really step up and take on the Alpha receiver role while Richards is on the sideline. I really think Jeff Thomas has the best chance to do this as he can abuse the slow Wisconsin defense in space as Ohio State did. 4. The Dallas-Cat? The Wild-Dallas? Go Deejay, That\u2019s my Deejay? Call it what you want, but it works! There were a lot of questions about where Deejay Dallas would fit into this team as he was viewed as a jack-of-all trades. He has had most of his success as a running back, scoring two touchdowns against Notre Dame. He has even lined up a few time at WR, but where he seems the most dangerous is running the Wildcat. Deejay Dallas is your typical OW (Offensive Weapon) and no matter where he gets the ball, he can make something happen. It is pretty clear that he seems comfortable as a former QB making decisions with the ball in his hands. While this may just be a gimmick and you cannot run an entire offense using this, it\u2019s something I would love to see used early in the bowl game and it should become a staple of the offense next season. Photo by Butch Dill/Getty Images 5. Senior Day Part 2 The Miami Hurricane seniors get a rare chance to play a second senior day game in front of their home crowd, and I expect them to put on a show. This senior class has been through a lot being coached by Al Golden for multiple years, and were the foundation of the rebuild that Mark Richt took over. These are some of the best Canes this program has ever seen, from Chad Thomas to Braxton Berrios , all guys that will be remembered for a long time. They have had huge moments for the program and have built a new culture from the old ways that the incoming classes can learn from. This will be the last time we get to see these guys play in Orange and Green, and it is our duty as fans to go out and give them a proper send off. Anything else you are looking forward to?

Hypoglycaemia can cause a range of symptoms including confusion, trembling, sweating, increased heart rate, difficulty with concentration and/or speech and in severe cases can lead to a seizure or coma.[4]-[6] Severe hypoglycaemia can cause extensive damage to the body and is significantly associated with cardiovascular death.[7] Every month, 46.5% of people with type 2 diabetes and 83.0% of people with type 1 diabetes experience a hypoglycaemic episode.[8] About the new analyses The analyses, based on the recent SWITCH trials, separated people into two groups depending on whether they had achieved target blood sugar levels (defined as HbA1c of 7.0% or less) during the maintenance period of the trial.[1] Target blood sugar levels are those recommended by the joint guidelines of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes.[9] About SWITCH 1 and 2 SWITCH 1 and SWITCH 2 were two phase 3b, 64-week, double-blind, randomised,treat-to-target, 2-period crossover trials that investigated the hypoglycaemia profile of Tresiba(R) compared with insulin glargine U100 in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. The trial design included a titration period in which the doses of study treatments (Tresiba(R) or insulin degludec U100) were gradually increased over a 16 week period, followed by a 16 week maintenance period during which a constant dose of study treatment was maintained.[2],[3] The primary endpoint was the number of severe or bloodglucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes observed in participants during the maintenance period.[2],[3] About Tresiba(R) Tresiba(R) (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides a duration of action beyond 42 hours with a flat and stable glucose-lowering effect.[10],[11] It has been shown to provide a lower risk of overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia, and low variability in blood glucose levels versus insulin glargine U100.[11],[12] Tresiba(R)   September 2012 and has since been approved in more than 80 countries globally.   more than 50 countries.

Biography Edit \nThe Weeping Master posed as a mere scribe among mortals who attended to the company of Zarathustra , until he met a young seer who guided him to the Stone with the help of precognitive dreams. When the pair found the statue the vampire could not help but taste the bloody tears, and as he did it, was struck by visions of the murder of the Second Generation , bursting in tears of blood and hating the Third Generation for their crime. After these revelations he Embraced Dastur Anosh and left for Alamut to introduce him to the clan (as well as reporting on the news). \nThe Kindred of Alamut desired the knowledge of where the Stone might lie, but the Weeping Master refused to tell them. With his childe he traveled away from the lands controlled by Alamut, but they were followed. Three dark-skinned Kindred appeared at the edge of their encampment as the sun set in the west. These emissaries of Alamut ordered them to return to the Eagle's Nest, but Anosh's master refused. The only reply the emissaries gave were drawn blades, and the childe Anosh hid. The battle that took place was hideous, the kind of carnage that only Kindred of many years can unleash, but in the end only the Weeping Master stood. \nThe Master and his childe Anosh traveled into Africa where they met many strange Kindred. There he was first called \"the Weeping Master\" for his oft-bloodied eyes and his terrible power. The African Kindred soon learned to leave the ebon-skinned scholar and his apprentice in peace as they traveled. As time passed, however, the master was degenerating. He often spent entire evenings in thrall to his visions, weeping uncontrollably. The Weeping Master forgot his name entirely, and nearly slew his childe when Anosh called him by it. He was falling into his visions and finding it harder and harder to find a way back out. More than once, he emerged from his trances in a frenzy , and Embraced no few of his victims afterward, forcing Anosh to take his new siblings under his wing. The Weeping Master sorrowfully referred to himself and his childer as the \"Lost Tribe of Alamut\", never daring to risk returning to that citadel. \nOver the next few centuries, the Lost Tribe grew and attracted a small handful of others. As time passed, they assumed a cultic reverence, with the Weeping Master as their prophet and Anosh as his high priest and interpreter. They built a haven near the Weeping Stone, and members of the Lost Tribe guarded the site from others. \nIn time the Lost Tribe discovered that the agents of Alamut sought them once more. They fled the site of the Weeping Stone, hoping to protect its location through obscurity and diversion. The Lost Tribe established a hold in the bustling young metropolis of Alexandria in Egypt . The resources of the city proved useful in the development of the Tribe's strange philosophy. They sought evidence of the Third Generation, first as proof of their existence, and then with a fanatic's zeal and desire to destroy them. Anosh counseled slow progress in such things \u2014 the sheer power of the Antediluvians was inspiration toward diligent planning and study. \nIt was here that the Lost Tribe found fragments of the Book of Nod . Its words further galvanized their philosophy and spurred their research. But even before they were able to formulate any plans for discovering and destroying any of the Antediluvians, the hawks of Alamut found them and attacked their hold. Vicious fighting brought about the Final Death of many of the Lost Tribe.

You don\u2019t need to tell anyone who lives in the hottest recruiting bed of the country that their area is filled with talent. They see it on Friday nights, they breathe it year-round\u2014and they notice the football programs across the country that fly in to poach homegrown talent from their football fields. When it comes to the University of Miami, losing players to the NFL is a fact of life, along with the humidity and sunshine of where they call home. They\u2019re coming off of an impressive 2017 season that saw the Hurricanes climb to number two in the Associated Press Rankings, and rank second in the College Football Playoff Rankings. With incredible success, especially at the college level, there is bound to be attrition. We know of the seniors who have exhausted their eligibility, but what about those players who are faced with the decision of staying in school for another season, or taking their talents to the pro level? With RB Mark Walton being the first Hurricane to declare early for the draft, how many will follow behind him? State of the U examines current Hurricane football players who could declare for the 2018 NFL Draft, previewing the chances that they stay or leave \u2018The U\u2019 before the January 15th, 2018 deadline for declarations. We designated each player as either a \u2019Cane, meaning that said player will be a Miami Hurricane in 2018, or ProCane, meaning the player would likely enter the 2018 NFL Draft. DT RJ McIntosh \u2014Junior Jeremy Brevard-USA TODAY Sports It\u2019s no secret that the position that would be impacted the most by the 2018 NFL Draft would be the interior of the defensive line for UM. While we spoke first about Miami\u2019s other DT, there were conversations that RJ McIntosh would be a viable candidate to leave early to the NFL. Miami\u2019s entire defensive unit, including reserves, have played lights-out football for the majority of the season. However, RJ McIntosh has consistently stood out among others this season with big plays week in and week out. McIntosh has two-and-a-half sacks, 12.5 tackles for loss and is graded by Pro Football Focus as a better defender against the run than even as a pass rusher. What makes McIntosh\u2019s stock difficult to judge is the abundance of defensive tackles in the NFL currently. Should McIntosh declare for the draft it\u2019s difficult to predict where he would land in the draft. With just about every team having at least one premier or capable defensive tackle on the roster, teams across the league are reluctant to use a early selection on a position that is not a need. Working in McIntosh\u2019s favour however is the relief that rookies provide to the salary cap for a franchise. Which make a younger, more affordable defensive tackle perhaps more appealing than an aging veteran in the free agency market. Just focusing on this draft class, McIntosh has the chance to be a good player in a intriguing DT class, especially coming off of a career-best season. \u2019Cane or ProCane\u201475% ProCane NEW at @draftbreakdown : DT RJ McIntosh (Miami) vs. Notre Dame (2017) https://t.co/Gi2vw8mEDD pic.twitter.com/TQR0qKuPbd \u2014 Matheus Milanez (@biffmila) November 16, 2017 If McIntosh were to return to Miami, it wouldn\u2019t be a shock. He would still be starting on a defense that should compete for an ACC title, as well as being a CFB playoff contender next season. However, his stock is fairly high based on his play throughout the season. Given the talent that likely could declare in 2019, McIntosh would go out on a high and look to take on his next challenge in life. DT Kendrick Norton \u2014Junior The other half of the law firm that is McIntosh and Norton, DT Kendrick Norton has been eating double-team blocks for the past couple of seasons. Standing at six-foot-three and weighing 312 pounds, Norton has become one of the better nose tackle prospect in a 3-4 defense in the nation, and is athletic enough to be used as a one-tech in a 4-3 defense. Norton shows off his strength at the point of attack, eating up blockers at the line of scrimmage and keeping blockers from reaching the second level of the \u2019Canes defense, allowing Miami\u2019s linebackers the freedom to pursue the play with minimal obstacles. \u2019Cane or Nah\u201470% ProCane If we discussed this question a year ago, we likely would have provided the same percentage. Norton is one of the better run-stuffing prospects eligible for the draft. As we previously stated for RJ McIntosh, the market for defensive tackles is pretty loaded, and there is no guarantee that Norton improves his draft stock by returning to Miami for his senior year. However, it would help Miami, who would have to rely on sophomores and freshmen to fill out the rotation in the middle of the defensive line. Don\u2019t believe us, take this tidbit from Bleacher Report\u2019s Matt Miller before Saturday's masacre in the ACC Championship. \u201cThe ACC title game is full of talent, and a lot of it comes on the defensive line. Miami has RJ McIntosh and Kendrick Norton, while Clemson has Clelin Ferrell , Christian Wilkins and Austin Bryant. If you like defensive line play, those five all look like potential top-75 picks.\u201d CB Michael Jackson \u2014Junior Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports While the artist named Michael Jackson would not be categorized as a one-hit wonder, the Miami cornerback may qualify. In his first two seasons at UM, Jackson was primarily a special teams maven, more so than a cover corner. After this season, Jackson has far exceeded anyone's expectation, save for his own. Using his six-foot-two size to impose his will on smaller receivers, his ability to stay with speed receivers and, of course, his penchant to make plays on the ball are qualities that every NFL defense would love to add. Jackson tied for the team lead in interceptions during the regular season with four, meaning he is among the leaders for appearences with the vaunted \u2018Turnover Chain\u2019 shine. \u2019Cane or ProCane\u2014 50% \u2019Cane Jackson has enjoyed a successful season and played well enough to be an All-ACC player. I would like to see him provide that production at the college level for another season, if not for our own selfish reasons, but because the grace period for defensive backs in the NFL is smaller than ever. RT Tyree St.Louis\u2014Junior Entering the 2017 season, St.Louis\u2019 biggest concern had more to deal with where he was going to line up than how he would project at the pro level. Based on his consistency playing right tackle for Miami, the junior has caught the attention of scouts at the next level. St. Louis is graded by Pro Football Focus, accounting his 417 pass blocking snaps, allowing two sacks, two QB hits and nine QB hurries, for a pass blocking efficiency of 97.5. Those numbers are good enough to place St. Louis in the top 50 of draft-eligible tackles in that category. A statistic that PFF does not release is how well St. Louis is doing in the running game, often executing a reach block to get in the way of linebackers in an attempt to create big runs out of the backfield. \u2019Cane or ProCane\u201485% \u2019Cane Should St. Louis return next season, he will be a senior tackle that could kick over to the left side or remain on the right side of the offensive line. If NFL talent evaluators are mumbling about his prospects this season, there will be plenty of frank discussion next season as St. Louis has the opportunity to establish himself as a premier tackle in the nation on title contending team. DT Gerald Willis III \u2013 Redshirt Junior You probably looked at the name and asked the question: Why would we list Gerald Willis III on here, he hasn\u2019t played a game all season? Well, the curiosity with Willis is that he has been in college for quite a while now\u2014roughly about four years, given his transfer and having to sit out a season based on what the team called \u2018personal reasons\u2019. Willis is a redshirt junior this season, and would be a redshirt senior should he decide to return for one more year. Losing both Norton and McIntosh at DT would be brutal, yet the loss of Willis really puts the onus on Coach Kool and Manny Diaz to have underclassmen, perhaps some freshmen, ready to compete at the start of the 2018 season. \u2019Cane or ProCane\u201455% \u2019Cane This comes down to whether Willis would rather stay to benefit from attrition or is finally fed up with his situation, hoping to impress the pro crowd at combines and workouts to work his way into the league. Looking from the outside in, staying put would make the most sense, but only one person can make that decision at the end of the day. Jaquan Johnson \u2013Junior Photo by Lance King/Getty Images A dark-horse candidate in the preseason to become a quantifiable prospect, Jaquan Johnson has stepped into a starting role at safety for the \u2019Canes, providing Miami with leadership both in the locker room and on the field. Providing Miami with leadership both in the locker room and on the field. Johnson has what you expect from a Hurricanes\u2019 safety: the speed to cover most of the field, the intuition to make a play on a ball and the confidence to stick his nose into any situation that arises during a game. In his 317 run snaps, Johnson has 38 tackles, nine assisted tackles and just five missed tackles, according to PFF. All the intangibles that a personnel evaluator could want from a safety exist inside Johnson. Does this all mean that a player who has carried around the moniker of \u2018The Franchise\u2019 since high school is likely off to the pros? \u2019Cane or ProCane\u201475% \u2018Cane Simply put, Jaquan Johnson is a game changer for @CanesFootball . pic.twitter.com/mdP1h84L9u \u2014 ACC Digital Network (@theACCDN) November 21, 2017 As great as Johnson has played in a season where he should be an All-ACC first team candidate, outplaying the likes of FSU\u2019s Derwin James , I would like to see Johnson return for his senior season. Again, there are likely selfish motives to this explanation, especially considering how special the 2018 version of the UM could be if a couple draft-eligible prospects hung around for another season. Staying one more season allows Johnson to bask in the shower of compliments and accolades that Derwin James received this past preseason as an touted safety. As good as Johnson has been this season, it\u2019s fathomable that he morphs into an elite prospect in 2018. Sheldrick Redwine \u2013Junior Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports From 0 to 100 real quick. Ok, maybe not 100, but when you go from no buzz to internet sensation, you\u2019re bound to see your stock rise after the season. That is what you can say about Sheldrick Redwine, who acts as the hammer of in the backend of Miami\u2019s defense. Whether coming up to the line of scrimmage to deliver a shot, or jumping into the passing lane to make a play on the ball, Redwine is a Tasmanian Devil (the cartoon, not the real life version) as soon as kickoff commences. Of the 246 run snaps that he\u2019s played, Redwine has accounted for 14 tackles, six assists and and just one missed tackle. Factor in his two interceptions, two tackle for loss, two fumble recovery and six pass breakups, Redwine\u2019s playmaking ability shows up on paper as much as it does in real life. \u2019Cane or ProCane\u201480% \u2019Cane When you see Redwine stepping onto the bench with a whiteboard with a message for \u2019Canes Fam or the national TV audience, you can\u2019t help but assume how much fun the young man is having.

He was born with visions, and during his mortal days he was one of the magi who gathered around the Golden One (who history would know as Zarathustra). \nHe befriended a scribe who was very interested in his visions, especially one about a a strange stone that wept blood . When Anosh spoke of having those dreams, of a strange stone that wept blood and the sounds of a woman sobbing on the desert winds of the night, one of the scribes grew very interested. He diligently recorded all of the young seer's recollections of the stone. Again and again the young man dreamed of the Weeping Stone , each time with greater clarity and recollection. \nEventually they left the company of their peers and sought the stone. The closer they came to finding it, the more intense Anosh's dreams became. They traveled during the night, sleeping during the day according to the needs of the scholar, which Anosh did not understand, though he did not comment on them. Finally, the pilgrims found the stone, and the scholar revealed his Cainite nature, Embracing the young seer. \nThey fled, then, bound for the secret citadel of Alamut , his sire's home. In that journey, Anosh found that his dreams had left him, and that he was instead subject to strange visions of grief and pain. At the citadel of the Eagle's Nest, Anosh found a cold welcome. Sequestered in a black cell deep within the fortress, Anosh lost all track of time. Those who brought him his draughts of blood intimated that his master sinned in Embracing him, and that he must answer for those sins. \nWhen they were granted the right to leave, he saw that his sire and master was subject to the same strange visions. As they traveled at night, his master spoke with hatred of the Third Generation and their terrible sins and the betrayal on Enoch , Irad , and Zillah . They traveled away from the lands controlled by Alamut, until the night when the three Kindred appeared at the edge of their encampment as the sun set in the west. These three emissaries of Alamut ordered them to return to the Eagle's Nest, but Anosh's master refused. \nThe only reply the emissaries gave were drawn blades, and Anosh hid. The battle was hideous, the kind of carnage that only Kindred of many years can unleash, but in the end only Anosh's master stood. The two then left for Africa and Anosh witnessed how his sire began to lose himself to the visions of grief, often weeping uncontrollable for hours and recklessly Embracing progeny. In one of his rare moments of lucidity, the Weeping Master sorrowfully referred to himself and his childer as the \"Lost Tribe of Alamut\", never daring to risk returning to that vaunted citadel. \nBy the time they returned to the site of the Weeping Stone and Anosh once again had tasted the blood, he began to understand the burden of his sire more and more and began to record his ravings. Over the next few centuries, the Lost Tribe grew and attracted a small handful of others. As time passed, the Tribe assumed a cultic reverence, with the Weeping Master as their prophet and Anosh as his high priest and interpreter. They built a haven near the Weeping Stone, and members of the Lost Tribe guarded the site from others. \nThe years turned him introspective, and Anosh found himself sympathetic to a body of principles similar to the Path of Blood that his master tried unsuccessfully to teach him. Taking the canon of that Path and combining it with the tenets of the beliefs they were developing, Anosh developed one of the first portions of what would later come to be known in the Sabbat as the Path of Caine . \nForced to leave their haven because of assailants from Alamut, the Lost Tribe established a hold in the bustling young metropolis of Alexandria . The resources of the city proved useful in the development of the Tribe's strange philosophy. They sought evidence of the Third Generation, first as proof of their existence, and then with a fanatic's zeal and desire to destroy them. It was here that the Lost Tribe found fragments of the Book of Nod and further refined its goal of fighting the dreaded Antediluvians. \nWhen attack teams from Alamut managed to capture the Weeping Master, Dastur Anosh became the leader of the Lost Tribe. In his grief, Anosh scattered his followers to the winds, sending them far away for their own safety. He would call upon them in the future, he assured them. In the meantime, they should keep secret their goals and spend their efforts to gather more information on their great enemies, the Third Generation. Then, in the year 139 BCE , Anosh returned to the site of the Weeping Stone, fortifying himself on a taste of its bloody rivulets, and returned to the bosom of the earth, surrendering to grief and torpor . \nWhen Anosh awakened, he assumed the identity of a recently embraced neonate , entering Alamut and learned what had happened during this time. Afterwards, he called his followers together, and after ten nights of revelry from the blood of the Weeping Stone, he slaughtered all who had told of the Weeping Stone to lesser Cainites in exchange for temporal power. The survivors were rechristened as the True Lost Tribe, who began to use the black crescent moon as a symbol. The Lost Tribe continued in this way for generations, until the assault upon the Lasombra Antediluvian . \nWord quickly reached the Lost Tribe from its agents. The Lost Tribe retained its secrecy, but joined with this vestigial Sabbat movement. The vampires of the Blackened Crescent infiltrated these movements, feigning ignorance of one another. They began to use a small sect as cover, called the Black Hand, that acted as a weapon of the Sabbat against the hated Third Generation. By the time the colonization of the New World had begun, Anosh realized that the Lost Tribe was no more. What had been conceived as a disguise for the Tribe had supplanted it. No more were Cainites swearing to uphold the rigors of the Lost Tribe. In fact, those who had even known of its existence made up a smaller and smaller portion of the Black Hand's population. \nWith this in mind, Anosh did what was unthinkable to his brethren of the Lost Tribe. He revealed their existence. In a gathering of the leadership of the Black Hand \u2014 including those who would one night be called its Seraphs \u2014 Anosh revealed the origins of the Black Crescent, his contributions to the Path of Caine, his personal history, and even the location of the Weeping Stone, all in his notably passionate style of address. But even as the Black Hand rejoiced for this connections to their true roots, the elders of the Sabbat began to question his loyalty. Anosh further recognized new influences within the Black Hand and began to suspect that other powers might be at work. He ventured into the Americas and became fascinated with the native cultures there. From here, he watched carefully. He took command of the Black Hand in the New World himself, carefully watching its members and drawing more from those Cainites newly Embraced from among the natives and settlers of the young domain over those with ties to Europe . \nIn order to find the conspirators that had begun to manipulate his sect , he once again assumed the identity of a mere neonate and infiltrated his own organization, until he learned the terrible truth: His Lost Tribe, who had sworn itself on avenging Zillah and her brothers, had become the pawns of a maniac death cult who worshiped the very beings that he had intended to destroy. Short times afterwards, a host of wraiths attacked him and he was forced to flee into the Mexican desert. \nIt has been assumed that Anosh met Final Death in 1766 CE , a short time before the First Sabbat Civil War , but he once again had disguised himself as a neonate, determined to bring the Tal'mahe'Ra down. Anosh gave up his original identity and the leadership of the Black Hand \u2014 two things that weighed him down with responsibility and limited his ability to search effectively for the answers he demanded from the world. In the time since, he has taken on the mantle of multiple Sabbat neonates, often showing up as recent Embraces from various crusades, or claiming a recently destroyed Sabbat vampire as a sire . About half the time, he arranges to find a place in the Black Hand, going through the induction rites thereof and drinking once more from the Weeping Stone.

But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region\u2019s fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \u201chigh\u201d into the color that means \u201cextreme.\u201d \n\u201cThe forecast for tomorrow is purple,\u201d said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \u201cWe\u2019ve never used purple before.\u201d \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\u201cWe\u2019re talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\u201d Pimlott said. \u201cThese will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\u201d \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week\u2019s fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region\u2019s fires . She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\u201cHeck yeah I\u2019m still worried,\u201d Rosenzweig said. \u201cWe\u2019re very grateful but I know we\u2019re not out of the woods.\u201d \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles\u2019 exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\u201cWe\u2019re basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\u201d said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \u201cBut that\u2019s about it.\u201d SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ken pimlott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pimlott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosenzweig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim chavez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rupert murdoch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa rosenzweig", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "california department of forestry", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sepulveda pass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ojai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moraga vineyards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bel-air", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa barbara", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:49.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "128ae8bd94871763117d1dcda181f5e6bfb74645", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1ptr64PLjVcc7wwPhaW2IExgXnmyRD85oT", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/v/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/v/ -

Mainstream scientists continue to be philosophically allergic to the idea that design (the observation) is caused by design (the intelligent process), or too afraid to be seen to acknowledge it. This has led to the coining of a new term and a new distinction: the hard-to-deny facts of biological purpose and design are now labelled \u201cteleonomy,\u201d whilst the contentious and frightening \u201ctheological\u201d idea of a primordial actor or creator is now labelled as \u201cteleology.\u201d They loudly assert that teleology has long been discounted and now teleonomy takes its place. That\u2019s fine if you want to believe it. All we are going to do here is to point out that facts have driven biology back towards notions of design, and mainstream scientists are going as far as they dare to bring back into biology thoughts that most of us already knew intuitively.
