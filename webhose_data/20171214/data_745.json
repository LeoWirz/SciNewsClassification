The other two beers from the brewery that I\u2019ve sampled, their Angel and Rocket bitters, were both pretty standard fair but the Newcastle based brewery seems to have upped their game of late and I\u2019ve started to see a few more adventurous offerings from them available. I picked this one up when visiting the city over the summer and also grabbed another couple from them on the same visit that I\u2019ve yet to try. I then spotted yet another imperial stout from Wylam in a Glasgow bottle shop last weekend, a beer that I quickly picked up. This particular offering from the brewery, despite the name suggesting otherwise, is apparently a vegan friendly beer that was first introduced in late 2015 and as yet is not one that I\u2019ve seen available in Scotland but perhaps that is something that will change going forward since last weekend was the first time that I\u2019d spotted any Wylam beers north of the border.\n\nAppearance (4/5): Opaque black and almost oil-like with a foamy brown head that is just under a centimetre tall but holds surprisingly well for a fairly strong beer. The head does slowly fade to leave a thin surface lacing in the middle with a little more build up around the sides but it doesn\u2019t look too bad at all. \nAroma (6/10): Quite a strong beer on the nose with a lot of alcohol showing in the early going as well as a lot of peated malts that gave the beer a type of whiskey aroma. It was slightly sweet towards the middle with some rich and dark fruits coming through alongside some mint that was unusual but enjoyable before the beer was rounded off with some liquorice and alcohol grains.\nTaste (6/10): Opening with the same peated malts that featured heavily with the nose, the beer wasn\u2019t quite as strong this time around but there was some strong alcohol grains and smoky flavours present that threatened to overpower at points. I got some roasted flavours around the middle of the beer with touches of mint further on with some more malts seeing things out.\nPalate (3/5): A very strong beer with plenty dark and roasted touches that were quite smoky too that\u2019s to the peated malts. The beer was loaded with alcohol and seemed stronger than the 8.8% abv. on the bottle, the balance in particular being a poor one that made it a slow one to get through; not a great one of the style at all and one I\u2019d avoid in future.\nOverall (13/20): This one was a very strong beer from the outset and one that was loaded with peated malts, smoky flavours and some wood which all gave the beer a whiskey feel to it in the early going. The alcohol that came through seemed overdone and made the beer seem a lot stronger than the 8.8% advertised on the bottle, it was also a bit of a struggle to finish too, although the surprising addition of some mint to the nose and taste was quite enjoyable but other than that the beer seemed poorly balanced and was a relatively poor imperial stout sadly.\nBrewed In: Newcastle upon Tyne, England\nBrewery: Wylam Brewery\nFirst Brewed : 2015\nType: Imperial Stout\nAbv: 8.8%\nServing: Bottle (330ml)\nPurchased: Fenwicks (Newcastle)\nPrice: \u00a33.49", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fenwicks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyne", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "newcastle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wylam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bohemia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:49.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "074ff5f85fa18f3e2898f78d31dc9c312042758f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSNhmZEbhKAgfcMOrqlCc5UP3K0l00eQOI2Y.417rKXYy6IKofm.GYKw51cUrT7e_JeW6qDvgrhp9JfYlKaH1Y.VGl4a4p2cms89PZior2_SuqXrrot6eHM", "site_full": "www.thetvdb.com", "site": "thetvdb.com", "site_section": "http://thetvdb.com/rss/newtoday.php", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "TheTVDB.com Today's New Episodes", "title": "The Menendez Murders: Erik Tells All: A Family With a Dirty Secret", "title_full": "The Menendez Murders: Erik Tells All: A Family With a Dirty Secret", "published": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15420, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "074ff5f85fa18f3e2898f78d31dc9c312042758f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSNhmZEbhKAgfcMOrqlCc5UP3K0l00eQOI2Y.417rKXYy6IKofm.GYKw51cUrT7e_JeW6qDvgrhp9JfYlKaH1Y.VGl4a4p2cms89PZior2_SuqXrrot6eHM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "The Menendez Murders: Erik Tells All: A Family With a Dirty Secret", "text": "Production Code: Overview: The trial takes a shocking turn when the defense claims Erik and Lyle Menendez killed their parents after years of sexual abuse; Erik gives his account of growing up in a \"house of horrors.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erik", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lyle men", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:49.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a152414fe5a4410a0d4fc4d5b9140b1095ab6daa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJ.QCkcXJvcBhElmC7wdOc9NE1zFG2BbdLpsSpAp3hGD7gcTVcDtHRJoBk.KxgObfaq_IuHAimW_t08P4d8Am0YTwTZLLkbL5VX3RkcERdKTUqHnI9Aj4MMA--", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Appliances-Microwaves/N-5yc1vZc3ok/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Magic Chef 1.6 ft.

But if you\u2019re surprised that the president of the United States and the Republican National Committee are throwing their support to a man who has been accused by multiple women, on the record, of pedophilia, remember that America has been looking the other way for a long time. \nWhy, for example, is the Pentagon suppressing a congressionally mandated independent report on Afghan allies who allegedly engage in systemic child sexual abuse? \nAfghanistan has revived an old and long-outlawed practice of men buying young boys, dressing them as dancing girls to be used as sex slaves for American-armed Afghan security forces. The boys are regularly raped by these American allies, engaging in \u201cbacha bazi,\u201d or \u201cboy play,\u201d while U.S. soldiers avert their eyes and try to ignore the raw violence against underage innocents. \nA recent analysis suggests that the U.S. military is preventing the report\u2019s release to avoid in-country blowback and consequential congressional action that could cut-off U.S. military assistance to Afghanistan.

SUBSCRIBE NOW \nWhile the Kabul regime may be the most egregious offender at passively condoning pedophilia, another open secret is that child sex tourism finds a home firmly within allied Southeast Asian nations. American citizens often travel to countries like Thailand to solicit sexual favor with children. Weak police enforcement and even official complicity in some Southeast Asian countries make combating child sex offenses extremely difficult. \nTactical advantage and strategic concerns often define how America deals with child sex issues both at home and abroad. Whether it\u2019s President Donald Trump\u2019s support for Republican Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race, the U.S. troops\u2019 failure to report allies\u2019 involvement in human rights abuses and criminality, or a brisk sex tourism business with allies in strategic parts of the world, legal and ethical actions are often overruled by politics. Globally, moral outrage over sexual misconduct with minors is selectively expressed \u2013 whether in America\u2019s malls , Kandahar parlors, or Japanese townships. Political fortune is constantly weighed against criminal behavior in a dark and often cynical calculus. \nThere should, however, be no equivocation, anywhere, ever. Ivanka Trump is right when she says \u201cthere\u2019s a special place in hell for people who prey on children.\u201d \nA couple of American soldiers personally brought that hell to offending Afghans. Two soldiers were discharged for beating-up an Afghan commander who chained a boy to his bed and repeatedly raped him. Vigilante justice is not a solution, but these soldiers' anger drove them to take matters into their own hands when their superiors instead insisted they sit on their hands. \nThe U.S. military may be reluctant to release the new report and slow to respond to accusations and missteps, but unlike most other countries\u2019 militaries, processes are in place for the Pentagon to take corrective action, change, and attempt to right any wrongs. While U.S. soldiers avoid policing illegal behavior of natives in foreign countries, Americans are sometimes held criminally accountable for their acts by foreign courts. \nIn 1995, for example, the American service members were caught, convicted, and sentenced to many years in a Japanese prison for kidnapping and raping a 12-year old Okinawan girl. Twenty-two years later, the Okinawa rape case is still fresh in Japanese minds and it continues to plague U.S.-Japanese military relations. Those old wounds were reopened just last week when an American military contractor received a life sentence in Japan for the rape and murder of yet another Okinawan. \nJapanese high moral ground is hard to hold, however, when reflecting on the country\u2019s own sordid history of sex slaves and industrial-scale rape. From 1932 through WWII, Japan enslaved underage girls and young women from occupied territories in military brothels for forced sex. While there is no definitive victim count, the \u201ccomfort women\u201d numbered at least 20,000 and may have reached into the hundreds of thousands. \nThe military and foreign service get special protections when serving overseas \u2013 diplomatic immunity can protect a State Department employee from foreign legal infractions. But the U.S. can waive that immunity in special cases, as it did with the American service members in Japan. Foreign courts can also lock-up Americans \u2019 who transgress overseas. Further, since 2004, American law allows U.S. courts to convict citizens of sex crimes committed abroad. \nAmerican child sex offenders who go overseas to engage in criminal activity can be punished when they come home, but they are also more likely to be prevented from achieving their goal when traveling. The U.S State Department will soon make important changes in U.S. passports , as required by last year\u2019s International Megan\u2019s Law. Some passports will have a notation that states \u201cThe bearer was convicted of a sex offense against a minor.\u201d \nThe scarlet letter passport may slow sex offenders from moving freely across the world, but it would still not prevent them from running for government office. One Alabama felon put up a candidacy in the recent past. \nThe electoral verdict on Roy Moore is days away. Internationally, beyond the Moore scandal, American conduct and honor in the Trump-era will continue to be judged daily. \nMarkos Kounalakis, Ph.D. is a senior fellow at Central European University and visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution.

You can exploit these levels or zones by watching the price action that occurs at the given levels. USD/JPY Analysis \nI was still expecting a new bullish movement yesterday, but I thought that the price would need to break the round number at 113.00 to really get going, which it never even touched, yet I entered myself long early at 112.85 and lost the trade. The bullishness has really evaporated now, with the price breaking below the former support at 112.30 which has now probably become a resistance level. It seems the long-term picture is just one of continual wide ranges, with no end in sight. It makes trading this pair very challenging unless you just follow the turns in the candlestick patters and mostly ignore support and resistance. I have no directional bias on this Forex currency pair now. \nThere is nothing important due today concerning the JPY. Regarding the USD, there will be a release of the ADP Non-Farm Employment Change at 1:15pm London time, followed by Crude Oil Inventories at 3pm.

I actually kind of forgot about them as I've been really into hot breakfasts like porridge or muesli with warm milk but this is another one of my favourites as well! I love the combination of banana and peanut butter so this is super yummy. I toasted a muffin, then slathered both halves with peanut butter, topped with banana and a sprinkle of chia seeds. I also had a black coffee and bottle of water. \n\nFor lunch I had an egg salad wrap (basically egg, mayonnaise & cress). My favourite kind are the seeded wraps which I find more filling & satisfying than the white ones. I also had some cherry tomatoes, cucumber and another bottle of water. \n\n\nLater that afternoon I made myself an almond milk cappuccino and had one of these Graze fruity flapjacks. They are so delicious! I've got Emilia into them as well and she loves them.  \n\nWe always have quite a big gap between snack and dinner as we eat later than the children and sometimes their bedtime has a tendency to drag on so I end up getting really hungry! Bedtime with three exhausted kids can also be very stressful...so sometimes you need a little something to get you through, hahaha!  On my way downstairs to get Emilia's reading, I stuffed my face with two chocolate chip brioches which were left over from Saturday's breakfast (one even had a bite taken out of it...I have no shame!!) and an opened packet of Maltesers which I had taken two out from the day before in an effort to bribe Emilia & Eduardo to smile for our Christmas family picture. This is real life folks!  \n\nFor dinner we had salmon fishcakes filled with hollandaise sauce, home made sweet potato chips and green beans. I had another two bottles of water before bed and was quite full from earlier so didn't feel like anything else after this!   \n\n\nAnd here's today's video for you to enjoy! I didn't include the cooking bits today just because it was a hectic day with loads of people coming in & out of the house, plus Jonathan and Izzy were working all day on #SJXMAS...basically we need a bigger house and I need an office!!

Sinopec alleges it never received full payment for 45,000 tons of steel rebar it agreed to sell PDVSA for $43 million and which was delivered in 2013. \nThe lawsuit, while small in size, says PDVSA through its U.S. subsidiary Bariven reneged on repeated promises to pay Sinopec, at one point costing the Chinese company $2 million in losses after it entered into arbitration with a supplier it agreed to purchase the steel from to carry out the deal. \n\"This is not simply a case of a broken promise to pay,\" Sinopec said in the court documents, accusing PDVSA of \"deceit\" and \"willful deception\" in its refusal to pay its bills. \"Rather, this case involves a complex commercial transaction specifically calculated to leave Sinopec without a remedy.\"   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nThe Chinese \"usually take a more diplomatic tone\" and are clearly angry, Russ Dallen, head of local brokerage Caracas Capital, wrote in a report Wednesday in which he revealed the existence of the lawsuit. \nThe dispute comes as Venezuela is seeking fresh financing to restructure its huge foreign debt on which it is behind payment. \nChina has been one of Venezuela's biggest creditors, providing it loans, cash and investment totaling more than $65 billion between 2007 and 2016, according to a database maintained by Boston University and the Inter-American Dialogue.

Turner in a Memphis courtroom. Judge Lee Coffee told her he would not allow another such interruption, but he did not charge her with contempt of court. \nTurner was indicted Tuesday on a first-degree murder charge. His bail is set at $1 million. Turner told the judge that he was planning to hire an attorney and Coffee set a hearing for Tuesday. \nWright's body was found in a swampy field in suburban Memphis on July 28, 2010, 10 days after the 34-year-old was reported missing. He was shot multiple times. The seven-year investigation into his death has been one of the Memphis Police Department's most high-profile unsolved cases. Never miss a local story.

Police said last month that they had found a gun used in the killing in a lake near the small town of Walnut, Mississippi, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Memphis. \nAfter Marion's statement, Turner was led out of the courtroom in the custody of court officers. The judge called Marion to a microphone in the courtroom and told her he understands her pain because his father was killed. But Coffee also said that he would not allow anyone to \"engage in an outburst like that.\" \n\"You have to be respectful of the judicial system,\" Coffee said. \nMarion replied, \"I told him what I wanted to tell him.\" \nOutside the courtroom, prosecutor Paul Hagerman said he spoke with Marion about the incident. \n\"Ms. Deborah is going to behave herself next time,\" Hagerman said. \nWright, who was born and raised in Memphis, played for the Memphis Grizzlies and four other NBA teams as a forward and center over 13 seasons before retiring in 2009.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wright hearing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wright", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "turner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lorenzen wright", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billy r. turner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "memphis police department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tenn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "memphis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "memphis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shelby county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:51.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b65f1b8b089a55a5565a137935855c756b5f22c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaENWAQqlCJPM1RdH.bSF4Qy_S090evJVG.su64rFbxOMN.0oZ7iCvKV92lnxHd4vezvsCcwLHw9g5EDuYvlz8LM6s9JEg2H3sqMgK6sQnIFU-", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/San-Diego-Hoteis.d178304.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Condado de San Diego: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "Hyatt Place San Diego/Vista-Carlsbad:", "title_full": "Hyatt Place San Diego/Vista-Carlsbad: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-10-12T00:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "51e2c3a1bfa1a65360ec7e66005d65593fa21fad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaENWAQqlCJPM1RdH.bSF4Qy_S090evJVG.su64rFbxOMN.0oZ7iCvKV92lnxHd4vezvsCcwLHw9g5EDuYvlz8LM6s9JEg2H3sQXDoJK6ObHvaJ7puqK46m7G2jQJtpyChj7P.QTzK2THnQnPz6qU3Jg--", "ord_in_thread": 15, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-21T00:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "We stayed here for a night on our Legoland trip and was happy with the spacious room, comfortable beds, the pool, the free breakfast, and great customer service.

Today\u2019s USD/CAD Signals \nTrades may only be entered before 5pm New York time today. Long Trades \nGo long after the next bullish price action rejection following the next touch of 1.2641 or 1.2590. \nPut the stop loss 1 pip below the local swing low. \nAdjust the stop loss to break even once the trade is 20 pips in profit. \nRemove 50% of the position as profit when the trade is 20 pips in profit and leave the remainder of the position to ride. Short Trades \nGo short after the next bearish price action rejection following the first touch of 1.2746, 1.2787, or 1.2846. \nPut the stop loss 1 pip above the local swing high. \nAdjust the stop loss to break even once the trade is 20 pips in profit. \nRemove 50% of the position as profit when the trade is 20 pips in profit and leave the remainder of the position to ride. \nThe best method to identify a classic \u201cprice action reversal\u201d is for an hourly candle to close, such as a pin bar, a doji, an outside or even just an engulfing candle with a higher close. You can exploit these levels or zones by watching the price action that occurs at the given levels. USD/CAD Analysis \nYesterday I highlighted the support level at 1.2641, pointing out that there is no long-term trend and therefore it is best to trade this pair, if you are going to trade it, by paying attention to news items and short-term reversals off key support and resistance levels. This worked out quite well, with an obvious bullish rejection of 1.2641 playing out. The bullish movement seems as if it might now have run out of steam. The price is in the middle of nowhere now, but there is major news due later, so it is probably best to stand aside until the Canadian data release gives the pair some direction. \nRegarding the CAD, there will be a release of the Bank of Canada\u2019s Rate Statement and Overnight Rate at 3pm London time. Concerning the USD, there will be a release of the ADP Non-Farm Employment Change at 1:15pm, followed by Crude Oil Inventories at 3pm.

EUR/USD Analysis \nYesterday\u2019s key even was the invalidation of the supportive zone between 1.1826 and 1.1813. It is now possible to link the lows with a descending trend line which forms a symmetrical but wide bearish price channel. There is also new resistance at 1.1848. These factors suggest the bullish revival is over for the time being, and the pair is now in a medium-term bearish trend, with no long-term trend in the price at all. \nThere is nothing important due today concerning the EUR. Regarding the USD, there will be a release of the ADP Non-Farm Employment Change at 1:15pm London time, followed by Crude Oil Inventories at 3pm.

It comes from the Greek nostos (homecoming) and algos (pain) and is thought to have been derived from Homer\u2019s The Odyssey .\nWith baby boomers reaching their senior years, nostalgia seems to be their drug of choice. Advertisers target boomers with Beatles music, retro fashions, and even long dead actors such as Marilyn Munroe selling perfume. While boomers seem to be lapping it up, not everyone is crazy about the nostalgia bug. Heather Havrilesky writes in The Washington Post , \u201cWhile griping about boomer nostalgia has become a somewhat common art, the cultural impact of that nostalgia transcends mere annoyance. Through sheer repetition and force of will, boomers have so thoroughly indoctrinated us into their worldview that we all now reflexively frame most current affairs through the lens of another generation\u2019s formative experiences.\u201d Abbey Hoffman might say not to trust anyone under 50!\nI myself am a baby boomer. Born in 1958, I was six years old when the Beatles came to North America. I sang \u201c A Hard Day\u2019s Night \u201d in my Grade One classroom, watched the moon landing on a fuzzy black and white TV, and took my Diana camera to Expo \u201967 in Montreal. While I have nostalgia for those early years, the time I miss most was when I was in my early twenties, studying photography at Ryerson in Toronto.\nThe photo at the head of this blog captures the time that I am nostalgic for. It was taken in my neighborhood in downtown Toronto in my first year of study. Everything was new and fresh, conversations were stimulating, photography was invigorating. Several of my classmates from that year became lifelong friends. Since returning to those days is impossible, I can make the journey with my retro photographs. It\u2019s the next best thing.\nGerrard East and Ontario Street, Toronto, 1981, is from the series: Toronto Days ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "diana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marilyn munroe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbey hoffman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heather havrilesky", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gerrard east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ontario street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montreal", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:53.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0990254dad536670bcb8242b5466cc8205535630", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZToeLjwucDydS1QxUJphw5UKiuzHaQISKlPD.gV2F.wQP9yrdH2KXcnyrw9ql1Yp9KH26B119nv_rAjaHN9S4nJPuqCzvlOzgidlBpiQ6p9gQsgCL3EABT1", "site_full": "www.temptalia.com", "site": "temptalia.com", "site_section": "https://www.temptalia.com/category/reviews/eye-product-reviews/page/3/", "site_categories": ["style_and_fashion", "beauty"], "section_title": "Eye Products Archives - Page 3 of 488 - Temptalia Beauty Blog: Makeup Reviews, Beauty Tips", "title": "ColourPop Semi Precious", "title_full": "ColourPop Semi Precious Eyeshadow Palette Review, Photos, Swatches", "published": "2017-11-19T22:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 20, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.496, "main_image": "https://www.temptalia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/colour-pop_semi-precious_001_palette.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15194, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9995b310016f0b07353c1d0ba1218411ea59936f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZToeLjwucDydS1QxUJphw5UKiuzHaQISKlPD.gV2F.wQP9yrdH2KXcnyrw9ql1Yp9KH26B119nv_rAjaHN9S4nJPuqCzvlOzgidlBpiQ6p9gcTqeqWMBIscHt189kHxYZjteEWi7MWoJw--", "ord_in_thread": 20, "author": "Wawi", "published": "2017-11-22T09:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "HI Christine thanks for the beautiful review, I adore the Colourpop palettes, what\u2019s you favorite?

XAU/USD initially made a move towards the resistance at $1277 but the market reversed its course after the bulls failed to overcome this barrier. As a result, prices tumbled below the $1274-$1271 zone and tested the support at around the $1260 level. \nXAU/USD is still trading below the Ichimoku clouds on both the daily and the 4-hourly charts. The Chikou-span (closing price plotted 26 periods behind, brown line) which is below prices also suggests that the bears have technical momentum on their side. The near-term charts indicate more price pressure is coming but note that the market is trying to stay above the 1265 level. At this point, also keep an eye on world stock markets, which are mostly weaker this week. \nIf the bulls can hold prices above the 1265 level, expect a bounce towards 1269.10-1268. Beyond there, the bears will be waiting in the 1274/1 zone. The bulls have to produce a daily close above 1274 in order to gather momentum for 1277.20. To the downside, pay attention to the intra-day support at 1263.20. If this support is broken, the market will be aiming for 1260. Breaking below 1260 opens up the risk of a fall to 1255.
