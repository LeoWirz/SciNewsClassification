One of the opportunities accorded by the amendment was to access affordable medicines under WTO rules. \nAll major decisions are made by the WTO\u2019s member governments: either by ministers (who usually meet at least every two years) or by their ambassadors or delegates (who meet regularly in Geneva). \nWith a view to achieving greater coherence in global economic policy making, the WTO cooperate, as appropriate, with the international Monetary Fund (IMF) and with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and its affiliated agencies. \nAs globalization proceeds in today\u2019s society, the necessity of an International Organization to manage the trading systems has been of vital importance. As the trade volume increases, issues such as protectionism, trade barriers, subsidies, violation of intellectual property are bond to arise due to the differences in the trading rules of every nation. \nAt the heart of the policy formulation and implementation of WTO initiatives is the Ministerial Conference called MC, which usually meets every two years. The MC11 will hold this December in Buenos Aires. The first MC in Africa (MC10) was in Nairobi, Kenya in 2015. \nThe organization is hinged on guiding principles which universal application. They are: non-discrimination, reciprocity, binding and enforceable commitments, transparency and safety values. \nThe non-discrimination matter is built on the structures of, Most Favoured Nation (MFN) rule, and the National Treatment Policy (NTP).Both are embedded in the main WTO rules on goods, services, and intellectual property, but their precise scope and nature differ across these areas. While the MFN rule requires that a WTO member must apply the same conditions on all trade with other WTO members the NTP on the other hand ensures that imported goods should be treated no less favorably than domestically produced. \nAnother area is Reciprocity which reflects both a desire to limit the scope of free-riding that may arise because of the MFN rule, and a desire to obtain better access to foreign markets. A related point is that for a nation to negotiate, it is necessary that the gain from doing so be greater than the gain available from unilateral liberalization. \nAlso, Binding and enforceable commitments, the tariff commitments made by WTO members in a multilateral trade negotiation and on accession are enumerated in a schedule (list) of concessions. \nThese schedules establish \u201cceiling bindings\u201d which are subject to modification by member countries. If satisfaction is not obtained, the complaining country may invoke the WTO dispute settlement procedures. \nMoreso, Transparency has been emphasized across WTO members hence they are required to publish their trade regulations, to maintain institutions allowing for the review of administrative decisions affecting trade, to respond to requests for information by other members, and to notify changes in trade policies to the WTO. \nThese internal transparency requirements are supplemented and facilitated by periodic country-specific reports (trade policy reviews) through the Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM). Nigeria just underwent its 6th Trade Policy Review in 2017. \nCritically, Safety values are made to have bearing on transactions because WTO\u2019s agreements permit members to take measures to protect not only the environment but also public health, animal health and plant health. \nThe World Trade Organization serves as the mediator between the nations when such problems arise. WTO could be referred to as the product of globalization and also as one of the most important organizations in today\u2019s globalized society. \nThe WTO is also a centre of economic research and analysis: regular assessments of the global trade picture in its annual publications and research reports on specific topics are produced by the organization. Finally, the WTO cooperates closely with the two other components of the Bretton Woods system, the IMF and the World Bank. \nIt was therefore gladdening that Nigeria took a major step in its commitment to improve ease of doing business through trade facilitation on January 20 2017, when it submitted the instrument of acceptance of World Trade Organisation\u2019s Protocol on Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) on the sideline of World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \nWith this, Nigeria became the 107th WTO member state to ratify the agreement. Other African countries that have ratified include Botswana, Niger, Togo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Zambia, Lesotho, Mali, Senegal, Swaziland, Gabon, Ghana and Mozambique. \nNigeria\u2019s ratification of the Trade Facilitation Agreement is a reflection of her commitment to the WTO and a rules-based economy. It is evidence of the commitment to rapidly implement initiative on the creation of an enabling environment for business. \nI was involved in several high-level participatory activities not with the intention to be appreciated but bearing in mind that, I have been in the Organised Private Sector (OPS) business for so long and have grasped that, there are massive inherent benefits to be derived from such platforms. \nI anchored my belief on the fact, there is need for the OPS to demonstrate a genuine show of interest in contributing to the growth and development of the country most especially as they have inbuilt tendency to impact positively on the fortunes of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) which oils the engine of growth of many world economies. \nPrince Kayode (SAN, CON, FCIArb) contributes this piece from Abuja and can be reached via kaylaw1@yahoo.com Related Posts", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "adetokunbo k", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adetokunbo kayode", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kayode", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international bank for reconstruction and development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medium enterprises", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibrd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ntp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world trade organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tfa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mfn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world trade organisation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trade facilitation agreement", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "togo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uruguay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abuja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zambia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ghana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nairobi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mozambique", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senegal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "botswana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swaziland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buenos aires", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lesotho", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:16.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9dfb2a39063129df1658ca1c18d916df9db1d685", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFqHsRIxrAMQtSWWGm.3.QA1U1nommeYJx2_RtM.5yp44xFo0uM7vKRf_EH8hnRHPPBlDg1g7gk.iokO3slVe0kz218dNGGDc5F_x6dcqFsviqXxlUU8z8nOq.q6vk5R0YvyZn8Ci383zK7.IvXpfrZN1HWX7GfJWtQ-", "site_full": "globalpatriotnews.com", "site": "globalpatriotnews.com", "site_section": "http://globalpatriotnews.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Global Patriot Newspapers", "title": "Avoid abscondment, pray for Nigeria, Gov.

Abubakar of Bauchi State Governor Mohammed Abubakar of Bauchi has charged state Christian\u2019s contingent to the holy lands of Rome, Greece and Israel against abscondment.\n\u200eHe gave the charge Wednesday while addressing the members of the Bauchi State Christian Pilgrims at Government House, saying \u201cIt will be wrong if you choose to abscond and seek to remain in the holy lands, or indeed relocate elsewhere in search of greener pastures\u201d. \nThe Governor, who warned that such an act would not be condoned by the state government, added, \u201cWe shall not allow such irresponsibility.\u201d \nAbubakar urged them to be ambassadors of the state, and shun any act that is capable of tarnishing the image of the state, warning further \u201cGovernment will not condone such misconduct\u201d. \nHe explained that going to Israel is a journey of spiritual renewal, hence the need for the intending pilgrims to be ambassadors of Bauchi state. \nThe governor told them, \u201cOur expectation is that you will serve as respected citizens of Bauchi state and Nigeria that you represent. Your journey to the holy land is sacred.\u201d \nHe also asked the pilgrims to pray for the country, saying, \u201cWe therefore expect you to pray fervently for the restoration of all that is good, development, health of leaders in the state and Nigeria\u201d. \nHe admonished them \u201cI want to urge you to be of humble character and reverence in your conduct on this pilgrimage and to be observant and note the elements that make the holy land a very compelling attraction for pilgrims all over the world.\u201d \nThe Chairman, Bauchi State Christian Pilgrims Welfare Board, Engineer Daniel Shawulu has earlier commended the governor for the opportunity given them to embark on pilgrimage to Rome, training of staff and continued support to the pilgrims board. \nHe also appealed to the governor to provide the board with permanent office accommodation of its own in the capital.

SGT By Nirmal Narayanan YouTube video Screenshot \nNASA has indirectly confirmed the news of explosion of a fireball, possibly a meteorite above Florida skies on Tuesday, reports WFTS TV. The world's leading space agency said it has received more than 60 reports of the fireball from people living in Tampa Bay area. \nMany people have also filmed the video of the fireball, which shot across the sky Florida skies before exploding behind the clouds. The flying object appeared from nowhere in the night sky, and people are fearing it to be an alien invasion . \nIn the meantime, a non-profit organization of scientists named 'The American Meteor Society' too confirmed the news and stated that they also received more than 55 reports of a fireball streaking across the sky. \nEven though the fireball appearance on the sky perplexed the local residents, these sightings are actually not rare. Basically, these fireballs are meteors that fly through the atmosphere at sky-rocketing speed. Air pressure on these celestial bodies makes them burn up in the Earth's atmosphere. \nThis phenomenon is quite common in all nooks of the globe, and thousands of meteors fall in the Earth's atmosphere daily. Many people are not seeing the fireballs as most of them usually falls in inhabited areas and above the oceans. \nWhen meteors enter the inhabited region during the daytime, sunlight camouflages the event. As people stay indoors during the night, most of these fireball incidents go unreported.

Speaking to the Derry journal, McEleney revealed he has received offers from clubs in England, Scotland and now the MLS, while of course Derry City remain keen on securing a return for their former player having reportedly offered McEleney a four-year deal to depart Stephen Kenny\u2019s \u2018\u2019Lilywhites\u2019\u2019, who are continuing to work hard in order to retain the midfielders services for 2018.\nFormer Sunderland trainee McEleney notched up eleven-goals for the County Louth outfit last season, with many of his impressive strikes ending up as goal of the season contenders. Despite a disappointing end to the 2017 season for McEleney\u2019s Dundalk, who relinquished their League of Ireland crown for the first time in three seasons to Cork City who also defeated Dundalk in the FAI Cup\nFinal via a penalty shoot-out, McEleney\u2019s eye-catching ability to turn a game on its head was always likely to see high volumes of interest in the attacking midfielder.\nStephen Kenny, who has already secured the return of 2014 top goal-scorer Patrick Hoban and Galway United hot-property Ronan Murray, will be hoping the re-singing of fellow coveted midfield man Robbie Benson earlier this week can play a role in persuading McEleney to commit to another season with the dethroned league champions.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephen kenny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kieran burke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronan murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david mcmillan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robbie benson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick hoban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mceleney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick mceleney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcmillan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "galway united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sunderland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irish sun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fai", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dundalk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oriel park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derry city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cork city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:17.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa67c9506438be0e42cf3aa4ce4c1b5019c580cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS1sweNw0kyGessK6k.L.PMFunFCo1dEaWmwPz5i4r4iiqoRWS8B529gbPRzDhSoWBQ1aSF_wU6CewcX06PGJfAJ.QCYjO8P5uHJTAzf34ulFNgBuxg1a_HNNzp_n5IZ3t", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "For photos that are, you know, mildly interesting.", "title": "I didn't pick my lettuce and it grew into a mini Christmas tree.", "title_full": "I didn't pick my lettuce and it grew into a mini Christmas tree. : mildlyinteresting", "published": "2017-12-07T05:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 75, "participants_count": 69, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b405b92d285bda4d75e294909e2a360493c0adad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS1sweNw0kyGessK6k.L.PMFunFCo1dEaWmwPz5i4r4iiqoRWS8B529gbPRzDhSoWBQ1aSF_wU6CewcX06PGJfAJ.QCYjO8P5uHJTAzf34ulFNgBuxg1a_HCEemgB2wovvjW4XSWsMaBBqAF_on7qvuw--", "ord_in_thread": 75, "author": "Liquid_Serpentine", "published": "2017-12-07T11:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Picking them I imagine.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:17.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3997b59dfcae80a07b394ca02b062f806720046d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8xMR_zqDhVU24R8Gr303y2eFJY60f.Y2rmTlibOglTSs8tMdKIuNdMWDKRmsDekIZLAbW6JV0Th1046VVir_xM4aYTNlsvFSb7FTmvQNS4m0TJxKOMSJa9e08wESjABYH62zjwmNC4kRiI0H_Zedhq5pI5ZjKMB9_GtvTItgLR9Hhe7yrDN8ruWRUCPmjMU39Nwl59FufcASgS2w7MSg6FzBc0SJTB7Hf13ogPz_VTCV0w7XNmtV4xA37bVU9Lmmn.lL4.hpJUYMzRcHlfP9_XTQ8URveimTwpOoE6LC8TMA--", "site_full": "www.juxtapost.com", "site": "juxtapost.com", "site_section": "http://www.juxtapost.com/feed/id/global", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Juxtapost -

Facebook/BiggBoss11 \nBigg Boss 11, the most controversial reality show of Indian television is all set to witness an emotional phase in this season as the housemates will meet their family members in the upcoming episode that will be aired tonight, Thursday, Dec.7. The contestants' family members or their loved ones will enter the house for some time. \nThe promo video shows that Vikas Gupta's mother, Puneesh Sharma's father, Shilpa Shinde's mother and other contestants' family members will visit them tonight. Like other contestants, Priyank Sharma will also get to meet one his closest person and it is none other than his girlfriend Divya Agarwal. A post shared by priyAnK nEw fan Club (kikki)? (@priyank_new_fc) on Dec 6, 2017 at 10:31am PST \nEarlier reports stated that Divya was upset with Priyank's apparent on-screen closeness with co-contestant Benafsha Soonawaala and announced her break-up officially to the media. The reports also added that she will vent out her anger on Priyank once she meets him. \nHowever, both Divya and Priyank were seen bursting into tears in the show promo. Divya was seen telling her beau that he has hurt her a lot. But, the promo didn't show the complete conversation. A post shared by priyAnK nEw fan Club (kikki)? (@priyank_new_fc) on Dec 6, 2017 at 10:59am PST \nWhile Divya was leaving the house, Priyank was seen running towards the door and was screaming her name. Later in another promo, Priyank was seen crying his heart out on his long-time friend Vikas Gupta's lap that eventually made us wonder if Priyank is regretting his actions inside the Bigg Boss house. The producer was also seen saying some heart-melting words to his friend. \nNow, the question is will these two come together again? Will Priyank manage to convince Divya? \nAlthough, when asked about the possibility of patch up, Divya has clearly said \"No\", we can still hope that the couple patch up once Priyank is out and they look adorable together. But, in order to do that Priyank would surely need to prove to Divya that his intentions were never wrong in the show and he truly loves her.

December 7, 2017 Israel, by contrast, applauded Trump\u2019s move with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a pre-recorded video message that it was \u201can important step towards peace\u201d and it was \u201cour goal from Israel\u2019s first day\u201d. \nLONDON: Arabs and Muslims across the Middle East on Wednesday condemned the USrecognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital as an incendiary move in a volatile region and Palestinians said Washington was abandoning its leading role as a peace mediator. \nThe European Union and United Nations also voiced alarm at US President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to move the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and its repercussions for any chances of reviving Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking. \nMajor US allies came out against Trump\u2019s reversal of decades of US and broad international policy on Jerusalem. \nFrance rejected the \u201cunilateral\u201d decision while appealing for calm in the region. Britain said the move would not help peace efforts and Jerusalem should ultimately be shared by Israel and a future Palestinian state. Germany said Jerusalem\u2019s status could only be resolved on the basis of a two-state solution. \nIsrael, by contrast, applauded Trump\u2019s move. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a pre-recorded video message that it was \u201can important step towards peace\u201d and it was \u201cour goal from Israel\u2019s first day\u201d. \nHe added that any peace accord with the Palestinians would have to include Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and he urged other countries to follow Trump\u2019s example. \nTrump upended decades of US policy in defiance of warnings from around the world that the gesture risks aggravating conflict in the tinderbox Middle East. \nThe status of Jerusalem is home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths. Its eastern sector was captured by Israel in a 1967 war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem for the capital of an independent state they seek. \nIsrael deems Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital dating to antiquity, and its status is one of the thorniest barriers to a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, in a pre-recorded speech, said Jerusalem was the \u201ceternal capital of the State of Palestine\u201d and that Trump\u2019s move was \u201ctantamount to the United States abdicating its role as a peace mediator.\u201d \nThe last round of US-brokered talks foundered in 2014 over issues including Israeli settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank and Israeli accusations of Palestinian incitement to violence and refusal to recognise it as a Jewish state. \nThe Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which has dominated Gaza since soon after Israel ended a 38-year occupation in 2005, said Trump had committed a \u201cflagrant aggression against the Palestinian people\u201d. Hamas urged Arabs and Muslims to \u201cundermine US interests in the region\u201d and to \u201cshun Israel\u201d. \nProtests broke out in parts of Jordan\u2019s capital Amman inhabited by Palestinian refugees, with youths chanting anti-American slogans. In the Baqaa refugee camp on Amman\u2019s outskirts, hundreds roamed the streets denouncing Trump and urging Jordan to scrap its 1994 peace treaty with Israel. \u201cDown with America\u2026America is the mother of terror,\u201d they chanted. \nAngry Palestinians switched off Christmas lights at Jesus\u2019 traditional birthplace in the West Bank town of Bethlehem and in Ramallah. A tree adorned with lights outside Bethlehem\u2019s Church of the Nativity, where Christians believe Jesus was born, and another in Ramallah, next to the grave of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, were plunged into darkness. \nAll Palestinian factions called for a general strike and protest rallies at midday on Thursday. \n\u201cLegally null\u201d decision \nThe Saudi Royal Court issued a statement saying that the kingdom followed \u201cwith deep sorrow\u201d Trump\u2019s decision and warned of \u201cdangerous consequences of moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem\u201d. \nThe statement described the move as \u201ca big step back in efforts to advance the peace process\u201d, and urged the US administration to reverse its decision and adhere to international will. \nEgypt, which forged the first Arab peace deal with Israel in 1979, brushed off Trump\u2019s decision and said it did not change Jerusalem\u2019s disputed legal status. \nJordan said Trump\u2019s action was \u201clegally null\u201d because it consolidated Israel\u2019s occupation of East Jerusalem. \nLebanese President Michel Aoun said Trump\u2019s Jerusalem decision was dangerous and threatened the credibility of the United States as a broker of Middle East peace. He said the move would put back the peace process by decades and threatened regional stability and perhaps global stability. \nQatar\u2019s foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, said Trump\u2019s undertaking was a \u201cdeath sentence for all who seek peace\u201d and called it \u201ca dangerous escalation\u201d. \nTurkey said Trump\u2019s move was \u201cirresponsible\u201d. \n\u201cWe call upon the US Administration to reconsider this faulty decision which may result in highly negative outcomes and to avoid uncalculated steps that will harm the multicultural identity and historical status of Jerusalem,\u201d the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement. \nA few hundred protesters gathered outside the US consulate in Istanbul, a Reuters cameraman at the scene said. The protest was largely peaceful, though some of the demonstrators threw coins and other objects at the consulate. \nIran \u201cseriously condemns\u201d Trump\u2019s move as it violates UN resolutions on the Israel-Palestinian conflict, state media reported. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said earlier in the day that the United States was trying to destabilize the region and start a war to protect Israel\u2019s security. \nIn Southeast Asia, the leaders of Muslim-majority Indonesia and Malaysia denounced Trump\u2019s action. \n\u201cThis can rock global security and stability,\u201d Indonesian President Joko Widodo, leader of the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation, told a news conference in which he called for the United States to reconsider its decision. \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May disagreed with Trump\u2019s embrace of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital before a final-status agreement as this was unlikely to help nurture peace in the region, her spokesman said. \nHowever, May\u2019s spokesman welcomed Trump\u2019s stated wish to end the conflict and his acknowledgement that the final status of Jerusalem, including boundaries within the city, must be subject to negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. \n\u201cThe status of Jerusalem is a question of international security that concerns the entire international community. The status of Jerusalem must be determined by Israelis and Palestinians in the framework of negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations,\u201d Macron told reporters in Algiers. \n\u201cFrance and Europe are attached to a two-state solution \u2013 Israel and Palestine \u2013 living side by side in peace and security within recognised international borders with Jerusalem the capital of both states,\u201d he said. \n\u201cFor now, I urge for calm and for everyone to be responsible.

The media questioned questioned the move, forgetting that the team and the coach probably didn\u2019t want any extra strain or pressure. Scoring three goals in three matches was stressful enough. India languishing at bottom of the pool after being dismantled by Germany in a possession vs counter-attacking game was worrying for the ticket counters. \nBelgium had scored 11 goals; five against Spain and three against Holland. Who in their right mind could predict an Indian win? Optimistic fans would probably have hoped for a close loss, and for Indian to avoid a massacre. \nYet the fans walked in. Slowly all the stands filled up, and by the time the National Anthem was played, the fans had their fingers' crossed and cheered India on with more hope than belief. Fans at the Kalinga Stadium during India's quarter-final match against Belgium. Firstpost \nIndia missed an early chance when SV Sunil, who always gives the impression of out-running the ball, failed to control a Gurjant Singh cross into the net. The roar from the fans subsided fast. The start was inauspicious; something similar had happened in the game against Germany. \nHowever, somewhere between the missed training session and the game on the pitch, beliefs, playing system, strategy and the approach had turned for India. This was a blueprint not many had visualised. And even if they had, they hadn\u2019t dared to dream it. Over the years, a false dawn has been predicted so many times that it no longer excited anyone. Pessimism was the law by which Indian hockey thrived. Despite the goalless first quarter, there were signs that India would miss and Belgium would score against the run of play. \nBut noticeably, the errors from Indian players reduced, their trapping was better and they dominated empty spaces. Belgium were, at times, confined to the middle of the pitch with no recourse to the Indian striking circle. \nBelgium doesn\u2019t use too many long passes. They have a tendency to build up but India put a stop to that completely. The fluency with which Belgium dominated the first two quarters wasn\u2019t there in the second half. \nAs minutes ticked away, Belgium became ragged. Then, they used the flanks to run into the circle; Varun Kumar, Sumit, Harmanpreet Singh, Dipsan Tirkey and Rupinder Pal Singh used their skills to avoid the ball on their feet. Once during the match, Birendra Lakra virtually sat on the turf, with his stick absolutely flat on the ground, refusing to yield space. \nMore than anything else, India had stepped up mentally. And the fans sensed it too. There was concern in certain quarters about supporters' ire if India failed to put in a substantial performance or win the match. But the Kalinga Stadium became become a parochial mad house as the match took a crazy roller-coaster ride through the four quarters. \nIf India\u2019s compact and tight display surprised Belgium, the supporters threw them off balance. The fans at the Kalinga are different from the polite classes that sit in Antwerp or Boom watching hockey. Generous applause rings around those stadiums. Sitting in those stands is akin to watching theatre where guttural sounds are frowned upon. Bhubaneswar fans are not used to niceties. Frustration had been boiling over in the last two matches which India had lost. So when Gurjant and Harmanpreet scored to give India 2-0 lead, fans found their voice. \nSuddenly, a match which was supposed to be Belgium\u2019s, was being reversed. India had failed with a penalty corner. And when Rupinder beautifully flicked the ball behind him to Harmanpreet, the indirect conversion seemed magical. Did the India team wait till the quarter-finals to switch on a few hidden tactics? Fans cared little as the decibel levels rose. The roar grew in intensity as India stretched the Belgian defence. \nAkashdeep Singh, Sunil and Mandeep Singh sprinted in and out of various positions upfront, driving the Belgian defence nuts. It wasn\u2019t just about scoring goals. The match had taken a different direction. Mandeep once ran around the outer striking circle forcing the Belgian defender to shoulder him over the touch line and India were awarded a penalty corner. India's SV Sunil in action against Belgium during the quarter-final of the Hockey World League Final. Firstpost \nThese were slightly alien tactics. Forwards are good when they create and not just score. First touches become important. Gurjant\u2019s goal was a classic example. But the build-up to the goal must have immensely pleased caoch Sjoerd Marijne \u2014 he was beaming when India took the lead. \nFormer Indian coach and commentator Cedric D\u2019Souza was adamant that India were playing well and that they would hit their groove by the quarter-finals. Most were skeptical. But against Belgium, both D'Souza and Marijne were proven right. \u201cWe will play well in the quarter-finals,\u201d Marijne had said after the 0-2 defeat to Germany. \nMandeep\u2019s off the ball running drove the Belgian defence batty. When India rotated the ball in the midfield, it stretched Belgium's resources to constantly try to keep a man on the players. It was reminiscent of the 1994 World Cup campaign in Sydney when D'Souza used a lone forward Edward Aranha to harass defences. The match against Holland, which India lost 2-4, was of a similar nature. The only difference was that with Floris Bovelander and Taco Hajo van den Honer in their ranks, the Dutch penalty corner battery was far more superior to India. India relied on counter-attacks but then World Champions Holland were just too powerful. \nSo when it was 2-2, it seemed history would repeat itself. It looked like Belgium, who had won seven out of their last eight matches against India, would prevail. And in the third quarter, for around four minutes, they made concentrated attacks. But India held them off, playing a little further in the striking circle and restricting them to the 25-yard line. The shots towards Suraj Karkera's goal were reduced. \nIn knockout matches, sustained intensity and excellence is rare. Both teams committed errors. And when Rupinder converted off a penalty corner, it seemed like India would go through. However, they were up against a Belgian side that models itself around perseverance. Winning regularly at the top level has also given them the confidence to constantly come back from the brink. \nIt was at this stage that Marijne took a gamble. Normally, India change their goalkeepers at the half. But Karkera was allowed to continue. Maybe, the coach was thinking about a possible shootout when a fresher goalkeeper would be needed. In hindsight, this turned out to be a masterstroke. \nAkash Chikte came on in . India were playing well and defending solidly. There were seven minutes left on the clock when a harmless cross from the right flank didn't find a Belgian stick or Chikte\u2019s pads but the ball zipped into the Indian goal after a thick deflection of Harmanpreet\u2019s stick to make it 3-3. \nA few cardiac arrests in the stands wouldn\u2019t have been out of the ordinary. Like waves, the fans rose and sat. This match was an emotional roller-coaster. Knowing India\u2019s penchant for letting in late goals, there was relief when the clock ran out. In the 2014 World Cup at the Hague, Belgium had scored the match-winner with only 15 seconds left on the clock. Not this time though. \nThe match went to a shootout and Chikte\u2019s presence would have been reassuring for the Indian team. In the 2016 Kuantan Asian Champions Trophy, he was the goalkeeper in the final against Pakistan. This was his moment to take India into the last-four. \nEven the shootout saw a 2-2 scoreline after five strokes. It was down to sudden death and Harmanpreet scored. Chikte came out of his charge but didn\u2019t commit. Arthur van Doren took a few seconds for Chikte to square up and Doren ended up pushing it through the gaps in the pads. But Chikte didn\u2019t relent. With no space, the ball bounced off the pads and Belgium had been ousted. Indian players celebrate after winning their quarter-final match against Belgium in a penalty shootout during Hockey World League Final at Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar. PTI \nAfter spending so long under Sreejesh\u2019 shadow, Chikte finally had a moment he could call his own. Marijne was happy and he said the team played to their plan. The counters had worked for India and the coach had got his desired result. \nRight from the time Marijne has taken over, he has spoken about ball speed and the need to bolster the attack with surprise. Those sentiments were echoed by Sunil. \u201cIt was about catching them with surprise,\u201d said Sunil. \u201cThe important part was also to play to the plan and it worked.\u201d \nThe Indian coach spoke about energy, marking and the creation of penalty corners. The blueprint was introduced during the Asia Cup, if not in its entirety, but there was a plan in place which would culminate in what the coach seeks from these players. Even in Dhaka, India\u2019s Dutch coach was consistent in saying that Indian players have the pace to unsettle defences and also control situations. \u201cThe quality is there. I have to understand and harness it.\u201d \nSunil's speed and forward movement leaves defences ragged. His perplexing pace, with highly exaggerated movements, confuses the opponent. From his lateral movement to his runs down the flanks with mistimed and straight forward crosses, Sunil is the force that defences back away from. Every player now plays a role which is defined in team meetings and there is a plan in place. \nMarijne believes India, despite their quality, need to understand the plans in depth. After the 1-1 draw against South Korea in the Asian Championships, where India scored in the last minute, it was the equaliser that made Marijne happy. \u201cIn fact, scoring in the last minute is a huge boost,\u201d he had said. \u201cIt means that they were in the match plan. And followed it till the last second.\u201d \nIn a world where nothing can be taken for granted \u2014 a touch might be wrong, a flick might fly wide, a pass made to a wrong stick \u2014 Marijne\u2019s philosophy to control the things you can control is working. Indian hockey has lived in a world of speculation but at the moment the future seems to be a fascinating prospect. \nPublished Date: Dec 07, 2017 02:43 pm | Updated Date: Dec 07, 2017 02:55 pm show Full story Also See", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sjoerd marijne", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "birendra lakra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandeep singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sunil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akash chikte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rupinder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sreejesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edward aranha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arthur van doren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "floris bovelander", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cedric d\u2019souza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gurjant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sumit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harmanpreet singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harmanpreet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandeep", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d'souza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chikte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marijne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dipsan tirkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akashdeep singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karkera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suraj karkera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varun kumar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taco hajo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holland", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "firstpost  india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harmanpreet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kalinga stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhubaneswar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kalinga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antwerp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhaka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:17.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "37a7ff5cd5f2dbc530cfcf7ad8916faf2f36f58f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTISFKBBcPridWRO3ionETI2ngkUohyYjAqczg9XuO4vtSOHN.MJNqc1JcAUrmGjgsrsxt7dhd95H5bhnqh1RTzFDjynOW5RU2adaTzT9aJyX5UYU04VmpWJ7BUoJBoBiaHBhHuZombTPyqkvOl1pFcROzcY0I9iB52.5nxfRJ8SqsO02XVygVuSaMza.yJGFx8ZOVJRtkv0Q--", "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "site": "reuters.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/worldNews/", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Reuters: World News", "title": "Pro-Kurdish opposition leader goes on trial in Turkey on terror-related charges", "title_full": "Pro-Kurdish opposition leader goes on trial in Turkey on terror-related charges", "published": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171207&t=2&i=1212815224&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEDB60NP", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 408, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 49, "comments": 0, "shares": 49}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "37a7ff5cd5f2dbc530cfcf7ad8916faf2f36f58f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTISFKBBcPridWRO3ionETI2ngkUohyYjAqczg9XuO4vtSOHN.MJNqc1JcAUrmGjgsrsxt7dhd95H5bhnqh1RTzFDjynOW5RU2adaTzT9aJyX5UYU04VmpWJ7BUoJBoBiaHBhHuZombTPyqkvOl1pFcROzcY0I9iB52.5nxfRJ8SqsO02XVygVuSaMza.yJGFx8ZOVJRtkv0Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "Pro-Kurdish opposition leader goes on trial in Turkey on terror-related charges", "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - The jailed leader of Turkey\u2019s pro-Kurdish opposition was remanded in prison for at least two more months on Thursday at the opening of his trial on terrorism-related charges.\nA supporter holds a mask of Selahattin Demirtas, detained leader of Turkey's Pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) during a rally in Istanbul, Turkey September 10, 2017. REUTERS/Osman Orsal Selahattin Demirtas, the co-leader of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (HDP) who has already been in detention more than a year, was not allowed to appear in court for security reasons and refused to take part via video link.\nThe former human rights lawyer faces up to 142 years in prison in a case closely watched by rights groups and Western governments. The judge ruled he should be kept in detention until the next hearing on Feb 14.\n\u201cThis trial bears all the hallmarks of a theater play. It\u2019s clear that this case was brought on orders. We demand an immediate end to this injustice,\u201d HDP Quote: d one of Demirtas\u2019 lawyers as telling the court.\nThe court ruled that Demirtas be kept in jail, in line with the prosecutor\u2019s demand.\nDemirtas was arrested on Nov. 4 last year, one of more than a dozen HDP lawmakers who were detained in a crackdown following last year\u2019s attempted coup.\nA crowd of several hundred gathered to show support for Demirtas in snowy weather outside the court near the capital Ankara. They joined hands and danced around small fires, singing songs in Kurdish. \u201cDemirtas is our honor,\u201d they chanted.\nDemirtas and other detained HDP members are mostly accused of links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group, which has conducted a decades-old insurgency in which 40,000 people have been killed. The group is deemed a terrorist organization by the United States, Turkey and Europe. All of the accused deny the charges.\nThe HDP is the third-largest party in Turkey\u2019s parliament. The party\u2019s other co-leader, Figen Yuksekdag, also jailed pending trial on terrorism charges, was remanded in custody by an Ankara court on Wednesday.\nPROTESTS BANNED Demirtas is held in a jail in the northwestern city of Edirne. The case was to be held within the city of Ankara itself but was moved to the Sincan prison complex outside the capital, two days before the trial, because of security concerns.\nEuropean parliamentarians, Western diplomats and rights group representatives attended the session in the small court room with a capacity of 120 people.

With winter's shortage of daylight, the sheen of metallic furnishings, fabric and decorative pieces can add a dose of the brightness and warmth so many of us are seeking. \"We love metallics because of the glamour they lend to our lives by catching and refracting light,\" says New York-based interior designer Young Huh. And \"there is nothing more magical or festive than metallic touches during the holidays.\" The trick, she says, is not going overboard with too much glittery goodness. \"A little sparkle goes a long way,\" Huh says. \"If everything is high-octane shine, your home will look a little sad in daylight.\" We asked Huh and two other interior design experts \u2014 Massachusetts-based Kristina Crestin, and Sarah Fishburne, director of trend and design for The Home Depot \u2014 for advice on using metallics during the holidays in ways that will look great all winter. ___ HARD MATERIALS, SOFT LOOK Fishburne has been seeing a trend toward softer metal shades, which look sophisticated. \"A little more white going into them is the best way to describe it,\" she says. The golds are paler and less brassy, the silvers appear a bit whiter, and even shades of rose gold and coppers are a bit less orange. So even if you're using several colors of metals, she says, \"that palette becomes a bit softer.\" Another way of getting metallic shine in a subtler way: Use mercury glass, which shows a range of soft colors in a metallic sheen when it catches the light. Huh says mercury glass is her favorite metallic \"especially in vintage or retro feeling ornaments. It's not too garish and looks well day or night. Buy some boxwood topiaries and pair with mercury glass, and you'll have a wonderful winter look that isn't confined to Christmas.\" Crestin agrees: Last year, she mixed in mercury glass candleholders of different sizes with greenery along her mantel, and loved the look enough to do it again this year. They gave off a warm glow even when the candles weren't lit, she says. ___ CASUAL COPPER Last year, after Crestin found a pretty \"Merry Christmas\" sign made of punched copper, she began adding more copper items to her holiday decorating. She included planters covered with copper foil (similar to gold leaf), copper serving bowls for entertaining, and LED lights on copper wire that she wove into holiday greenery. She took the same approach for a client who wanted to freshen up her holiday decorating: Crestin brought in a selection of copper ornaments for the client's tree and mixed other copper items in throughout the room. \"We used half of what she already had and then supplemented coppery tones,\" she says. The technique works with any type of metal: \"Maybe you edit what you have a little bit,\" Crestin says, and then supplement with ornaments and decorations in copper or another metal this year. ___ EASY ADDITIONS Sparkly metals also look great alongside organic and natural textures, Huh says: \"For instance, what's prettier than silver with burlap?\" Buy a selection of simple terracotta planters or flower pots in different heights, and spray paint some of them in metallic shades, says Fishburne. \"There are so many fantastic metallic spray paints,\" she says, in shades of rose gold, soft golds and silvers. Fill them with poinsettias, artificial or real, in whatever colors appeal to you. If the plants begin to wilt, or you get tired or them after the holidays, keep the same pots but switch them out for succulents. Huh agrees that flower pots are a great place to add metallic accents: \"You can switch out some of your usual cachepots or accessories with items that have a bit of glimmer,\" she says. Finally, Crestin points out that metallic scrapbooking paper from a craft store can be the perfect way to affordably add one more dose of metallic shimmer to your holiday decorating. Buy several sheets in a color you like, and use them as a dining table runner with votive candles and little silver-toned planters on top. For just a few dollars, she says, \"it makes such an impact.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kristina cre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crestin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristina crestin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah fishburne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fishburne", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "massachusetts-based interior", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap image", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:18.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e146bc8123d1c6383e9fe513775c15c4ad665f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMoO9Tb3Z3KqUiAs2csaDOiFvEv5f4hMt0.xe2G_O43CmmpquN8.XPLExZWW9jhsJXqrSWWIsj_VCos8A1jXWMdWr.iIXe8guYM-", "site_full": "top1deco.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://top1deco.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "NeW DecoratinG", "title": "Reasons For Hiring Boston MA Wedding Photography Services", "title_full": "Reasons For Hiring Boston MA Wedding Photography Services", "published": "2017-12-07T10:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e146bc8123d1c6383e9fe513775c15c4ad665f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMoO9Tb3Z3KqUiAs2csaDOiFvEv5f4hMt0.xe2G_O43CmmpquN8.XPLExZWW9jhsJXqrSWWIsj_VCos8A1jXWMdWr.iIXe8guYM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "noreply@blogger.com (Admin)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "Reasons For Hiring Boston MA Wedding Photography Services", "text": "Reasons For Hiring Boston MA Wedding Photography Services By Arthur Stewart Marriage occasions are always colorful and they demand perfect memory capturing act.

Noah Forrin and Colin MacLeod\u2019s paper, This time it\u2019s personal: the memory benefit of hearing oneself , explores what\u2019s been termed the \u2018production effect\u2019\u2013 a neat name for the memory advantage of saying words aloud over simply reading them silently. The speculation is that the effort of saying something out loud appears to make information more cognitively \u2018sticky\u2019, creating stronger schematic connections in long-term memory. This advantages appears to be strongest when we say things out loud ourselves, but also holds true when listening to someone else read aloud. \nThis has, I think, some important implications for two areas of classroom practice. Earlier this year I wrote about why there\u2019s good reason to believe that asking students to listen to a text being read aloud whilst simultaneously expecting them to \u2018follow along\u2019 in silence is likely to over burden working memory and lead to poorer comprehension . I suggested that this was a form of multitasking which human beings are simply incapable of. Instead, we task switch, diverting attention from reading to listening, with a lag of a few seconds with every switch. My conclusion was as follows: \nTo be absolutely clear: reading aloud to students, especially weaker readers, is a good thing to do. Prosody \u2013 the sound and rhythm the words make \u2013 really aids comprehension, especially with difficult texts. The problem comes when children are expected to follow along at the same speed. Because they lack the fluency to do this their working memory overloads and derails comprehension. \nReading aloud to students \u2013 or even better, having them read aloud \u2013 is likely to also boost their memory. There are obvious classroom disadvantages to having all children read aloud, but asking the most skilled reader (probably the teacher) in the room to read aloud is likely to benefit everyone. \nThe second implication is around improving students\u2019 writing. It\u2019s been some years now since I first proposed my \u2018 simple theory of writing \u2018, but essentially what I suggest to teachers is that intervening at the point of writing is an ineffective way to improve writing. Intervening at the point of speech seems to be far more effective. Many students are unable to write down their thoughts because they simply don\u2019t possess the knowledge of how to express their ideas in written language. If we scaffold students\u2019 spoken language by making them \u2018speak like an essay\u2019 then my observation is that the act of speaking in academic language seems to strengthen the schema of how to communicate in academic language and thus writing becomes possible. My anecdotal finding has been that this is far more effective than using writing frames, so it\u2019s pleasing to find some empirical support for the idea. \nWhen I\u2019m training teachers in effective instruction, one of the points I make is that if you want students to remember something, you have to make them say it aloud. If you just get one or two students to repeat something, then only one or two students will remember it. If one students finds a way to avoid having to speak, that\u2019s the student who will be least likely to remember it. The answer is to use fast paced call and response whenever you want students to pay special attention to memorising a particular idea or phrase. \nOf course, none of this is definitive proof that saying things out loud supports memory \u2013 the current research is based on participants studying word lists, so it will be important to see if the findings can be replicated with longer texts, but there\u2019s a clear and plausible mechanism to explain why we should expect the production effect to be an effective way to teach and study.

At the beginning of fall, I had a huge clear out which was very much in order as I could not fit one extra pair of shoes in my storage but with all the recent PR samples lately, my collection has definitely overgrown again (hey, I'm not complaining and as long as I get to wear all of them, I'm happy!). Personally, I try to avoid overly trendy pairs as I know I probably won't maximise their wear, and instead opt for pairs that go with a variety of outfits and these are the ones I want to show you today! I've featured most of these on the blog already so let's recap, shall we?!\n\nJumper:  Primark //  Skirt:  Urban Outfiters ( here ) Boots*:  Zaful ( here , Coupon:  ZafulChen  for 10% off) Original post here . \n\n1. OVER-THE-KNEE BOOTS \n(Original post here )\nI will start with my favourite style, and the one you must have this season! They were pretty big last year too but this season somehow the trend exploded even further and what can I say, this girl here loves them! Over-the-knee boots not only give any outfit extra fashionista points, they are versatile and perfect for those winter days when you want something a little more covering (they are super warm over pants!). They look great with mini sweater dresses and skirts, but equally amazing with denim and pleather trousers! My favourite styles are definitely on suede and tie backs to avoid them falling down as you walk. \n\nJavaScript is currently disabled in this browser. Reactivate it to view this content. \n2. KNEE HIGH BOOTS \n(Original post here )\nIf OTKs are a little too much for you, a fun way of trying the trend in a slight variation is by adding knee-high boots to your shoe arsenal. Knee-high boots are equally comfy and they look right with so many different outfit variations. Not only can you rock them during the weekend for play, they also work well for the office environment. Designers have focused on slouchy and skin-tight styles this season so there is a style to suit every mood. For me, knee-high boots look amazing in suede and leather material, but I can't deny how amazing the patent pair I've linked below looks. \n\nJavaScript is currently disabled in this browser. Reactivate it to view this content. \n3. RED BOOTS \n(Original post  here ) I have yet to find my perfect pair but imagine how amazing red boots would look for a Christmas outfit! It's undeniable that red has been the colour of the season and whilst I have added red pieces to my wardrobe, like dresses and sweaters, my shoe collection is looking overly black (does that justify adding a new pair to it?). Pair it with all-black ensembles, but also with denim and a cable knit sweater for a more casual but comfy look, and go for vinyl styles for trendy vibes. \n\nJavaScript is currently disabled in this browser.

LACE-UP BOOTS \n(Original post  here )\nAltuzarra and The Row rocked combat/lace-up boots at their A/W 2017 catwalk shows, and I expect them to be huge this season. Apart from heeled pairs which we have been seeing everywhere on the high street, and which I featured here  and here . This pair of boots featured here are a lot more chunky and grunge, and I can't think of a better companion for those harsh wet winter days ahead. \n\nJavaScript is currently disabled in this browser. Reactivate it to view this content. \n5. WHITE BOOTS \n(Original post here )\nAnd last but not least, the most controversial of them all but definitely one to remember; white boots!  They've been on a high for quite a few seasons now, despite being not for everyone, proving to be  timeless. I wore mine non-stop during fall and have yet to incorporate them into my winter wardrobe but the best thing with these is that they work amazingly well for spring and summer too, so that's a pair you will be bringing out all year round. Plus, the white boot doesn\u2019t feel as heavy or tired as black and it is the perfect way to inject some \"light\" into your winter outfits. \n\nJavaScript is currently disabled in this browser.

Three companies, namely Schneider Electric SE, Emerson Electric Co., and ABB Ltd., account for a total of 41% of the total market share in this highly concentrated market. ABB Ltd. account for 17.7% of the total market share of the world harmonic filter market. \nIndustrial sector account for the highest consumption of harmonic filters and ABB Ltd. provides harmonic filters to utilities, manufacturing processes, and metal processing. As such, ABB Ltd. account for such a large chunk of the market for harmonic filters. \nIn 2016, the revenue of the global Harmonic Filter market is anticipated to reach US$1.2 bn towards the end of the forecast period of 2016-2024. The market is anticipated to register a CAGR of 6.50 % during the forecast period. \nAsia Pacific to Remain Dominant during the Forecast Period \nSo far as geography is concerned, the market has been segmented into Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America. \nFill the form to gain deeper insights on this market @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=1411 \nThe region of Asia Pacific is anticipated to expand with a very high CAGR over the forecast period of 2017-2025. The region is anticipated to account for around 38% of the total market share. It has also been forecasted that the major contributing countries for the market of Harmonic Filter would be China, and India. There are several factors that are playing a major role in the expansion of the market in this region. \nCountries of the Asia Pacific region experience massive loss of power during transmission and distribution of power, thus many companies are resorting to the use of harmonic filters in a bid to obtain better quality of power. The region experiences increasing demand for electricity thus harmonic filters are also being forecasted to find increasing usage in this region. This region is forecasted to register a CAGR of 6.80% and reach an amount of US$ 471.6 mn in 2024 from US$264.3 mn in 2015 \nEurope comes as second in this market for harmonic filter. However, the growth for this regional market is expected to be sluggish owing to prevalence of high quality infrastructure of power. \nDemand to be Adversely Affected by Lack of Consumer Awareness \nThe market for harmonic filters is set to experience growth owing to various factors like poor quality of power in the countries of Asia Pacific and Latin America. The market has been bifurcated into four categories by the segment of Type, namely passive harmonic filters, active harmonic filters, tuned passive harmonic filters and de-tuned passive harmonic filters. Of these, passive harmonic filters are set to enjoy more demand as compared to the active ones. The reason being robust design and cost efficiency. Active harmonic filter is forecasted to gain momentum in the next few years to come. \nHowever, the growth of the market for harmonic filters is anticipated to be restrained owing to the lack of consumer awareness about harmonic filters. In addition to this, the cost of harmonic filters is on the higher side which is also adversely affecting the market for harmonic filters.

January 2017 \nThe council announced plans to close the pop-up village temporarily, after concerns were raised about a distinct lack of visitors. \nIt said that Guildford Pop-Up Village would reopen in the Spring after various improvements were made. June 2017 \nIt reopened as The Village Guildford after being rebranded. \nThe reopening event featured a giant puppet called \u2018Eartha\u2019 Queen of the earth and characters from Alice Through the Looking Glass. \nMore than 5,000 people attended the reopening event. \nThe council said it would no longer be described as a pop-up village as it would offer long-term opportunities in a \"flexible, different space\" for retailers and traders. June 2017 \nIt was revealed that the council had spent \u00a390,000 on rebranding The Village Guildford. \nThe council also admitted another \u00a3149,000 could be spent on the project. November 2017 \nA council report said estimated levels of income and expenditure on the project were \"unrealistic and unachievable\". \nThe document also said the council decided to close The Village Guildford temporarily after \"business deteriorated rapidly\" in January. November 2017 \nThe council's Overview and Scrutiny Committee recommended that an exit strategy should be drawn up. \nIt was also revealed that the project had cost council tax payers over \u00a31.2 million. \nOne councillor described it as a \"sunk cost\" and said it was time to \"cut your losses\". December 2017 \nThe council decides to shut The Village Guildford and withdraw all funding, just 12 months after it opened. \nThe ice rink was also closed down, after the operator pulled out. Councillor David Bilbe said the \"achievements so far are not enough to justify continuing with this new enterprise\". \nKeep up to date with the latest news from around the county via the free Get Surrey app. \nYou can set up your app to see all the latest news and events from your area, plus receive push notifications for breaking news. \nAvailable to download from the App Store or Google Play for Android .

So it is proving with climate change, which has resulted in increased temperatures, droughts, changed weather patters, more and bigger hurricanes, and the sound of denialists running for cover. One of the best known climate change deniers has been Rupert Murdoch, still there at the head of his mafia empire, and in day to day charge of Fox News Channel (fair and balanced my arse ). Rupe, to the lasting joy of his adoring fans (Sid and Doris Delingpole), Tweeted out his disdain for such trivialities as science. He also, along the way, shelled out $28.8 million for a house and winery in the upmarket Los Angeles suburb of Bel Air. The Murdoch mansion in Bel Air ... \nAs the Guardian has reported , \u201c Murdoch bought the estate, boasting steep vine-lined slopes and a 1920s Mediterranean-style house with nine bathrooms and 11 bedrooms, as a home for when he and wife, Jerry Hall, visit the US west coast \u2026 A previous owner, Victor Fleming, the director of The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind, used to host Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Ingrid Bergman and other Hollywood illuminati \u201d. Murdoch\u2019s belief that It Wasn\u2019t Really Happening could be seen very clearly when he was active on Twitter, telling \u201c Just flying over N Atlantic 300 miles of ice. Global warming! \u201d as well as \u201c World growing greener with increased carbon. Thirty years of satellite evidence. Forests growing faster and thicker \u201d and the priceless \u201c To the naked eye reef looks fully as good as it did 50 years ago \u201d. He couldn\u2019t see it, so it wasn\u2019t there. Well, that was then, but this is now: that California estate with its house and winery is now in the path of what has become known as the Skirball Fire. The Guardian again: \u201c Flames fanned by strong winds reached a temperature-controlled wine storage shed on [Murdoch\u2019s] Moraga Vineyards estate on Wednesday after destroying at least six properties in Bel-Air and threatening hundreds more \u201d. All that wine lost! \u201c The estate has been evacuated. The house appeared undamaged on Wednesday night but the blaze was still largely out of control. It\u2019s unclear how much wine was lost in the storage shed which burned \u201d. As for climate change not happening, \u201c California\u2019s fire season usually ends in November but the hottest summer on record and delayed rains have left the region tinder-dry into December. Some scientists have linked the conditions to climate change \u201d. Climate change reality has arrived chez Murdoch. ... and this week's reality in Los Angeles \nSo what has Rupe had to say as fire threatens to take out all those memories of 1930s Hollywood glitterati? \u201c We are monitoring the situation as closely as we can and are grateful for the efforts of all the first responders \u2026 Some of our neighbors have suffered heavy losses and our thoughts and prayers are with them at this time \u201d. \nHe might also think a little more about what the scientific mainstream is telling him, and a little less about being contrarian just to flog a few more papers .

The Peoples Democratic Party has said that former Vice President Atiku Abubakar will not vote at its December 9 national convention, which holds at Eagles Square, Abuja. Atiku Abubakar According to a statement from the party, this is because of the provision of the Constitution that deals with new entrants into the party. However, the party said he would be allowed to speak at the convention. While revealing more details, the party spokesperson, Prince Dayo Adeyeye, who spoke with journalists at a press briefing in Abuja on Wednesday, said the party\u2019s constitution should be used as a guide on the issue. Adeyeye said, \u201cAll you need to do is pick up the constitution of the party and see whether Atiku is qualified to vote or not.\u201d When pressed further, he said, \u201cFirst of all, I can tell you that we are happy with Atiku coming back to the PDP. It is very exciting for all of us. It is a good omen to everybody in the PDP. \u201cHe was one of the founding fathers, one of those who built this party and he is coming back home. His room was never occupied, so we have opened it for him. \u201cHe will be part of this convention. He will even make a speech at the convention, but he may not be voting at the convention.\u201d Chapter 2 (Part 1) of the party\u2019s constitution deals with admission of members into the party.

In the end, a judge sentenced Slager to 20 years in prison, giving the Scott family the justice they had sought ever since a stranger came to them with the shocking video of Scott being killed. \n\u201cI forgive Michael Slager. I forgive you,\u201d Scott\u2019s mother, Judy, said as she turned toward her son\u2019s killer. \u201cI pray for you, that you would repent and let Jesus come in your life.\u201d \nSitting just a few feet away, Slager wiped tears from his eyes and mouthed: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \nThe punishment wrapped up a case that became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Slager, 36, is one of only a few police officers to go to prison for a fatal shooting, and his sentence is by far the stiffest since the shootings came under extra scrutiny in recent years. \nAttorneys for the former North Charleston officer said he shot the 50-year-old Scott in self-defense after the two fought and Scott grabbed Slager\u2019s stun gun. They said race didn\u2019t play a role in the shooting and Slager never had any \u201cracial animus\u201d toward minorities. \nStill, Slager pleaded guilty in federal court to violating Scott\u2019s civil rights. As part of a plea agreement reached in May, prosecutors dropped state murder charges. \n\u201cThis is a tragedy that shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d U.S. District Judge David Norton said. \nSlager apologized to the Scott family, calling Scott\u2019s mother and brothers by their names. \n\u201cWith my actions that day, Walter Scott is no longer with his family, and I am responsible for that,\u201d Slager said. Of their forgiveness, he added: \u201cI am very grateful for that.\u201d \nSlager\u2019s emotions stood in stark contrast to his stoic demeanor during his state murder trial when jurors deadlocked over a verdict. He has several weeks to appeal his sentence and will be housed at the Charleston County jail until he\u2019s assigned to a federal prison. \nAfter the sentencing, Judy Scott and Walter\u2019s two brothers told reporters that, while they had made peace with the case, they remained adamant the officer should pay for his crime. \n\u201cWho are we not to forgive?\u201d Rodney Scott said. \nA bystander recorded the shooting on a cellphone, and it was shared around the world, setting off protests across the U.S. as demonstrators said it was another egregious example of police officers mistreating African-Americans. \nSlager fired at Scott\u2019s back from 17 feet (5 meters) away. Five of eight bullets hit him. \nThe video was seized on by many as vivid proof of what they had been arguing for years: that white officers too often use deadly force unnecessarily against black people. \nWhen the jury failed to reach a verdict in the state murder case, many black people and others were shocked and distressed, because the video seemed to some to be an open-and-shut case. Some despaired of ever seeing justice. \nThe shooting angered local African-Americans who complained for years that North Charleston police harassed blacks, pulling them over or questioning them unnecessarily as they cracked down on crime. But after the shooting, the Scott family successfully pleaded for calm, asking everyone to let the justice system run its course. \nTwo months after the shooting, a young white man killed nine black church members in a racially motivated massacre during a Bible study in Charleston. The family members of those victims struck a similar forgiveness tone after that attack. \nBefore Slager\u2019s sentence was handed down, the judge had to decide whether the shooting amounted to second-degree murder or manslaughter. Norton found that it was murder. \n\u201cNo matter what sentence I give, neither the Scott family nor the Slager family is going to think that it\u2019s right,\u201d the judge said. \nAfter the shooting, Slager picked up his stun gun and placed it next to Scott. Slager contended he was securing the weapon. Prosecutors think he put it there to bolster his self-defense story. \nThe judge also found that Slager obstructed justice when he made statements to state police after the shooting. \nA pre-sentencing report for Slager found that he committed manslaughter and recommended 10 to nearly 13 years in prison. But the judge was not bound by that review. \nIf Slager had faced another state trial and been convicted of murder, he could have been sentenced to anywhere from 30 years to life in prison. \nConvictions in police officer shootings are uncommon in the U.S. and prison time is even rarer. \nSouth Carolina has been aggressive in charging white officers who shoot unarmed black people. Four have pleaded guilty in state or federal court in the past six years. But only Slager and former state trooper Sean Groubert, who shot a man as he tried to get his wallet during a seat belt violation check, will have been sent to prison. Groubert was sentenced to five years behind bars. \nKinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP . Read her work at https://apnews.com/search/meg%20kinnard .

Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told the House. \n\"Every Australian had their say and they said it is fair, get on with it!\" \nThe historic reforms will commence on Saturday, when same-sex couples can a lodge a notice to marry. They will then have to wait a month before tying the knot. \nLabor opposition leader Bill Shorten hailed the passing of the bill as a uniting moment for Australia, adding: \"Now is the time for healing. \n\"A time to build, a time to love, and is now at last a time for marriage equality,\" he said. \nSame-sex marriage campaigners converged outside parliament in the nation's capital Canberra to celebrate the historic occasion, which sees Australia join more than 20 other countries in recognising such unions. \n\"We came, we saw, and love finally conquered,\" co-chair of the Equality Campaign Alex Greenwich told reporters. \n\"We thank all Australians for their support for saying yes, we thank all those who have campaigned for many years, for over 10 years, for fairness and equality.\" \nThe bill was introduced in parliament by the conservative government after Australians last month endorsed the reforms in a controversial voluntary postal vote. \nNearly 80 percent of eligible voters took part in the poll, and almost 62 percent of the 12.7 million people who participated chose \"yes\" on their ballots. \nThe vote had been called by Turnbull, a moderate who backed gay marriage, in the face of opposition from hardliners who refused to back a national plebiscite on the issue. \nIt was opposed by proponents of same-sex marriage, who wanted direct legislative action and argued a poll would expose gay people and their families to hate speech. \nJust under five million people voted \"no\", with conservative politicians using their rejection as a catalyst to push for religious exemptions to be included in the bill. \nBut after lengthy debate, both houses of parliament knocked back any religious freedom amendments. \nLeading \"no\" campaigner Lyle Shelton said it was \"deeply disappointing\" day. \n\"The Australian people were promised that their freedom of speech, freedom of religion and parental rights would be protected in any same-sex marriage legislation, and this has not happened,\" he said. \n- Weddings early next year - \nThe House vote took place on the last sitting day of parliament for the year, with more than 100 MPs speaking on the bill this week. Queues of people lined up to watch the debate from the public gallery, with some dancing and cheering. \nIn moving scenes, the entire parliament burst into song after the bill passed, belting out the lyrics to the \"I Am Australian\" song: \"We are one, but we are many; And from all the lands on earth we come; We'll share a dream and sing with one voice; 'I am, you are, we are Australian'.\" \nSeveral parliamentarians who supported the changes wore rainbow-coloured socks or ties, including Warren Entsch, described in local media as a \"fiercely heterosexual... crocodile-farming, bull-catching Liberal\". \nMPs have paid tribute to Entsch over the pass few weeks for his efforts, with the veteran Liberal MP speaking passionately about his \"very lonely\" journey in support of equal rights on the conservative side of politics. \n\"This bill will take from no-one; it simply makes our nation a kinder and a fairer place,\" Entsch told parliament this week. \nOne highly anticipated wedding will be the Liberal Party's Tim Wilson, who proposed to his partner Ryan Bolger while speaking on gay marriage on the floor of the House earlier this week. \nSame-sex marriage is now recognised in more than 20 countries, of which 16 are in Europe. It was most recently authorised on Tuesday by Austria's top court by 2019 at the latest. by Glenda KWEK", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

The OCD attaches itself to that particular obsession but it can change and attach itself to something new (it can really attack anything about a person's life, including their weight). OCD and eating disorders are about the person trying to have control over their life, however the disorder manifests through obsessive thoughts and anxities over one's weight, which is sad because they can't control it, it's 100% biological.

about drone that crashed India says China was informed about drone that crashed Posted By: Gopi December 7, 2017 \uf50a Listen to this \nNew Delhi, Dec 7 (IANS) India on Thursday said it had informed China about a drone that crashed in Chinese territory, after Beijing claimed the Indian UAV had \"intruded\" in its area. \nThe Defence Ministry in a statement said that the Indian UAV was on a regular training mission inside Indian territory when it lost contact with the ground control due to some technical problem and crossed over the Line of Actual Control in the Sikkim Sector. \n\"As per standard protocol, the Indian border security personnel immediately alerted their Chinese counterparts to locate the UAV,\" the statement said. \nIn response, the Chinese side responded with the location details of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, the Defence Ministry said. \n\n\"The exact cause of the incident is under investigation. The matter is being dealt with in accordance with the established protocol through institutional mechanisms to deal with situations along the India-China border areas,\" the Ministry said. \nA report from China's Xinhua news agency quoted Zhang Shuili, deputy head of the combat bureau of the Western Theater Command's joint staff department, as saying that an Indian UAV intruded into China's airspace and crashed. \nChina did not give any exact location or time of the crash. \nThe newly-created Western Theater Command is the largest of the five military divisions in China. Tibet which shares a border with India comes under it. \nShuili said the development \"infringed upon China's territorial sovereignty and we are strongly dissatisfied with and opposed to this.\" \n(This story has not been edited by Social News XYZ staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)
