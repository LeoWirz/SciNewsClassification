All regulations should be (equally) enforceable,\u201d he said.\nThe move comes as Tumblr has been criticized here for refusing to employ mechanisms to ensure that its sites do not proliferate posts that promote inappropriate content like prostitution or rape.\nFounded in 2007, Tumblr is a website that combines blogging with social networking. It lets users post multimedia including pictures, gifs and videos to a short-form blog. Some 375.4 million blogs and over 155 billion posts were shared on the platform as of November this year.\nTumblr is currently owned by Oath, the media conglomerate owned by the US mobile carrier Verizon. Though the Tumblr website is available in Korean, the company does not have an office in Korea.\nAs a US company, Tumblr is currently not subject to Korean media content regulations. Citing this position, the firm has previously denied the Korean government\u2019s request for it to join other major internet website operators in employing self-monitoring initiatives to ensure their sites remain clean.\nHowever, Tumblr\u2019s hands-off policy has ignited complaints here. For instance, simply typing in the keyword \u201ccouple\u201d on Tumblr\u2019s Korean website yields blogs that advertise \u201csex partners\u201d while the keyword \u201cwoman\u201d leads to blogs promoting prostitution or porn.\nThe issue became most salient when an unidentified male in Korea posted a naked picture of his allegedly under-aged younger sister earlier this year, claiming that \u201che has been raping her since she was in the fifth grade\u201d and that \u201cthose who want to have sex with her should leave a comment.\u201d\nThe posting received more than 9,200 likes and was \u201cre-blogged\u201d more than 2,000 times on Tumblr, and received numerous comments asking to be contacted, according to local media reports.\nThough the police opened an investigation at the time, the case was soon closed as they could not track down the person who uploaded the posting. To join Tumblr, one simply needs an email, name and password, requiring almost no form of personal identification.\nThe incident led more than 40,000 Koreans to file a petition to the Presidential Office last month, calling on the government to punish those who circulate defamatory content involving individuals via foreign websites.\nAccording to the KCC\u2019s data publicized via Rep.

Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data.

LIFE How Dopamine Addiction is Derailing a Generation of Entrepreneurs--and What You Can Do to Stop It All that Facebook liking and YouTube binge watching could be derailing your efforts to build a successful product or live a balanced life. Journalist and digital consultant @ jboitnott WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images \nThe brain is a complex organ, helping us perform daily tasks and eventually achieve long-term business goals . But that same organ can also easily derail us, especially with so many distractions available in an Internet-driven world. \nOne second we're focusing on work and the next, we find ourselves commenting on a social media post or laughing at a cat video. \nI sometimes feel like I have to treat myself like a lab rat in order to keep my brain on track. I use the Pomodoro Technique, going 25 minutes on and 5 minutes off, in order to stay fresh. \nI block out periods of time each day for emails. I schedule out the neighborhood walks I take. Somehow I still end up burnt out, or wasting time on Youtube or chat. I'm a science experiment that never ends. \nDopamine is the culprit, say mental health experts . It's at work whether we're binge-watching the latest season of Stranger Things or compulsively checking texts or emails. When we enjoy something, our bodies are conditioned to crave more of it. \nHere's the science behind dopamine and some specific recommendations for taking better control of your daily activities. Understanding the dopamine effect \nDopamine is one of the most important chemicals in our brain, driving many of the behaviors that make humans more sophisticated than other species. Although this function is closely related to focus and other cognitive actions, it also regulates pleasure. \nWhen you experience something enjoyable, dopamine is released, driving you to engage in that activity again. If that pleasure comes from something like drugs, alcohol, and yes, even technology, it can eventually lead to addiction and other issues. \nThe response that drives you to throw your schedule out the window and check your phone every time it beeps at you can bring problems. You may find that this compulsion gets in the way of a productive workday, which eventually holds you back in your career aspirations. The negatives of giving In \nIn addition to decimating your productivity, falling prey to dopamine's effects can also be bad for your overall mental health. This is especially true if you use Facebook to get that dopamine hit, as studies have found that excessive use can hurt self-esteem and general well-being. It can also lead to multitasking, which slows down progress on the tasks you're trying to complete. \nYou also may be doing yourself a disservice when you indulge in hours of TV watching, with one study having found that this type of mass consumption leads to a degradation in both retention and comprehension. Yo don't as much out of these shows as you might have when you saw them once a week. Battle the temptation \nThe first step toward gaining control of your behaviors is understanding why they're taking place. Your need to reach for your smartphone every time it pings is a pleasure-reward response. Seeing it that way can help you at least turn off audible pings for the time-being, and keep more focus on the work in front of you. \nThen there's the aforementioned blocking out time for emails, etc. Some of the best and brightest do this. But what happens when that potentially lucrative new customer sends a chat, or your top-paying client calls you in the middle of \"e-mail time.\" \nWhat if you get a text from that person you've been itching to take out on a date? \nUh oh. I just got a notification that the trailer for the new Avengers movie came out. Suddenly work falls by the wayside and I'm living in distraction land. \nFirst of all, understand that you're only human. Stick to your plan, but let yourself tackle the truly pressing issues when they arise. Then, do some meditating (or nothing at all for a change) once you have a break. It's all about balance. \nBut perhaps the best answer may be for you (and I) to accept waiting as an essential part of life. There's something to be said for anticipation, such as the excitement of waiting for vacation to begin or just waiting until tonight to see the Avengers trailer. \nIf you can find a way to delay gratification a bit, you'll not only be able to keep your days filled with hard work, but you'll also be able to truly enjoy the small pleasures in life, a little at a time.

For Trump, the proclamation was an important way to make good on a pledge to his political base, which includes evangelical Christians and pro-Israel Republicans eager for such a move. \"While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\" the president declared Wednesday in announcing his decision. \"Today, I am delivering.\" Those were words to savor for a president who's been frustrated to see a number of key campaign pledges stalled or slowed - sometimes by a bitterly divided Congress, some by larger national or international concerns. Repealing the Obama era health care law is a promise unfulfilled, much to Trump's frustration. Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. The president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. On Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. Steve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. Observers were divided on how to score the president's action. \"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" But Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" A host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. But after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. An email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" Critics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. Aaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" Trump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" The president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. During a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" Trump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "catherine lucey associated", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for a new american security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:13.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d22212193d3a0ea84243a8dc2def53eb29b13f3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlRNQbuGr0BZhuzaatL7ciY", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ - International - 4chan", "title": "/ausnz/", "title_full": "/int/ - /ausnz/ - International - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T12:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 99, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a349b9aa0eacc7f60c26685d61587266fdba3c2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlRNQbuGr0BZrDLIJ2s73jez2_lZ7T_J58-", "ord_in_thread": 75, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>82717068\nReady for what?

REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay It is the first time that Lego has succeeded in a copyright competition case in China, where copies of its colorful bricks and figures have been a recurrent problem as it seeks to gain share in the $31 billion toys and games market.\nEarlier this year, the Beijing Higher Court passed a ruling that recognized the Lego logo and name in Chinese as \u2018well-known\u2019 trademarks in China, putting the toymaker in a better position to act against infringement of its trademarks.\nThe China Shantou Intermediate People\u2019s Court had ruled that \u201ccertain Bela products infringed upon the copyrights of the Lego Group and that manufacturing and selling of those products constituted acts of unfair competition\u201d, Lego said in a statement on Thursday.\nThe court also decided that Lego is protected under Chinese \u201canti-unfair competition law\u201d for \u201cthe distinctive and unique appearance of certain decorative aspects of its packaging across particular product lines (in this case, LEGO Friends)\u201d\nCapturing the imaginations of Chinese children with its bricks is key to reviving growth for the unlisted company after disappointing revenues in its core U.S. and European markets has brought an end to a decade-long sales boom.\nLego, whose name is derived from the Danish \u201cleg godt\u201d meaning \u201cplay well\u201d, is competing with Barbie maker Mattel Inc ( MAT.O ) and Hasbro ( HAS.O ), the firm behind My Little Pony, for a slice of the Chinese market.\nThe case was filed against two Chinese companies, which had been manufacturing and selling Bela products that were almost identical to Lego\u2018s. They will now have to stop copying Lego\u2019s packaging and logos, it said.\n\u201cWe think this is very important for the continued development of a favorable business environment for all companies operating in the Chinese market,\u201d Lego\u2019s vice president of legal affairs, Peter Thorslund Kjaer said.\nReporting by Stine Jacobsen; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "reu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "toymaker lego", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stine jacobsen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter thorslund kjaer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters/wolfgang rattay", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "toymaker lego", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mattel inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lego group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barbie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "my little pony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing higher court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hasbro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "min read copenhagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china shantou intermediate people\u2019s court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bonn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:13.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d22212193d3a0ea84243a8dc2def53eb29b13f3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlRNQbuGr0BZhuzaatL7ciY", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ -

Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

The curriculum materials category encompasses supporting materials that educators might use in the classroom, such as workbooks, lesson plans, manuals and classroom activities. \n\"Mind Your Time,\" authored by the William & Mary Center for Gifted Education, is designed for gifted students in grades 4-5. The focus of the language arts unit is that every person has experienced the effects of time on various phases of their life. Many individuals take time for granted and do not understand the important role it plays in their everyday lives. The reading selections and instructional activities are designed to intrigue and challenge high ability students. Students work independently and in groups doing classwork as well as homework outside the classroom. \nKendall Hunt is a two-time Texas Legacy Award recipient. \"The Pursuit of Justice\", authored by Mary Ann Yedinak was recognized as the 2016 Curricular Materials Award Recipient. Additionally, the Kendall Hunt\u2019s Project M3 unit \"Shopping at the Bazaar: Connecting Number and Algebra with the Meerkats\" was also considered for the 2017 TAGT Legacy Book Award. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous honor to have a Kendall Hunt product recognized by the Texas Association for the Gifted & Talented,\u201d said Chad Chandlee, president of Kendall Hunt Publishing Company. \u201cThe fact that \"Mind Your Time\" is a new unit and has been on the market for just over a year makes this honor that much more exciting.\u201d \nIn all, awards were given in four categories from the Texas Association for the Gifted & Talented. The categories include: Curricular Materials; Educator; Parent and Scholar. A total of 22 books were submitted by nine publishing companies and reviewed by 31 readers. \nAbout Kendall Hunt Publishing Kendall Hunt Publishing is the premiere publisher of innovative, hands-on, inquiry-based science, mathematics, gifted and virtual reality curricula for grades PreK-12.

The waiver and release specifically includes, without limitation, any and all rights and claims pertaining to the processing of personal data, including but not limited to any rights under any applicable data protection statute(s). If in any jurisdiction, any part of this disclaimer is held to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such part of this disclaimer shall be restricted or eliminated to the minimum extent and the remaining disclaimer shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. \nPlease note the information presented is deemed representative at the time of its original release. Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data.

The significant factors resulting in substantial growth are growing adoption of insulin delivery devices and increasing awareness of diabetes care. Home usage of insulin devices saves additional visiting costs, clinic, or hospital fee, and waiting time. The developed devices including pens, pumps, and injectors, are small, highly portable, and give a comfort of using them anywhere and anytime. Therefore, better access to such delivery devices and their developed ease of usage has enabled insulin users opt for self-care diabetes management options. \nU.S. insulin delivery devices market accounted for largest market share in 2016 owing to increasing awareness levels amongst the affected population. Increasing diabetic population and the availability of technologically advanced devices are the factors leading to the high market growth. Also, as per Canadian Diabetes Association, the prevalence of diabetes is increasing in Canada and it is projected to reach over 4 million by 2025. Forming a large patient base with diabetes and its growing incidence is likely to enhance the growth in the U.S. region for insulin delivery devices market during the forecast period. \nIndia and China, are anticipated to witness significant growth during the forecast period due to the existence of a vast patient base suffering with diabetes and rising awareness of insulin delivery devices. In addition, large number of regional players are expanding their business by providing high-end products for diabetes care. \nCompanies operating in insulin delivery devices market include Novo Nordisk (Subsidiary of Novo A/S), Tandem Diabetes Care, Sanofi, Medtronic, Valeritas, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Eli Lilly, F.

Dreamers are recipients of DACA, created by the Obama administration in 2012 to protect 800,000 young people who were brought to the U.S. as children. Thanks to DACA, Dreamers who meet certain guidelines are able to attend college, obtain driver's licenses and work permits to support their families. Among those who would be affected by DACA\u2019s rollback -- 36,000 LGBTQ DACA recipients . With every day they delay, lawmakers are putting more and more people at risk of deportation. HRC continues to pressure Congress to pass a clean DREAM Act and protect Dreamers, including the thousands who are LGBTQ. More from The Washington Post . Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and John Cornyn (R-TX) have introduced a partisan bill on DACA. The real solution to keeping Dreamers in the U.S. -- the only home many of them have only known -- is to pass a clean Dream Act Now. We are disappointed that Grassley and Cornyn are playing partisan games instead of supporting the bipartisan bill that has the votes to pass.

The case involves Jack Phillips, a baker who refused to serve a gay couple in violation of Colorado\u2019s statewide non-discrimination law. Represented by the SPLC-designated hate group Alliance Defending Freedom , Phillips -- who lost before the Colorado Supreme Court -- was granted the Supreme Court hearing to make a claim that he should be able to discriminate against LGBTQ people on religious freedom and freedom of speech grounds. The Trump-Pence Administration has also entered this case to back the baker\u2019s claim. Masterpiece Cakeshop is one of the most significant Supreme Court cases of the year, and the outcome could have sweeping consequences for every single LGBTQ American and millions of others. More from HRC and Pink News . #OpenToAll: HRC is a proud member of the \u201cOpen To All\u201d coalition. As a nation, we decided a long time ago that when a business opens its doors to the public, it should be open to everyone, on the same terms. Learn more here . An online survey notes that 60 percent of Americans believe that wedding professionals should be required to serve same-sex couples, and millennials are more likely than other generational groups to oppose service refusal.

Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

The waiver and release specifically includes, without limitation, any and all rights and claims pertaining to the processing of personal data, including but not limited to any rights under any applicable data protection statute(s). If in any jurisdiction, any part of this disclaimer is held to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such part of this disclaimer shall be restricted or eliminated to the minimum extent and the remaining disclaimer shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. \nPlease note the information presented is deemed representative at the time of its original release. Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data.

(PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nPowerphase today announced that it has closed an investment from strategic investors including Xcel Energy ( NYSE: XEL ), the nation\u2019s top wind energy provider. In addition to the investment from Xcel Energy, Powerphase is welcoming ClearSky Managing Director James Huff to its Board of Directors. This latest investment will be used to grow global sales of the Powerphase products through expanded strategic partner relationships. \nPowerphase was founded in 2012 by energy industry veteran Bob Kraft. The company has multiple global installations of its flagship product, Turbophase, a quick response time and cost-effective way to upgrade new or existing gas turbines to produce more power, more efficiently while increasing grid operational flexibility. Kraft\u2019s previous company, PSM, was first acquired by Calpine, a U.S. independent power producer, then in 2007 by the global manufacturing conglomerate, Alstom, for $241 million. \n\u201cAs an energy provider serving millions of customers, we\u2019re always searching for innovative technologies that increase energy efficiencies while reducing the environmental impacts of energy production,\u201d said Ben Fowke, chairman, president and CEO of Xcel Energy. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to partner with Powerphase, a company that shares our commitment to providing quality products and services to customers.\u201d \nNatural gas power generation is increasing at record rates globally, creating an attractive market for turbine enhancements. Powerphase\u2019s Turbophase technology drives gas turbine efficiency and savings through a modular system that can be used both to upgrade existing generators and augment new installations. The Turbophase product benefits from three macro trends in power: increasing renewable energy, increasing use of natural gas, and increasing distributed generation. \n\u201cThe power industry is moving rapidly in the direction of natural gas power generation, and Powerphase\u2019s groundbreaking patented air efficiency technologies are leading the way in innovation, with significant market-changing potential. Powerphase is looking forward to introducing its disruptive turbine enhancement products to leading energy providers around the globe,\u201d said ClearSky Managing Director and Powerphase Board member, James Huff. \nAbout Powerphase Powerphase has commercialized advanced quick response aero-thermal technology for power generation and industrial applications to use air more efficiently and effectively in combustion turbines leading to revolutionary advancements in renewable energy support and grid efficiency. The management team has leading expertise in combustion turbine design and technology, combined with deep experience in the power industry.

Two protesters were hit by rubber-coated steel bullets and five others were treated for tear gas inhalation in the town of Bethlehem, as Israeli soldiers fired on a peaceful march against the US president's declaration on Wednesday.\nEleven people were injured in Tulkarem city and 15 in Hebron and al-Bireh, where thousands of demonstrators rallied with chants of \"Jerusalem is the capital of the state of Palestine\", witnesses said.\nOne protester was hit by live fire and another 14 by rubber-coated steel bullets, medics said. An Israeli military spokeswoman said soldiers had used \"riot-dispersal gear\" against rock-throwers.\nIn Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip, four Palestinians were injured by Israeli soldiers, one of whom was reported to have been hit by live fire and was in a critical condition.\nVideos from Khan Younis showed smoke plumes rising from a series of fires set by Palestinians, a tactic used in the past to prevent reconnaissance missions of Israeli jets.\nThe Israeli military said on Thursday that an aircraft and a tank had targeted two posts belonging to militants in the Gaza Strip after three rockets were launched at Israel.\nTwo rockets launched from the besieged coastal strip fell short inside the Palestinian enclave earlier in the evening and a third, fired later, landed in an open area in Israel causing no casualties or damage, an army spokeswoman said.\nGaza residents said there were no casualties from the Israeli attack and that two unmanned lookout posts were hit.\nA hardline militant group in Gaza called the Al-Tawheed Brigades - which does not heed the call from Hamas to desist from firing rockets - claimed responsibility for the launches.\nPalestinians were also protesting outside the Old City of Jerusalem.\n'People are disappointed' Across the West Bank, Palestinians closed down their shops on Thursday in observance of a strike that Palestinian factions called for after Trump\u2019s announcement.\nIn Ramallah, streets were empty and life was brought to a halt by the strike.\nJamal Juma\u2019a, who was protesting near the illegal settlement of Beit El, north of Ramallah, said there is immense anger among Palestinians, not only against Trump\u2019s move, but also against their own leadership.\nIn a speech on Wednesday, Palestinian strongly condemned the embassy move and called for unity, but he stopped short of taking any drastic measure like resigning or dissolving the Palestinian Authority.\n\u201cPeople are disappointed in Abu Mazen (Abbas); his speech was very empty and subdued,\u201d Juma\u2019a told MEE.\nHe added that with the mounting anger and frustration, he predicts protests will escalate.\n\u201cWe are bracing for a long day tomorrow,\u201d he said of Friday.\nThe unrest came as Hamas, which controls Gaza, called for a new intifada or uprising against Israel. \"We can only face the Zionist policy backed by the United States by launching a new intifada,\" the group's leader Ismail Haniyeh said in the Gaza Strip.\nIsrael's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile hailed Trump for his move.\nIn Jerusalem, Palestinians decried the decision, condemned by a huge majority of world leaders, as the latest treachery by the West.\nAn Israeli soldier fires towards Palestinians during clashes in Bethlehem on Thursday (Reuters)\nDaoud, 27, who lives in the Old City, told Middle East Eye he felt \"betrayed by the Arab nations and the entire world\".\n\"Britain promised our land Palestine to the Jewish people and America gave Jerusalem to Israel,\" said Daoud.\n\"We don't rely on anyone - even our leadership. It's up to us, the Palestinian people, to not be silent on all of this. We will lead the struggle. You saw that in the crises of the Aqsa last summer and you will see what will happen now.\"\nThe Israeli military said on Thursday it was deploying reinforcements to the occupied West Bank in anticipation of unrest.\n\"Upon the conclusion of the general staff's situation assessment, it was decided that a number of battalions will reinforce in the area of (the West Bank), as well as combat intelligence and territorial defence,\" the military said.\n\"In addition, more standby forces were defined, as part of the readiness for possible developments.\"\nIn Jerusalem on Wednesday evening, hundreds of protesters gathered in front of Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third-holiest site, to condemn Trump.\nYoung Palestinians also organised a late-night protest in the West Bank city of Nablus.\nIn Gaza, activists urged people via mosque speakers to take to the streets to protest the US decision.\nPalestinians also switched off Christmas lights at the traditional birthplace of Jesus in Bethlehem on Wednesday night in protest.\nA Christmas tree adorned with lights outside Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity, where Christians believe Jesus was born, and another in Ramallah, next to

Fady Ghattas, Bethlehem's municipal media officer.\nMore embassies on the way\nNetanyahu said he was in touch with other countries about the possibility of moving their embassies from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as well.\nThe Philippines, Czech Republic and Hungary are among those who have reportedly discussed the idea.\nIsrael seized the eastern part of Jerusalem during the 1967 Six-Day War and later annexed it, claiming both sides of the city as its capital.\nThe Palestinians want East their future state.\nSeveral peace plans have unravelled in the past decades over the issue of how to divide sovereignty or oversee holy sites in Jerusalem.\nMost of the international community does not formally recognise the ancient city as Israel's capital, insisting the issue can only be resolved in negotiations - a point reiterated by the UN's secretary-general, Antonio Guterres.\nGuterres implicitly criticised Trump, stressing his opposition to \"any unilateral measures that would jeopardise the prospect of peace\".\nA Palestinian woman walks past Israeli police near Damascus Gate in Jerusalem on 7 December (Reuters)\n- Reuters also contributed to this report", "highlightText": "",

It\u2019s the sixth year we\u2019ve done one (well done to Rebecca Ferguson and Mike Sharples on pushing this through). When we started the intention was to make it distinct from the NMC New Horizon reports by focusing on pedagogy. I think, to be honest, in those early ones there was probably a technology focus still, but as it\u2019s progressed it has really moved away from this to more pedagogy, socially focused issues. \nI\u2019d also add I\u2019ve found it increasingly useful as a resource. I\u2019m occasionally asked to contribute something on current developments in ed tech, and I use the IP reports as a good starting point. Basically, they allow you to sound very knowledgeable, and impress people. \nThe ten trends covered this year are as follows (you can guess which one I contributed). The Times Higher take is here. \nSpaced learning Based on research into brain activity and human learning, this involves teaching in short blocks with breaks between them. This fast-paced approach has been tested, showing that 90 minutes of spaced learning could have the same outcomes as months of study. Learners making science Experiencing how science is made can enhance skills and develop critical thinking. Taking part in crowdsourced activities and participating in citizen science projects have the potential to change how young people think and act in relation to their surroundings. Open textbooks Initially established to reduce costs (HE books can account for a quarter of a student\u2019s expenses), Open Textbooks are a form of Open Educational Resource, providing adaptable content which students can add to and edit. Navigating post-truth societies New information sources diversify the information available but have created new challenges as people make daily decisions about where to get information and who to trust. Taking account of this in the curriculum helps people evaluate information, reflect on their own assumptions and seek a diversity of knowledge to cut through \u2018fake news\u2019. Intergroup empathy Projects such as \u2018Humans of New York\u2019 show the value of constructive contact between people from various cultural backgrounds. New approaches use technology and gaming to develop empathy with people from different groups. Immersive learning Fast-developing technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality offer learners opportunities to immerse themselves in situations that would be difficult, dangerous or impossible in everyday life. Learning in this way can be engaging, stimulating and memorable for learners. Student-led analytics Moving away from teachers and institutions using analytics to help students, this trend focuses on analytics helping learners to specify their own goals and ambitions. Particularly useful for those with limited study time, this approach puts learners in control and allows them to, for example, shift their goals and priorities or request feedback. Big-data inquiry In today\u2019s data-driven world, students need to learn to work and think with data from an early age so they are well prepared with the skills society needs. To do this, they need opportunities that encourage them to be active in exploring data, managing and analysing it. Learning with internal values People are motivated to learn when they have important questions to answer or problems to address. When learning is linked to goals that learners value, they take ownership of their work and put in the effort needed.

Have you added anything different to how you mentally and physically prepare for every new game in terms of how your working on your game and body during the week? \n\n\n\nIt all about habits and being consistent and doing the same thing each day. When you get older it\u00b4s all about being consistent and doing your daily habits and hoping the habits remain consistent \n\n\nHow much of a challenge is it playing on a team that is so deep and always having to be effective knowing every little touch and play determines how much minutes you will get. Does this challenge motivate you more each season as you get a year older? \n\nI have played for big teams and it\u00b4s not so much about individual aspects, but more the collective. There can be a different top player in each game. It\u00b4s about how much time you are on the court and how you can contribute the most. You just try to do your best in helping your team win. My major concern isn\u00b4t about harping on not taking shots and worrying about being taken out, but maximizing my opportunities on the court best. Key is knowing your role and doing the best on the court. \n\n\n\nThe Euroleague seasons has had some surprises as Milan is near the top and Fenerbahce has been struggling. The two Greek powerhouses are playing well as Bamberg. Has the Euroleague season so far been a surprise to you? \n\n\n\nI don\u00b4t thin k so. The season is still young and only 1/3 over. Some teams have had injuries, others have chemistry while others don\u00b4t. It is a very long season and isn\u00b4t a sprint, but a marathon. You have to play your best basketball in April and May. Key now is winning games and staying consistent. \nYour back in Bamberg for the Christmas time. What memories do you have of that time when you were playing with the club? \n\n\nSeeing the Christmas time in Germany has been one of my best experiences in Europe. I remember going to the Christmas market in Nurnberg and experiencing the lights and atmosphere. It was just remarkable. \n\n\nBamberg have been struggling in the BBL and slowly finding their way and playing very spirited basketball in the Euroleague. With so many new faces, how much of the credit goes to head coach Andrea Trinchieri in the early going? \n\n\nThey have many new faces and many new go to guys. My friend Ricky Hickman is starting to play a lot better after having an early season injury. They still have to find their chemistry. They also have some young guys that have had to take over new permanent roles. Anytime you lose some guys to the NBA, it will be tough. You have to credit the coaching staff for the success in the Euroleague. It is still very early and it is hard to judge the team from the first two months. If you see how they have done losing so many good players, they have done a tremendous job. \n\n\nBamberg departed with Quincy Miller-Scott and have added long time NBA veteran Dorrell Wright. Do you feel like he will be able to be that needed piece that the club was missing despite no real European experience? \n\nHe has championship experience. He had an immediate impact and will continue to lift them. \n\n\nEvery game in the Euroleague is vital. What kind of game can we await and what will be key to winning? \n\n\nIt is always tough playing in Bamberg. The games are always tight and last season there was a buzzer beater. We know what to expect with the atmosphere there. They are always strong at home and play physical. We need to match their physicality and get the 50/50 balls and hustle plays. It will be the little things that make the difference. \n\n\nThis is your eighth season of coming back to Bamberg to play Euroleague. You played two seasons in Italy and Greece with one team and Bamberg was the only team where you played one season. What does Bamberg have that none of the other places had that will forever stay in your heart? \n\n\n\nBamberg is a unique city. It reminds me of Veroli and Pireus as every city lives through their basketball. The Bamberg fans are so passionate. The environment isn\u00b4t hostle, but fanatic They know basketball and care about it. \n\n\n\nIn the last interview we talked about your project My Hoop Journey, but you also have a documentary coming out. Give an update on these two projects? \n\n\n\nMy Hoop Joruney let\u00b4s players tell their stories playing abroad. We have curtailed it a bit into the documentary showcasing my life in Moscow. It gives people at home the chance to see how the life is of a player and fans how foreigners live. \n\n\n\nHow surprising has the rampant success of the Boston Celtics been and the slow start of the Cavs. Is head coach Brad Stevens making new waves in terms of his coaching ability? \n\n\nI think that Stevens is underrated in the NBA. Boston has a successful program and team. They had a plan and executed it well. They have a great system that has been able to let the players compete and be successful. There weren\u00b4t much expectations recently, but in the last few years they have been very competitive. \n\n\n\nHow do you summarize the 2017 NBA Draft. What sleepers do you see playing a role in the NBA? \n\n\nDonovan Mitchell of Utah has really exploded. Jayson Tatum has been a difference maker for Boston. Dennis Smith Jr has been the most exciting. Ben Simmons is a once in a generation player \n\n\n\nWhere will the journey of the Houston Rockets go this season with Chris Paul and James Harden in the back court. Do they have enough to make a serious run at the title or is something missing? \n\n\nThe Rockets are cruising now. Harden is looking like the MVP now. Paul is a great player. The fact that these two are playing well together has erased any question marks. They will be competitive this season. \n\n\nHow do you rate the Kyrie Irving-Isaiah Thomas trade? Who got the better deal and which team will profit better in the long run? \n\n\n\nIt is hard to say. Both teams are in a good position. I think it worked out well for both teams. You won\u00b4t know until 3-4 years from now who got the better deal. \n\n\nWhere will the journey of the Oklahoma Thunder go this season with Westbrook, George and Anthony? Can they make a serious run in the west? \n\n\n\nThey have three superstars. That is a formula for winning a title. It\u00b4s all about figuring out how to play well together. They will find the chemistry that James, Wade and Bosh were looking for early in Miami. I think they could match Golden State.
