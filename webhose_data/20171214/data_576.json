Bout this over the Anker and JBL because of the overall best bang for the buck value, considering sound and build quality.\nThanks Cambridge SoundWorks for making such a great product available to Canadians without jacking up the price!!\nBelieve it or not it's sometimes hard to get popular US items in Canada without going through some random 3rd party seller who jacks up the price like 10x! stars: 5", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:11.043+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a1122a6d4abc6ff7f0cbe590e75267bf7739574", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94orQZ9QJAYI0m5hWg7ndh3JrAAZ4MgDA_4nhRk2HepqOenAFm3z4RL2r2RBdUE._afI2XSejd5ujuOwA85o9VhMKG9ORsMjnjZcdjMr2rgn.uNWef6zgC36OsG3k2GR5dcKFcBNmui5Q48PH8021RWS0myIb_Ud5Z5FmllC0tQrvk1hQR5ZYH7F0BSKkm5GeWTY6Eo4ObHtIWet1r2PSp2a88yhaSSF305Q--", "site_full": "www.amazon.ca", "site": "amazon.ca", "site_section": "https://www.amazon.ca/Cambridge-SoundWorks-Angle-Bluetooth-Playtime/dp/B01LZV6TYQ/ref=lp_677226011_1_5?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1512600653&sr=1-5", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality &amp; 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker: Amazon.ca: Electronics", "title": "Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality & 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker", "title_full": "Amazon.ca:Customer reviews: Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality & 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker", "published": "2017-04-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7b84a19a5289ba9291637bdb09f25b68909e014e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94orQZ9QJAYI0m5hWg7ndh3JrAAZ4MgDA_4nhRk2HepqOenAFm3z4RL2r2RBdUE._afI2XSejd5ujuOwA85o9VhMKG9ORsMjnjZcdjMr2rgn.uNWef6zgC36OsG3k2GR5dcKFcBNmui5Q48PH8021RWS0myIb_Ud5Z5FmllC0tQrvk1hQR5ZYH7F0BSKkm5GeWTY6Eo4ObHtIWet1r2PSp2a8bYNhCwacmFtC2ZLTM9YV4", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "Aaron Gomirato", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Received the speaker earlier than I had anticipated.

He is charged with leading a terror organization, engaging in terror propaganda and other crimes. \nThe trial is one of many against Demirtas, who is imprisoned in northwestern Turkey. He did not attend Thursday\u2019s trial. \nDemirtas was arrested last year when the government launched a crackdown following a failed coup attempt, which critics say has been expanded to target all government opponents and dissenting voices. \nThe government accuses the HDP, the nations\u2019 third-largest party in parliament, of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK. The HDP denies the accusation. \nProsecutors accuse Demirtas of being a leader of Turkey\u2019s outlawed Kurdish rebels and hold him responsible for street violence that broke out in 2014 during protests against government policies on Syria. \nThe violence led to more than 30 deaths. \nThe New York-based advocacy group, Human Rights Watch, criticized the trial, calling it \u201cpart of a wider pattern of repression against government critics.\u201d \n\u201cHolding the leader of a major opposition party in pre-trial detention for over a year on flimsy charges is another example of the political abuse of the criminal justice system we are repeatedly seeing in Turkey,\u201d said Hugh Williamson, Human Rights Watch\u2019s director for Europe and Central Asia. \nThe Turkish parliament stripped lawmakers of legal immunity last year, paving the way for the arrest of several HDP legislators \u2014 including Demirtas and former co-chairwoman Figen Yuksekdag \u2014 on terror-related charges. \nThe arrests follow the collapse of a fragile peace process between the state and the PKK in 2015. The group is considered a terror organization by Turkey and its Western allies. \nYuksekdag lost her seat in parliament earlier this year after an appeals court confirmed her 2013 conviction for engaging in terrorist propaganda, and later stepped down as the HDP\u2019s co-leader.

(AP) - The Latest on Southern California wildfires (all times local): \n10:30 p.m. \nA surge from the biggest of the wildfires burning in Southern California has forced several thousand more people to evacuate in a community of artists and resorts. \nVentura County sheriff's Sgt. Eric Buschow says flames have been creeping closer and slowly surrounding the town of Ojai (OH'hi), and Wednesday night increasing winds brought them close enough to expand evacuation orders there. \nFlames, now about 4 miles away, were visible from the city's downtown for the first time on Tuesday night, and ash was raining down. \nParts of Ojai were already under evacuation orders, and the entire valley surrounding it had been under a voluntary evacuation advisory since the fire broke out on Monday. \nThe new evacuations meant most of the town of about 7,000 people was under mandatory orders. \nNearly 30,000 people are under evacuation orders for the fire. \n___ \nThis story corrects the day of the week. \n___ \n7:50 p.m. \nThe largest and most destructive wildfire in Southern California has grown to 140 square miles and fire officials say the worst may be yet to come. \nThe 90,000-acre fire burning in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles has swept through ridges and canyons to the sea and Santa Ana winds that drove it are expected to return with a vengeance overnight. \nState fire director Ken Pimlott says winds that eased in the afternoon could return with gusts up to 80 mph Thursday that would make it impossible to fight the fire. \nDozens of homes have burned since the blaze erupted Monday. Nearly 1,800 firefighters and a fleet of aircraft are fighting the flames but the blaze is only 5 percent contained and an estimated 12,000 buildings are in danger. \n___ \n6:20 p.m. \nA wildfire in a wealthy western area of Los Angeles has reached the estate and winery owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch. \nRoxanne Langer at Moraga Vineyards in Bel Air says a temperature-controlled wine storage shed burned after the fire erupted before dawn Wednesday but it's unclear how much wine was lost. \nShe says firefighters stepped in to douse the flames with the aid of helicopters and that other storage sheds, the winery itself and the estate's unoccupied house are not damaged. \nThe winery has been evacuated. \nMurdoch bought the property for about $30 million in 2013. \nLanger says it appears the 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines suffered only slight damage and the grapes already had been harvested. \nIn a Facebook statement, Murdoch says some neighbors suffered heavy losses and his thoughts and prayers are with them. \n___ \n3:45 p.m. \nFirefighters have stopped the spread of a wildfire that has destroyed homes near the world-famous Getty museum in Los Angeles. \nDeputy Fire Chief Charles Butler says firefighters and aircraft stopped the growth of the 475-acre (192-hectare) blaze in the Bel Air neighborhood. \nThere are currently few visible flames and crews are concentrating on the southwest corner of the fire. \nButler says four homes have been destroyed and 11 damaged since the blaze erupted before dawn Wednesday in an area that includes many hilltop mansions. \nAbout 700 homes, an apartment building and a school have been ordered evacuated. \nNortheast winds driving the flames eased by afternoon but are expected to return in full force Wednesday night. Firefighters are struggling to ring the blaze before that happens. \n___ \n3:15 p.m. \nCalifornia's top firefighter says the state is in for the worst Santa Ana wind conditions it's ever seen. \nKen Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, says the wind wildfire threat to Southern California for Thursday is purple. The has color has never been used before, means there is extreme danger and that fires that erupt will burn uncontrollably. \nBelow that is red, meaning high danger of fires that burn rapidly and intensely and are difficult to control. \nPimlott says the winds could hit 80 mph (129 kph) and make it impossible to fight Southern California wildfires that have destroyed at least 200 homes and buildings. \nFive wind-driven flames continue to threaten homes in Ventura and Los Angeles. Some 200,000 people are under evacuation orders. \n___ \n1:25 p.m. \nThe University of California, Los Angeles, has canceled classes for the rest of the day due to difficult traffic problems stemming from a wildfire. \nThe university's website says many students, faculty and staff have been unable to reach the campus Wednesday, so classes from noon onward are canceled. \nThe athletics department says a night men's basketball game and all other team workouts and practices are canceled. \nThe fire erupted before dawn in the Sepulveda Pass, just up Interstate 405 from UCLA. The fire has destroyed some homes as it spread into the Bel Air area. \n___ \n10 a.m. \nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti says at least four and possibly six homes have been destroyed by a wildfire in the city's Bel Air area. \nThe fire erupted before dawn Wednesday in Sepulveda Pass, a major commuter route between the west side of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to the north. \nThe fire burned up hillsides on the east side of the pass into expensive neighborhoods that are now under evacuation orders. \nThe mayor says the fire is now 150 acres with zero containment. \nSome 500 firefighters are battling the fire along with water-dropping helicopters and airplanes laying down streams of fire retardant. \nThe dangerous Santa Ana winds that have fanned fires across Southern California this week have diminished over the new LA fire but conditions are very dry, with just 9 percent relative humidity. \n___ \n9:15 a.m. \nPresident Donald Trump says his thoughts and prayers \"are with everyone\" in the path of California's latest wildfires. \nTrump in a tweet is also encouraging everyone \"to heed the advice and orders of local and state officials\" and thanking first responders for their \"incredible work!\" \nWind-driven fires have raced through California communities for the second time in two months, leaving hundreds of homes feared lost and uprooting tens of thousands of people. \nThe most damaging fire is in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, where more than 100 square miles (259 sq. kilometers) and numerous homes have burned. \nDeadly fires tore through Northern California earlier this year. \n___ \n8:03 a.m. \nThe biggest and most destructive of several wildfires burning in Southern California has scorched more than 101 square miles. \nState fire authorities say the fire burning in Ventura County about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles is also considered a threat to 12,000 structures Wednesday. \nDozens of homes have burned since the fire erupted Monday amid fierce Santa Ana winds. \nA new fire burning among ridges and canyons on the west side of Los Angeles has also burned several homes while snarling morning commuter traffic. \n___ \n7:35 a.m. \nTwo homes are burning in a wildfire that has erupted in an exclusive ridge-top neighborhood in Los Angeles, the latest to hit fire-plagued Southern California. \nThe fire broke out before dawn Wednesday on the east side of Interstate 405 in the Sepulveda Pass and raced up steep slopes into neighborhoods at the top. \nThe Los Angeles Fire Department has deployed hundreds of firefighters and called in helicopters and airplanes. \nEvacuations have been ordered and a wider area has been told to be ready for orders to leave. \nIt's the same region of Los Angeles where hundreds of homes burned in the famous 1961 Bel Air Fire. \n___ \n6:52 a.m. \nMandatory evacuations have been ordered in an exclusive ridge-top neighborhood in Los Angeles as a dangerous new wildfire burns in Southern California. \nThe fire erupted before dawn Wednesday on the east side of Sepulveda Pass, which carries heavily traveled Interstate 405 through the Santa Monica Mountains on the city's western side. \nHelicopters are making water drops and more than 200 firefighters are battling flames close to homes. \nIn addition to the mandatory evacuations, Los Angeles Fire Department spokeswoman Margaret Stewart says a wider area on the east side of the pass has been advised to get ready in case of evacuation orders. \n___ \n5:35 a.m. \nA brush fire has erupted on the west side of Los Angeles along Interstate 405 in Sepulveda Pass. \nFire Department spokesman Margaret Stewart says the fire was reported at 4:52 a.m. Wednesday and is burning uphill, driven by topography rather than winds. \nStewart says 47 firefighters are on the scene, setting up protection for homes at the top of the steep slopes. Two firefighting helicopters have been assigned. \nSepulveda Pass carries heavily traveled Interstate 405 through the Santa Monica Mountains between the western neighborhoods of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to the north. \n___ \n12:40 a.m. \nThe same vicious winds that made three Southern California wildfires so destructive are also making the firefight itself more difficult. \nThe water-dropping planes and helicopters essential to fighting massive fires have been mostly grounded because it's too dangerous to fly in the strong gusts. \nCommanders hoped to have them back in the air on Wednesday morning, but all indications are the winds will be whipping then too. \nThe blazes brought evacuation orders for nearly 200,000 people, destroyed nearly 200 homes and have remained mostly out control. \nThe largest and most destructive of the blazes, an 85-square-mile wildfire in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, had nearly reached the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday night after starting 30 miles inland a day earlier. \n___ \nThe 5:35 a.m. entry has been corrected to say west side. \n.

\nANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 A Maryland county executive has asked the campaign of U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama for a refund of a $1,000 donation. \nThe Capital Gazette reports that Anne Arundel County Executive Steve Schuh confirmed on Wednesday that he had made the donation \u201ca few months ago,\u201d and requested a refund via email to Moore\u2019s chief of staff, Rich Hobson, on Monday. \nSchuh said he waited to make the request as he had expected Moore to drop out of the race in light of the \u201ccredible\u201d accusation of sexual misconduct with Alabama teenagers. \nSchuh says he hasn\u2019t received the money. \nMoore\u2019s campaign did not return a request for comment from the newspaper. \nInformation from: The Capital, http://www.capitalgazette.com/ TAGS",

What's her income?\" Irwan asked when speaking to the media at the launch of local e-wallet service, TaPay, at Cyberjaya today. On Tuesday, the singer tweeted that Malaysians are  angry  for having to deal with a \"debt\" that they had no part in creating. \n\nIrwan suggested, however, that people who make such complaints get confused between the cost of living, and the cost of lifestyle. \"The inflation is only 3.5 percent, but the annual salary increase is higher, at five to six percent, the salary (increment) should be able to cover the inflationary cost. \"There is another cost, the lifestyle cost. People always confused between the lifestyle cost and cost of living, if you add the lifestyle cost, then things are beyond your means,\" he said. Irwan also stressed that the government has done a lot for the bottom 40 percent (B40) group. \"(We are giving) 1Malaysia People's Aid (BR1M), education fees (free education), and RM1 hospital fees. \u201cWhere in the world can you go to hospital and only pay RM1 ?\" he asked. Sheila\u2019s tweet, which also touched on runaway inflation, unemployment and the depreciation of the ringgit, has since caused a firestorm of reactions.

More >> Garrison Keillor says Minnesota Public Radio shouldn't have dismissed him last week without investigating what the radio station has called \"multiple allegations.\".   \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

Why are people asking if the president is Jewish? \nTrump\u2019s true religious beliefs have been a source of mystery and speculation for some time By Tom Michael 7th December 2017, 9:41 am DONALD Trump\u2019s religious beliefs have been a source of mystery and speculation for some time. \nHere\u2019s what we know about the US president and his faith\u2026 Sky News Donald Trump wears a kippah during a visit to a Jewish holy site in Jerusalem What religion is Donald Trump? \nDonald Trump says he is Christian. More specifically he is Presbyterian, which is a form of Protestantism which traces its roots back to Scotland. \nThe US president inherited his religion from his British mum, who was born on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides before moving to New York in 1930 at the age of 18. \nHis father\u2019s ancestors were Lutheran \u2013 another form of Protestantism originating in Germany. \nHis family attended First Presbyterian Church in Queens, New York, before joining Manhattan\u2019s Marble Collegiate Church in the 1970s. \nBut Trump did not often attend apart from major occasions like weddings and funerals, according to US Catholic . \nThe president talked about his religious beliefs during his 2016 presidential campaign, saying his own book The Art of the Deal was his \u201csecond favourite book\u201d after the Bible. \nBut some critics have suggested he is not really a practising Christian and was simply talking up his religious credentials to appeal to the many US Christian voters. \nThey have pointed to his vague answers when quizzed on religious matters in more detail. \nStories about him nearly putting cash in a Church communion plate, and referring to the holy wine and bread at Church as \u201cmy little wine\u201d and \u201cmy little cracker\u201d are also often cited. AP:Associated Press Trump has said he is Presbyterian, which is a form of Protestantism Why are people asking if the US president is Jewish? \nPeople have been asking if Donald Trump is Jewish for a number of reasons. \nAmong them is the US president\u2019s strong pro-Israel stance since, especially compared to his predecessor Barack Obama. \nIsrael was one of his first international visits after coming into office, with only Saudi Arabia coming before. \nHe is still yet to visit the UK. \nMost recently, Trump defied convention and advice from America\u2019s global allies to officially recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel . Latest on Donald Trump Why Trump recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital is so controversial HOLY WAR Trump accused of \u2018opening gates of hell' by declaring Jerusalem capital of Israel HOLY WAR Trump is 'declaring war on Muslims' if he recognises Jerusalem as Israel's capital JUST NOT DON Theresa May vows to confront Trump as he declares Jerusalem Israel's capital BOMBS AWAY Cockpit footage shows US jet firing missiles in drills amid 'nuclear war\u2019 fears TRUMP TRAVEL BAN Here's what you need to know about Donald Trump's controversial travel ban \nThe move was a controversial one because the divided city is also claimed by Palestine as its capital, and its status was seen as key to the Middle East peace process. \nThe state of Israel and the pro-Israel lobby in the US were virtually the only ones to celebrate the decision, which was slammed by US allies around the world. \nThe president\u2019s daughter Ivanka also converted to Judaism after marrying Jared Kushner, who was made one of his top advisers. \nAnd Trump has spoken fondly about having three Jewish grandchildren.

This, UDN says leads to illegitimate debts that should not be paid. \nIn June this year, finance minister Matia Kasaija reported that Uganda\u2019s external and domestic debt had hit $8.7 billion (sh28 trillion). \nAccording to Kasaija, the debt burden , which is almost equivalent to this year\u2019s national budget, accounts for 33.8% of the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). \nGovernment debt as a percent of GDP is used by investors to measure a country\u2019s ability to make future payments, and a negative perception can affect the country\u2019s borrowing costs and government bond yields.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "julius kapwepwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matia kasaija", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ngo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donor economic group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyon terms", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto terms", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uganda debt network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uganda revenue authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "udn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uganda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kasaija", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monterrey", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:15.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6bce9bc57ea20a00586fc3019543b935a41249f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLtZqyWX0qjG7B_njk4pFjSTo064N3nfqOQeiHNIKutxh2HOAqztYmq0mWnoSdXEn8b_DmHCtkV7x9ylcC1LEuhT", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript?page=1&sort=newest&pagesize=30&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'javascript' Questions - Page 1 - Stack Overflow", "title": "javascript - enable Vue Devtools inspection in laravel 5.4", "title_full": "javascript - enable Vue Devtools inspection in laravel 5.4 - Stack Overflow", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.044, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a6bce9bc57ea20a00586fc3019543b935a41249f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLtZqyWX0qjG7B_njk4pFjSTo064N3nfqOQeiHNIKutxh2HOAqztYmq0mWnoSdXEn8b_DmHCtkV7x9ylcC1LEuhT", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Yeasir Arafat Majumder", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "javascript - enable Vue Devtools inspection in laravel 5.4", "text": "I want to start using Vue in my laravel 5.4 app. Without laravel i can see vue devtools inspection tab on chrome.

On Monday, the 51-year-old told NW that she can\u2019t remember the last time she took public transport. And this holds true for The Real Housewives Of Melbourne regular Gina Liano and newcomer Sally Bloomfield. The Real Housewives of Melbourne is Arena\u2019s highest-rating program of all time. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging for me because there are a couple I just couldn\u2019t be bothered with. \"If people want to act like schoolkids, I let them go.

Venus Behbahani-Clark joins Real Housewives of Melbourne. And Pettifleur Berenger has showcased her trim, toned and tanned figure ahead of her trip to Cancun, Mexico.

It\u2019s been around a year and a half since The Real Housewives Of Melbourne had filmed a scene together, but that wasn\u2019t a long enough break for some of the ladies. The saying goes: keep your friends close and your enemies closer. The fourth season of The Real Housewives of Melbourne has undergone a cast revamp, with publishing powerhouse Sally Bloomfield joining the series.We are fortunate to overlook beautiful Bondi Beach and have a north facing sun-drenched backyard. She\u2019s the former Real Housewives Of Melbourne star who has not been shy about documenting her body transformation on her social media. The Real Housewives of Melbourne cast Gamble Breaux, Janet Roach, Jackie Gillies, Sally Bloomfield, Lydia Schiavello, Gina Liano, Venus Behbahani-Clark. Breaux says her weight consistently stays within the 50 to 54kg range. Reality content on Arena includes The Real Housewives of Melbourne S4, Vanderpump Rules S6, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills S8 and new series Bethenny & Frederick Flip Manhatten.

Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Sound quality is very good with enough bass that doesn't over power or drown out everything else.

I'm using Google Music mostly to play songs off of so I can adjust the bass using the EQ settings. Bout this over the Anker and JBL because of the overall best bang for the buck value, considering sound and build quality.\nThanks Cambridge SoundWorks for making such a great product available to Canadians without jacking up the price!!\nBelieve it or not it's sometimes hard to get popular US items in Canada without going through some random 3rd party seller who jacks up the price like 10x! stars: 5", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:16.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "054abc70128489dbeaf5011f2ce34e96364c3c99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94orQZ9QJAYI0m5hWg7ndh3JrAAZ4MgDA_4nhRk2HepqOenAFm3z4RL2r2RBdUE._afI2XSejd5ujuOwA85o9VhMKG9ORsMjnjZcdjMr2rgn.uNWef6zgC36MmxcVhNyfqAub7HJc1pn3aB3gj3uCXaKjZcxjy4KxlzHGNSuRTjlmE5jS8Jkg9nw9kkdraFdDePQ--", "site_full": "www.amazon.ca", "site": "amazon.ca", "site_section": "https://www.amazon.ca/Cambridge-SoundWorks-Angle-Bluetooth-Playtime/dp/B01LZV6TYQ/ref=lp_677226011_1_5?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1512600653&sr=1-5", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality &amp; 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker: Amazon.ca: Electronics", "title": "Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality & 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker", "title_full": "Amazon.ca:Customer reviews: Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality & 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker", "published": "2017-04-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "61797de2100a114b11b26236d9b06cb5d7cc4361", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94orQZ9QJAYI0m5hWg7ndh3JrAAZ4MgDA_4nhRk2HepqOenAFm3z4RL2r2RBdUE._afI2XSejd5ujuOwA85o9VhMKG9ORsMjnjZcdjMr2rgn.uNWef6zgC36MmxcVhNyfqAub7HJc1pn3aB3gj3uCXaKjZcxjy4KxlzHGNSuRTjlmE5jS8Jkg9nw.JOQsZEDTGtyQJYvb9znqu", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "Aaron Gomirato", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Received the speaker earlier than I had anticipated.
