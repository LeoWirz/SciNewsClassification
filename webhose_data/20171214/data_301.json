(PA Graphics) \nSpeaking to the Press Association, Captain Jerry Kyd described the commissioning ceremony, being held at the ship\u2019s home base Portsmouth on Thursday, as a \u201cmajor milestone\u201d. \n\u201cBuilding aircraft carriers is not for the fainthearted. There are very few countries who can do this around the world,\u201d he said. \n\u201cSo we should look at our British industry, our designers, all the skills, all the production companies around the country, the shipyards from Devon through to Fife, to the Royal Navy, who have come together to make this happen. A member of the crew adjusts her hat (Andrew Matthews/PA) \n\u201cWe should be really proud as a country. This has been a national endeavour. It has just been fantastic \u2013 it is really a culmination of all our hard work.\u201d \nSet to be the nation\u2019s future flagship, the aircraft carrier can be pressed into action for various tasks such as high intensity war fighting or providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief. \nShe will also serve as a floating military base for the F-35B stealth fighter jets that will launch from the deck of the vessel to undertake missions. Preparations ahead of the commissioning ceremony in Portsmouth (Andrew Matthews/PA) \nCpt Kyd said hosting the Queen and having the monarch step on board for the commissioning ceremony was a \u201ccomplete honour\u201d, adding that she would no doubt be \u201cjustly proud\u201d of the sailors. \n\u201cI think this is the culmination of a number of years of real excitement,\u201d he said when quizzed about the significance of the ceremony in the ship\u2019s life so far. The first sailing from Rosyth was only nine months ago, we have come a long way. \n\u201cThe first entry into Portsmouth was in the summer and here we are today accepting the ship into Her Majesty\u2019s fleet formally. So, it is right at the top, it is the latest milestone, many more to come, but hugely exciting and a very proud day.\u201d \nPressed on what was next for the aircraft carrier after commissioning, Cpt Kyd said it was \u201call about operationalising the ship\u201d, getting her ready to \u201cgo out on the world stage\u201d. (PA Graphics) \n\u201cNext year is all about integrating the aircraft properly, helicopters at the beginning of the year and then we go to the United States to embark the F-35B, the new jet,\u201d he said. \n\u201cAfter that it is more training and we will prepare to go out on our first operational tour in a few years, so it is quite a racy programme. \n\u201cPutting together an aircraft carrier and all its facets and all its bits and pieces is quite a complicated business (but) one we are looking forward to. This (the commissioning) is a major milestone now, it is all systems go really.\u201d \nDuring the ceremony the commissioning warrant will be read and the Blue Ensign, which has been flying from the ship until it is formally handed over to the Royal Navy, will be replaced with the White Ensign. \nThe Queen will also review the first row of the royal guard and will say a few words as Lady sponsor.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "elizabeth", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "andrew matthews/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry kyd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fife", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white ensign", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gareth fuller/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavin williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cpt kyd", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "blue ensign", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "press association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pa graphics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal navy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosyth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "devon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portsmouth", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:53.126+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40c18f5c92d993750a337fa7fc9658c8fa911dea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbU_PL4nRv.UOtLL7rYSkvl7USQ.CopuJ2NW2VAZTkIRwkmm5q3hcQWZXOiJB8sOICBr9koT9e7b0M6Cy5OYrHjEPFTDF9q8CDtO1OozeYzlhRhw2_Irb9zU-", "site_full": "www.expedia.es", "site": "expedia.es", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.es/Las-Palmas-De-Gran-Canaria-Hoteles.d2117.Guia-Viajes-Hoteles", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "260 Hoteles en Las Palmas de Gran Canaria baratos con Expedia.es", "title": "Hotel Astoria", "title_full": "Hotel Astoria (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Espa\u00f1a) | Expedia.es", "published": "2016-12-21T17:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26131, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "68cce1e89d054d358a1d07372dab93a4f0011834", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbU_PL4nRv.UOtLL7rYSkvl7USQ.CopuJ2NW2VAZTkIRwkmm5q3hcQWZXOiJB8sOICBr9koT9e7b0M6Cy5OYrHjEPFTDF9q8CDtO1OozeYzlhLKNpx6LuM8ZniL8gxXhy5jNiJ.bX.0rvUEeweAfw08g-", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-30T04:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hotellet skulle tj\u00e4na p\u00e5 ett kraftigt uppfr\u00e4schat yttre.

Arlene Foster (Michael Cooper/PA) \nBut it is understood Mrs Foster has no immediate plans to fly to London for talks with Mrs May and any such move would depend on progress in negotiations between the DUP and the Government in London. \nConfederation of British Industry (CBI) president Paul Drechsler underlined businesses\u2019 \u201cimmediate\u201d need for a transition deal, telling the City of London Corporation: \u201cOr 60% of firms with contingency plans will have put these into effect by Easter.

Gambling? Please do. Met the love of your life and are in a rush to get married? No waiting period here. Oh, and enjoy the honeymoon. \nThe Las Vegas Strip was built on fantasy. Escape from laws that make other places seems so button-down and straight. There's a lot to be done in this famous stretch of glitz, lights and hedonism. \nBut whatever you do, don't feed the pigeons. \nThe Clark County Commission passed a law that took effect Nov. 21 stating the feeding of feral pigeons would be a crime _ a misdemeanor with a potential fine of $1,000 or six months in jail. A warning is more likely for a first-time offender, county officials said. \nAs in Clark County, pigeons have been a hotly contested topic for years around the world. Some high-profile bans, such as the one in Venice, Italy, came after the birds were deemed an extreme nuisance because their droppings were damaging historic monuments. Feeding them is banned in London's Trafalgar Square, too. \nOther tourist towns like San Francisco and Los Angeles have a patchwork of laws in place but mostly rely on signs to discourage bird feeders. \nAnd, actually, some places don't mind at all. In Puerto Rico, a scenic area in San Juan includes Parque de las Palomas, a small park that offers refuge for pigeons. Feeding them is OK in New York, too. \nNot so on the Las Vegas Strip. County officials attempted to get an ordinance to control the birds passed in 2012, but that one didn't fly. It was noteworthy, nevertheless, for the specificity it laid out in what kinds of pigeons couldn't be fed _ namely \"the species Columbia livia, also known as the City Pigeons, Rock Doves, Rock Pigeons or Flying Rats.\" \nClark County resident Michelle Stewart took great umbrage at that last term during public comments at a commissioners meeting in November before the ordinance was approved. She mounted a defense for the pigeons, decrying the term \"flying rats.\" The current language simply refers to the birds as \"wild pigeons.\" \nStewart told the commission it wasn't fair to penalize people who wanted to feed pigeons. She wore a T-shirt at the hearing that read \"It's Coo To Be Kind\" and said she had fond memories of giving the birds treats with her grandparents. \n\"I can't imagine not being able to feed the birds,\" she said. \"I could be having the worst day of my life and everything come crashing down but when I get to go feed the birds, that's something that makes my day.\" \nThe hearing didn't bring a lot of people to testify, but the handful of proponents and detractors were passionate. \nKevin McGowan, an ornithologist at Cornell University, said it's not surprising that ordinances such as this get to people's emotions. \nHe said pigeons were brought to the United States as domesticated animals by early settlers from Europe and were treated like chickens and turkeys _ often to be consumed. Some were trained as homing pigeons and the birds even have a history of war service as message carriers. He said there is a relationship between the birds and people that goes back a long way. \n\"We generally like each other,\" he said. \nBut he said ordinances such as the one passed in Clark County help with the nuisance of large flocks congregating and perching on landmarks or damaging buildings with their acidic poop. Pigeons, he said, learn where food sources are and flocks watch each other to see where it's plentiful. That's when the birds gather en masse. \nMcGowan said pigeons are hardy birds that can eat most anything. But while the parents eat junk food, they have a milk source they give their fledglings that allow them to avoid devouring bad food. It's full of nutrients and not empty like a potato chip. \n\"They're reasonably smart birds,\" he said. \"And they've been living in cities for a long time and have learned to be open to a lot of different foods.\" \nWhile the ordinance covers much of the four-mile stretch of the Las Vegas Strip, it was born largely of trouble brewing beyond the Strip in unincorporated Clark County. \nThe West Flamingo Senior Center _ a couple of miles west of the Strip _ had become somewhat of an epicenter for perched pigeons. County Commission Chairman Steve Sisolak said some spots at the senior center saw six inches of pigeon poop accumulation after years of free feeding. \n\"It was a mess,\" he said. \"They had to clean it with a shovel. It caused the air conditioning unit to break down.\" \nWith the area's triple-digit temperatures in the summer, a malfunctioning air conditioning unit isn't a minor inconvenience either. A surge in solar panels on homes in Las Vegas, according to A Better Day Pigeon Control office manager Danielle Wagner, created a lot of new nesting opportunities for the birds, too. \nOfficials at the Flamingo senior center said the bird flock density could be thick enough to hide portions of the parking lot at times. Some days, it looked as if it were a casting call for a reboot of Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds.\" \nSupporters of the ordinance said it was necessary to keep repair costs down due to bird dropping damage and the potential for the spread of disease. \nSisolak said the Strip wasn't the primary target of the law and the casinos never raised a stink to him about the birds bobbing and pecking about their properties as the ordinance was being considered. \nThat's not to say pigeons don't hang out around the area and its famous properties, however. Good eats for a resourceful bird can be found outside most restaurants and casinos south of Sahara Boulevard on the Las Vegas Strip. \nDave Kanellis, operations manager for Airborne Wildlife Control Service, said the waste from all of those buffets served at casinos are a big food source for pigeons. He said the ordinance likely will help keep the numbers down, but the pigeon population will never likely go the way of the 50-cent shrimp cocktail, either. \n\"All they need is food, water and shelter,\" he said. \"There's plenty of that there.\" \n(c)2017 Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com \nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

I did discover them in time to include on this countdown, and the first to make an appearance is \"You Should Be Loved.\" The song's got a bit of an old-fashioned, yet easygoing vibe to it. I feel like the sentiment of this song is similar to past songs of his, but it's a message he delivers well; it's a quintessential Hunter Hayes song. I also feel like Hunter Hayes is someone we don't hear from a lot lately, at least not as much as a few years ago. But it's good to see he's releasing music, and I guess a new album is on its way? I guess we'll see.\nFavorite lyric:\nI'd never steal you from his arms\nI don't mean him any harm\nBut I can't keep my silence as hard as I try\nAll I'm trying to say is you should be loved. #95: Kiwi - Harry Styles\nHarry Styles's solo music hasn't been my favorite from the One Direction lads, but it isn't bad music either. They seem to be grooming him to be some sort of rock star, which isn't often seen from former boy band members. I didn't really expect this sound from Harry Styles, despite Midnight Memories having some rock-influenced songs. But rock music comes across as believable from Harry, so it makes sense. Anyway, I've yet to hear his album, but I heard him perform \"Kiwi\" on various TV appearances and thought it had a cool sound to it. It's loud and the lyrics are a bit nonsensical, but it's a jamming song that makes for a fun listen.\nFavorite lyric:\nIt's like I paid for it\nI'm gonna pay for this. #94: Beautiful - Walker Hayes\nWalker Hayes has been making music for years now, but I didn't know of him until his 2017 hit \"You Broke Up With Me.\" More on that song later, but I also came across this song \"Beautiful\" and liked it after a first listen. The phrasing in the verses is reminiscent to Sam Hunt's music, but it's got more of a lighthearted feel to it whereas I think Sam has a bit more edge. Anyway, it's a catchy song. The structure is a bit interesting as the chorus is simply the repeated line, \"Baby, why do you have to be so beautiful?\", but the verses have a lot more detail and imagery. I like Walker's delivery of the song, and I find it to be a fun and pleasant song to listen to.\nFavorite lyric:\nI don't think your stomach's supposed to hurt quite like this\nWhen you run into a girl you forgot you missed\nIt's like the space between us only made me numb\nThought I could just see you and be okay, but I'm not okay, girl. #93: Yours - Russell Dickerson\n\"Yours\" was a pretty decent hit for Russell Dickerson, another artist I was unaware of until I came across this song. Although technically released in 2016, it became very popular this past year; I recall seeing it high on the country iTunes chart often. \"Yours\" is, to put it simply, a love song about finally finding the one. I haven't heard any of Russell's other songs, but I like his delivery here. The verses are more restrained, but the song comes alive in the chorus, which is very fitting for the lyrics in those parts of the song and what the song is saying overall. Even though the lyrics aren't the most groundbreaking, it's still nice enough and quite romantic.

Tuesday Dec 5, 2017 at 7:30 AM By Mac Aljancic Times-Reporter sports correspondent \nIn high school, college, and professional athletics, the outcome of all championships are determined entirely on the field of play. \nThe regular season weeds out the pretenders. The post-season then pits worthy qualifiers face-to-face in elimination clashes that end when only the one true champion is left standing. \nThe glaring exception to this format, however, is the beauty pageant of college football. For well over a century, national championships have been awarded through an inexact recipe of performance, perception, and opinions. Teams play completely different schedules and different styles of football throughout the season in their own conference territories. From the results of those thousands of games, a group of humans then make a final decision as to \u201cwho\u2019s the fairest of them all.\u201d \nFor most of the 20th century, human opinion was the sole judge and jury in awarding the crown. In 1968, Associated Press voters declared that 10-0 Ohio State was better than the 11-0 Penn State. In 1978, those voters declared that 11-1 Alabama was better than 11-1 Oklahoma and 12-1 USC. \nThe BCS system arrived in 1998, allowing humans (sometimes with computer help) to anoint two beauty queens to fight for the crown. Often times, multiple teams were deserving of those precious two spots. The 2003 BCS system chose 12-1 Oklahoma (which lost their conference championship game 35-7) for the championship dance spot over 12-1 USC. In 2007, 12-1 Florida crushed undefeated Ohio State for the crown. But prior to that game, many felt that 12-1 Michigan was more worthy of a championship bid than the Gators. \nIn 2014, that legendary Dr. Pepper vendor, Larry Culpepper, invented the current four-team playoff, which has been an enormous hit. Champions have been decided more on the ball field and less in the ballot box. But unfortunately, in each year has had a fifth or sixth team feeling it was snubbed.' \nThe Buckeyes have been on both sides of the coin for all four years of the current format. The 2014 squad suffered an ugly opening-game home loss to Virginia Tech, and looked to be on the outs. But a 59-0 romp over Wisconsin in the Big Ten championship game jumped 12-1 OSU to the No. 4 spot, just ahead of the Big 12 co-champions, 11-1 Baylor and 11-1 TCU. \nThe powerful 2015 Buckeyes lost their only game on the final play in Week 11 to Michigan State. The Spartans, along with Alabama and Oklahoma, all made the playoffs with both one loss and a conference championship trophy. Ohio State actually finished No. 7 on Selection Sunday behind 12-1 Iowa and 11-2 PAC-12 champ Stanford. But in an eye test, OSU was surely a top-four team. \nLast year, the Buckeyes sole loss at Penn State cost them a chance at a Big Ten Championship. But the playoff committee set a precedent by making OSU the first non-conference champion to earn a playoff berth, due to their strong resume of wins. The two-loss Nittany Lions felt that their Big Ten title and head-to-head win should have trumped the Buckeyes. \nLast year\u2019s precedent came back to bite this year\u2019s Ohio State team in the butt. Did 11-1 Alabama, which did not make the SEC championship game, deserve to be chosen for the No. 4 spot over the 11-2 Big Ten champion Buckeyes? I believe part of that decision was due to the bias towards the \"mystique\" of Nick Saban\u2019s dynasty that has won four national titles in the last eight years. However, I regretfully have to agree with the committee\u2019s choice. \nOhio State\u2019s 31-point loss in November to a 7-5 Iowa squad, on top of an ugly 31-16 home loss to Oklahoma, made for an ugly scar that was too hard to ignore. Alabama\u2019s schedule lacked the quality wins of OSU. But at the beginning of the season, nobody saw the Crimson Tide\u2019s schedule, which opened against then No. 3 Florida State an included the powers of the SEC West, as a detriment. \nFor Buckeye Nation, the current playoff system giveth and taketh away. But overall, this playoff system has been a blast in comparison to its predecessors. The question is, if four teams is good, would eight teams be great? I\u2019ll explore that topic in an upcoming article.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pepper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mac aljancic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry culpepper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick saban", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "buckeye nation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penn state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crimson tide", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nittany lions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia tech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tcu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "osu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buckeyes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baylor", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:54.056+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ddceec3892b19658e8a783ffbf311306a65dcc4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.JN.aiTOowIminLgFzGBY1RGv_4PksYjbklia97loKIo5x1gsCqx8OTo_U7BrT0K0tidf7Vmb7Mp0I5U4jlJpANTYiGxt3oxYeuEv.6NSk1A--", "site_full": "www.v7n.com", "site": "v7n.com", "site_section": "http://www.v7n.com/forums/webmaster-forums/", "site_categories": ["education", "business"], "section_title": "The Webmaster Forums - Webmaster Forum", "title": "Is Electroconvulsive therapy worth it?", "title_full": "Is Electroconvulsive therapy worth it? - Webmaster Forum", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "http://img.escalatemedia.com//images/v7n_logo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ddceec3892b19658e8a783ffbf311306a65dcc4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.JN.aiTOowIminLgFzGBY1RGv_4PksYjbklia97loKIo5x1gsCqx8OTo_U7BrT0K0tidf7Vmb7Mp0I5U4jlJpANTYiGxt3oxYeuEv.6NSk1A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "littlepup", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Is Electroconvulsive therapy worth it?", "text": "I think you need to rely on the professionals involved in your case.

I could see this doing really well on the charts.\n99. Label : NHT but I ALWAYS forgot that Ayla does country music every time i listen to her music on your list. Nice enjoyable song and she sounds great on it.\n98. Go To Bed Early : NHT. This is alright but not really my thing/style. Brad sounds nice on it though. Hmm hearing the chorus, I think I may have heard this before.\n97. This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things : NHT but have heard OF this. I like the sound/feel of it. I like the beat/music of it which has a fun sound to it and she sounds nice.\n96. You Should Be Loved : Denise would be proud of you for including this on your list. I don\u0092t know/think I heard this, but yeah I totally hear the \u0093old-fashioned, yet easygoing vibe\u0094 you speak of. Wow this reminds me a lot like Keith Urban\u0092s \u0093Blue Ain\u0092t Your Color\u0094 with the sound/vibe. It\u0092s nice and I do like this. Aw yeah and it\u0092s sad we don\u0092t hear too much about Hunter now as we used to in the past.\n95. Kiwi : The first song I know I have heard although still not TOO overly familiar with it. Yeah Harry\u0092s solo music overall isn\u0092t really my thing and this song is an example of that. I didn\u0092t expect this sound either. It\u0092s not really my style but he sounds great on the song and it does suit him so well done to him.\n94. Beautiful : First there\u0092s Hunter Hayes and now there\u0092s Walker Hayes. Wow I never heard of this guy so NHT either. This song has a nice feel sound to it and I do like it on first listen. Interesting on the Sam Hunt comparison. I never would have gotten that comparison on my own.\n93. Yours : NHT or this guy either. But yeah this is a nice sweet romantic song.

In general, I like the vibe of this.\n99. Label : Never heard this before, but I always liked Ayla. The song is okay for me on first listen, and could maybe be a grower. It's great she's been putting out music so consistently.\n98. Go To Bed Early : I actually don't think I heard this, which kind of surprises me. I like the story or concept of it, but I think it's again another grower. I always love the sincerity in Brad's vocals and lyrics though.\n97. This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things : YES I was thinking weeks ago how we probably wouldn't be able to share Taylor's songs in our threads but I'm so glad we can! This is somewhere among my favorite songs from the album, but... I'm not sure exactly how I rank them yet. I agree about the cheeky lyrics and singalong feel of the song. I love that. The bridge is one of my favorites with all the \"Here's to my... \" parts. LOL the \"cackle.\"\n96. You Should Be Loved : om . I know his releases from last year were not included on your list, so I'm SO happy to see this here! You just need to talk to me and you'll know all about his songs. Anyway, I obviously love this. I agree about the throw-back vibe, although I can't figure out the perfect word to describe it. I guess just perfect. I absolutely love the feel of it, his vocals, the lyrics, everything. \"I also feel like Hunter Hayes is someone we don't hear from a lot lately, at least not as much as a few years ago.\" He is here even if award shows or radio stations or whoever don't recognize. He's currently releasing a triology of songs and videos (which YSBL is one of so maybe you already know), and then hopefully an album will come soon. He said it would a long time ago.\n95. Kiwi : I do think the ~rock style suits Harry more than any of the other 1D guys, although I prefer other softer and/or more poppy songs from him still. But I like this and do think it is actually among my favorites from his album.\n94. Beautiful : Never heard of this or him, but I like it on first listen. I totally get the Sam Hunt comparison, and agree with everything you said actually. I look forward to hearing more of him on here.\n93.

Namely, he was the European Commissioner for Regional Policy from September 1999 to March 2004 (Prodi\u2019s Commission) in charge of the EU\u2019s Northern Ireland peace programme. Note that the Good Friday Agreement came into force on 2 December 1999 \u2013 so Barnier was THE EU person in charge of its implementation.\n* Because Barnier deeply understands the Irish problem with all its complexities, he gave the task to deal with this problem to the EU27 deputy chief Brexit negotiator Sabine Weyand. Weyand is one of the EU\u2019s sharpest and most experienced negotiating weapons.\n* Varadkar may have a weak government, however this does not really matter re Brexit because ALL Irish parliamentary parties are UNITED in relation to solving the border problem caused by UK.\n* All 27 EU members plus the European Parliament are UNITED re the Irish problem.\n* The EU27 understand how the borders function and the consequences of the WTO rules, the Good Friday Agreement and the EU legislation. Collectively, they also have huge practical experience with handling of land borders under a wide variety of regimes (ranging from the totally restrictive Iron Curtain to the \u2018invisible\u2019 internal EU borders).\n(2) On the UK side:\n* The UK is the one who UNILATERALLY BREACHED the Good Friday Agreement with Brexit.\n* The UK government (and indeed all British politicians of all political colours) are totally clueless about the very basics of functioning of land borders.\n* The UK\u2019s negotiators (May, Davis) are totally clueless.\n* The UK is very deeply DIVIDED re Brexit along many fault lines.\n* The UK is de facto ruled by the DUPes who were AGAINST the Good Friday Agreement, who got 0.9% of the votes at snap elections (at 68% turnout), who did not even win a majority of the votes in Northern Ireland, who are pro-Brexit (whereas the majority of the people of Northern Ireland are against Brexit) and who are beyond totally clueless about the functioning of the REAL world in general. The DUPes have NO solution for the Irish border. None. Zero. They are just destructively undermining everything, just like they tried to undermine the Good Friday Agreement. Peace in Northern Ireland is NOT in the DUP\u2019s interest.\nThe DUPes ordered May to reject the exit document \u2013 a few hours after May confirmed to the EU27 negotiators that the UK agrees with it. Yet another huge international blunder for the UK.\nWell, the clueless incompetent UK now has a few hours to either sign the exit document as it is or else to propose a \u2018better\u2019 version of the text \u2013 which will of course have to be acceptable (!) to all 27 EU members and to the European Parliament. (I am sure that the DUPes with their excellent expertise will be able to provide wording which is much better than that crap compromise that the top EU negotiators and legal teams came up with.) If the UK fails to do one or the other, the Brexit negotiations will remain stuck in the exit phase until March 2018 and full-scale Brexodus will begin.\nIn the meantime, every time the DUPes open their mouths, they attack the Irish government with blind sinister hatred (blaming the Irish for the holy mess that the DUPes themselves have caused with their Brexit idiocy).\nThe DUPes fail to grasp that the position of the Irish government is the united position of all 27 EU members. So every time the DUPes attack Ireland, they attack and insult 440 million people in 27 countries. Where this time all 27 countries are closely watching every DUP utterance and will act accordingly to protect the collective interests of the EU27.\nWell, every time that the sinister bigoted retro-nationalistic DUPes speak, they boost support for united Ireland across the EU27. Where it was blindingly obvious BEFORE the Brexit referendum that post-Brexit the ONLY viable and workable long-term solution is reunification of Ireland.\nIt is time to end the British occupation of Northern Ireland. The Brits have not been able to solve the Northern Irish problem (which they have themselves caused) in almost a century after sinister partitioning, and the Brits are now undermining peace yet again with Brexit. The Brits are the ones NOT capable of respecting the Good Friday Agreement. Enough.\nUnited Europe for united Ireland!

I could see this doing really well on the charts.\n99. Label : NHT but I ALWAYS forgot that Ayla does country music every time i listen to her music on your list. Nice enjoyable song and she sounds great on it.\n98. Go To Bed Early : NHT. This is alright but not really my thing/style. Brad sounds nice on it though. Hmm hearing the chorus, I think I may have heard this before.\n97. This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things : NHT but have heard OF this. I like the sound/feel of it. I like the beat/music of it which has a fun sound to it and she sounds nice.\n96. You Should Be Loved : Denise would be proud of you for including this on your list. I don\u0092t know/think I heard this, but yeah I totally hear the \u0093old-fashioned, yet easygoing vibe\u0094 you speak of. Wow this reminds me a lot like Keith Urban\u0092s \u0093Blue Ain\u0092t Your Color\u0094 with the sound/vibe. It\u0092s nice and I do like this. Aw yeah and it\u0092s sad we don\u0092t hear too much about Hunter now as we used to in the past.\n95. Kiwi : The first song I know I have heard although still not TOO overly familiar with it. Yeah Harry\u0092s solo music overall isn\u0092t really my thing and this song is an example of that. I didn\u0092t expect this sound either. It\u0092s not really my style but he sounds great on the song and it does suit him so well done to him.\n94. Beautiful : First there\u0092s Hunter Hayes and now there\u0092s Walker Hayes. Wow I never heard of this guy so NHT either. This song has a nice feel sound to it and I do like it on first listen. Interesting on the Sam Hunt comparison. I never would have gotten that comparison on my own.\n93. Yours : NHT or this guy either. But yeah this is a nice sweet romantic song. It\u0092s okay for me but maybe it could grow on me with more listens.\nYeah, 2017 wasn't music's best year.\n100. They went the Spanglish route for this version of the song, but https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXiuVQ-GgA4. I'm glad you think this is a fun and cool song.\n99. Yeah, I don't blame you on forgetting she went the country route. Yay for thinking she sounds great here.\n98. That's fair. At least you think he sounds nice!\n97. Fun sound indeed.\n96. True, but hopefully Denise won't be too disappointed that this song isn't higher on the list. Ooh, I hadn't thought of the \"Blue Ain't Your Color\" comparison, but you're right that it does.\n95. Yup, he sounds great and the style suits him.\n94. I hadn't even noticed there were two Hayes in this set until you pointed it out. Yeah, the Sam Hunt comparison is mainly due to the talk-singing in the verses.\n93. At least you think it could grow on you.\nQuote:\n96. You Should Be Loved : NHT but this has a really sweet sound to it. This subject has been sung about hundreds of times, but Hunter still manages to make the subject sound fresh and catchy. It has a great sound to it.\n95. Kiwi : I have heard some of Harry's solo music, but I don't think I've heard this one yet. His solo music isn't my favorite of the 1D guys (that would probably be Liam or Niall), but this has a cool sound to it. Harry sounds great singing it, as usual, but it's not my favorite thing he's done.\n94. Beautiful : NHT or of this guy. But on first listen, this has a pretty cool sound to it. I can hear the Sam Hunt comparisons you're making, and it definitely works with this song. I wouldn't mind listening to this again.\n93. Yours : NHT or of this guy either. But this has a really sweet sound to it. The subject is another one that's been sung about a million times, but it still sounds great and it is definitely a great wedding song.\n96. I agree with your thoughts.\n95. I prefer Liam and Niall's music too. But yeah, this does have a cool sound to it.\n94. That's great that this is a song you wouldn't mind listening to again.\n93.

In general, I like the vibe of this.\n99. Label : Never heard this before, but I always liked Ayla. The song is okay for me on first listen, and could maybe be a grower.

I like the story or concept of it, but I think it's again another grower. I always love the sincerity in Brad's vocals and lyrics though.\n97. This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things : YES I was thinking weeks ago how we probably wouldn't be able to share Taylor's songs in our threads but I'm so glad we can! This is somewhere among my favorite songs from the album, but... I'm not sure exactly how I rank them yet. I agree about the cheeky lyrics and singalong feel of the song. I love that. The bridge is one of my favorites with all the \"Here's to my... \" parts. LOL the \"cackle.\"\n96. You Should Be Loved : om . I know his releases from last year were not included on your list, so I'm SO happy to see this here! You just need to talk to me and you'll know all about his songs. Anyway, I obviously love this. I agree about the throw-back vibe, although I can't figure out the perfect word to describe it. I guess just perfect. I absolutely love the feel of it, his vocals, the lyrics, everything. \"I also feel like Hunter Hayes is someone we don't hear from a lot lately, at least not as much as a few years ago.\" He is here even if award shows or radio stations or whoever don't recognize. He's currently releasing a triology of songs and videos (which YSBL is one of so maybe you already know), and then hopefully an album will come soon. He said it would a long time ago.\n95. Kiwi : I do think the ~rock style suits Harry more than any of the other 1D guys, although I prefer other softer and/or more poppy songs from him still. But I like this and do think it is actually among my favorites from his album.\n94. Beautiful : Never heard of this or him, but I like it on first listen. I totally get the Sam Hunt comparison, and agree with everything you said actually. I look forward to hearing more of him on here.\n93. Yours : I never heard this one before either, but I'm enjoying it here. I love the sentiment and romance of it.\nSuch a beautiful page topper.\nHi, Denise!\nI'm glad you like the gif choice.\n100. That's cool you're familiar with the original version. I'm glad you think the Spanglish version works too!\n99. Yeah, it is good she's been able to release music consistently. Fair thoughts about the song too.\n98. Yeah, I can see how this song would be a grower. Agreed about the sincerity of Brad's music too.\n97. Yup, we'll be able to feature reputation songs on our lists. And yay for agreement!\n96. Hunter does appear on the list this year, which I knew you'd be happy about! That's a shame about country radio and award shows neglecting to promote him, but it's good to see he's making music. Hopefully that album comes out soon!\n95. I definitely agree rock suits Harry the best from the 1D guys. That's cool this is one of your favorites on his album.\n94.

A source in the community claimed that the herdsmen who were armed started shooting but the villagers refused to back down and attacked them back. As a result, four herdsmen reportedly lost their lives. The source claimed that the herdsmen returned with soldiers to try and recover their cattle that had scattered as a result of the confrontation. The villagers reportedly fled after the soldiers started firing when they entered the community. The source said:\u201cThe situation created panic and most of the villagers had to escape into the bush. Most of them are yet to return as we speak as they are afraid for their lives.\u201d Irene Ugbo who is the police public relations officer said officers were deployed to the area to maintain peace. She said: \u201cWe have heard about it and right now we have sent men to the area and the area is calm. It is not a bad situation. There are men on ground to make sure nothing happens.
