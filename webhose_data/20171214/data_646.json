(Pt.2: PANE Project and Konstanet) In the past few years, browsing the internet have become the dominant way to uncover some of the most promising cultural organizations and their non-gallery temporary exhibitions. In the second part of this ongoing series, Un/Certain Space Pt.2 presents PANE Project, a free-standing dialog between art pieces and public spaces by Lucia Leuci and Konstanet, a scaled-down white cube by Keiu Krikmann and Epp \u00d5lek\u00f5rs. ~~~ \nPANE PROJECT \nWhat was the initial inspiration to start PANE project? \nI wanted to organize exhibitions in unusual spaces in Milan, places which are normally designated to different functions than the artistic one. The project is also questioning the preconceived gallery\u2019s role, intended in the technical sense of private, commercial space, inserted into a system with very specific rules. PANE is meant to create a bridge between the \u201creal\u201d world of everyday life and the artists themselves, without too many mediations. Another relevant aspect is the exchange, of personal relationships and networks: I think this is better deployed in a different place, then the gallery space. KELLY BAR, Michele Gabriele \u201cm-lnx2015\u2033 (pink/pussy & blue/mood) , 2015 \u2013 Mixed plastic materials, oil paint \nOn what principles do you choose the artists for each exhibition? \nOn my curiosity, simply: my interest gives birth to other interests. I choose the artists on the basis of the single project proposed for the exhibition space, there is no choice limit. There is no doubt, that for the nature of PANE project, there also has to be a perfect feeling with people who are taking part to the exhibitions. The most engaging process is managing to create relations among the invited artists, who have the possibility to confront themselves with the others, thus opening a dialogue. A characteristic of PANE project is to ask for a visual contribution also to different professional figures such as curators, chefs, architects, to name a few. And then I\u2019m extremely interested in portfolio I receive. I think is wrong to institutionalize the exclusion a priori of someone, who proposes an original research. If it is a really convincing work, why not exhibiting it? \nPANE Project does not have a fixed gallery space but, it is rather an online platform to display exhibitions that explore several context potentialities of non-art spaces. In your opinion, what is the importance of questioning the economic and institutional paradigms of the current art scene? \nI never thought to contacting a sponsor, even if \u2013 of course \u2013 a lot of people involved (working in the art field and not) and the spaces owners support us. Anyway the reality of art projects has an enormous potential of diffusion of visions and ideas, and akin brands should totally keep an eye on us. KELLY BAR Rosa Ciano \u201cReady for the fog\u201d , 2015 \nYou also published a zine on the occasion of \u2018Bubble Tea\u2019 group exhibition. Please tell us about your interest in independent publishing. Is it something you intend to keep doing \u2013 releasing new physical publications with your upcoming projects? \nOf course, I\u2019ll create a fanzine for every episode, and some projects will be dedicated exclusively to that. I\u2019m really interested in the independent publishing as a spontaneous act, and willing to left a mark as an artist. Publishing on his own is always admirable. It is so cool when you go to an exhibition and you can bring home the catalogue. I have a nice collection at my place. When I was talking about \u201cexchange and collaboration among artists\u201d I was referring also to this: which better context than a publication to compare oneself to the work of other artists and curators? The fanzines have been published in high resolution, online, and so they can be printed by anyone on the paper they prefer. It is a democratic act of free press. KELLY BAR Bruno Zhu \u201cBest Wishes\u201d , 2016 \nWhat were the main challenges you encountered with PANE project so far? \nI don\u2019t think in art there necessarily have to be challenges, in order to face new projects. The artist can perfectly lead his own research with calm and sense of reality. Anyway, to answer your question, maybe some problem arises when an unusual location is chosen (a butchery, or a Chinese coffe shop) to organize an event/exhibition and install the new works, during the opening hours. When you go beyond the first reticences, all the site managers are surprised and happy to see how much people is participating. Normally we have an huge number of people at our openings. This is very satisfying and gives us the measure of the amount of work we had done and of the strong collaboration to set up the exhibition. BUBBLE TEA, Lucia Leuci \u201cBirth\u201d , 2016 \nWhat are you working on at the moment? \nIn this moment I\u2019m working at a project linked to video tutorials. Organizing an online project is not that different from setting up a publication. A tutorial is a tool, beyond its objective of explaining something, it talks about aesthetics in the most complete sense I know. \nAnd could you tell us about how is the future programming going to be like? \nI want to organize a big collective show in an hair saloon. It is managed by a crew of beautiful Nigerian girls, very nice, even though at the moment we are facing some small technical issues, but that\u2019s normal. I am certain that the project will be realized. Pretty soon. BUBBLE TEA, Giulio Scalisi \u201cLet the Nymphs of the forest tell you\u2026\u201d , 2016 \nI have to ask you about the word \u201cPANE\u201d, what\u2019s its meaning and how would you relate it to your exhibitions? \nPANE is the Italian translation of \u2018bread\u2019. The bread, in almost every culture, is the basic food, the most essential of our daily life. I thought it was the perfect blessing for the project. BUBBLE TEA, Paul Barsch \u201cThe wooden clogs ended up in smoke\u201d , 2016 MIRANDA Monia Ben Hamouda, \u201cI\u2019m Just Trying to Love You (Racoon)\u201d , 2017 \nKONSTANET \nWhat originally prompted you to start Konstanet? \nThe initial idea had a lot to do with wanting to create a space that would allow young artists to experiment with physical space, while also allowing for a more layered online presentation. And, obviously, we were also inspired by many artists we really wanted to work with. \nHow does the scaled (1:5) condition of the space influence the artists and their installations? \nThe way Konstanet was set up until recently \u2013 we had an online space at konstanet.com and a physical space, a scaled white cube in our studio \u2013 allowed to perhaps level the playing field for young artists to an extent. Documentation plays such a huge part in circulating art and often the photos and the actual exhibition look quite different, so it\u2019s definitely a game of illusions. So we thought why not amplify this effect and rig the game a bit. The scaled space allowed us and our artists to create images that don\u2019t really look much different than those of big institutional shows but could also be really confusing for people to look at \u2013 is this a life size exhibition? how much post-production is involved? is it a 3D model? is at least some of it real? how much of it is real? But as for the process of installing and documenting the exhibitions \u2013 of course there were limitations too, the scaled space was sometimes quite tricky to work with, it took a while to figure out what works and what doesn\u2019t. Maximilian Schmoetzer A Rare Bird in Estonia , 2016 Michele Gabriele They are standing there, under the weather, totally waterproof or completely wet , 2015 \nWhich criteria do you follow in order to select the artists you work with? \nThere\u2019s really no set criteria. When we had the two-space setup, we usually thought how and to what extent they could make use of both of the spaces, although it was never a requirement that they had to simultaneously produce online and offline works, that is a lot to ask from one person anyway, people\u2019s skill sets are different. So it\u2019s more an intuitive process \u2013 we work with people whose work we\u2019re curious about. Daria Melnikova, EX-UVIA , 2016 \nWhat obstacles do you usually encounter in the setting up of each exhibition? \nAs we mentioned previously, the scaled space does have its limitations \u2013 but in general it\u2019s not that different from the obstacles that appear when setting up exhibitions anywhere else. \nIt is imperative to not associate Konstanet with issues about the relationship between the digital and the material. How do you relate these different realms into a final outcome? \nWith each project we tried to find a solution that would suit the particular artist and their work best \u2013 we were always open to people using our spaces how they felt would benefit their work the most. Ideally we would have online elements alongside the physical installation or vice versa, but, for example, if the artist really works only with sculpture it wouldn\u2019t make sense to start making up online content just for the sake of it \u2013 the material and immaterial should come together organically. Ella Goerner Sustainability & Opportunities , 2014 Rene M\u00e4e, Norman Orro Xenotica , 2013 \nHow do you envision the future of art documentation? \nStrictly speaking documentation will probably keep its significance as it has now and has also been historically. Maybe it would be even more interesting to think about the situations when documentation becomes a work of art its own or even perhaps even an interactive game \u2013 could it still be part of the artwork or become more of an appendix or introduction to it. \nWhat are your next aspirations for Konstanet? \nA few months ago we moved out of our studio and demolished our physical scaled space in the process, so currently Konstanet is an online project space.

One men's team and one women's team will get that opportunity. \nWith two days left of round-robin play, the playoff picture is getting a little clearer as teams are slowly being eliminated from contention.\nKevin Koe's team out of Calgary is the first to earn a spot in the playoffs. They did so Wednesday afternoon by defeating John Epping 6-4.\nLIVE BLOG: Canadian curling trials Carey gets emotional win after death of her grandfather \n\"Our first goal is done. Obviously that's great,\" Koe said. \"Now we just have to get hot on the weekend.\"\nKoe's team is undefeated through six games. He's the only unbeaten men's team left at the trials. \n\"I'm feeling good and felt really good out there today,\" Koe said after Wednesday's win.\n\"It's the biggest event and you have to do everything you can to get ready. I'm throwing with a lot of confidence out there right now.\"\nKoe needs just one more win to earn a spot directly into Sunday's final, something he says is crucial.\n\"It's one less chance you have to step out there and possibly lose,\" he said. \"And it's always a little reassuring to start with the hammer.\"\nBrad Gushue defeated Mike McEwen 8-3 Wednesday night to run his record to 4-2. McEwen dropped to 4-2.\nGushue has now won two games in a row and three out of his last four.\n\nTaking time for the fans, as always. @TeamGushue signing autographs after their 4th win at the Trials. #cbccurl pic.twitter.com/DPwILoY5HY \n\u2014 @Devin_Heroux \"I'd feel better if we were in Koe's spot but we're moving in the right direction,\" Gushue said. \"We're getting more confident as the week goes on.\"\n\"I thought there would be a logjam up front with ourselves, Jacobs, McEwen, Koe and Carruthers.\"\nAfter Gushue and McEwen there are a bunch of teams still trying to find a way into the playoffs.\nBrad Jacobs, Reid Carruthers and Brendan Bottcher are still alive, sitting with three losses. Four losses is mathematically still in the playoff picture (but it's a long shot).\nWomen's side still up for grabs There's only one women's undefeated team left at the trials.\nChelsea Carey won an emotional game Wednesday afternoon over reigning Olympic champion Jennifer Jones 7-5 to remain perfect at 5-0.\nChelsea Carey remains undefeated after victory over Jennifer Jones 0:59\nOn Saturday, as the trials were beginning, Carey's grandfather died. The funeral was held in Winnipeg just hours before her game against Jones in Ottawa.\n\"I told my mom before the game he was in my heart today,\" Carey said. \"He was an amazing man. He was the kindest, most gentle soul I've maybe ever met.\"\nCarey's third, Cathy Overton-Clapham, has won five Scotties championships but never an Olympic berth. She says the key to success at big bonspiels starts with a confident skip.\n\"One of the biggest things is your skip reading the ice and playing well,\" Overton-Clapham said. \"And when I've won championships that's always been the case. I think Chelsea has a great handle on draw weight.\"\nIn the night draw on Wednesday, Rachel Homan made a heart stopping double to score four in the tenth end to defeat Casey Scheiddeger 10-7 and earn a fifth win.\nAfter the shot Homan, who normally holds back her emotion, waved her arms to the crowd as they erupted in cheers.\n\"It was a battle and making that last one was all of our emotions coming out,\" she said. \"That was amazing. It was so awesome to have everyone here. It was fun to play and fun to make that last shot.\"\n\nShe did it! And the place goes crazy. @TeamHoman wins a thriller over Scheidegger for 5th win. #cbccurl pic.twitter.com/wlMuyyAHkW \n\u2014 @Devin_Heroux With the win, Homan is tied with Jennifer Jones for second with a record of 5-1.\nKrista McCarville's team is still alive and in the playoff hunt after stealing two in the 10th end and defeating Allison Flaxey 8-7. At 3-2, McCarville has a massive upcoming game against Jones Thursday afternoon.\nIt sets up a dramatic Thursday of curling at the Olympic trials in Ottawa.\nThe top three teams on the men's and women's side advance to the playoffs. The first-place team goes directly into the finals on Sunday. The second and third-place teams play in the semifinals on Saturday to determine who will move onto the final.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mcewen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachel homan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "casey scheiddeger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacobs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krista mccarville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea carey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike mcewen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad jacobs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reid carruthers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "overton-clapham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccarville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scheidegger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brendan bottcher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin koe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad gushe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cathy overton-clapham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john epping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carruthers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "homan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allison flaxey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gushue", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ottawa ottawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ottawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winnipeg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calgary", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:34.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "89231f9f8f356941c6e43fec8aa61c2f23427168", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuYQ9wS2Ww9NhsqNO34UAo.2sTqkns3wJdYiBdoYa6TcI1LVTaSHfqZ7hkI8Utv250-", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html?page=9&sort=newest&pagesize=15&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'html' Questions - Page 9 - Stack Overflow", "title": "html - URL prefill not working on website", "title_full": "html - URL prefill not working on website - Stack Overflow", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "89231f9f8f356941c6e43fec8aa61c2f23427168", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuYQ9wS2Ww9NhsqNO34UAo.2sTqkns3wJdYiBdoYa6TcI1LVTaSHfqZ7hkI8Utv250-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "funkedelic_bob", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "html - URL prefill not working on website", "text": "I have an extension that embeds into Amazon called RevSeller.

All eyes on the US ADP jobs. \nThe AUD/USD pair extended the Asian sell-off into mid-Europe and went on to hit fresh six-month lows of 0.7521, in response to a broadly higher US dollar and weaker Aus fundamentals. \nAUD/USD on track for second straight weekly loss \nThe Australian dollar remains heavily offered against its American counterpart, mainly driven by downbeat Australian macro news, after weaker trade data added to the recent softer Q3 GDP release. \nThe Australian trade surplus narrowed to AUD 105 million in October from the September figure of AUD 1604 million, while the Q3 growth numbers showed that the economy expanded by 0.6% versus a 0.9% increase seen in Q2 and 0.7% expected. \nAdditionally, the US tax reform progress driven ongoing rally in the US dollar also collaborated to the sell-off in the Aussie alongside falling gold prices. Gold prices on Comex drop -0.60% to $ 1259 levels. \nIvan Delgado, Chief Editor at FXStreet noted: \u201cLooking at the state of valuations, from a daily perspective, the depressed levels in the Aus vs US 10yr yield spread, last at 0.175%, somehow justifies that sentiment towards the Australian Dollar dissipated. The yield curve between the two countries, however, is far from supporting sustained losses, as it holds around the 0% (when discounting the 10y-2y); that said, it is starting to retreat, having broken the last base, which may increase the interest to sell on rallies.\u201d \nMarkets now eagerly await the US unemployment claims data and sentiment on the Wall Street for fresh impetus on the prices. \nAUD/USD Preferred Strategy \nJim Langlands at FX Charts writes: \u201cTrading from the short side continues to be the plan ahead of next week when the Fed is expected to hike rates. I, therefore, suspect that further upside for the Aud will be limited and selling into rallies is still preferred.\u201d \n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

SBD going up like crazy? \nWell, I thought Steem would go to 12 USD in value. At least that is what I got from the three pigs, a bucket and some truffels. As you may remember. And with Steem closing in on 2 USD, this might be the breaktrough many have been hoping for. Anything seems possible right now in the Cryptos realm! As I thought BCH would become less then 10% of the value of BTC. Seems even towards less now SegWit gets adopted by more services and the Lightspeed network did its magic already. Mining numbers and figures already showed that it was a matter of time before BCH would go down. Guess their putsch can be called a fail. The overall market cap of Cryptos is going crazy, and it looks like it is going through the half a trillion ceiling before the end of 2017! This is beyond imagination... \nAnd this is also great for Steem Backed Dollar and Steem. Because a bigger growth in market cap would also move some investments towards Steem. Could it already make it to the 12 USD that keeps echoing in my mind? The timing for the Smart Media Tokens {SMT} might just be as good as the timing for Steem as a Social Media Platform on a blockchain itself. And if you are reading this and did not become a blockchain member yet, then this is the time to jump on the bankwagon. Because your one account will grant to acces to many awesome applications that are build on Steem. Like Steepshot, the Insta that can make you earn Cryptos, just like SteemIt dot com and many others. This year, 2017 has become indeed the year for the Blockchain breakthrough! And 2018 will be the year where Cryptos go mainstream. And I so do hope that the Steem developers get the SMTs out in very early new year. It is going to be a game changer! A trillion USD market. \nOr maybe more, if the Cryptos get mainstream attention it will trigger a bigger attraction. And what greater way to get into Cryptos if you can earn them by creating content that gets valued by curation. Guess what platform is best suited for that? And I can tell you from my own experience that I was able to pluck my Fruit Of Work a while ago, of being active at Steem for more than a year. Even before all those awesome apps got build on the Steem blockchain. Now slowly building up again my Steem Power again. With a great new opportunity coming with the Smart Media Tokens this will mean new ways to earn Cryptos as Tokens on the Steem platform, in the same way as SBD and SP now. Imagine SteepShot or Zappl having their own Smart Media Token, for their own App? And you can trade them on the internal decentralized market? Or D.Tube, dAudio all having their own SMT and the Cryptos market get hundreds of billions in for investments. \nSteem van handle it, where some kitties hype cause congestion on the Ethereum blockchain, Steem would not break a single sweat drop. Sp bring it on that Steemy Pussies app! My better half told me though that this might not be a realy good thought out name for it... Do not see the problem, as long as it gets people in. She stated that it would be probably mostly males and they would be disappointed, okay but that is not the point I've been trying to make here... The fact that the Steem blockchain can handle a million transactions a day, with ease, makes it more than perfect to have run all kinds of apps on its blockchain. Even things like CyberCreatures , you remember the game Creatures? Make it a 2D HTML5 browser game, use WASM, now that would get some users to Steem, you bet ya! Alright, Steemy Pussies might be considered a bad name as it might suggest some adult funny stuff going about, so maybe CryptoCreatures or something like that is a better choice. Would at least know a few that are not yet on Steem that would do so in a jiffy! Great times ahead. \nThe Crypto days are coming ! Yes, it is a reference to the Holidays are coming, just like Sa To Shi is coming to town . Yet it is true, these are the days of the blockchain and when you got in on Steem, than you got in on time. And if you understand what great impact the Smart Media Tokens are going to have in early 2018 and beyond, than you know you can still get in on Steem. (Yes, another play with words: I got in on Time -> I got in on Steem, it is what I do, they do not always work out the way I want though.) Remember, one Steem blockchain membership gets you unlimited acces to an ever growing amount of applications, with one that suites you best and that way could earn you some Cryptos. Even more so in 2018 when the Smart Media Tokens come to the Steem platform. These are exciting times and the get more wild by the day! May the Cryptos be with us! \nYes, I still believe in Steem going towards 12 USD...

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, speaking immediately after Trump\u2019s announcement, delivered criticism couched in diplomatic terms, saying he was \u201cagainst any unilateral measures that would jeopardize the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians.\u201d\u201cJerusalem is a final status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties on the basis of the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, taking into account the legitimate concerns of both the Palestinian and the Israeli sides,\u201d Guterres added. Trump invoked the a 1995 law passed by US Congress calling for moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, to justify fulfilling his campaign promise. As he pointed out, his three predecessors, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, issued waivers putting the law on hold but he was now following the intent of the Congress. While nations and leaders, from China to Pope Francis criticised Trump\u2019s decision and even US allies have refused to follow Washington\u2019s lead on moving embassies to Jerusalem, there was no noticeable political opposition in the US from even the Democrats. In the US, politicians are loath to be seen as anti-Israel and Trump\u2019s move was a challenge to his domestic critics to make it a major politically issue. Trump\u2019s announcement muddies the diplomatic waters in the Middle East where his son-in-law Jared Kushner is engaged in a so-far unsuccessful peace effort to bring Israel and Palestinians together for a solution to the contentious issue.\u201cThe United States would support a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI intend to do everything in my power to help forge such an agreement.\u201d While declaring that he would ask the State Department to move the embassy to Jerusalem, he added, \u201cThis decision is not intended, in any way, to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement.\u201d\u201cWe are not taking a position of any final status issues, including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, or the resolution of contested borders,\u201d he added. \u201cThose questions are up to the parties involved.\u201d That leaves the room for Israel to have West Jerusalem as its capital, while Palestine has its capital in East Jerusalem, a territory that Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East War, if there is an eventual peace agreement between the two sides. Trump\u2019s announcement is directed towards his domestic base, rather than the world.

But my thoughts do come without the specialist knowledge of many others on here\nCheers\nChris\nPerhaps I should have bolded and italicised the word \"most\".\nAnd, yes, it does indeed imply that the branch train terminates at the junction station. Consultation of timetables will show you that is indeed the usual way even in the many cases (some cited above) where it would have been far more convenient to passengers if there had been through trains. I would suggest that the history of the Bridport branch could have been very different if people had been able to travel directly from Bridport to Dorchester, their most likely destination. But the reality of the steam age railway is that it was optimised for freight operation with the passengers coming a poor second in most locations.\nAgree x 1 Back to top Top", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:36.036+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "247b5b9d56c1888b879f0fe49b8e082e76e01a12", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_I6WqyKS3KtmoKfb5Gu7Nd58obgBFplq4BHYPoSD1Nb6ZHapsTMdr", "site_full": "www.youtube.com", "site": "youtube.com", "site_section": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXtOF5CJPj40m9RyhVkj2KQ", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Paige Secosky - YouTube", "title": "GO CLUBBING WITH ME IN NYC (A NIGHT OUT IN MY LIFE AS A COLLEGE STUDENT VLOG)", "title_full": "GO CLUBBING WITH ME IN NYC (A NIGHT OUT IN MY LIFE AS A COLLEGE STUDENT VLOG)", "published": "2017-11-18T19:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 74, "participants_count": 71, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r_nZCCsxxWs/maxresdefault.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3826616c7d1cafb95834635868233b75abd54323", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_I6WqyKS3KtmoKfb5Gu7Nd58obgBFplq4BHYPoSD1NTPWJGzBbBWEb46Kn2dQRaM-", "ord_in_thread": 74, "author": "karola to ja", "published": "2017-12-07T09:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Goals everywhere", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:36.037+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "005c97152e04477191a8bffc19475b13538a27b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQXPtxbFYR0UQNA59BNXe.fo_Otg68x6PMyC0gSS8C1pGMpVYcUUdDNILgWSn6bGcbsvcIUT3Jx1jGeuqkGZyWppjFZnBvThjY-", "site_full": "talk.newagtalk.com", "site": "newagtalk.com", "site_section": "https://talk.newagtalk.com/forums/forum-view.asp?fid=14", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Viewing a forum - AgTalk Cafe", "title": "Putting Farm into a LLC", "title_full": "Viewing a thread - Putting Farm into a LLC", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.995, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 61838, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "005c97152e04477191a8bffc19475b13538a27b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQXPtxbFYR0UQNA59BNXe.fo_Otg68x6PMyC0gSS8C1pGMpVYcUUdDNILgWSn6bGcbsvcIUT3Jx1jGeuqkGZyWppjFZnBvThjY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brandon SWIA", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Putting Farm into a LLC", "text": "And they will also sue you personally and since you own the llc's, all the assets will be bunched together.

They lived in Williamsburg before moving to Toronto nearly four years ago. Credit Robert Wright for The New York Times Alison and Adam Sadel met in 2011 at the Equinox health club in Grand Central Terminal, where she worked and he was a member. They later moved in together, living with two roommates in a rental building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\nNearly four years ago, Equinox transferred Ms. Sadel, then Alison Hornstein, to Toronto, as the company was expanding in Canada. She rented a one-bedroom in a new condominium tower downtown, with a den, balcony, washer-dryer and two bathrooms. Mr. Sadel soon followed, finding a job in property management there.\nPhoto The Sadels signed a two-year lease on an apartment with an open kitchen in a new 40-story tower. Credit Robert Wright for The New York Times Last winter, however, they decided it was time to return to New York. Mr. Sadel, now 32, took a job in Manhattan as a broker for Park River Properties, which specializes in condo conversions. The couple knew that Ms. Sadel, an account executive at Equinox, would be able to transfer back to New York, though it was unclear exactly where she would be based. So Mr. Sadel lived with his parents in northern New Jersey while he looked for a one-bedroom and she wrapped up things in Canada.\n\u201cIt had been my job in Toronto to pick an apartment,\u201d said Ms. Sadel, 29. \u201cAdam moved in sight unseen. Now it was my turn to trust him.\u201d Besides, she had other things to think about: At the time, they were engaged and she was busy planning their wedding at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.\nPhoto The building has views of the waterfront. Credit Robert Wright for The New York Times The Sadels wanted to live in a relatively new building close to their jobs in Manhattan, and hoped to spend about $3,500 a month for a one-bedroom. Mr. Sadel\u2019s priority was a large closet; Ms. Sadel\u2019s was an open kitchen. Two bathrooms, they thought, would be nice, too.\nAdvertisement\n \u201cOnce you have two bathrooms, it\u2019s hard to go back to one,\u201d Mr. Sadel said, though he assumed it was inevitable. \u201cWe were looking for something similar to what we had in Toronto without sacrificing too much.\u201d\nPhoto WILLIAMSBURG The apartment had surround-sound speakers, but the balcony was on a low floor overlooking a busy courtyard where \u201ceveryone could just watch you,\u201d Mr. Sadel said. Credit Robert Wright for The New York Times Mr. Sadel began looking in Brooklyn Heights, where they had friends. But apartments seemed small for the price, and many of the buildings were old. He knew they would find more space in Williamsburg, as well as plenty of buildings built in the last decade or so, as the neighborhood had changed substantially in the few years they had been gone.\n Advertisement\n Mr. Sadel liked Leonard Pointe , built around 2014, where he was drawn to the surround-sound speaker system. But the apartment he saw there overlooked the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, he said, \u201cand you could hear the cars zooming by.\u201d\nPhoto WILLIAMSBURG The building was relatively new, but the apartment overlooked the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Credit Robert Wright for The New York Times Another building, 101 Bedford , which opened in 2012 near McCarren Park, also had an available apartment with surround-sound speakers. It had a balcony as well, which was something they felt they could easily do without, and it was on a low floor overlooking a busy courtyard, with a fishbowl feel, he said, \u201cwhere everyone could just watch you.\u201d\nThen one day last spring, as Mr. Sadel was walking along Kent Avenue, he saw a 40-story tower rising in what looked like a great spot on the waterfront. The building, Level , was not offering showings yet, but he visited the rental office and saw floor plans that showed the desired open kitchen and ample closet space, as well as a washer-dryer.\nPhoto WILLIAMSBURG The building was brand new, the apartment had an open kitchen, and \u201cI felt instantly home,\u201d Ms. Sadel said. Credit Robert Wright for The New York Times When he later visited a one-bedroom there being offered for $3,520 a month, he sent a video to Ms. Sadel in Toronto.\nShe happily gave him the go-ahead. \u201cI wanted it taken care of,\u201d she said. \u201cI trusted him because he has better taste than I do.\u201d\nNewsletter Sign Up Sign Up for the Real Estate Newsletter Every week, get updates on residential real estate news, covering the five boroughs and beyond.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

(About a quarter of the building\u2019s 554 units have been rented so far.)\nAdvertisement\n \u201cI felt instantly home,\u201d Ms. Sadel said. \u201cI was so happy to be back in the city.\u201d\nThe first few weeks they were there, the hallways were covered with plastic floor-protection film, Mr. Sadel said, and \u201cyou could hear people walking on it near your door\u201d \u2014 a crunch that sometimes awakened him.\nIt has since been replaced by carpeting, but the construction continues. Because they are at work during the day, though, they are able to escape the brunt of it, and it is scheduled to be finished in the spring.\nTo his delight, Mr. Sadel realized he could ride the ferry to work, with a quick trip between the North Williamsburg landing and Murray Hill, though it runs less often than the subway.\nMs. Sadel heads to two gyms in the East 50s in Manhattan. She reluctantly gave up her 12-minute walk to work in Toronto, and now uses the crowded Bedford Avenue station, where she takes the L train and transfers uptown.\nThe only other real sacrifice, they said, was the second bathroom \u2014 but then, they expected that. \u201cOur bathroom is a big bathroom,\u201d Ms. Sadel said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not a problem.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "adam", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "alison sadel", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "sadel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equinox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alison hornstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert wright", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam sadel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sadels", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york times continue", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "new york times last", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equinox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "park river properties", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "williamsburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn botanic garden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williamsburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn heights", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:36.056+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d948b2c3f281e84665814ac2d87eeac0f3b14179", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrq..gqyQUPoGCpwfHbZ03BjtQOOoQyuY9IVLEJ1.rv_NA.LnkcVmY8m.cIrPXhzoAksdA0hSaAAnuFvUiAXZiC", "site_full": "bimmersport.co.nz", "site": "bimmersport.co.nz", "site_section": "http://bimmersport.co.nz/forum/12-want-to-buy/", "site_categories": ["vehicles", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Want to buy - bimmersport.co.nz", "title": "E39 HID LEFT FRONT HEADLIGHT", "title_full": "E39 HID LEFT FRONT HEADLIGHT - Want to buy - bimmersport.co.nz", "published": "2017-12-05T16:51:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NZ", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "21cc26fa9785558219a95dacda1f416c34d3494e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrq..gqyQUPoGCpwfHbZ03BjtQOOoQyuY9IVLEJ1.rv_NA.LnkcVmY8m.cIrPXhzoAksdA0hSaAAuYMLTOUHgfjPgYZIZRaKIo-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Gabe79", "published": "2017-12-05T17:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I'd encourage you to watch some videos on fixing the adjuster.

This article is packed with useful information and advice to help you build muscle. Take a few minutes to read over these ideas and apply them to your own efforts.\nRemember that muscles grow during periods of rest, if you are trying to build muscle. So, try limiting your weight training to 2 or 3 days per week with a day of rest in between. On the off days, you could concentrate on doing cardio exercises to give the muscles a break.\nDo not train one day and follow it by another training session the next. Always skip one day between to be sure that your muscles have the time that they need to repair themselves before working out again. If you do not allow them to heal, they are not going to develop as fast as you would like them to, and you could end up hurting yourself.\nDo not train one day and follow it by another training session the next. Always skip one day between to be sure that your muscles have the time that they need to repair themselves before working out again. If you do not allow them to heal, they are not going to develop as fast as you would like them to, and you could end up hurting yourself.\nShort-term use of creatine supplements can help you build muscle with minimal risks. Creatine plays an important role in your body in that it is required to produce ATP, a basic and vital form of energy. Your body cannot function without ATP, and lack of creatine can cause muscle problems. Having a higher level of creatine will enable you to train more intensely, and for a prolonged period of time.\nYou should completely exert yourself when performing weight lifting exercises in order to maximize your muscle gain results. Do this by forcing yourself to keep doing one more repetition until you absolutely cannot. This sends a clear signal to your body that you need more muscle. Remember to get help from a spotter so that you do not suddenly drop the weight when you are finished.\nYou need to know how many calories to eat per day in order to gain the muscle you want to gain. To determine your daily calorie intake you should multiple your weight by 15. mouse click the next page resulting number is the number of calories your body needs to build muscle and burn as much fat as possible.\nIf you cannot get to the gym for some reason, do not skip your workout altogether. You can simply do chin-ups, pushups and dips in your home. Even with all of the fancy equipment at the gym, they still remain the best forms of upper body building that you can do.\nMake sure you\u2019re getting enough calories. There are a number of online calculators to help you calculate what your caloric need is, for how much muscle you hope to build. Once you have determined your caloric needs, you need to make sure that you increase your levels of carbohydrates and proteins in proportion to get the maximum benefit.\nA great tip for growing muscle that is often overlooked is getting an adequate amount of sleep. Your body heals itself and changes while sleeping. Therefore, if you don\u2019t get enough of it, you aren\u2019t allowing your body the chance to do these things. If you are working out hard, aim for at least eight hours of sleep, if not more.\nBecoming huge and buff isn\u2019t necessarily the goal of everyone who weight trains. There are a variety of bodybuilding routines designed to get different results. You need to determine what your goals are before settling on one. If your goal is to gain lots of mass and bulk up, a supplement will probably be required.\n\nAllow yourself to eat some ice cream. Studies have shown that eating one bowl of any type of ice cream that you like about two hours after a workout does some good. It will trigger the surge of insulin in your body better than many other foods will, and it will taste good too!\nWhen lifting weights, you should attempt to end your session with a pump. Studies have demonstrated that your strength and muscle size can be increased by pushing an additional amount of blood into your muscles through a high-rep set after your normal sets. Try ending with a set of twenty reps or even one hundred reps of an isolation exercise.\nOne very important you can do for your weight training program is to keep a training diary. Keep a log of what kind of exercises you do, the amount of weight you are lifting along with any changes. This way you won\u2019t forget your routine and any increases in weight or other changes you have made. Your progress will go forward if you keep track of everything.\nStretching after you do an exercise can be just as important as stretching during a warm-up! Immediately, after you have worked on a muscle group, do a stretch that focuses on that group and hold the stretch position for a good 90 seconds. This will stretch out the fascia (the connective tissue surrounding the muscle) and encourage more muscle growth.\nDon\u2019t be tempted into taking steroids. Steroids work by replacing and overwhelming the naturally-occurring hormones in the body, which can have terrible effects. Steroids can also have a negative effect on your liver, cause breast development in men, and deplete the \u2018good\u2019 cholesterol levels in your body. Steroids also affect the user\u2019s moods in a negative way and can cause breakouts of acne. Highly recommended Online site is not appealing, is it?\nWeight training and cardio routines go together like peanut butter and jelly. Not only do they both work towards the same thing, but they also have a high level of synergy together. This means that including some light running into your routine can have large results in your muscles.\nWhen starting out in muscle development, focus on major lifts initially. Exercises that work out multiple muscle groups should take priority over exercises that target specific groups. Save targeted exercises for later in your workout when you are warmed up and able to focus your energy and attention much better.\nAdding muscle mass can be a challenge if you lack the proper guidance. Most people have the potential to transform their body, but simply need a few tips to get started. Take the ideas and concepts in the article you just read to heart, and you will be amazed by the results you can achieve.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "atp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:37.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "445d2fed462722e94615dc4d771b835b70aa756f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTw6W4s5kEcE5VLQjRlLj1m6ernk1hxAlkePvziH9JQtAmx6i5WpMTk96fDfXi2cTrmcAND9aT.xnJMJgOUH8.Zc00fwVcFiRfT69cSGG8mHcvWi2.ggmDOlzHYYTsPpHzyDLgoyX4BbQ--", "site_full": "margaretgreyes.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://margaretgreyes.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Hurricane-force gusts could cripple battle vs. SoCal wildfires \u2013 Margaret Reyes", "title": "Hurricane-force gusts could cripple battle vs. SoCal wildfires", "title_full": "Hurricane-force gusts could cripple battle vs. SoCal wildfires", "published": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "445d2fed462722e94615dc4d771b835b70aa756f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTw6W4s5kEcE5VLQjRlLj1m6ernk1hxAlkePvziH9JQtAmx6i5WpMTk96fDfXi2cTrmcAND9aT.xnJMJgOUH8.Zc00fwVcFiRfT69cSGG8mHcvWi2.ggmDOlzHYYTsPpHzyDLgoyX4BbQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "margaretgreyes", "published": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hurricane-force gusts could cripple battle vs. SoCal wildfires", "text": "Unprecedented conditions in forecast could leave crews with \u201cno ability to fight fires\u201d\nfrom Home \u2013 CBSNews.com http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-force-gusts-could-cripple-battle-against-southern-california-wildfires/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:37.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c17473cc6e0bb758fa53b57cea0e4907412aa85", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ItQbIV25W.rGDAk..RKh1KHzYsGPl0Mj8qo0laizWeXHTjTKSOvvka1MvRbbHT2nC_RtdTL86VgWEy.PbOTyU", "site_full": "www.idownloadblog.com", "site": "idownloadblog.com", "site_section": "http://www.idownloadblog.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "iDownloadBlog.com", "title": "This tweak ports the iPad Camera app interface to the iPhone", "title_full": "This tweak ports the iPad Camera app interface to the iPhone", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8691, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 0, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c17473cc6e0bb758fa53b57cea0e4907412aa85", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ItQbIV25W.rGDAk..RKh1KHzYsGPl0Mj8qo0laizWeXHTjTKSOvvka1MvRbbHT2nC_RtdTL86VgWEy.PbOTyU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anthony Bouchard", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "This tweak ports the iPad Camera app interface to the iPhone", "text": "0 \nI routinely use the Camera app on both my iPhone and iPad, but between the two, I prefer the look and feel of the Camera interface on the iPad. \nIf you\u2019re in the same boat, then a new free jailbreak tweak called iPad Cam for iPhone (iOS 10) by iOS developer Adel Hammoud might be right up your alley. \nAs shown above, iPad Cam for iPhone transforms your iPhone\u2019s Camera app to look more like the iPad\u2019s by rearranging various elements inside the app. For example, the shutter button, camera mode selector, and zoom slider become relocated to new locations, as do other controls. \nWhile it\u2019s a neat concept to have the iPad-style Camera interface on your iPhone , and I personally prefer it, I\u2019ll be the first to admit that the iPhone\u2019s stock interface feels somewhat more ergonomic. \nWhy? Mostly because the iPad\u2019s interface makes it more awkward to tap on the shutter button, as it\u2019s now located on the right side of the screen rather than at the bottom. On the other hand, I like having the camera mode selector and zoom slider on either side of the screen as opposed to the bottom. \nThe iPad Cam for iPhone tweak might be triggering some serious d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in your mind right now, and that\u2019d be because Hammoud launched another tweak back in September that accomplished the exact opposite purpose: porting the iPhone\u2019s Camera app user interface to the iPad. \nWith both tweaks now available, you can finally get the interface you prefer on all of your devices. Furthermore, neither tweaks have any options to configure, keeping things super simplistic. \niPad Cam for iPhone (iOS 10) is a free download from Cydia\u2019s BigBoss repository and should work on all jailbroken iPhones running iOS 10 . Worthy of note, the tweak has only been tested on Plus-sized (5.5-inch) devices, so stay wary if you\u2019re using anything else. \nDo you prefer the iPad\u2019s Camera app UI over the iPhone\u2019s?

A samurai sword attack, a double murder \u2013 just awful, awful things.\u201d \nOne which really upset her involved a young man who died after being stabbed. She was with his mother as he lay injured in hospital. \n\u201cI remember holding her hand. Her son was being rushed to another hospital to try to save his life. I remember grabbing her hand running out of the room saying, \u2018I\u2019m really, really sorry, you\u2019ve got two seconds, please give your son a kiss, just say goodbye to him now and I\u2019ll take you to the next hospital.'\u201d \nSoon afterwards she confided in her husband that she couldn\u2019t stop crying and shaking. \nI could smell the bodies when I woke up Paul Settle, Retired police officer \nSuzie was suffering from PTSD brought on by the things she had seen on the job. She sought help and is now back at work, but for some the damage is just too great. \nFormer Metropolitan police officer Paul Settle, 44, retired through ill health last month after more than 25 years in the job. He too is suffering from PTSD. \nFor years after some of the horrific incidents he had seen, he was a high-functioning officer on an accelerated promotion scheme. \n\u201cMost of my career was dealing with serious crime and it was not uncommon for me to see things that most people would regard as horrific. I\u2019ve probably dealt with 100 murders,\u201d he says. \nBut eventually things which had happened years before started to haunt him \u2013 an IRA bomb attack in Wood Green, London in 1992 and his work to help identify and repatriate Britons killed in the 2004 Thailand tsunami. \u2018You dread going to sleep\u2019 \n\u201cIt is really difficult to understand because for the best part of 20 years it never affected me, then out of nowhere it started to affect me in a very nasty and intrusive way.\u201d \nHe started to have nightmares where he would wake up feeling the heat from the bomb blast. \n\u201cIn the case of the tsunami, I could smell the bodies when I woke up. It was quite a rapid descent. You begin to dread going to sleep so you stay up later.\u201d \nHe says he initially turned to alcohol to help him get to sleep, but quickly found that made matters worse so sought intensive treatment instead to try to help him overcome debilitating symptoms which he says have reduced him to a shadow of his former self. \nEven after treatment he still finds it hard to go out or be in a crowd. \nSirens and some loud noises can trigger gut wrenching and exhausting episodes of hyper arousal, an intense anxiety which can last for weeks on end. \n\u201cOn two occasions I was preparing to kill myself. But whilst I was at my lowest point I decided I needed to try to make the best of a bad situation. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever recover fully.\u201d \u2018Officer numbers falling\u2019 \nAn FOI request of police forces in England and Wales found officers taking more than a month off has been increasing over the past six years. \nOf the 26 forces which provided the information, all but one had seen a rise in sickness rates increasing from 1,631 in 2010-11 to 2,804 in 2016-17 \u2013 a rise of 72%. \nAt the same time the number of police officers working at those forces dropped by 17%. Across England and Wales police officer numbers are lower than they have been for 20 years according to Home Office data. \nThe Home Office says it recognises the issue and has committed \u00a37.5m to pilot a new welfare support service for police officers. \nThe National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council also said it was working hard to help support officers. \nBut coupled with increasing demands on the emergency services as a result of terrorist attacks and other serious crime, Paul and Suzie both say they feel reduced officer numbers also have a significant part to play in making people ill. \nSuzie said if staffing had been better in her unit, she and colleagues working under her may not have had to deal with so many difficult jobs. \n\u201cThey are having to go to a lot more incidents, a hell of a lot more in such a short space of time without being able to step away and process it in their mind before they go on to something else. \n\u201cIt has had an impact and it will continue to have an impact until officer numbers are increased.\u201d \nTo hear more about this story, tune into 5 live Investigates on 3 December at 11:00 BST or listen to the podcast. \nHave you got something you want investigating?

The old record, done behind a speedboat instead of a sailing yacht was standing for over four years. Tow Up The attempt was engineered to perfection prior to the attempt. More than 500 meters of line was dragged behind the boat, where Jacobsen connected himself too. The speed of Team Brunel took care of the actual lift.

The Erebus was one of two ill-fated ships of the Franklin Expedition that was abandoned in the Arctic in April 1848. \nIn addition to Noon\u2019s help the students would also be meeting with members from the Surf\u2013rider Foundation. \nThe Foundation is a non-profit environmental organization that works to protect and preserve the world\u2019s oceans, waves and beaches by organizing clean ups. \nKoller said the students would participate in a beach clean-up with the group. After, he said, the organization would analyze the garbage, weigh it and do a report, letting them know where the garbage came from and more. \nFinally on the last day, the group would visit the Nuyumbalees Cultural Centre which features the We Wai Kai Nation that can trace its history back to 1792 when they first made contact with Europeans. \nKoller noted that to date he had yet to discuss the trip with the students, as it required board approval. \nCaptain Jeff Koller assured the board that \nPillar Rock was actually safer than usual ships as it was coast guard certified. \nThey noted that the company was willing to purchase personal flotation devices for PLRD students that would only ever be used for this and any other potential trips should other schools choose to also offer the experience up. \n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to some kids in my class,\u201d Koller said. \n\u201cOut of eight, six have never been out of Alberta, four not out of Central Alberta,\u201d he noted. \nSuperintendent Cam McKeage formulated the idea according to Koller after remarking on a similar trip to Pillar Rock. \n\u201cThe whole idea is to give students an experience,\u201d McKeage agreed. \n\u201cA lot of students don\u2019t leave their home community. This is a fantastic experience. They have woven CTS educational (components) in.\u201d \nChair Holli Smith recommended that Koller present McKeage with a formal trip proposal to be presented to the board at their next meeting. \nJIrwin@postmedia.com ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hanna herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackie irwin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mckeage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holli smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff koller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilfred laurier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cam mckeage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott koller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill noon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "prairie land regional division", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canadian coast guard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heritage bay inn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plrd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wai kai nation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calgary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central alberta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arctic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "campbell river", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:39.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ecec0e459f80f61d6ef292d50cd51e254ca11bb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQrhEv5cMr0GHD1RQFtyJ9lfYLiSLQtHvYjS2ug3aTQrgi5MLuUPD3JLmB.UDailG4ysN3nDCq1M4OsEP.grL6T.G1IY8am40ab5vyB2Em9pA--", "site_full": "travelwirenews.com", "site": "travelwirenews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "House calls for sanctions on Myanmar security forces | TravelWireNews", "title_full": "House calls for sanctions on Myanmar security forces | TravelWireNews", "published": "2017-12-07T10:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.14, "main_image": "https://i0.wp.com/travelwirenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GulfNews.png?fit=540%2C280&#038;ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ecec0e459f80f61d6ef292d50cd51e254ca11bb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQrhEv5cMr0GHD1RQFtyJ9lfYLiSLQtHvYjS2ug3aTQrgi5MLuUPD3JLmB.UDailG4ysN3nDCq1M4OsEP.grL6T.G1IY8am40ab5vyB2Em9pA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "House calls for sanctions on Myanmar security forces | TravelWireNews", "text": "Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

The neighborhood around Granville Cottage is called the Forest of Riverview because when they developed the subdivision they built the homes among the mature trees. Our small lot has over nine trees. All the streets are tree-lined. So Saturday and Sunday was a flourish of leaf-gathering and yard-tending. \nI\u2019m leaving before dawn for my commute to Bethel in Jackson and arriving back home after dark these days while we are waiting for the house-sale to close. Last night I made a few phone calls on the way home enjoyed some Christmas music. Lois called to remind me to pick up some corn chips to go with a black bean and corn soup she had made for dinner. I stopped by the European Market for them and spent a couple minutes encouraging the woman who waited on me. She was burdened about her young daughter. I listened and encouraged her to connect with a local church. \nWhen I finally pulled into the Forest of Riverview I realized that the neighbors all around me had been doing more than yard work on the golden, sunny weekend\u2026 Many of them were getting their Christmas lights and displays into place. I instinctively slowed down to enjoy the beautiful sight and remembered with a bittersweet pang the sound of eight children in the car sing-songing \u201cOoooh-Ahhhh.\u201d With the memory my heart was tender again with the beauty of Christmas.\n\u201cGod,\u201d I thought, \u201cMake yourself known to the families that live in these homes, that the light of faith would glow in every hearth all through the year and the people would know the Christ of Christmas.\u201d\nAs I walked into Granville Cottage Lois was busy with dinner and Hazard greeted me with his usual enthusiasm and I was freshly aware of how much our lives have been graced by the presence of Christ incarnate. \nKen Pierpont\nGranville Cottage \nRiverview, Michigan\nDecember 2017 \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ken pierpont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "granville cottage  riverview", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "granville cottage lois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bethel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riverview", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "granville cottage", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:40.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c25369000e2656992e740a4d0f739dee1b8598b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_YxMZS96Uj43IgBlrEvujYHyjntptf5EGM5qaAw3oOrywsBtWw3uJkEXkrCYFZqiYTb2emSrQytu85WwrEue2x", "site_full": "www.funnyjunk.com", "site": "funnyjunk.com", "site_section": "http://funnyjunk.com/rss/latest_funny_pictures.rss", "site_categories": ["entertainment"], "section_title": "FunnyJunk Latest Pictures", "title": "Oh dis ain't good", "title_full": "Oh dis ain't good", "published": "2017-12-07T05:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3997, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c25369000e2656992e740a4d0f739dee1b8598b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_YxMZS96Uj43IgBlrEvujYHyjntptf5EGM5qaAw3oOrywsBtWw3uJkEXkrCYFZqiYTb2emSrQytu85WwrEue2x", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T05:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Oh dis ain't good", "text": "Reply 0 (16h ago) [-] Eh.

Die Zusammenarbeit mit Bloggern, um eine Werbebotschaft zu platzieren ist derzeit eine popul\u00e4re Marketing-Methode. Besonders so genannte Micro-Influencer mit kleinen und pers\u00f6nlichen Blogs sind daf\u00fcr beliebt. Doch wie findet man als Unternehmer geeignete Blogger, die authentisch schreiben und dabei professionell arbeiten? Vor dieser Frage stand auch Christian Keller, Gr\u00fcnder von my SCHOKO WORLD, der vielen aus \"Die H\u00f6hle der L\u00f6wen\" bekannt ist. Um sein erstes Vorhaben im Bereich Micro-Influencer-Marketing zu verwirklichen, hat er sich f\u00fcr eine Kooperation mit trusted blogs entschieden und seine Idee Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt mit professioneller Unterst\u00fctzung umgesetzt. \"Mit trusted blogs habe ich die ideale Plattform gefunden, um die Zusammenarbeit mit Bloggern strukturiert und projektweise zu testen\", so Keller. Die Erstellung der Kampagne erfolgt in Absprache mit den Experten von trusted blogs. Neben einer pr\u00e4gnanten Unternehmensvorstellung und dem Ziel der Kampagne wird den Bloggern in diesem ersten Schritt bereits die Verg\u00fctung dargelegt. Das kann in diesem Fall das Produkt in H\u00f6he eines bestimmten Wertes sein oder ein zus\u00e4tzlicher Gutschein f\u00fcr den Shop. In Hinblick auf die anstehende Weihnachtszeit beschloss Christian Keller, die mit Fotos personalisierten Adventskalender zum Test anzubieten. \"Das hat das Ganze f\u00fcr mich planbar gemacht\", betont Keller, \"wir hatten mit dem Zeitraum bis zum 1. Dezember einen konkreten Rahmen, um den Erfolg unserer Kampagne zu messen.\" Die Blogger durften einen Kalender f\u00fcr sich gestalten, um dann auf ihrem Blog von dem Shop, dem Bestellvorgang und dem Endprodukt zu erz\u00e4hlen - eingebettet in eine pers\u00f6nliche Geschichte. \"Entscheidend daf\u00fcr, wie authentisch die Werbebotschaft bei der Community ankommt, ist eine hohe Verbundenheit von Leser und Blogger\", wei\u00df Eduard Andrae, Gr\u00fcnder von trusted blogs. Dabei komme es gar nicht unbedingt auf eine hohe Reichweite an. Im Gegenteil: Das Besondere an den Micro-Influencern sei gerade, dass ihre Bekanntheit und Leserschaft eher begrenzt sind, sie daf\u00fcr aber intensiver mit ihren Lesern in Verbindung stehen. Da diese Blogger schwerer als die gro\u00dfen Meinungsmacher im World Wide Web zu finden sind, sieht sich trusted blogs als vermittelndes Bindeglied zwischen Unternehmen und Micro- Influencern. \"Die Kampagne mit trusted blogs war einfach zu erstellen und mit geringem Aufwand umzusetzen. Mir ging es in erster Linie darum, das Micro-Influencer-Marketing auszuprobieren und my SCHOKO WORLD und die Produkte zielgerichtet zu bewerben. Ich konnte meine Bekanntheit in der f\u00fcr uns relevanten Zielgruppe steigern und uns in einer subjektiven Berichterstattung positiv pr\u00e4sentieren. All das bei einem \u00fcberschaubaren Budget und Zeitrahmen\", so das Fazit von Christian Keller.
