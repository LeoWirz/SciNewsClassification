For many of us, it means time for family and the joy of the holidays. That time with the family can include traditions of baking cookies or making homemade candy. There are aisles in stores devoted to red and green treats. On top of all the sugary treats dancing in your head, your schedule may be hectic. Parties and gatherings can be time consuming. It can seem like a losing battle to try to keep your smile healthy during this busy time. We have compiled a few tips that may help keep your smile in tip-top shape during the holidays. Make Time For Your Routine \nWhen the holidays get busy, it can be easy to skip brushing or flossing your teeth in the morning. Maybe you let the kids fall asleep without brushing or flossing because they tried to stay up waiting to see Santa. With all the sugar bombs around, it is important to remember to keep brushing and flossing. Make it a part of putting on the holiday pajamas. Sing Christmas songs while you try to brush as a fun game. Do whatever you need to do to make sure you stick to your daily routine. Brushing and flossing at least twice a day protects your teeth and gums . Moderation Is Key \nWhen you are tempted to eat Christmas cookies for dinner, remember to eat some healthy greens or protein. Not only is it healthful for your smile, but it is healthful for your body, too. Try building a \u201cgingerbread\u201d house out of chopped up red and green bell peppers instead of gingerbread. The veggies make good building blocks, and can make a healthy snack. Rinse With Water \nIt can be a daunting task to replace cookies with vegetables. It may not work all of the time. When you reach for the sweets, remember to rinse away the harm with a sip of water. If your treat of choice is egg nog or apple cider, water can help the sugars not to stick to your teeth. Water can help keep you hydrated, as well as helping to keep your mouth clear of bacteria. Ask Dr. Coon for more healthy smile tips \nDr. Coon wants to help keep your family\u2019s smiles healthy.

So, I share with you a sermon on him preached by Father Alexander Men (1935-1990) an influential parish priest and evangelist in Russia who wrote, lectured widely, and eventually appeared on radio and television, becoming a nationally known figure. He started the first Russian Sunday-school as soon as the communist persecution ceased, established a university, made a film, and started volunteer work at a children\u2019s hospital. He personally baptized thousands, and though he had a huge following of ordinary people he was called \u201cthe apostle to the intellectuals.\u201d \nHe was assassinated in 1990. \nYou can go to a website dedicated to him HERE . Of particular note is the article by Irina Yaziova We are Moving into an Age of Love summarising his life and work. \nHere is Father Men's sermon on St Ambrose of Milan, taken from the Russian Orthodox website Pravmir.com   \n\nIn the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit! \nIn earlier times it was customary that a bishop would be chosen for his ministry by his own flock, by the people of the Church themselves, and only thereafter would his consecration \u2013 that is, his ordination \u2013 take place in church. \nOnce in ancient Italy, in the city of Milan \u2013 which was then called Mediolanum \u2013 the head of the local Church died and elections for a new bishop began. As with all elections, this was a tumultuous assembly. For several days there were disputes, with first one person being put forward and then another. Opinions were divided among people and clashes even broke out between disputants. Then, in order to maintain peace in the sizeable crowd, the local prefect or chief of police was called in. He was a just and kind man, well known in the city, who had not yet been baptized. As was then the custom, he belonged to the catechumenate \u2013 that is, he was preparing for baptism \u2013 although he was already in his fourth decade of life. \nThis chief of police, whose name was Ambrose, came to church to restore order during the tumultuous and noisy disputes about the election of the bishop. Then suddenly, during the discussion of the candidates, someone cried out (perhaps it was a wag or a child): \u201cAmbrose will be bishop!\u201d The crowd went silent for a moment, and then everyone cried out; both the clergy and the people turned to this Ambrose. \nThe entire Church of Mediolanum unanimously decided that this very person, who did not have a theological education and was not yet baptized, should be their bishop. He himself, of course, was very confused and bewildered: he had never prepared for ecclesiastical duties and had long put off his own baptism, but he took this as God\u2019s calling and obeyed the people\u2019s will. As if through the mouth of that child or anonymous person who had cried out his name, the Lord called him: \u201cAmbrose, follow Me!\u201d He accepted unwaveringly and within a few days was baptized and then, a few days after that, was entrusted with his omophorion from the bishops, becoming the Bishop of Milan or Mediolanum. \nMany, many centuries have since passed, and the Church holds sacred the memory of Ambrose of Milan. Today we are celebrating his feast day, inasmuch as he was numbered among the ranks of the saints. \nHe was a great man of the Church: he was an organizer, a steward, and a remarkable poet who composed church hymns. According to tradition, the famous hymn we sing during the moleben, \u201cWe praise Thee, O God,\u201d was composed by Ambrose of Milan. He also wrote commentaries on the Holy Scriptures for us. \nIt was then the practice to baptize everyone on Pascha, for which people prepared throughout Great Lent. Each day Ambrose sat in church, where those preparing for baptism gathered, and read the Bible to them from beginning to end, explaining the meaning of the word of God. Scribes recorded his talks, and these formed the many books of St. Ambrose of Milan. \nYou see what an enormous step he took from unbaptized chief of police to bishop, holy hierarch, and later saint of the Universal Church! Why did it happen this way? Because he accepted that call as the voice of God. Each of us often hears the voice of God in our lives, but we neither hear nor listen to it. We rarely reflect on how to act, what to do, where to go, to whom to turn; we waver and fool around, while life passes by and time runs out. But we must always be attentive to the Lord, in order to say to him: \u201cI\u2019m listening to You, I\u2019m coming! Tell me, Lord, which path to take!\u201d \nIf you are visited by illness or grief, this is God\u2019s call to patience. If the person next to you is experiencing difficulties, this is also God\u2019s call. If you make the choice whether to act basely or nobly, this is also clearly God\u2019s call. If you wake up in the morning, as if risen from the deathly sleep of night, then God is calling you to labor this morning. \nStrive to reflect on the events and circumstances of your life, to look back on the years that have gone by, and you will see how often the Lord has called us. But we have not responded: we have continued to doze and to walk through life half asleep, not giving thought to how we are living or why we are laboring. God\u2019s voice is quiet and seemingly inaudible; yet, at the same time, if we are attentive, it is powerful, calling each of us by our names, reproaching our conscience, strengthening us, and saying to us in difficult times: \u201cFear not, I am with you.\u201d \nToday we heard the Gospel reading about the healing of the leper. Leprosy was a terrible disease, which we only recently learned how to treat. Even one hundred years ago it was untreatable. There were islands to which the sick were taken and cast to the mercy of fate. They lived there, rotting alive, losing their fingers and ears. Frightful to behold and abandoned, devastated both spiritually and morally, they lived in huts like animals. \nShips on which missionaries were travelling to preach the word of God to savages and heathens sometimes passed by these islands. On one of these ships was a very young priest from Belgium, Damien de Veuster, who was not much more than twenty years old. He had also gone to preach the Gospel to the pagans, but when he learned that there was an island nearby where people lived as though in hell, he could not go any further. He felt that God\u2019s voice was calling him. He left his ship and stayed on that island forever. And he, as they say, raised these people from the dead: he got them to build houses, he built them a church, and he raised their spirits. They began to live like human beings. This island was transformed, its life becoming completely different, although he himself caught leprosy and died. But he had done his duty! \nThus, God\u2019s voice calls us in the most unexpected moments. We might think about and await one thing, but find another. We might begin building our plans in one way, but if the Lord calls us, then let His will be accomplished! Do not forget those words from the \u201cOur Father\u201d \u2013 few in words but great in meaning \u2013 that to us are immortal and precious: \u201cThy will be done!\u201d Amen. \n\nFr Alexander Men (1935-1990) \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "st ambrose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander men", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "damien de veuster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irina yaziova", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ambrose", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "russian orthodox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st ambrose of milan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mediolanum", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "milan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:16.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd5acd91c3698f4a3fda14c117a1dd851b9c9196", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeMF4s2rxtrDYBHjpryry6bpYjo.ISa0LrJxRgA7IwMR74XRi_bO5mmP8lDZE_IMD4b94hEEuWGEXHWXQ4QhQDUTSa3fZJ7eizDNVTKt9KIR1U3vPmcyHR6wW1nJn08UY7YF1tZuK5JSo7_xsz.P.MdP7wz2.soVGoxLLTuazyXiIfshMNaj3PsA--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/shop-mens-sneakers/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Men's Sneakers - Buy Men's Sneakers at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "Male coconut shoes new Korean fly fabric running lovers shoes sport shoes shoes shoes burst", "title_full": "Male coconut shoes new Korean fly fabric running lovers shoes sport shoes shoes shoes burst | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-07-05T12:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 23, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.023, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5714d12d4ce721142300d44a989b0122af87c2d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeMF4s2rxtrDYBHjpryry6bpYjo.ISa0LrJxRgA7IwMR74XRi_bO5mmP8lDZE_IMD4b94hEEuWGEXHWXQ4QhQDUTSa3fZJ7eizDNVTKt9KIR1U3vPmcyHR6wW1nJn08UY7YF1tZuK5JSo7_xsz.P.MdP7wz2.soVGoxLLTuazyXiLhVnLheeyVwCibMsMVmhpv", "ord_in_thread": 22, "author": "Muhamad fazuan abd rahman", "published": "2017-11-23T03:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "One Star", "text": "Totally different with display..im very disappointed with this", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:16.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70a87dd8e89ee18eafe8e12931ca9e2aef79b4f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8lgnl3OLT4iqThiIQvRddd_FV7yOEMpp4_NEUh81sB0zf94EMa9eA86UYgkjXxh59U_5dEv4VdQxG.P0Pp_nbocNqZI6YS7k.3Iqcgpg4Cgg--", "site_full": "www.contestnews.in", "site": "contestnews.in", "site_section": "http://www.contestnews.in/feed", "site_categories": ["contests_and_freebies", "shopping"], "section_title": "contestnews.in", "title": "Whirlpool \u2013 Let\u2019s Onam Offer \u2013 Participate And Get A Chance To Win Prizes", "title_full": "Whirlpool \u2013 Let\u2019s Onam Offer \u2013 Participate And Get A Chance To Win Prizes", "published": "2017-12-07T09:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "70a87dd8e89ee18eafe8e12931ca9e2aef79b4f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8lgnl3OLT4iqThiIQvRddd_FV7yOEMpp4_NEUh81sB0zf94EMa9eA86UYgkjXxh59U_5dEv4VdQxG.P0Pp_nbocNqZI6YS7k.3Iqcgpg4Cgg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2017-12-07T09:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "Whirlpool \u2013 Let\u2019s Onam Offer \u2013 Participate And Get A Chance To Win Prizes", "text": "You must have to purchase Whirlpool branded Refrigerator, Washing Machine, Air Conditioners, Water Purifier/ROs, Micro Wave Ovens.

December 6, 2017 . 9:30am \nMega Man 11 was announced as 2018 game, and during the same livestream it was also revealed that Game Informer would have new details about the upcoming game starring the Blue Bomber. Thanks to several summaries of the feature, we now know a bit more about the process of greenlighting and developing the new game. [Thanks, Game Informer and Rockman Corner ] \n\nGameplay: \n\n\u2013 The game will feature 8 Robot Masters, which can be challenged in any order, as usual. \n\u2013 Mega Man 9 & 10 were inspired by the 8-bit games, while this is a more modern anime look thanks to Yuji Ishihara\u2019s style. However, Game Informer notes that the controls are as tight as ever. \n\n\n\u2013 As can be seen above, there are four difficulty modes available. (Note: This screenshot is from an older version, as Mega Man 11 has a subtitle in Japan) \n\u2013 The camera has been zoomed out to give a better view compared to past games. \n\u2013 The change in armor Mega Man has this time around is based off of concepts tossed around in the development of Mega Man 1 . \n\u2013 Capcom are toying around with mapping the Slide to a button as an option for newer players. Mega Man\u2019s weapons can also be swapped using the Right Stick as a weapon wheel. \n\u2013 The Gear icons are a new \u2018game-changing\u2019 mechanic. \n\nDevelopment: \n\u2013 Mega Man 11 Producer Kazuhiro Tsuchiya said that it was hard for Capcom staff to speak up about working on Mega Man after Keiji Inafune left. Nobody knew how to fill his role, which was essentially the brand\u2019s leader. \n\u2013 Koji Oda, Director of Mega Man 11 , received the greenlight for this project, but in the last seven years there were several new pitches for Mega Man games. \n\n\n\u2013 One of the screenshots show Mega Man taking on a form that looks like Mega Man Starforce.

Japanese sales tracker Media Create released the latest software and hardware sales data from the week of November 27 through December 3, 2017. \n\n#1 of the week goes to Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon for the third week straight since its launch, with 107,657 units sold on Nintendo 3DS. \n\nXenoblade Chronicles 2 wasn\u2019t that far from first place in its debut with 97,732 units sold for Switch in its opening week to put it at #2. This makes it the highest debut for the Xenoblade series after Xenoblade Chronicles debuted with 82,952 units sold in Japan for the Wii back in 2009 and Xenoblade Chronicles X opened with 85,586 units sold on the Wii U in 2015. \n\nSuper Mario Odyssey continues selling well with 61,596 units sold to chart at #3, and same goes for Splatoon 2 which sold 36,246 units to chart at #4. At #5 we have another new title with Kirby: Battle Royale with 28,023 units sold, which may not be as much as the main series but about right for a spinoff. \n\nAs far as other new titles go, Nobunaga\u2019s Ambition: Taishi sold 27,230 units on PS4 and 5,636 units on Switch to chart at #6 and #17 for a total of 32,866 units sold between the two versions. Attack on Titan II: Future Coordinates opened at #12 with 8,353 units sold on 3DS. \n\nLittle Witch Academia: Chamber of Time charted at #13 with 8,069 units sold on PS4, which is a little lower than expected, but keep in mind that the series isn\u2019t as popular in Japan, so it\u2019ll likely do better in the West. And lastly, we have Resident Evil Revelations Collection at #14 with 6,540 units sold on Nintendo Switch. \n\nHardware sales saw a good rise across the PlayStation family of consoles to start the new month. The Nintendo Switch continues to impress in Japan with 124,770 units sold in the week, so it seems like there\u2019s more stock to meet the demand going into the holiday season. This puts the total of Nintendo Switch consoles sold in Japan at 2,521,027 units sold since its launch in March, going by Media Create\u2019s data. \n\nThe top-20 chart of the week is as follows: Lw", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sato", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "taishi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mario odyssey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nobunaga", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nintendo switch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nintendo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "media create", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pok\u00e9mon ultra sun & ultra moon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "splatoon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:17.066+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1050c2dcd2cbca6f5bc2067ada99b98781895cc2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqd_OzGgcZDDJL.FSeWjh0ebVxlZvrAX8vjcOe84EBdgyMHeFhyMIFGaWWXVEX4OiaA4ddod_eP2.91FIvIkJFDao9JwPRPHnV.IaOucRwAtA--", "site_full": "blog.islamawareness.net", "site": "islamawareness.net", "site_section": "http://blog.islamawareness.net/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Islam Awareness Blog", "title": "Muhammad and Rumi on Sexual Harassment", "title_full": "Muhammad and Rumi on Sexual Harassment", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1050c2dcd2cbca6f5bc2067ada99b98781895cc2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqd_OzGgcZDDJL.FSeWjh0ebVxlZvrAX8vjcOe84EBdgyMHeFhyMIFGaWWXVEX4OiaA4ddod_eP2.91FIvIkJFDao9JwPRPHnV.IaOucRwAtA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Zafar Khan (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Muhammad and Rumi on Sexual Harassment", "text": "It is a time of reckoning for men around the world who have disrespected and brought distress and harm upon women. Rumi, writing about what could be called the \u201csacred feminine,\u201d quotes the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him): \u201cThe Prophet said, \u201cWoman prevails over the wise man, while the raw and ignorant prevail over her.\u201d Those men who lack tenderness and affection are animals, not men.\u201d [see: [Mathnawi I 2421-2437] To paraphrase: woman can dominate a wise man who can recognize the creative power and divine quality vested in the feminine and willingly choose to serve and protect that beauty, while the ignorant and insensitive man imposes his crude desires upon her. Such a man is actually enslaved to the power of woman, but is deaf, dumb, and blind to what woman might offer willingly if her freedom and beauty were respected. Or as Rumi says it: If outwardly you dominate your wife, inwardly you are dominated, seeking her love. What pleasure can a man receive from \u201cgroping\u201d a woman (or worse), oblivious to the fact that the greatest pleasure of human relationship is in reciprocity? These are some of the spiritual secrets that have been lost to worldly societies, East, Middle East, and West. Too many men, emotionally crippled by both Puritanism and salaciousness, enslaved to lust, numb to intimacy, violate the sacredness of eros.

BREAKING DOWN 'Operational Efficiency' \nOperational efficiency in the investment markets is typically centered around transaction costs associated with investments. Operational efficiency in the investment markets can be compared to general business practices for operational efficiency in production. Operationally efficient transactions are those that are exchanged with the highest margin, meaning an investor seeks to pay the lowest fee to earn the highest profit. Similarly, companies seek to earn the highest gross margin profit from their products by manufacturing goods at the lowest cost. In nearly all cases, operational efficiency can be improved by economies of scale. In the investment markets this can translate to buying more shares of an investment at a fixed trading cost to reduce the fee per share. \nA market is reported to be operationally efficient when conditions exist allowing participants to execute transactions and receive services at a price that equates fairly to the actual costs required to provide them. Operationally efficient markets are typically a byproduct of competition which is a significant factor improving the operational efficiency for participants. Operationally efficient markets may also be influenced by regulation which caps fees to protect investors against exorbitant costs. An operationally efficient market may also be known as an \"internally efficient market.\" \nOperational efficiency and operationally-efficient markets can help to improve the overall efficiency of investment portfolios. Greater operational efficiency in the investment markets means capital can be allocated without excessive frictional costs that reduce the risk/reward profile of an investment portfolio. \nInvestment funds are also often analyzed by their comprehensive operational efficiency. A fund\u2019s expense ratio is one metric for operational efficiency comparison. A number of factors influence the expense ratio of a fund including transaction costs, management fees and administrative expenses. Comparatively, funds with a lower expense ratio can generally be considered to be more operationally efficient. Investment Market Examples \nFunds with greater assets under management can obtain greater operational efficiency because of the higher number of shares transacted per trade. Generally, passive investment funds are typically known to exemplify greater operational efficiency than active funds when considering their expense ratios. Passive funds offer targeted market exposure through index replication. Large funds have the advantage of economies of scale in trading. For passive funds, following the holdings of an index also incurs lower transaction costs. \nIn other areas of the market, certain structural or regulatory changes can serve to make participation more operationally efficient. In 2000, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) passed a resolution allowing money market funds to be considered eligible margin requirements, where before only cash was eligible. This minor change reduced unnecessary costs of trading in and out of money market funds, making the futures markets more operationally efficient. \nFinancial regulators have also imposed an 8.5% sales charge cap on mutual fund commissions. This cap helps to improve operational trading efficiency and investment profits for individual investors.

Sinopec alleges it never received full payment for 45,000 tons of steel rebar it agreed to sell PDVSA for $43 million and which was delivered in 2013.\nThe lawsuit, while small in size, says PDVSA through its U.S. subsidiary Bariven reneged on repeated promises to pay Sinopec, at one point costing the Chinese company $2 million in losses after it entered into arbitration with a supplier it agreed to purchase the steel from to carry out the deal.\n\"This is not simply a case of a broken promise to pay,\" Sinopec said in the court documents, accusing PDVSA of \"deceit\" and \"willful deception\" in its refusal to pay its bills. \"Rather, this case involves a complex commercial transaction specifically calculated to leave Sinopec without a remedy.\"\nThe Chinese \"usually take a more diplomatic tone\" and are clearly angry, Russ Dallen, head of local brokerage Caracas Capital, wrote in a report Wednesday in which he revealed the existence of the lawsuit.\nThe dispute comes as Venezuela is seeking fresh financing to restructure its huge foreign debt on which it is behind payment.\nChina has been one of Venezuela's biggest creditors, providing it loans, cash and investment totaling more than $65 billion between 2007 and 2016, according to a database maintained by Boston University and the Inter-American Dialogue. But it has so far failed to come to President Nicolas Maduro's rescue as he tries to shield the OPEC nation from triple-digit inflation, fast-declining oil production and financial sanctions imposed by the Trump administration.\nA spokesman for Beijing-based Sinopec Group confirmed that a U.S. subsidiary of a Sinopec trading company had launched a lawsuit against PDVSA about \"a dispute over payment owed.\"\n\"As a big company, it is normal for us to have such commercial dispute and it is normal to resort to law if there is a dispute,\" Sinopec spokesman Lu Dapeng said by phone.\nGeng Shuang, a spokesman of China's Foreign Ministry, said the issue was nothing more than a regular commercial dispute and that China remains willing to cooperate with Venezuela on an equal and mutually beneficial basis.\n\"I think this is a common commercial dispute and there is no need to make over-interpretations of it,\" Geng said. \"I want to stress that China attaches great importance to the development of China Venezuela relations.\"\n___\nAssociated Press researchers Yu Bing and Shanshan Wang in Beijing contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Altogether, the 31 regional Blues had 4.6 million individual market customers at the end of September. Those members paid premiums of $22.2 billion while accruing medical claims of $17 billion. \n\u201cThis is the backbone of the segment right now,\u201d Kathy Hempstead, who oversees coverage programs for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said of the regional Blues. \u201cThey have figured out how to do business here.\u201d \nThe turnaround follows three years of financial bloodletting for insurers in the Obamacare markets. McKinsey estimates that the carriers lost more than $12 billion in just 2015 and 2016. Many national insurers \u2014 including UnitedHealth Group and Aetna \u2014 largely abandoned the marketplaces after sustaining big losses. \nThe biggest reasons for the sea of red ink: Insurers underestimated the cost of covering those who enrolled, and too few younger, healthier Americans signed up for coverage. \nBut there have been other unexpected factors that contributed to the financial turbulence. Congressional Republicans insisted that a program designed to protect insurers with particularly expensive customers from big financial losses be budget neutral. That\u2019s led to a roughly $12 billion shortfall in payments to health plans. \nIn addition, an Obama administration decision to allow plans that don\u2019t meet the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage requirements to remain in place \u2014 following an outcry over canceled plans \u2014 cut offa large pool of potential customers for ACA-compliant plans. The Trump administration has maintained that policy of allowing non-compliant plans to remain in place. \nThere is likely to be some erosion in the insurers\u2019 financial performance during the final three months of this year. Medical claims as a share of premiums are almost certain to increase in the final quarter of the year. That\u2019s because more customers will be maxing out their deductibles, meaning insurers will have to cover a bigger share of costs. \nIn addition, President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to cut off subsidy payments that insurers rely on to reduce the costs for low-income customers means plans will take a more than $1 billion financial hit, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. \nRepublicans' efforts to dismantle the law, including a potential repeal of the individual mandate as part of the tax bill, H.R. 1 (115) , currently being debated on Capitol Hill, are creating further uncertainty about the future viability of the markets. The Environmental Scandal in Scott Pruitt\u2019s Backyard By MALCOLM BURNLEY \n\u201cThere\u2019s so much speculation. We have to kind of wait to see what actually happens,\u201d said Greg Thompson, a spokesman for Health Care Service Corp. \u201cThings are very, very fluid at this point in time.\u201d \nObamacare anticipated that health plans would need about three years to adjust to the fledgling markets. The path has been much bumpier than expected. \nThe markets in many states remain in perilous shape. Nearly half of all counties nationwide have just a single insurer selling Obamacare plans next year. And insurers jacked up rates by eye-popping amounts again fortheir 2018 plan years. \nBut a healthy chunk of those increases can be attributed to Trump\u2019s decision to cut off subsidy payments and uncertainty about the future of the marketplaces. The landscape might have looked much different without those aggravating factors. \n\u201cA lot of them would have put across some pretty modest rate increases, and we would have had a harbinger of a pretty good market next year,\u201d Hempstead said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this kind of performance would suggest.\u201d \nTucker Doherty contributed to this report .

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAt first glance you might say that the standout feature of this four bedroom detached house is the amount of daylight inside and a welcome sense of space as a result, an understandable reaction given its spectacular floor-to-roof window at the front. \nBut to leave it there would be to sell it short because this property, at Ivinson Way on the Bramshall Meadows development, on the edge of Uttoxeter and overlooking the surrounding countryside, has so much more to offer - including the added bonus of being on a prestige development at a location carefully chosen to make life easier and more comfortable for its residents. \nFor one thing, it has almost instant access to the A50 , and anyone who has wasted endless hours stuck in queues getting onto it from the Stoke-on-Trent end will appreciate the attraction of that. \nFrom the front door, residents will have excellent road links to the M6 or the rest of the Midlands, and this pretty rural town has its own railway station too. \nFor another, it has a superb and spacious layout with high ceiling rooms and high end appliances, and fully warrants its \u2018luxury\u2019 tag. Read More Fancy a barn conversion? This one has SIX bedrooms and plenty of land \nThis particular house is of the Garnet style on the estate which has permission for just 44 homes and currently has three and four bedroom properties available. \nEntering the hallway, the sense of light, space and volume is amazing and most certainly has a \u2018wow\u2019 factor. To the right is the first and smaller of the two main living rooms with the lounge to the left. Following the modern trend, this runs the full depth of the house so it is big and has a set of French doors at the far end opening to the back garden. \nThe open plan fitted kitchen diner is a very impressive part of this design. A second set of French doors lets in the light for the area where most people will put their table and chairs, and around the far end is the Zanussi designer kitchen area with the cupboards and appliances. \nIt is a good layout, with the eye level double oven on one side and the hob on another, so you can cook a meal without being cramped. Off it is a useful utility area to take care of the laundry, and there is a downstairs loo and understairs storage. Inside the property \nThanks to that amazing window, the landing becomes more than just a little used space because this house provides a nice study area right by it and with a vaulted ceiling above, one imagines this would be a lovely place to sit and read or do some work from home. \nThree of the bedrooms on this level are definitely doubles and the fourth is, depending on how you define it, either a big single or small double. The rule of thumb given to me by an estate agent years ago is that if you can get out of bed on either side, that\u2019s a double\u2026 \nThe master has both an en suite shower room and a separate walk-in wardrobe, making yet another impressive part of this house. Underlining the quality you get here, the sanitary ware throughout is from high end manufacturer Roca.

Next to it is the four-piece suite family bathroom, having a bath and separate shower cubicle. \nLooking outside, a drop kerb from the road leads to a driveway alongside the side of the house and big enough for several cars . \nAt the end of that is a double garage and at the back of the house, accessed from those two sets of French doors and a gate from the drive, is the rear garden which is fully enclosed and therefore safe for children to play in. \nIf you want a further incentive to buy, the multi-award wining developer St Modwen Homes is operating its part-exchange system here which gives very favourable terms to people who already have a property they want to sell, making the process a whole lot easier. \nThe government-backed Help to Buy equity loan programme is also available. \nDave Smith, managing director at St Modwen Homes, said: \u201cOur aim is to deliver quality new-build homes that stand out from the crowd, and our detached Garnet at Bramshall Meadows is testament to that, offering real kerb appeal with a full height window to the front of the property.

Dezember 2017 | ID: 135574 Diesen Artikel hervorheben Food Pairing - nat\u00fcrlich mit Saft Bonn, 7. Dezember 2017 - Kaum ein anderes Getr\u00e4nk kann so viele Bed\u00fcrfnisse und Verzehrsanl\u00e4sse bedienen wie Fruchtsaft. Und so bieten sich S\u00e4fte auch beim Trendthema \"Food Pairing\" als ideale Partner an. Beim Food Pairing werden Aromen kombiniert, die zun\u00e4chst nicht vermuten lassen, dass sie gemeinsam ein harmonisches Ganzes ergeben. Fruchtsaft & Co. in Kombination mit Tonic Water oder schwarzem Tee, mit Kr\u00e4utern, Gew\u00fcrzen oder \u00d6len bieten ganz neue Geschmacksalternativen. Diese Kombinationen eigenen sich hervorragend als alkoholfreie Speisebegleiter, auch als Alternative zum klassischen Wein im Rahmen des Weihnachtsmen\u00fcs. Dabei muss man nur wissen, was wozu passt und welche Aromen miteinander harmonieren. Grunds\u00e4tzlich sind der Fantasie aber keine Grenzen gesetzt und schlu\u00dfendlich entscheidet immer der eigene Geschmack. Fruchtsaft f\u00fcr neue Geschmackserlebnisse Fruchts\u00e4fte und -nektare k\u00f6nnen dank ihrer Sorten- und Geschmacksvielfalt ganz unterschiedliche Geschm\u00e4cker bedienen. Ob herb-s\u00e4uerlich, klar und spritzig oder samtig-s\u00fc\u00df, es gibt immer das passende Produkt. Das moderne Food Pairing geht heute \u00fcber die Berechnung von passenden Schl\u00fcsselaromen hinaus. Um die Kombinationen perfekt zu machen, kommt es auch auf Texturen, Konsistenzen und Aggregatzust\u00e4nde an. Fruchts\u00e4fte und -nektare verf\u00fcgen hier von Haus aus \u00fcber verschiedene Varianten, sei es ein klarer Kirschnektar, ein Orangensaft mit Fruchtfleisch oder ein samtiger Aprikosennektar. Ein Saft oder Nektar bietet sich auch ideal als Granita an oder sorgt \u00fcber das Fermentieren f\u00fcr ein ganz neues Geschmackserlebnis. Fermentation beruht auf dem Prinzip, dass der Pilz in einer N\u00e4hrl\u00f6sung wie Tee oder einem Aufguss liegt und von dem zugegeben Zucker lebt. Verwendet man Fruchs\u00e4fte, reduziert dies nicht nur die Menge des beizugebenden Zuckers, sondern sorgt durch die Fermentation f\u00fcr v\u00f6llig neue Geschmackserlebnisse. Es muss auch nicht immer das Getr\u00e4nk sein. Fruchts\u00e4fte begleiten das Men\u00fc auch in Dressings, Saucen oder Dips. So passen Sauerkirsche und Johannisbeere gut zu Fleisch- und Wildgerichten, w\u00e4hrend die Ananas Currys eine besondere Note verleiht und ein Orangensaft dem Salat den Frischekick gibt. Unsere Food Pairing-Ideen f\u00fcr Weihnachten Rhabarber-Loorbeer-Drink 330 ml Apfelsaft naturtr\u00fcb, 330 ml Rhabarbernektar, 350 ml kochendes Wasser, 5 getrocknete Lorbeerbl\u00e4tter Zubereitung: Lorbeerbl\u00e4tter grob brechen, mit dem kochenden Wasser aufgie\u00dfen und 15 Minuten ziehen lassen. Abseihen und den Lorbeertee abk\u00fchlen lassen. Apfelsaft, Rhabarbernektar und Lorbeertee mischen. Passt zu: Ein s\u00fcffiger Allrounder-Drink, der mit seiner fruchtig-herben Note zu vielen Gerichten passt! Er schmeckt zu Gem\u00fcsegerichten wie geschmortem K\u00fcrbis oder Guacamole. Er passt zu Ofenkartoffeln, Couscoussalat und Flammkuchen, harmoniert mit milden Frischk\u00e4sen, wei\u00dfem Fischfilet oder Omeletts. Er l\u00e4sst sich aber auch zu m\u00fcrbem Apfelkuchen, Waffeln oder gebackenen Apfelspalten trinken. Der Verband der deutschen Fruchtsaft-Industrie e. V. in Bonn wurde 1951 gegr\u00fcndet. Rund 345 Fruchtsaft-, Fruchtnektar-, Gem\u00fcsesaft- und Gem\u00fcsenektarhersteller Deutschlands sind Mitglied. Der Verband vertritt die gemeinsamen Interessen der Branche im In- und Ausland.

The answer, according to those who know him best, is: both.

(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.
