Impress Potential Employers. Get Yours Today. Click Here 4 Details 5 Sections You Need To Remove From Your CV Immediately! 07 Dec 2017 \nI\u2019m sure you have always been told about what you should have in your CV. But today I want us to talk about five things on your CV that are probably very irrelevant. \nThese are sections that are not adding any value to your CV but instead end up giving you a lengthy piece of document that fails to bring out the best in you. \nLet\u2019s find out. 5 things you should never have in your CV \n1. Your photo \nUnless you are applying for certain jobs such as modeling which often require a visual, kindly do not have a photo on your CV. \nWhat the recruiter wants to know is how well equipped you are to do the job not how handsome or beautiful you appear to be. \nFurthermore, adding your photo only eats up valuable space on your CV that could have been used to communicate your expertise instead. \n2. Inappropriate/unprofessional email addresses \nCreating an email is an exercise that is free and will take you no more than 5minutes. \nWith these perks some job seekers opt to create very unprofessional email addresses such as maggymresh@gmail.com , jimbabayao@hotmail.com, shirowamum@yahoo.com . \nSuch email addresses only show your lack of seriousness and unprofessionalism. \n3. Personal social media accounts \nCommunication has greatly changed in the advent of social media. \nWhile it is okay to include your LinkedIn page due to its professional nature, you need not start including everything else like your twitter handles, facebook page, Instagram, Snap chat, you-tube channel etc. \nThis will only make a recruiter start going through your profiles and perhaps stumble on something that will diminish your chances of being shortlisted. \n4. Grammatical errors and typos \nIt is very annoying for any recruiter to peruse pages of a CV that has not been proof-read. \nBefore sending out your CV, read it, re-read it and if possible give it to someone else to proof-read for you. \nHaving grammatical errors and typos show that you put little thought into your CV and hence the recruiter will not even look at it twice. \n5. Vague and ambiguous phrases \nIf you have the habit of indicating on your CV vague statements such as \u201chardworking\u201d, \u201ccompetent\u201d, \u201cmotivated\u201d etc., you are doing a great disservice to your CV. \nThese statements don\u2019t tell the employer much. What you need to do is offer a brief explanation or statement not cliche statements that every job seeker is using. \nA good example: \n\u201cI am a highly motivated individual who takes a personal initiative to ensure that the tasks assigned to me are completed and executed in due time.\u201d \nPiece of advice\u2026 \nThe amount of time and effort you put into your CV will reflect to any recruiter. \nIf you\u2019ve been churning out half-baked, error ridden CV\u2019s you will probably never get a call back for an interview. \nIf you require expert help on how to write the perfect CV, have a CV writing professional help you through that. \nSometimes the only barrier between you and your dream job is your CV! \nEsther Kamau works for Corporate Staffing Services, a leading HR firm that offers recruitment and FREE job placement. \nFor more information, visit their website on www.corporatestaffing.co.ke STAND OUT from the competition with a professional CV.

Pine is one of the original Bach Flower Remedies. It is used by people who blame themselves when things go wrong, who feel excessively guilty and feel like they can't forgive themselves. They might constantly criticize themselves or feel tired and depressed from feeling worthless or like nothing they do will ever be good enough. How a person like that might long for salvation and inner peace! Pine is a salve for the heart on many levels. It helps you accept yourself, forgive yourself, and able to move ahead despite faults or past mistakes.   \n\nI recently added Reiki infused dosage strength bottles and sprays of Pine Flower Essence to my Etsy shop.

USA TODAY Dru, voiced by Steve Carell, appears in a scene from \u201cDespicable Me 3.\u201d (Photo: Illumination and Universal Pictures via AP) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE When \"Despicable Me\" burst onto the scene seven years ago, it brought with it the fun little premise of making the villain the hero (a trope that can land beautifully or crash spectacularly). It was enjoyable enough, with plenty of laughs and a heartwarming ending. The second film told the story of the villain redeemed as a hero (another trope that can land or crash), and it more or less continued the successful franchise. More: Christmas flicks: Our staff's favorite holiday films With \"Despicable Me 3,\" we meet a long-lost family member (trope trope trope!) and go on new adventures with new villains. The trilogy has made for some great movie moments \u2013 but it also unleashed an unholy plague on the world. With that in mind, here are three reasons to own \"Despicable Me 3\" (and one reason not to). 3. Steve Carell's double duty \nGru, left, meets his twin brother Dru (both voiced by Steve Carell) in the animated feature \"Despicable Me 3,\" now on Blu-ray, DVD and a variety of streaming sites. (Photo: Deseret News) Steve Carell has been the voice of \"Despicable Me's\" pro/antagonist Gru since film No. 1, but in this third installation, he also brings to life Dru, Gru's secret twin brother. Carell does an honorable job of pulling two crazy voices out of his toolbox, with Dru taking on a buoyant, Nordic sound that is almost the auditory version of the character's flowing blond hair. If there's a fourth addition, I'm calling on Illumination Entertainment to cast Carell as their long-lost older sister as well. And name her Su! 2. Half the voices of 'South Park' \nGru, voiced by Steve Carell, left, and Balthazar Bratt, voiced by Trey Parker, appear in a scene from \u201cDespicable Me 3.\u201d (Photo: Illumination and Universal Pictures via AP) The villain, Balthazar Bratt, is voiced by none other than Trey Parker, half the brains and voices behind the wildly popular \"South Park\" empire. That voice is so engrained into pop culture that it's almost hard to hear anything other than Randy Marsh, but it's still fun to hear Parker's voice coming out of yet another animated character (albeit a far less crude one). Hey, there are even flashback scenes of Bratt as a kid where Parker's voice is altered \u2013 and it sounds like Cartman! I have to believe this was purposeful. 1. The imagination of technology \nSteve Carell returns as Gru in \"Despicable Me 3.\" (Photo: Photo Credit: Illumination and U) I think my favorite part of the \"Despicable Me\" movies is the inclusion of the almost other-worldly technology. From life-size inflatable pyramids in the first one all the way to inflating chewing gum that lifts cities in this most recent film, the spy-world gadgetry puts everything we've seen in any James Bond movie, \"Austin Powers\" and \"Kingsman\" to shame. I don't know what it is about these over-the-top inventions that get my mind and imagination whirling, but I simply adore the myriad ways in which these writers and animators have found to get the characters' jobs done. But remember that unholy plague I mentioned earlier? Yeah. There is one reason to skip adding \"Despicable Me 3\" to your library: 1. Minions \nThe Minions are the real stars in \u201cDespicable Me 3.\u201d (Photo: Courtesy of Illumination and Universal Pictures) You know what? I used to enjoy the Minions. I thought they were cute and funny, and their existence was so off-the-wall that it made them all the more valuable to the stories. But then they multiplied. They scattered. They began showing up outside of the movie. Suddenly they were on everything \u2013 especially social media, where I love to spend the majority of my precious remaining years. The over-saturation of the Minions (including their own movie and countless, countless mini movies) has made them nearly unpalatable. And it's a shame because there are some genuinely funny scenes with them in this movie. More: 'Minions' comes to Blu-ray after total Internet saturation I won't lie; there's a portion of \"Despicable Me 3\" where the Minions end up in jail that elicited what can only be described as belly laugh of Saint Nicolaus proportions from me. But that seed of annoyance has been planted and the garden is now full of irritating Minion-shaped weeds. And one redeeming scene just can't clear out the brush. So I'll leave it up to you to decide if the pros outweigh the con. I'm still trying to decide myself, actually.

(AP Photo/Jacques Brinon) \nParis (AP) \u2014 Johnny Hallyday, France\u2019s biggest rock star for more than half a century and an icon who packed sports stadiums and all but lit up the Eiffel Tower with his high-energy concerts at the foot of the Paris landmark, died early Wednesday. He was 74. \nPresident Emmanuel Macron, who knew the star offstage, announced his death in a statement, saying \u201che brought a part of America into our national pantheon.\u201d In a second comment during a visit to Algeria, Macron said that \u201cwe were convinced he was invincible \u2026 He is a French hero.\u201d \nMacron\u2019s office said the president spoke with Hallyday\u2019s family, but didn\u2019t provide details about where the rocker died. \nThe French media reported widely that he died at his home west of Paris, which was quickly surrounded by mourning fans and police providing security. \n\u201cHearing about Johnny\u2019s death has hurt us because Johnny is our God and nobody can replace him,\u201d said one fan, Yves Buisson, outside the Hallyday family\u2019s gated home in Marnes-La-Coquette. His arms were covered with tattoos of the star. \nHallyday had lung cancer and repeated health scares in recent years that dominated national news, and recently returned from a hospital stay. But he continued performing as recently as this summer. \nCeline Dion was among stars sharing condolences for a rocker with a famously gravelly voice who sold more than 100 million records, filled concert halls and split his time between Los Angeles and Paris. Brigitte Bardot tweeted: \u201cJohnny is a monument. It is France!\u201d \nSome of France\u2019s leading political figures on the left and right joined Macron in mourning the loss of \u201cJohnny,\u201d as he was known. Former President Francois Hollande, the Socialist leader replaced by Macron, said Hallyday \u201cis part of our national patrimony.\u201d \nHallyday fashioned his glitzy stage aura, with an open shirt, jewelry and a pumping pelvis, from Elvis Presley, drew musical inspiration from Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly, performed with Jimi Hendrix, and made an album in country music\u2019s capital, Nashville, Tennessee. \nHis stardom largely ended at the French-speaking world, yet in France itself, he was an institution, with a postage stamp in his honor. He was the country\u2019s top rock \u2018n\u2019 roll star through more than five decades and eight presidents, and it was no exaggeration when Macron wrote \u201cthe whole country is in mourning.\u201d \n\u201cWe all have something of Johnny Hallyday in us,\u201d Macron said, praising \u201ca sincerity and authenticity that kept alive the flame that he ignited in the public\u2019s heart.\u201d \nHallyday, whose father was Belgian, also was a musical hero across the French border. The Brussels subway system played his hits over intercoms, and Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said \u201ca great artist has left us, transcending generations. \u201d \nThe antithesis of a French hero right down to his Elvis-style glitter and un-French name, Hallyday was among the most familiar faces and voices in France, which knew him simply as Johnny, pronounced with a slight French accent and beloved across generations. \nHe released his last album \u201cRester Vivant\u201d \u2014 or \u201cStaying Alive\u201d \u2014 last year, and performed this summer as part of the \u201cOld Crooks\u201d tour with long-time friends and veteran French musicians Eddy Mitchell and Jacques Dutronc. \nFormer President Nicolas Sarkozy, as mayor of the rich enclave of Neuilly-sur-Seine on the western edge of Paris, presided in 1996 over the entertainer\u2019s marriage to his fourth wife, Laeticia. \n\u201cFor each of us, he means something personal. Memories, happy moments, songs and music,\u201d Sarkozy said in 2009, days after Hallyday, then 66, was hospitalized in Los Angeles. Sarkozy called the Hallyday family during an EU summit and gave updates on the singer\u2019s condition during news conferences. \nThe star all but lit up the Eiffel Tower during several free concerts, one on Bastille Day in 2009, attended by more than 500,000 people. \nHallyday sang some songs in English, including \u201cHot Legs\u201d and \u201cHouse of the Rising Sun,\u201d \u2014 the melody of which was also used for one of his most famous songs, the 1964 \u201cLe Penitencier.\u201d \nAnd there was a real American connection: American singer Lee Ketchman gave him his first electric guitar. Hallyday\u2019s stardom, however, was not inevitable. \nHe was born in Paris on June 15, 1943, of a Belgian father and French mother during the dark days of World War II with a less glamorous name, Jean-Philippe Smet. His parents had separated by the end of the year. The young Smet followed his father\u2019s sisters to London, where he met Ketchman. \nHallyday gave his first professional concert in 1960, under the name Johnny, and put out his first album a year later. By 1962, he had met the woman who would be his wife for years, and remained his friend to the end, singing star Sylvie Vartan. That year, he also made an album in Nashville, Tennessee, and rubbed shoulders with American singing greats. \nHe quickly became a favorite of young people during the \u201cYe-ye\u201d period, the golden years of French pop music. A respected musician, Hallyday played with Jimmy Hendrix during the 1960s and once recorded a song with Led Zeppelin founder Jimmy Page. \nWith his square-jawed good looks and piercing blue eyes, Hallyday was often sought-out for the cinema, playing in French director Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s \u201cDetective\u201d (1984) and with other illustrious directors including Costa-Gavras. \nHallyday appeared in Johnnie To\u2019s \u201cVengeance\u201d (2009) and had talked about giving film a bigger role in his life. \nHowever, it was the rocker\u2019s personal life, and his marriage to Laeticia, that gave him a mellow edge. He spoke lovingly of daughters Jade and Joy, who were adopted from Vietnam. \n\u201cI\u2019m not a star. I\u2019m just a simple man,\u201d he said in a 2006 interview on France 3. \nHis widow\u2019s statement announcing the death was a testimonial to Hallyday\u2019s battle with cancer, \u201cgiving everyone extraordinary life lessons.\u201d \n\u201cThe heart beat so strongly in this body of a rocker who lived a life without concession for the stage, for his public, for those who adored and loved him,\u201d said her statement, transmitted overnight to the French national news agency AFP. \u201cMy man is no more.\u201d \nHallyday is also survived by two other children, Dave, a singer fathered with Vartan, and Laura Smet, whom he had with noted French actress Nathalie Baye. \nMemorial plans weren\u2019t immediately announced.

Numerous benefits availed by patients due to the appropriate usage of radiation for improved diagnosis and treatment are evident. It has become a key part of the modern medical treatment, especially in treating cancer. Protection from radiation for doctors, other healthcare professionals, and patients is constantly evolving in the ever-developing modern medical environment. Radiation-producing technology such as X-ray diffraction equipment and X-ray machines are employed in various hospitals and diagnostic centers. Many handle intensive treatment procedures where risk of high levels of radiation exposure exists. Therefore, for the optimal safety from radiation, the medical radiation detection, monitoring and safety market offers radiation detection and monitoring products for real-time dosimetry monitoring. \nAccording to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in 2014, seven out of every 10 Americans underwent diagnostic X-rays and radiation therapy. Furthermore, 10 million nuclear medicine procedures are performed in hospitals and radiology centers in the U.S. each year. Radiation is commonly employed to detect injuries, generate 3D images, as teletherapy, brachytherapy, and afterloading to treat tumors. Thus, the major factors which are anticipated to act as drivers for the medical radiation detection, monitoring, and safety market growth are increased usage of nuclear medicine and radiation therapy for diagnosis and treatment, rising cancer prevalence, and increase in the population of the persons with insurance. However, delay in new product approvals due to strict regulatory guidelines and scarcity of skilled professional to handle radiation related procedures are anticipated to act as restraints for this market. Report Overview and TOC @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/medical-radiation-detection-monitoring-safety-market.html \nThe medical radiation detection, monitoring and safety market can be segmented into safety products, monitoring, detection and detector products, and end-users. In terms of detector, the medical radiation detection, monitoring and safety market can be segmented into solid-state detectors, gas-filled detectors, and scintillators. Due to the wide application in medical imaging and favorable cost-performance ratio of gas-filled detectors it had acquired the major share of medical radiation detection, monitoring and safety market in recent years. \nIn terms of product type, the market can be segmented into area process monitors, personal dosimeters, environment radiation monitors, environment radiation monitors, radioactive material monitors, surface contamination monitors, and others. Personal dosimeters accounted for a major share of the medical radiation detection and monitoring market due to their high demand in the medical field in recent years. Request for Broucher @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=25526 \nIn terms of modality, the market can be segmented into hand safety products, face protection products, full-body protection products, and others.

Greg Gianforte\u2019s has hired Winifred native Christine Heggem as his new chief of staff. \nHeggem replaces Charles Robison, who resigned as Republican Gianforte's chief of staff last month to become the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Development Director in Montana. \nHeggem is a nearly 20-year veteran of congressional politics. She most recently worked on the House Agriculture Committee for Chairman Mike Conaway, R-TX. Heggem\u2019s job was working with other committees and farm groups to form coalitions on agricultural issues. \nShe got her start in 2000 working for the former Republican Montana U.S. Sen. Conrad Burns, and later worked for the Senate Appropriations Committee, of which Burns was a member. \n\u201cI came out here, as many Montanans do come out to DC, with a promise that I would only be her two years and then be back in Montana,\u201d Heggem said. \u201cAnd now, it\u2019s 18 years later.\u201d \nHeggem's family is best known for the owning the Winifred Country Store. Heggem's mother, Donna Young, was a county commissioner in Fergus County for six years in the 1990s and has the unusual distinction of being a county commissioner in more than one county. Young was a commissioner in Powell County for six years after moving to Elliston. \nHeggem said she has worked with most Montana agriculture groups as the House Agriculture Committee begins work on a new farm bill. She's worked frequently with the Montana Stockgrowers Association. \nBefore working for Conaway, Heggem was a senior government relations representative for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. \nShe has a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree in business and economics from Montana State University in Bozeman.

beauty from AVR. \nLament will push enough torque through the wheels of steel that the chasis of the crowd will buckle under immense force & the bpm will hit the rev limiter in no time at all with its powerful nitrous injected intro from the moment the green light is given. \nThis track ploughs through the lineups & reaches the 1st twist to the course & hugs the apex melodies in a tranquil downshift that keeps you focused & controled with precision engineering in the breakdown. \nThis then gently glides around from one corner to the next & prepares to roll out onto the straight like a true performance champion leading the race. \nWith an upshift smoothly placed in the main part of the track with graceful uplifting boost that heads towards the finishing line outro with full dedication to its fans that has the crowd roaring for a victorious lap of honour to which this is more than happy to oblige. \nWe hope you like this release as we do. \nEnjoy!", "highlightText": "",

(AP Photo/Majdi Mohammed) Posted: Thursday, December 7, 2017 3:54 am | Updated: 4:18 am, Thu Dec 7, 2017. \nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the fallout from President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital (all times local): \n11:45 a.m. \nIraq's government has decried the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, calling it \"unjust\" and urging the United States to revoke it. \nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in a statement on Thursday warned of \"dangerous consequences\" for the region's stability and the world. \nHe says the U.S. should \"retreat from that decision in order to stop a dangerous escalation that leads to extremism and creates an atmosphere which helps terrorism.\" \nMeanwhile, hundreds of Iraqis are gathering in Baghdad to protest President Donald Trump's move. \nThe protest leader, Abdul-Latif al-Himaim from Iraq's Sunni Religious Endowments, told the protesters: \"Jerusalem is our identity, Jerusalem is Arab.\" \nHe says: \"You can uproot a palm tree from a grove, but you will not be able to uproot Jerusalem from our hearts and from Palestine.\" \nIraq is a key U.S. ally in the region, with more than 5,000 American troops remaining in Iraq, according to Pentagon. With the backing of the U.S.-led coalition, Iraqi forces have retaken nearly all territory held by the Islamic State group since 2014. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n11:35 a.m. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says President Donald Trump \"bound himself forever\" to the history of Jerusalem by recognizing the city as Israel's capital. \nNetanyahu claimed other states are considering following the U.S. lead and recognizing Jerusalem. He spoke on Thursday at the Foreign Ministry. \nNetanyahu says that \"we are already in contact with other states that will make a similar recognition.\" \nHe says the \"time has come\" and expressed confidence that others will follow suit and move their embassies to Jerusalem. \nMeanwhile, the Israeli military said it will be deploying additional troops to the West Bank ahead of Friday, when mass Palestinian protests are anticipated in response to Trump's move. \nThe army statement on Thursday says it will deploy several battalions to the territory while other troops have been put on alert to address \"possible developments.\" \nPalestinians went on strike across the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip on Thursday and protests are expected on Friday after midday prayers. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n11:25 a.m. \nThe top leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas is calling for a new uprising against Israel in the wake of President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nIsmail Haniyeh spoke to his followers in the Gaza Strip on Thursday and called the U.S. decision an \"aggression on our people and a war on our sanctuaries.\" \nHe says the uprising should begin Friday, the Muslim holy day. \nHaniyeh then added: \"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision.\" \nHamas killed hundreds of Israelis during an armed uprising in the early 2000s. But Hamas' ability to carry out attacks is more limited. Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, and many of Hamas' supporters in the West Bank have been arrested. \nEven so, Hamas possesses a large arsenal of rockets in Gaza capable of striking many areas in Israel. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n10:30 a.m. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, are condemning the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nIt's a rare public rebuke by the royal court of U.S. ally and President Donald Trump. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n9:40 a.m. \nSchools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n9:30 a.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nErdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nErdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nErdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n8:50 a.m. \nPalestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
