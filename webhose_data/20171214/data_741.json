Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 7:50 am \nUpdated at 5:50 a.m. ET \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nMarriage in Australia is now defined as \"the union of two people\" instead of \"union of a man and a woman.\" \nLawmakers had tried and failed some two dozen times in the past to make the change. \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of the 80 percent of registered voters who cast ballots, ensuring that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\" Copyright 2017 NPR.

The 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act, which called for the U.S. Embassy to be moved to Jerusalem, passed by a large bipartisan margin and was strongly supported by Jewish-American groups. \n\"It's been the consensus mainline view for decades,\" said Nathan Diament, executive director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, \"because Jerusalem is the capital city for Israel and the Jewish people. ... The United States puts its embassies in capital cities, and it's unjust and discriminatory to say we're going to single out Israel as the one country where we don't put our embassy [in the capital].\" \nWhen President Trump on Wednesday ordered the State Department to begin preparations to move the embassy to Jerusalem, several Jewish-American groups welcomed the move. \n\"By stating the truth of Jerusalem's status as the capital of the State of Israel, President Trump has asserted U.S. global leadership towards ending a longstanding, senseless anomaly,\" said David Harris, chief executive officer of the American Jewish Committee. \nThe Anti-Defamation League, while urging a \"rapid resumption\" of peace negotiations, called the move a \"significant step,\" coming at a time \"when international organizations and other detractors delegitimize the Jewish state and deny any Jewish connection to the holy city.\" \nBut there were also misgivings from some Jewish-American groups. The Reform Jewish Movement, representing nearly 900 congregations, noted that it has long supported the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital but also believed that moving the U.S. Embassy there should happen only \"at the right time.\" Without a comprehensive peace plan, the movement said it cannot support the president's decision to move the embassy now. \nConservative evangelical Christian leaders had fewer qualms. \n\"This decision will be met by political praise and theological conviction,\" said Johnnie Moore, an informal spokesman for Trump's evangelical advisory group. \"Evangelicals in every corner of the United States will be ecstatic,\" he said. \nEvangelicals feel a special kinship with Jerusalem as the city where they believe Jesus Christ was crucified and rose again. Some sects even take an eschatological view, arguing that Jesus will return to Earth in Jerusalem, once all Jews are reunited there. \nFor Trump's evangelical advisory group, said Moore, the only issue more important than the status of Jerusalem is the question of who will be appointed as federal judges. \n\"In our various meetings with the White House, this issue has always come up,\" Moore said. \"And it has always been an extended discussion around the table. I mean, at the heart of the relationship between the United States and Israel has been the friendship between evangelical Christians and the Jewish people.\" \nSome evangelical leaders who generally support the president's Jerusalem decision, however, fear the repercussions for their own Palestinian Christian followers. Muslim leaders in the Palestinian territories have warned there will be a reaction there to the president's announcement. The governments of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Turkey all expressed alarm at Trump's decision, as did Muslim leaders in the U.S. \n\"The reality is that Palestinians have existed for generations on the land of Palestine [and] in Jerusalem,\" said Osama Abuirshaid, a board member of the American Muslims for Palestine, at a news conference near the White House. \"[Trump] cannot deny this reality,\" Abuirshaid said. \"He spoke about the Jewish connection to Jerusalem while negating the Christian and Muslim connection to the land and to the holy city.\" \nPope Francis advised against \"adding new elements of tension in a world already shaken and scarred by many cruel conflicts.\" The heads of several Christian churches in Jerusalem, in a joint letter to Trump, said a unilateral change in the status of Jerusalem by the U.S. government \"will yield increased hatred, conflict, violence, and suffering in Jerusalem and the Holy Land ... [and] cause irreparable harm.\" \nA similar warning came from Elizabeth Eaton, the presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the largest Lutheran group in the U.S. \n\"This announcement,\" Eaton said, \"has a high probability of leading to violence and bloodshed and not ... getting any closer to having the two parties come to the table again.\" \nEaton spoke following a meeting in Geneva with fellow Lutheran chuch leaders from around the world, including those in Jordan and other Arab countries.

But the one thing which doesn't distinguish the division is the traditional political party structure. And therein lies May's problen.\nIf there were a more straightforward division on left-right or Tory-Labour then another GE could settle many of the issues. But unfortunately, the divisions are far more nuanced than that.

CNN 16 hrs ago By Matt Wotus and Judson Jones, CNN California Wildfires Dry conditions and the Santa Ana winds are being blamed for at least five fast-moving wildfires that have burned more than 65,000 acres in Southern California.\nThe term \"Santa Ana winds\" gets thrown around a lot by Southern California meteorologists and even shows up in \" I Love L.A. ,\" Randy Newman's classic ode to Los Angeles.\nBut what are they, exactly?\nThe National Weather Service defines the Santa Ana wind as \"a weather condition in which strong, hot, dust-bearing winds descend to the Pacific Coast around Los Angeles from inland desert regions.\"\n\u00a9 Rex Features via AP View form the Thomas Fire over Santa Paula. Thomas Wildfire, Santa Paula, Los Angeles, USA - 05 Dec 2017 The fire has burned more than 10,000 acres and caused at least one death as of filing. The fire is also casuing rolling blackouts across Ventura County. The fire has been aided by strong Santa Ana winds with gusts of 40 to 60mph. The strong winds have also grounded firefighter's helicopters. (Rex Features via AP Images) The winds often pass through Santa Ana Canyon, east of Los Angeles; thus the name.\nThe weather condition is most common in the period of October through March when the desert is relatively cold, and the winds develop as high pressure builds over the Great Basin in Nevada, according to the UCLA Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences .\nAs the cold air there begins to descend, it's forced downslope toward the Pacific Ocean, causing it to compress and warm as it falls. The air starts out dry, but the relative humidity decreases as the temperature increases, causing the air to end up even drier once it reaches sea level.\n\u00a9 NASA A NASA image from space shows the Southern California wildfires. The air gains speed as it goes through passes and canyons. The result is the strong, hot Santa Ana winds, which increase the potential for wildfires by drying out vegetation. The winds also accelerate the speed of wildfires once they start.\nAccording to a report from the Southern California Geographic Coordination Center, multi-day Santa Ana wind events aren't uncommon during the winter months. The highest number of wind days occur in December and January. Both months also see the highest number of days with moderate to strong wind events.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://people.atmos.ucla.edu/fovell/ASother/mm5/SantaAna/winds.html", "http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/06/us/ventura-fire-southern-california/index.html", "https://gacc.nifc.gov/oscc/predictive/weather/myfiles/Santa_Ana_Wind_Season_Outlook.pdf", "http://www.cnn.com/", "http://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=santa%20ana%20wind", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcADqxnQA_4"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt wotus", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "judson jones", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "santa paula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "randy newman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas wildfire", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "national weather service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucla department of atmospheric and oceanic sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern california geographic coordination center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "santa ana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa ana canyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "great basin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l.a.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:26.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ddc861bcb1e5a17136ed50ff8fac666e140dbecc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSNhmZEbhKAgfcMOrqlCc5UP3K0l00eQOI2Y.417rKXYy6IKofm.GYKw51cUrT7e_JgiDaXJDlTil9wk1AY9kijCF4_c61UmQSMhNb3QzZ8XtYUXX_HwB4i", "site_full": "www.thetvdb.com", "site": "thetvdb.com", "site_section": "http://thetvdb.com/rss/newtoday.php", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "TheTVDB.com Today's New Episodes", "title": "S.W.A.T.

That's because they already pay the estate tax. \nThe bills approved by Congress recently would eliminate or reduce the estate tax, while leaving the exemption in place. \nIn other words, you would be able to pass on assets that have gained a lot in value \u2014 like those Apple shares you bought years ago \u2014 and, unlike everyone else, your heirs never have to pay tax on the appreciation. \nTo put it another way: Someone could inherit her grandfather's large beachfront mansion without paying estate tax, and sell it off right away without paying any capital gains tax. \nIt's a much more generous policy than previous tax overhauls, says Lily Batchelder, a professor of law and public policy at New York University Law School. \n\"We've never seen a proposal like this,\" she says. \"I don't recall ever seeing a proposal that would both fully repeal the estate tax and fully exempt from tax all the accrued gains on these giant estates.\" \nThe bill passed by the Senate early Saturday would double the exemption on large estates, allowing people to pass on estates worth $11 million to their heirs tax-free. \nThe exemption for married couples would be $22 million. The House bill would gradually reduce the estate tax and then scrap it altogether in 2023. \nHouse and Senate leaders are now trying to reconcile the two versions of the tax overhaul, with a vote expected by the end of the month. \nThe estate tax has long been the bane of conservatives. Congress briefly eliminated the tax in 2010, but it came back the following year and remains in place today. \n\"We just think it's unfair. Death should not be a taxable event. And we should not be stopping people from being able to pass their life's work on to their kids,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told Fox News recently. \nThe estate tax brings in a relatively small amount of money to the federal Treasury, about $19 billion a year, even as it hurts the large economy, says Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation. \nBecause of the tax, people end up pouring money into tax shelters and paying hefty bills to tax lawyers, he says. \nThe tax is especially onerous for assets that may be worth a lot on paper but are cash poor, such as certain kinds of businesses, Hodge says. In some cases, heirs have to break up or sell businesses to pay taxes, he says. \nPeople who want to keep the tax say such cases are extremely rare. They also say that at a time of growing income inequality, the estate tax plays an important role in making the economy fair. \n\"The estate tax is basically a way of partially leveling the playing field, so that these heirs of massive estates don't have quite as gigantic a leg up in life,\" Batchelder says.

For the 2018 show, there will be more than 200 free seminars on everything from sailing around the world to transiting the Ballard Locks using a \u2018no-mayhem\u2019 approach, and advanced seminars for a fee through Boat Show University. On the fishing and crabbing stage there will be 55 free seminars by the Northwest\u2019s top-notch fishing experts providing anglers with an in-depth wealth of knowledge on how to catch fish and crab across the Pacific Northwest. Loyal seminar attendees from previous years will notice some new faces and new topics this year that are sure to get anglers hooked into new locations and varieties of fish. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better place to live where fishing is a year-round proposition, and one day you can be chasing fish on a river, and then hit a lake or marine area the following day. We are fortunate to have so many excellent choices on where to catch fish, and so many local experts who are more than happy to share their vast knowledge of sport fisheries with show attendees,\u201d says Mark Yuasa, director of Grow Boating Programs/NW Salmon Derby Series for the Northwest Marine Trade Association. \u201cThe greater variety of seminars offered this year have enormous value that anglers can take on their next outing.\u201d Of interest and great value to those considering attending numerous seminars on multiple days will be the new Unlimited Pass. The $40 e-ticket includes admission on all nine show days as well as free parking on any or all days at Bell Street Pier Garage or on weekends at the Yale Avenue Garage at South Lake Union.

Brad Hole , kayak fishing guide and founder of Kayak Fishing Washington , has taken this style of fishing to a whole new level. In his seminar Brad will go over how to get started, plus share tips on how to catch everything from trout, salmon and bass to monster-sized sturgeon as well as filling a pot with Dungeness crabs. Many anglers are finding out just how excellent winter and early spring fishing can be for trophy-sized kokanee in eastern Washington\u2019s expansive Lake Roosevelt. Austin Moser , owner of Austin\u2019s Northwest Adventures is the \u201cgo to\u201d person on what to use for gear and bait, trolling tactics and location of these excellent tasting fish commonly known as a landlocked sockeye salmon. He\u2019ll share his tips for catching those beauties. Keith Robbins , owner of A Spot Tail Salmon Guide in Seattle is not new to the show with his seminar on the \u201cold school\u201d way of catching salmon via mooching in Puget Sound. But he also has a vast knowledge of how to fly-fish for coastal cutthroat and salmon that inhabit nearly all bodies of water in the Pacific Northwest. He\u2019ll share his knowledge in his new \u201cFly Fishing in Puget Sound\u201d seminar.

K-12 \nLet's start with K-12. There, Republicans from both sides of Congress generally agree on two big changes. \nSaving for private school \nTaxpayers can currently save money for college through a 529 plan, where earnings grow tax-free. Many states also offer deductions for contributions. In the proposals, Republicans want to let taxpayers use 529s to pay for K-12 tuition at private and religious schools, too. Families can already do that with a different plan \u2014 Coverdell Education Savings Accounts \u2014 but these have low contribution limits and aren't open to high-income Americans. The move to expand the 529 would dramatically increase who could use these plans and the money they could save. \n\"I think the only taxpayers who will be in a position to benefit from the 529 change are very rich people,\" says Nora Gordon, an economist and associate professor at Georgetown University. She says using these accounts to save for elementary or high school won't help much unless you can afford to set aside a lot of money early on. No wonder, when the Government Accountability Office studied 529s and Coverdells a few years ago, it found \"families with these accounts had about 25 times the median financial assets\" of those who didn't use them and \"about three times the median income.\" \nWhile the proposed expansion of 529 plans would largely help affluent parents who use private schools, Republicans are proposing another change that could hurt funding for the nation's public schools. \nThe SALT (state and local taxes) deduction \nUp to now, taxpayers who itemize their deductions \u2014 generally high-earners who make up about a third of households in the U.S. \u2014 have gotten a break from the federal government for paying state and local taxes. \nThink of it as a kind of rebate \u2014 courtesy of Washington \u2014 that ultimately helps state and local governments pay for important things, like schools, among other things. \nRepublicans now want to cut that discount, getting rid of the income and sales tax deductions and putting a $10,000 cap on the deduction for property taxes. \n\"This bill is going to make it more painful for residents to increase local property taxes to pay for public schools,\" says John Friedman, an associate professor of economics at Brown University. \nOn average, nearly half of public schools' funding (45 percent) comes from local taxes, often property taxes. In the past, when locals hiked these taxes to help pay for their schools, the federal government made the hike hurt less with that SALT deduction. So imagine, if Congress caps the property tax deduction, for high earners who already pay a lot \u2014 in places like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, even Texas \u2014 a new hike would hurt more than it used to. \n\"This is a really big deal for some states and no deal at all for other states. And the states that it's a really big deal for are blue states,\" says Nora Gordon of Georgetown. \"They're states with higher cost of living, higher property values and states that spend more on their state and local government.\" \nWhile local taxes provide nearly half of public school dollars, state taxes account for much of the rest (46 percent). Kim Rueben of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says states often use these sales and income taxes to help their poorest schools. \n\"The money from the state ends up helping to prop up school districts that have less ability to raise money from the property tax,\" she says. Getting rid of these deductions, Rueben says, will make state-level taxes more painful for some and, again, could make it harder to raise money for schools in the future. \nImportant context: All this is happening with many school districts still reeling from the Great Recession. According to a recent analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, after adjusting for inflation, \"twenty-nine states provided less overall state funding per student in the 2015 school year than in the 2008 school year, before the recession took hold.\" Higher education \nThe two tax bills are farther apart when it comes to higher education. \nIn the House: fewer tuition benefits \nWe've heard a lot about graduate students' reaction to the proposal to tax their tuition waivers as income. \nAs Ariana Figueroa reported for NPR: \n\"Many grad students \u2014 especially in Ph.D. programs \u2014 receive tuition waivers in exchange for teaching classes or doing research. Under current law, that money isn't taxed as income. But the House bill calls for those tuition waivers to be counted as income and subjected to income taxes. \nThat means graduate students would be paying taxes on money they never receive.\" \nThe House bill also cuts or reduces other higher education tax benefits: The Hope Scholarship Credit The Lifetime Learning Credit and tuition deduction The deduction on interest for those repaying student loans The American Opportunity Tax Credit, which students and families can use to offset college tuition payments, is limited to exclude part-time and graduate students, although it is also extended for a fifth year. \nTogether, the axed benefits are worth about $6.5 billion a year to students and families, according to the American Council on Education. \nThe Senate bill doesn't include any of the above. \nState funding for public higher education may also be in jeopardy, for the same reasons we discussed above \u2014 a consequence of getting rid of the deductions for SALT. Scaling back, or cutting federal discounts to taxpayers may cause a squeeze on funding for state universities and colleges. \nPrivate college penalties \nBoth public and private colleges have expressed concern that fewer people are going to be taking the charitable deduction, because of the increase in the standard deduction. They're worried this will lead, in turn, to less money in donations. The American Council on Education estimates about $100 billion less a year in donations across all nonprofits. \nThere are also some provisions in the House and Senate bills that target private colleges specifically. One provision would levy a tax on investment gains for a small group of private colleges that have very large endowments on a per-student basis. Currently, this money grows tax-free thanks to the colleges' nonprofit status. \nThis affects about 65 private colleges with extremely large endowments. But even more colleges are worried about it, says Terry Hartle of the American Council on Education. \n\"Even though public universities are not affected by the endowment tax, they are very much opposed to it, for fear it would set a precedent that would be applied to them in the future.\" \nCulture war? \nThe tax plans, which passed on party lines in both the House and Senate, are aligned with a broader Republican agenda. On the K-12 side, cuts that impact the source of public school funding are coming hand in hand with special tax benefits for families with means to put aside money for private school tuition. \nOn the higher education side, Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and adviser to the Trump campaign, told Bloomberg that Republicans are going after university endowments because \"universities have become playpens of the left.\" Amplifying that point, a recent Pew Research Center poll showed there is a sharply rising partisan gap on higher education, with 58 percent of Republicans saying colleges have a negative effect on the country, while 72 percent of Democrats say they have a positive impact.

Back to Article news Some unhappy national service personnel have filed a suit against the Executive Director of the service over the over the mandatory insurance package introduced for them by the National Service Secretariat. The Executive Director of NSS has sent circulars to all its regional director to charge all personnel a compulsory GHC15 for an insurance package. However, the complainants; Solomon Anapansah, Toxla Caleb Elikem, Kwadzodeh Enoch Lelabi and Timothy Donkor, say they have not instructed the NSS to enter into any insurance arrangement on their behalf. Earlier on some NSS personnel also petitioned the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) to look into the same matter. The Insurance Package According to the NSS, National service personnel who suffer permanent or temporary disability through accidents during the service year will now be entitled to GH\u00a215,000 insurance cover. The next of kin of service persons who die while undertaking the mandatory national exercise, will receive the same amount from Glico Life.

However, a former NSS boss Dr Micheal Kpessa Whyte, has described the mandatory insurance for NSS personnel as \u201c daylight robbery. \u201d | Tweet Do you ever witness news or have a story that should be featured on Pulse Ghana?

These findings are published in Transparency Market Research\u2019s study, titled \u2018Auto-Injectors Market \u2013 Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2014 \u2013 2020\u2019. \nRead Report overview @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/global-auto-injectors-\u2026 \nThe study states that the global auto-injectors market will rise from its 2013 valuation of US$665.0 mn to rise to US$2.5 bn by 2020, with enormous opportunities existing in RoW markets and emerging economies. An alarming increase in the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis and various food allergies will further create opportunities for the growth of the auto injectors market globally. TMR analysts identify a major roadblock standing in the way of companies trying to occupy a larger revenue share in the auto-injectors market: The high prices of auto-injectors. The price factor assumes greater importance when it comes to patients in emerging economies, where, incidentally, the most lucrative growth opportunities lie. \nglobal-auto-injectors-market \nEven so, the demand for auto injectors will continue to rise consistently as patients opt to choose these products for their ease of use, even during self-administration. The report segments the global auto injectors market on the basis of product type, manufacturing design, therapeutic application, and geography. On the basis of product type, the market is segmented into prefilled or disposable auto injectors and fillable or reusable auto injectors. Given their unmatched ease of use, pre-filled auto injectors made up the largest segment in the auto injectors market by product type. \nLikewise, using manufacturing design as a criterion, the global auto-injectors market has been segmented into customized and standardized auto injectors. Although the standardized injectors segment was the larger one in 2013, the growth of the customized auto-injectors segment will be the fastest through the report\u2019s forecast period.Moving further, the report segments the auto-injectors market by therapeutic application into anaphylaxis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and others. The high prevalence of anaphylaxis has created a massive demand for auto injectors for administrating drugs to people suffering from this condition. This factor has made the anaphylaxis the largest application segment in the auto injectors market. \nRequest Sample Report@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag\u2026 \nFrom the geographical standpoint, the market for auto injectors is segmented into North America, Asia Pacific, Europe, and Rest of the World (RoW). Claiming a 70% stake in the global auto-injectors market, North America was seen to be the largest regional market in 2013. While the dominant position of North America will not see a drastic change, the Asia Pacific market will report the fastest rate of growth. The key recommendations of TMR\u2019s analysts, discussed in detail in the report, include: Channeling investments into China and India, spearheading innovation in auto injectors, and improving consumer awareness through marketing campaigns. \nCompanies profiled in detail in the auto-injectors market report include: Pfizer, Inc., Becton, Dickinson & Co., Mylan, Inc., Antares Pharma Inc., Novartis International AG, Unilife Corp., Ypsomed Holding AG, Biogen Idec, and Scandinavian Health Ltd. \nAbout TMR \nTransparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company providing business information reports and services.

Alex Wong / Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 10:54 am \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Strzok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets.

December 7, 2017, 3:05 PM \nBy Charissa Luci-Atienza \nA consumer group is urging the bicameral conference committee tasked to scrutinize the proposed Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) to further conduct in-depth study and look into the economic impact of the revenue-generating measure before passing it. \nIn a letter to Davao City Rep. Karlo Alexei Nograles, chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations dated December 5, Alyansa ng mga Grupong Haligi ng Agham at Teknolohiya para sa Mamamayan, Inc. or AGHAM (Filipino for \u201cScience\u201d) reminded the bicameral panel to ensure that new taxes that will be imposed should be \u201cfair and equitable.\u201d AGHAM President Angelo B. Palmones(AGHAM Partylist Facebook page / MANILA BULLETIN) \n\u201cAGHAM believes the Honorable Bicameral Conference Committee should conduct further research and verify the economic impact of the proposed tax reform before the proposed TRAIN tax reform is passed,\u201d AGHAM President Angelo B. Palmones said in his two-page letter to Nograles. \n\u201cThe consumer group holds that the imposition of drastic increase in taxes should be fair and equitable to the taxpayers,\u201d he said. \nThe letter was also sent to the Senate. \nPalmones, a former congressman, expressed concern that all the members of AGHAM , who are consumers of electricity \u201cwill be directly affected financially\u201d by the passage of Senate Bill No. 1592 and House Bill No. 5636, also known as the TRAIN. \n\u201cParticularly, in the Senate Bill 1592, while intended to be a revenue acceleration measure, it is actually replete with taxation rates and provisions that seem to be surreptitious insertions without proper and legal basis,\u201d he said. \nThe group noted that the proposal for the amendment of the excise tax imposed on coal as a \u201cmineral and mineral product(s),\u201d imposing a nearly 3,000% hike in three tranches from 2018 to 2020, is \u201covertly excessive.\u201d \nAGHAM said the imposition of excise tax on coal under the TRAIN appears to be imposed as an environmental measure to prevent coal from being used as a fossil fuel by generating, manufacturing, and other large plants that require efficient and stable sources of heat to produce an end-product. \n\u201cIn order to be a valid environmental measure, it should not be grossly discriminatory and excessive in nature. Otherwise, while we also support the reduction of the effects of greenhouse gases to alleviate climate change, the drastic increase in the excise tax on coal will gravely affect consumers \u2013 both industrial and manufacturing industries, whose competitiveness in the global market may be curtailed, as well as end-users who will ultimately shoulder this tax measure\u2019s impact of increased prices for basic commodities \u2013 possibly even worse than the benefits our nation stands to gain by the proposed tax measure,\u201d Palmones said. \nHe said his group also opposed the provision in the House Bill No. 5636 proposing an excise tax on kerosene as fuel, with a tax rate of P3 per liter for 2018, P5 for 2019, and P6 for 2020. \n\u201cIt will be confiscatory to the general consuming public especially if taken together with the proposed increase in excise tax on diesel and bunker fuel oil, which, like coal, are being used as fuel for machineries that require efficient, fast-starting and reliable source of heat and electricity,\u201d Palmones said.

A rear wheel drive transmission has three shafts - input, counter shaft and output. These are called layshaft. Both the input and output rotates independently at different speeds and one-piece slides into the hollow bore and is supported by bearings. Transmission gears and shafts are manufactured generally done as per the specifications of the clients. The way it operates is not universal as fixed and fear gear can either be mounted on input or output shaft or both of them. If you are looking for the best transmission components, go through http://avtec.in/avtec-engine-transmission-component and look at features of its components. \u00b7 Some high hobbling, shaping and shaving machines are used for producing gears and shafts. \u00b7 World-class testing equipment are used for checking all parameters of transmission components. \u00b7 Efficiency and cost effectiveness is taken care of during manufacturing of such components. \u00b7 Transmission that does not feature direct drive is an advantage for input and output as it reduces the amount of torsion that the transmission needs to bear. The input shaft is one pinion gear that drives the counter shaft. Along with these are gears of various sizes that rotate when the input shaft rotates and it corresponds to forward speed and reverse. Most front wheel drive transmission is designed uniquely. They have two shafts, input and counter shaft that are also called input and output. In a conventional rear drive transmission; there are three shafts - input, output and counter shaft. The gears eliminate one major component i.e. the pinion gear. Input and output are lined on rear drive unit for relieving torsion stress on transmission and mounting. The distribution of shift matters as much as design matter. Shafts and gears that are used should be highly durable, material robust and have dimensional accuracy.

Michael Masters / Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 7:50 am \nUpdated at 5:50 a.m. ET \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nMarriage in Australia is now defined as \"the union of two people\" instead of \"union of a man and a woman.\" \nLawmakers had tried and failed some two dozen times in the past to make the change. \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of the 80 percent of registered voters who cast ballots, ensuring that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott barbour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george brandis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "parliament approves same-sex marriage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images members of parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "npr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the sydney morning herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "federation square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images  australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:29.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb1e8e6679f6b334dd64a662214cb1d66a854804", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhP.TRyeSYofgFywv1XC3GL1I9EUQRx6aGKtfiPb3pnSW6Si.PvlwRSJJu1nqX1ZyfZoCNNTSOJWgYRBa_vZkaI7ijiGKhBStMLRpWOZUR344kWC6RPU_hmtehZQQLFFzgfD7dS_i_ymIoTpcuYfRLYiAeMllGwjDVj721xg_usItaPy51sM4_2DOpm_2eJWWs2ImXgcXc1bdc-", "site_full": "www.military-technologies.net", "site": "military-technologies.net", "site_section": "http://www.military-technologies.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["table_tennis_ping_pong", "financial_news", "finance", "sports"], "section_title": "MilTech", "title": "Data Quality Tools Global Market Top Key Players \u2013 Experian , Informatica , SAP , SAS Institute , Trillium Software (Harte Hanks Company) and Forecast to 2021", "title_full": "Data Quality Tools Global Market Top Key Players \u2013 Experian , Informatica , SAP , SAS Institute , Trillium Software (Harte Hanks Company) and Forecast to 2021", "published": "2017-12-07T10:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cb1e8e6679f6b334dd64a662214cb1d66a854804", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhP.TRyeSYofgFywv1XC3GL1I9EUQRx6aGKtfiPb3pnSW6Si.PvlwRSJJu1nqX1ZyfZoCNNTSOJWgYRBa_vZkaI7ijiGKhBStMLRpWOZUR344kWC6RPU_hmtehZQQLFFzgfD7dS_i_ymIoTpcuYfRLYiAeMllGwjDVj721xg_usItaPy51sM4_2DOpm_2eJWWs2ImXgcXc1bdc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rony Delucia", "published": "2017-12-07T10:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "Data Quality Tools Global Market Top Key Players \u2013 Experian , Informatica , SAP , SAS Institute , Trillium Software (Harte Hanks Company) and Forecast to 2021", "text": "Source: imported from this press release . \nPR Agency: WiseGuy Research Consultants Pvt.

Mittel S.p.A currently has a total float of 75.55M shares and on average sees 67,204 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 1.3 and high of 2.168. FTSE MIB (Milano Italia Borsa) Index: Driving Italy Economy \nFTSE MIB Index is the equity index of 40 largest, most active and most liquid stocks on Italy\u2019s stock market. And Mittel S.p.A works with them as well. The index is market capitalization-weighted and free-floated adjusted. \nFTSE MIB replaced MIB-30 in 2004. The Standard & Poor\u2019s operated the index until June 2009 when it relinquished the administration of the benchmark index to FTSE Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of London Stock Exchange Group, which is also the parent company of Borsa Italiana, the nation stock exchange in Italy. Mittel S.p.A prefer to appear at both markets. \nFTSE MIB index hit a record high of 50108.56 points in March 2000. The index reached its lowest mark on record of 12362.50 points in July 2012 as fears over Spain\u2019s debt crisis and rising cost of borrowing in Europe rattled the stock market in the region. \nComponents of FTSE MIB represent sectors such as Energy, Financials, Mining, Manufacturing and Telecommunications. The index accounts for 80% of the total market cap of Italia Borsa stock exchange. \nFTSE MIB is reshuffled quarterly where components that have fallen short of inclusion requirements are dropped and newly qualified stocks added. But companies must meet certain stringent eligibility requirements before their stocks can be added in the index. \nRebalancing of FTSE MIB is also done to reflect the changes in the market cap of its constituents, which may come as a result of new shares being issued or debt being converted to stock. The stock market \nItalia Borsa is Italy\u2019s main stock of Italian companies and it\u2019s fondly known to as Piazza Affari, referring to its Milan headquarters building called Palazzo Mezzanotte. \nItalia Borsa was established in February 1808. Until 1998 when the exchange was sold to a group of banks, it operated as a public entity from its inception. The exchange was acquired by London Stock Exchange group in an all-stock deal in 2007. Following the acquisition, Italia Borsa was merged with the London Stock Exchange. Other than stocks, Italia Borsa is also a platform for trading other securities such as bonds, including Eurobonds. Trading hours \nItalia Borsa is open all weekdays except on holidays. The market is closed on weekends. Trading on Italia Borsa begins with a pre-market session that runs between 8.00 a.m. and 9.00 a.m. Regular trading session on the platform starts at 9.00 a.m. and continues until 5.30 p.m. On the back of the regular trading comes post-market session that begins at 6.00 p.m. and runs until 8.30 p.m. That is the time to stop the trading day for Mittel S.p.A. \nThe long trading hours means that the exchange is accommodative for a variety of investors because there is ample room to schedule trading hours, especially for overseas investors who may be in different time zones. \nItalia Borsa uses electronic trading system and more than 130 domestic and foreign brokers operate on the platform. More than 340 companies are listed on Italia Borsa. Interest building up for Italian stocks \nItalian stocks are heating up lately as investors take notice of the country\u2019s improving growth prospects. Some investors are betting that Italy might benefit from the Brexit fallout as some of the companies leaving the U.K. move to pitch tents in the country and create employment. Increased employment and improving incomes should boost consumer purchasing power and drive up company earnings. Consumers are interested in the reliability of Mittel S.p.A. \nMore news for Mittel S.p.A (BIT:MIT) were recently published by: Pehub.com, which released: \u201cMittel takes majority stake in Italian auto parts maker IMC\u201d on September 13, 2017. Reuters.com\u2018s article titled: \u201cBRIEF-Mittel appoints Rosario Bifulco as new CEO\u201d and published on November 16, 2015 is yet another important article. \nMittel S.p.A., together with its subsidiaries, engages in the equity financial advisory, investment management, and real estate activities primarily in Italy.

To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. \nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: \nSome breaking news from Minnesota tonight. Minnesota Public Radio News reports that Senator Al Franken will announce his resignation from the Senate tomorrow. His decision comes after at least 30 Senate Democrats, including leader Chuck Schumer, today called on Franken to step down. Joining us now from the Capitol is NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis. Hey there. \nSUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey there. \nKELLY: So these allegations of sexual harassment against Franken have been out there for weeks. What changed today that prompted this avalanche of Democrats to call for him to step aside? \nDAVIS: Politico reported this morning about a seventh accuser. It was an anonymous woman, but she alleged that in 2006 then Al Franken, who was a comedian, not yet a senator, had - again - forcibly tried to kiss her. This is what a group of female senators, including New York Democrat Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, said for them was the tipping point. This morning, in a very rapid succession, about a half a dozen female Democratic senators put out statements calling for him to resign. And they sort of started an avalanche. From that point throughout the day, Democrats in the Senate, one after another, just started calling for Franken to resign. \nI spoke to several Democratic aides who had said that this was a conversation that had been happening quietly inside the Democratic caucus for several days now but that it was just determined that it was time for him to go. I do want to add one note of caution - that the senator's office tweeted out that his final decision had not been made. He will make an announcement tomorrow. But Democrats here in the Capitol tonight certainly expect that that announcement will be his resignation. \nKELLY: Now, this, of course, comes just a day after Michigan Democratic Congressman John Conyers resigned over sexual harassment allegations. Is this starting to add up to a message that Democrats are sending? \nDAVIS: You know, we have to also talk about that this is happening, one, in this broader context of this national conversation, and then within politics, it's also happening as the Alabama Senate races is playing out. \nKELLY: Sure. \nDAVIS: And I think Democrats, particularly following President Trump's decision to re-back Roy Moore and for the Republican National Committee to get back into that race even though Moore is facing similar allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault, Democrats want to draw contrasts. Party leaders like Nancy Pelosi are saying that they want to be a party of zero tolerance towards this kind of behavior. And I would note that it might not be over. There are two additional sitting congressmen in the House - a Republican from Texas, Blake Farenthold, and a Democrat from Nevada, Ruben Kihuen - who are facing allegations of sexual harassment, and they are also facing some calls to step aside. \nKELLY: Well, other than calling for lawmakers to step aside, what else is Congress doing in response to all of these allegations? Is there some sort of legislative action, some bill brewing? \nDAVIS: It's actually been quite a lot. Already both chambers in the House and the Senate have passed new rules to mandate sexual harassment training for everyone that works here, including lawmakers, once a year. They also have competing legislation that would affect both internally how sexual harassment is handled inside the Capitol. And today, Gillibrand introduced a bipartisan bill that would essentially end forced arbitration in private companies when - they say as many as 60 million Americans, when you sign up to work for a company, part of your terms of employment or that if you have a sexual harassment complaint, it has to go through a mandatory private arbitration process. They want to get rid of that. \nI would note at this event today that I covered they also had former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson there to make a statement because she was one of these women, these tipping point women, that started this national conversation. So, yeah, you know, there's just - there's significant momentum, and I would say this has bipartisan support. There's a lot of Republicans in support of this legislation who want to capture this cultural moment and send a message that it's time to sort of remake how we think about the American workplace. \nKELLY: And real quick, Sue, to circle you back to Al Franken - if he does say he's resigning, what happens to his seat? \nDAVIS: They have a Democratic governor, it's Mark Dayton. He would get to appoint an interim senator. He's a Democrat, so there's no chance this seat will flip in the short term. Whoever that senator is will have to run for re-election in the 2018 midterms. \nKELLY: And we'll see. Maybe he'll pick a woman. Who knows? Thanks very much, Sue. \nDAVIS: You're welcome. \nKELLY: That's NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis.
