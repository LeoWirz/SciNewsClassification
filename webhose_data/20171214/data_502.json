Bought VND from Centrum. While the internet rate was 0.0028, they gave for 0.0038, which now i realize was an absolute loot and total daylight robbery. Better to just carry a few VND for immediate necessity and carry US $'s instead and exchange there as and when you need it. You will get a better deal. I bought a few items through Credit Card and even that turned out cheaper than when i checked with the 0.0038 rate given by Centrum. Also if planning is done properly book all your hotels in INR through booking.com or similar hotel booking sites.

With President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un exchanging threats and insults, why would the media bother with something innocuously labeled \u201cMalabar 17\u201d? \nThey should have. \nMalabar 17 brought together the U.S., Japanese, and Indian navies to practice shutting down a waterway through which 80 percent of China\u2019s energy supplies travel and to war game closing off the Indian Ocean to Chinese submarines. If Korea keeps you up at night, try imagining the outcome of choking off fuel for the world\u2019s second largest economy. \nWhile Korea certainly represents the most acute crisis in Asia, the diplomatic maneuvers behind Malabar 17 may be more dangerous in the long run. The exercise elevates the possibility of a confrontation between China, the U.S. and India, but also between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed countries that have fought three wars in the past 70 years. \nThis tale begins more than a decade and a half ago, when then Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Douglas Feith \u2014one of the most hawkish members of the George W. Bush administration\u2014convened a meeting in May 2002 of the US-India Defense Policy Group and the government of India. \nAs one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement, India traditionally avoided being pulled into the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. \nBut the Bush administration had a plan for roping Indian into an alliance aimed at containing China, with a twist on an old diplomatic strategy: no stick, lots of carrots. \nAt the time India was banned from purchasing uranium on the international market because it had detonated a nuclear weapon in 1974 and refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). There was a fear that if India had nuclear weapons, eventually so would Pakistan, a fear that turned real in 1998 when Islamabad tested its first nuclear device. \nPakistan also refused to sign the NPT. \nUnder the rules of the Treaty, both countries were excluded from the 45-member Nuclear Suppliers Group. While the ban was not a serious problem for Pakistan\u2014it has significant uranium deposits\u2014it was for India. With few domestic resources, India had to balance between using its uranium for weapons or to fuel nuclear power plants. Given that India is energy poor, that was a difficult choice. \nWhen the Bush administration took over in 2001, it immediately changed the designation of China from \u201c strategic partner\u201d to \u201cstrategic competitor.\u201d It also resumed arms sales to New Delhi despite India\u2019s 1998 violation of the NPT with a new round of tests. \nThen Washington offered a very big carrot called the 1-2-3 Agreement that allow India to bypass the NPT and buy uranium so long as it is not used for weapons. This, however, would allow India to shift all of its domestic fuel into weapons production. \nAt the time, Pakistan\u2014which asked for the same deal and was rebuffed\u2014warned that the Agreement would ignite a nuclear arms race in Asia, which is precisely what has happened. India and Pakistan are busily adding to their nuclear weapons stocks, as is China and, of course, North Korea. \nThe 1-2-3 Agreement went into effect in 2008, although it has not been fully implemented. \nComplicating this whole matter are on-going tensions between India and Pakistan in Kashmir, over which the two have fought three wars, the last of which came close to going nuclear. Rather than trying to defuse a very dangerous conflict, however, the Bush administration ignored Kashmir. So did the Obama administration, in spite of a pre-election promise by Barack Obama to deal with the on-going crisis. , \nIt would appear that a quid pro quo for India moving closer to the US is Washington\u2019s silence on Kashmir. \nIn 2016, the Obama administration designated India a \u201cMajor Defense Partner,\u201d made Japan a permanent member of the Malabar exercises, and began training Indian pilots in \u201cadvanced aerial combat\u201d at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. \nThe Trump administration has added to the tensions between India and Pakistan by encouraging New Delhi to deploy troops in Afghanistan. While India already has paramilitary road building units in Southern Afghanistan, it does not have regular armed forces. From Islamabad\u2019s point of view, Indian troops in Afghanistan will effectively sandwich Pakistan, north and south. So far, India has resisted the request. \nThe government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also rolled out a new military strategy called \u201cCold Start,\u201d which allows the Indian military to attack and pursue \u201cterrorists\u201d as deep as 30 kilometers into Pakistani territory. \nThe danger is that a \u201cCold Start\u201d operation could be misinterpreted by Islamabad as a major attack by the far larger Indian army. Faced with defeat, Pakistan might resort to tactical nuclear weapons, a decision that Pakistan has recently delegated to front-line commanders . Since India cannot respond in kind\u2014it has no tactical nukes\u2014New Delhi would either use its high yield strategic nuclear weapons or accept defeat. Since the latter is unlikely, the war could quickly escalate into a general nuclear exchange. \nSuch an exchange, according to a recent study by Scientific American, would not only kill tens of millions of people in both countries, it would cause a worldwide nuclear chill that would devastate agriculture in both hemispheres. In terms of impact, as scary as the Korea crisis is, a nuclear war between Pakistan and India would be qualitatively worse. \nDuring his recent Asia tour, Trump used the term \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d on a number of occasions, a term that was originally coined by the rightwing Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe. Japan is currently in a tense standoff with China over several uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, and Abe is trying to dismantle Japan\u2019s post-World War II \u201cpeace\u201d constitution that restricts Japanese armed forces to \u201cself-defense\u201d operations. \nAbe is also closely associated with a section of the Japanese political spectrum that argues that Japan was simply resisting western imperialism in World War II and denies or downplays its own colonial role and the massive atrocities committed by the Japanese army in China and Korea. \nAsia looks like a pretty scary place these days. A rightwing Hindu fundamentalist government in India and a revanchist Japanese Prime Minister are allied with an increasingly unstable administration in Washington to surround and contain the second largest economy in the world. \nThere are some hopeful developments, however. For one, following the recent Communist Party Congress, China seems to be looking for a way to turn down the heat in the region. After initially threatening South Korea for deploying a US anti-missile system, the THAAD, Beijing has stepped back and cut a deal: no additional THAAD systems, no boycott of South Korean goods. \nThe Chinese also dialed down tensions in the mountainous Doldam region on the border of China and Bhutan with an agreement for a mutual withdrawal of troops. There has been some progress as well in finding a non-confrontational solution to China\u2019s illegal claims in the South China Sea, although Beijing is not likely to abandon its artificial islands until there is a downsizing of US naval forces in the region. \nAnd in spite of the tensions between the two, India and Pakistan formally joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organization this past summer, a security grouping largely dominated by Russia and China. \nThe danger here is that someone does something stupid and things get out of hand. There are those who point out that in spite of similar tensions during the Cold War, all concerned survived those dark times. That, however, ignores the fact that the world came very close to nuclear war, once by design\u2014the Cuban missile crisis\u2014and several times by accident. \nIf you keep rolling the dice, eventually they come up snake eyes.

All the figures, the snowman and lamp posts near the track got flattened but never mind.

As of now, the raging fires in and around Los Angeles have been nothing more than a slight inconvenience for the Rams and Eagles. But both sides are monitoring the situation as Sunday\u2019s game at the Coliseum nears. REED SAXON \u2014 DIGITAL FIRST MEDIA By Bob Grotz, , @BobGrotz on Twitter Posted: # Comments \nCOSTA MESA, Calif. >> Wildfires aren\u2019t an issue here. The skies are clear and the air as pure as it\u2019s going to get in this part of Southern California. \nThe same with Anaheim, where the Birds are practicing at Angel Stadium and Disneyland is doing its 3D thing. \nRoughly 50 miles from the Eagles\u2019 hotel, however, the wind-driven fires are raging, destroying multi-million dollar homes and vegetation and creating issues for the Rams \u2014 and potentially the game Sunday at the Coliseum against the Eagles. \nLos Angeles is 17 miles from the edge of the carnage, which is close enough to ingest toxic fumes from the smoke. Advertisement \nThus, the Los Angeles Rams moved their regularly scheduled practice Wednesday in Oxnard indoors due to poor air quality. It\u2019s not known if the Thursday and Friday sessions will be impacted. \nWith road closures due to the fire, and smoke already billowing just 20 minutes from Los Angeles, there is at least a chance the game between the teams Sunday at the Coliseum in Los Angeles could be affected. \nEagles head coach Doug Pederson said he\u2019s heard nothing from the NFL about a postponement or cancellation. The matter is being monitored on every conceivable level. \n\u201cIt is obviously a serious issue with what\u2019s going on, and our thoughts and prayers are obviously with the people that are affected,\u201d Pederson said. \u201cI know the Rams were affected these last couple of days. And it makes it a little uncomforting and unsettling.\u201d \nRams head coach Sean McVay said on a conference call that the fires basically are an inconvenience. Scaling down the practice isn\u2019t that big of a deal at this point of the season. \n\u201cThey affect us a little bit with the things that recently developed,\u201d McVay said on a conference call. \u201cThe air quality isn\u2019t quite what you\u2019d like it to be to be able to go outside. But fortunately, because we are right next to Cal Lutheran\u2019s campus, we were able to go over to their gym, have a good walkthrough, kind of use both of their basketball gyms. That was kind of the approach we were going to take anyway. We just did it indoors, and we kind of kept the players off their feet more than we were accustomed to on a Wednesday. Being this late in the season, you do sometimes look into adjusting your practice plans to have a little bit more of an above-the-neck emphasis on a Wednesday. And that\u2019s what we did, and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to regain our normal practice schedule and get back out there tomorrow.\u201d \nSeveral Eagles who played for the Rams empathized with their former teammates. \n\u201cA lot of those guys live up north,\u201d defensive end Chris Long said. \u201cIt\u2019s a scary situation for everybody. I\u2019m sure for a lot of people it makes a football game less important. I hope everyone is alright. That\u2019s a scary deal.\u201d \nEagles cornerback Jaylen Watkins\u2019 brother, Sammy, who leads the Rams in touchdown receptions, is among those affected. \n\u201cHis place is north of LA,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cAs of now it\u2019s OK. But the potential is there.\u201d \nIf the game is rescheduled, it won\u2019t be the first time Pederson has been through the drill. Late in the 2010 season, the Eagles had a Sunday game pushed back to Tuesday. Despite having LeSean McCoy in the lineup, the Eagles had 22 runs, and 43 pass attempts in a 24-14 loss. \n\u201cI can just remember back a few years ago, we had a snowstorm in Philly that pushed a game back,\u201d Pederson said. \u201cThose thoughts do come back to my mind because I was a part of that, too.\u201d \nRight now, winds are blowing the smoke and the fires to the north and west. \n*** \nEagles leading receiver Zach Ertz remains in the concussion protocol. \nThe veteran tight end didn\u2019t practice Wednesday, but has been present at team meetings according to Pederson. \n\u201cThe sense is that he\u2019s doing well,\u201d Pederson said. \u201cBut again, I don\u2019t to get into too many details about it. He\u2019s in the protocol. We just have to monitor it.\u201d \nWhile Ertz didn\u2019t practice, linebacker Joe Walker (neck stinger) was back in uniform Wednesday. \nCenter Jason Kelce was a full participant althoiugh hes working through an ankle issue sustained in the Bears game. \nThe addition to the report is defensive tackle Destiny Vaeao (shoulder), who was held out of practice. \n*** \nNOTES >> Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz said there will be no visit from Angels slugger Mike Trout, who not long ago signed a contract large enough to put a down payment on Angel Stadium. Wentz said he texted Trout, who is back in South Jersey hunting. \u201cHe\u2019s back home hunting it up,\u201d Wentz said. \u201cWe keep in touch. I shot him a text.\u201d Hunting, shot \u2014 get it? Trout also is slated to get married Saturday \u2026 Wentz, by the way, is the only quarterback in the league to throw a touchdown pass in every game. He leads the circuit with 29 TDs, three short of Sonny Jurgensen\u2019s team record set in a 14-game season in 1961 ... Pederson brought his sense of humor to Cali. During the Wednesday morning presser, a cell phone sounded with the AOL \u201cyou\u2019ve got mail\u201d ringtone. The head coach shot a goofy look toward that corner of the audience. The last question from the presser, came from the area of the AOL tone. Before fielding the query, Pederson said, \u201ccheck your mail.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zach ertz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lesean mccoy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonny jurgensen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trout", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reed saxon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason kelce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug pederson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pederson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "destiny vaeao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike trout", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ertz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe walker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcvay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaylen watkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sammy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris long", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wentz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eagles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aol", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south jersey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "disneyland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anaheim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bel air", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "costa mesa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angel stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxnard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:25.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8676f19b5239f4aad233bf782a6d5f171f39f5dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlzr1oCwrvvqP9eGWYEGxpP", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ -

But while the notch will be there, not the same display would be used across the entire lineup, with people close to the matter saying that Apple is pondering using an LCD screen as a cost-saving measure. Basically, Apple is expected to unveil three different iPhones, as it follows: one with a 5.8-inch OLED display that would be very similar to the iPhone X, a Plus-sized version of this model (also with an OLED screen) that could go as high as 6.5 inches, and a more affordable model with an LCD display. Nikkei says this cheaper iPhone could come with a screen of 6.2 or 6.3 inches, while top-rated Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says a 6.1-inch display is more likely. 2018 iPhone in more colors But the more interesting tidbit is that this affordable model could return to metal for the body, as compared to the other two which will probably retain glass like the iPhone X and iPhone 8. Apple made the switch from metal to glass with the release of iPhone 8 and iPhone X, a change that enabled new features like wireless charging, so there\u2019s a chance such functionality would be removed on this particular 2018 model. The cited source claims several color options would be available as well, as the metal body would make it easier for Apple to launch new versions. It\u2019s believed Cupertino couldn\u2019t stick with more color variations on a glass body because of the complex nature of the used materials, so going back to metal would enable the company to release more such versions. Of course, these are just rumors for the time being since we\u2019re still far away from the moment the 2018 iPhone lineup would see daylight, so a healthy dose of skepticism is recommended.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ming-chi kuo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bogdan popa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "cupertino", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:26.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8676f19b5239f4aad233bf782a6d5f171f39f5dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlzr1oCwrvvqP9eGWYEGxpP", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ - International - 4chan", "title": "when", "title_full": "/int/ - when - International - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T10:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 38, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4615820d382fdc6b06ed73a27c5f49ad2752eb72", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlzr1oCwrvvqASZlwgkFiK1Ewu4JEIryQk-", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T11:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>82714973\nFuck that.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:26.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b339366ee7916a5f8bda1f772af4a556ef1e4e1a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gfBslnDni2K3HuHR2botR9c-", "site_full": "us.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/22814287/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "7.3.5 PTR General Discussion - World of Warcraft Forums", "title": "Player nightborne models", "title_full": "Player nightborne models - World of Warcraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T15:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/wow.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0ad87fc42c769ce9df53df0f5f1fa20264676f22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gfBslnDni2K39iaGbvjFHHK1crls49Kazg--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Talerosus", "published": "2017-12-07T17:17:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I think they could use some more options judging by the video previews I've seen on YouTube.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:26.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8676f19b5239f4aad233bf782a6d5f171f39f5dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlzr1oCwrvvqP9eGWYEGxpP", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ - International - 4chan", "title": "when", "title_full": "/int/ - when - International - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T10:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 38, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bac7c66123258c291fe404ddc778d0b215435098", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlzr1oCwrvvqASZlwgkFiK1L56BxqJ..Z4-", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>82714954\nOf course not, none of the major cities will be a capital.

Alex Wong / Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 9:54 am \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Strzok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order. Copyright 2017 NPR.

John Froschauer \u2014 The Associated Press By Bob Grotz, , @BobGrotz on Twitter Posted: # Comments Los Angeles Rams quarterback Jared Goff (16) throws as Arizona Cardinals outside linebacker Chandler Jones (55) pursues during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Dec. 3, 2017, in Glendale, Ariz. Ross D. Franklin \u2014 The Associated Press \nANAHEIM, Calif. >> Jared Goff doesn\u2019t remember a lot of details about his 2016 pre-draft visit to Philly other than it was the day the Los Angeles Rams traded up to secure the first pick in that draft. \nAnd no, the Eagles didn\u2019t immediately turn to him and say, \u201cthanks for stopping by, we\u2019ll get you a cab to the airport.\u201d \nStill, Goff and Eagles counterpart Carson Wentz, who came off the board 1-2 in the draft, knew what was going down. After all, they trained together before the draft and were represented by the same agency, Rep 1 Sports. \nAll of those memories and more return Sunday at the Coliseum in Los Angeles \u2014 wildfires willing. Advertisement \n\u201cWe\u2019re good friends now so I think we\u2019re pretty excited to finally face off,\u201d Wentz said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of crossover film this year, so I\u2019ve seen a handful of his games on tape. He\u2019s having a great year. We\u2019ve texted back and forth a little bit, so it will be fun for us.\u201d \nWentz has thrown a league-leading 29 touchdown passes, Goff 20. The Eagles are 10-2, the Rams 9-3. A showdown like this doesn\u2019t always come off so smoothly for quarterbacks selected with the first and second overall picks. Just look at the past. \nJameis Winston and Marcus Mariota went 1-2 in 2015. They haven\u2019t been much of a tag team. The same with Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin in 2012. Injuries have destroyed them. As long as we\u2019re in Southern Cali, Peyton Manning held up his end in the 1998 draft while Ryan Leaf \u2014\u201cdon\u2019t talk to me, alright? Knock it off!\u201d\u2014 did not. \nGoff and Wentz could be just what the NFL needs in this time of fading ratings and drooping popularity, among other issues. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s fun,\u201d Rams head coach Sean McVay said. \u201cI think when it\u2019s the Rams versus the Eagles, everyone will make it about Jared versus Carson. But what is exciting about it is you\u2019ve got two young exciting quarterbacks that are doing a nice job leading their respective offenses, and they\u2019ve been able to have a lot of success up to this point. I think, just for the league, when you talk about how important and how marketable that quarterback position is, you look at two great individuals that are great human beings, great leaders and great representatives of each organization. And for them to be playing productive football, it sure makes for a fun matchup and looking forward to it.\u201d \nWentz and Goff have plenty of weapons to do the job, starting at running back. The Eagles\u2019 committee of LeGarrette Blount, Jay Ajayi and Corey Clement dominated until last week in Seattle. Rams running back Todd Gurley ranks among the league leaders in almost every category. He\u2019s a typical run from 1,000 yards. \nAlshon Jeffery, Torrey Smith and Zach Ertz (still in concussion protocol) have made a huge difference for Wentz in his second NFL season. \nGoff has Sammy Watson and Robert Woods, who fly down the field the way motorcyles tear up the Cali freeways. \nWentz and Goff have little trouble keeping up with each other, All they have to do is watch the weekly highlights, since the Eagles and Rams have had six common opponents. \n\u201cI think the biggest thing is he\u2019s accurate,\u201d Wentz said. \u201cHe makes some throws that are impressive and he\u2019s pretty decisive. It\u2019s fun to see how far he\u2019s come this year. I think we\u2019re both kind of similar. We\u2019re always studying, we\u2019re always so busy.\u201d \nWentz said he and Goff texted back and forth about the crossover film. \nWhile Goff is much more subdued, don\u2019t let that fool you. Eagles defensive tackle Elijah Qualls says Goff is the same tough-minded, get-out-of-my-face guy he\u2019s known since their childhoods. \n\u201cThe area that I grew up in, I actually was on a seven-on-seven team with Jared Goff,\u201d Qualls said. \u201cHe went to high school like 30 minutes from me so I actually did some training with him back when we were in high school. And then he went to Cal, but we were good friends. He\u2019s talented, he\u2019s smart and honestly, he\u2019s one of the most aggressive quarterbacks I\u2019ve ever been around. I like to mess with a lot of quarterbacks. Especially when we were in high school. I used to always talk mess to them to try to get in their heads. He was probably one of the only ones that ever actually talked back.\u201d \nGoff, on the other hand, sounded polite but came off like he loathed conference calls Wednesday. He low-keyed the matchup with Wentz this weekend. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s a really fun story line for you guys,\u201d Goff said on a conference call. \u201cFor us we\u2019re focused on trying to win the game. And so, we have to prepare ourselves as best we can to beat the Eagles.\u201d \nGoff, nonetheless, clearly respects his counterpart for any number of reasons. \n\u201cI\u2019m very happy for him and everything he\u2019s accomplished so far this year, and through his career,\u201d Goff said. \u201cEverything he has, has all been earned. From my experience getting to know him a little bit, I remember how hard he works.\u201d \nWhatever it is \u2014 second player selected or whatnot \u2014 Wentz seems much more pumped about competing against Goff than vice versa. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s exciting any time two young quarterbacks like us faceoff,\u201d Wentz said. \u201cI think it\u2019s definitely excited for the league. Jared and I both are excited about it and it will be fun.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "goff",

Dec 7, 2017 in Top News \nPUTRAJAYA \u2013 Former public university Master\u2019s student Siti Noor Aishah Atam will spend a shorter time in jail for allegedly possessing 12 books related to terrorism. \nThis follows a decision by the Court of Appeal three-man panel today, comprising Datuk Ahmadi Asnawi, Datuk Kamardin Hashim and Datuk Abdul Karim Abdul Jalil, to reduce her jail sentence from five years to three years after allowing her appeal on the sentence. \nJustice Kamardin, who delivered the court\u2019s judgement, set aside the five years\u2019 jail sentence and substituted it with a three-year jail term to run from the date of her arrest on March 23, last year. \nHe said the five years\u2019 jail term imposed by the High Court was manifestly excessive. \nThe court, however, dismissed Siti Noor Aishah\u2019s appeal on her conviction on the grounds that her appeal did not have merits. \nJustice Kamardin said the court agreed with the High Court\u2019s findings that Siti Noor Aishah\u2019s defence did not raise a reasonable doubt against the prosecution\u2019s case. \nHe said the court also found that the High Court judicial commissioner did not make any error in his findings and in his decision to convict Siti Noor Aishah on the charge which warranted the appellate\u2019s court intervention. \nThe 30-year-old Siti Noor Aishah was found guilty by the High Court in Kuala Lumpur in April this year for the possession of 12 books on Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), Islamic State (IS) and Al Qaeda (AQ) at Lot 1241, Jalan Lapangan Terbang Sura, Dungun, Terengganu at 12.25 pm on March 22, last year. \nShe was initially acquitted and discharged by the High Court without entering her defence on Sept 29, last year but on appeal by the prosecution, the appellate court on March 27, this year ordered her to enter her defence and remitted the matter back to the High Court for her to do so. \nAfter the verdict, counsel Mohd Kamaruzaman A. Wahab said he would seek his client\u2019s instruction on whether to bring the matter up to the Federal Court. \nHe said since her jail term had been reduced to three years, Siti Noor Aishah is expected to be released by early next year as she had already served a year\u2019s jail and taking into account the one-third remission on her jail sentence. \u2013 BERNAMA Related You might be

LUMPUR \u2013 UMNO\u2019s membership stood at 3,644,295 as of yesterday while there are 21,851 party branches across the country except in Sarawak. \nParty secretary-general Datuk Seri Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor said Sabah remained as the state with the biggest number of UMNO members, with its Silam division having the most number among the divisions and Kampung Batu Putih Darat in Libaran having the biggest number of members among the party branches. \nTengku Adnan, who is also Federal Territories Minister, said in a situation where UMNO was being attacked by various quarters including the opposition and former party members, its membership continued to rise, proving that the party always had supporters. \n\u201cThe UMNO machinery continues to work relentlessly, ensuring not just membership increase but simultaneously getting party members to register as voters so as to perform their duty in the upcomng 14th general election.\u201d He said this when tabling the party\u2019s annual report at the UMNO General Assembly held at the Putra World Trade Centre, here, today. \nAttended by 2,718 delegates, the assembly was officially opened by UMNO president Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak. \nTengku Adnan, also known as Ku Nan, said although some quarters had slandered UMNO, made baseless accusations, spread lies and tried to divide the party, unity prevailed among the members who held dear to the spirit of togetherness in pursuing the party\u2019s struggle. \n\u201cThis is not just to ensure UMNO\u2019s survival and to remain strong, but what is more important is to continue to imbue the basis and objectives of the party\u2019s establishment.
