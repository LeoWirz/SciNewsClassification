While they enjoy the happiness and excitement that the Elf gives their little ones, they also hate having to come up with clever new ideas for the Elf\u2019s antics every night. \nFor those who aren\u2019t familiar with this holiday phenomenon, here\u2019s how it works: Each year between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve, Santa sends out an Elf to every child\u2019s home in order to keep an eye on him or her and make sure they are being good. Every night, parents move the Elf to a new location in their house, and they often pose him doing funny things and causing mischief. The kids might wake up to find the Elf hanging upside down from a light fixture or munching on a bag of popcorn, for instance. Flickr | mbaylor \nWell, now parents might reconsider the mischief they allow the Elf to get into. Mom Lynn Heinrich decided to pose her family\u2019s Elf in the bathroom with a big shaving cream mess. But her oh-so-smart idea backfired in a BIG way. The idea was that her son, Mile,s would walk into the bathroom, see the shaving cream all around the mirror and sink, and then look down and see the Elf holding the shaving cream can, along with a note that said, \u201cMiles did it.\u201d \nFunny, right? Well, wait until you see what actually happened. \nThe prank didn\u2019t quite go according to plan. Miles did indeed walk into the bathroom and see the Elf\u2019s sign accusing him of making the mess. But rather than laugh at the Elf and his attempt to get him in trouble, the little boy panicked! He grabbed a Sharpie and started drawing all over the wall, then removed the original note from the Elf, and replaced it with a note that read: \u201cYou are ugly Lynn.\u201d \n\nToo funny! Miles was so afraid that the Elf was going to get him into trouble that he went to great lengths to \u201cframe\u201d him for the crime and make it seem as though the Elf was the real troublemaker. Which, in a way, he kind of was! And now, poor mom Heinrich has to repaint her bathroom walls. Sigh, maybe Elf on the Shelf is too much work after all. \nThis story originally appeared on Simplemost . Checkout Simplemost for other great tips and ideas to make the most out of life.

Our online archive of 25 years of news, sports and opinion from the pages of the New Hampshire Union Leader. Beloved Zippy is found; the life-sized Deerfield elf had been missing By MELISSA PROULX Police brought Zippy home in Deerfield Wednesday. (Courtesy) DEERFIELD \u2014 Monday wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d consider a beach day, but that didn\u2019t stop Zippy, a life-sized elf, from setting up his lawn chair to catch some sun outside of Veasey Park. Then, he disappeared. Officials scrambled to find him over the last couple of days. \u201cWe have contacted the North Pole, and we believe they are sending us some help to locate Zippy, stay tuned!,\u201d Deerfield Rescue wrote on its Facebook Page. The hard work paid off, and he turned up Wednesday morning. \u201cHe\u2019s just wet,\u201d said rescue squad Capt. Cindy McHugh. Zippy was found in front of a house near the Raymond line, across town from where he disappeared, McHugh said. \u201cThe news coverage probably made someone feel bad and they brought him back,\u201d she said. McHugh said she assumed the elf\u2019s disappearance was a prank and she expected Zippy to show up at someone\u2019s house in town, perhaps a selectman\u2019s. Zippy, a holiday staple in the community, first showed up three years ago. Rescue Squad workers move him about town, asking residents to share pictures of his whereabouts on Facebook. \u201cWe move him every night,\u201d McHugh said. Who might have taken the elf is still a mystery and might just remain that way. McHugh said the goal was to get Zippy back, she said. \u201cThe kids really missed him,\u201d McHugh said. The loss of Zippy sparked an outpouring from across the country. \u201cGreat news!!,\u201d wrote Facebook user Gwen Bennett on the post announcing Zippy\u2019s return. \u201cHugs from Texas!!\u201d Local children sent video messages to the Facebook page, calling for the bandit or bandits to return their missing friend. \u201cEach and every day, I try to look for him in my mom\u2019s car,\u201d one kid said in his video, pleading for \u201cthe Grinch\u201d to return Zippy. \u201cMe and my brother always look out the window. I would look out one side and he would look out the other.\u201d News outlets picked up the story, including the New York Times. McHugh said the rescue squad is grateful for all the support it received during the search and that Zippy should be at the town\u2019s elementary school so students can see him when they get out for the day. \u201cThat\u2019s our plan,\u201d she said.

Also, Storm talked about whether his farewell promo will ever air on Impact television. Finally, Storm shared his thoughts on the future of Impact. \nDuring the interview, Storm confirmed his Impact Wrestling departure, saying he feels like he has accomplished all of his goals at Impact. Additionally, Storm suggested that the regime change that saw the ouster of Jeff Jarrett may have influenced his decision to part ways with Impact. \n\"It actually hasn't [become] official for me, but, yes, I have left Impact Wrestling and it's just one of those things where it just kind of felt like I did everything I can do with that company and the landscape of it has changed from the time I was there.\" \nStorm continued, \"but so many people want to frown upon Dixie [Carter] and Jeff [Jarrett] and all that, but the reason I thank them and Bob Ryder is because basically if it wasn't for those guys, there would be no 'Cowboy' James Storm. There might not be an AJ Styles and might not be a Bobby Roode, might not be all these other guys who got the breaks that Jeff gave us when he started up TNA Impact Wrestling back in the day.\" \nApparently, the farewell promo Storm cut after competing in his final match for Impact was not planned. Rather, Storm wanted to go out on his terms and does not care whether he has heat with Impact brass as a result. \n\"Hey, I left - who cares if there's heat? No, it's just one of those things. I just grabbed [the microphone] because, like, if I'm going out, I'm going out the way that I want to. I'd do the match however they wanted, but at the end of the day, when I grabbed that microphone and said what I had to say, it was from the heart. And being on the road so long, I wanted to say to my wife and my kids, 'hey, I'm coming home for a little while and daddy gets to spend time with you because I'm taking time off, letting my body heal, and then go back at it.' And also, like I said, Dixie Carter, Jeff Jarrett, and Bob Ryder, without those guys, a lot of the guys you know now wouldn't be around and they gave us a platform.\" \nAs for whether the farewell promo will ever see the light of day, Storm did not seem confident that it will ever air on Impact television because 'The Cowboy' namechecked Carter, Jarrett, and Ryder. \n\"As far as the video, to me, I don't know. I doubt it, but I'm not for sure if that footage will ever be seen. It might now that it has leaked out on the internet.\" \nStorm said, \"but those guys needed to get kudos. They always get crapped on for all the negative stuff that goes on, but they never get the praise for the good stuff that happened.\" See Also How Much Money James Storm Was Making With Impact, Backstage Note On Impact Hall Of Fame Being Nixed \nWith respect to the future of Impact, Storm admitted that he does not know where it will go, but wishes them well because The Hexagon is another place for pro wrestlers to work. \n\"I wish I could say either way and I never wish bad upon anybody and I definitely don't wish bad upon Impact Wrestling because I'm not there anymore because to me, it gives the boys another place to work where they might not have another place to work. It gives them television exposure and all of that. And as far as where they'll be, I don't know. I just know that they need a lot of work in different departments. It's definitely not the wrestling side because the boys are bringing it. So, hopefully, like I said, hopefully, they'll be around for a while, just to give the guys another place to work and be able to make a living.\" \nStorm stressed that Anthem needs to improve its marketing of Impact. Also, Storm mused that NXT vs. Impact Wrestling could have been done on the WWE Network if WWE bought Impact. \n\"It starts from the head of the snake and that's Anthem. They need to make changes to make it more marketable to me.

However, further to the announcement made on 13 November 2017, the Company has now updated its procedures such that the Company's NAV estimate per share will be published on a daily basis to provide Shareholders with the most up-to-date available information. The first daily NAV estimate will be announced on 7 December 2017, with respect to the 6 December 2017 NAV estimate. The daily NAV estimate will be produced by CACEIS Bank, Luxembourg Branch, and will be the responsibility of the Investment Manager, Axiom Alternative Investments SARL. The Company will also announce monthly NAVs produced by the Company's Administrator, Elysium Fund Management Limited. The Administrator will no longer produce any weekly NAVs. It is intended that the daily NAV estimates will generally be released on the business day following the NAV date. However, daily NAV estimates will not be released on national holidays in the UK and the NAV estimate that would otherwise have been released on that day will instead be released on the next business day. When there is a public holiday in Guernsey but not the UK, a NAV estimate will be released as normal. When there is a national holiday in Luxembourg, the NAV estimate for the business day prior to the Luxembourg national holiday will be released on the next business day after the Luxembourg national holiday. The NAV estimate for the day on which there is a national holiday in Luxembourg will be released on the next business day, as normal.

I'm looking for $245 or close offer for each of them. I also have two 4 pin joystick controllers @ $230 each. At this price it would be worth it to have a spare, as one of the leading causes of plow failure is a bad controller. I will test the controller for you at time of pickup on one of my plows or , if delivered, on yours. I have a very little bit of wiggle room on these....New controllers are $400 plus tax, so these are a bargain !!! Thanks for lookin, and with an extra controller, you will have confidence when plowing.

Photo: SEYLLOU / AFP \nDIASS, Senegal \u2013 Senegal opens a flagship new airport on Thursday seven years later than originally planned but with ambitions to become a west African regional hub with a capacity for three million passengers. \nPresident Macky Sall will cut the ribbon at Blaise Diagne International Airport (AIBD) at midday (1200 GMT) in the town of Diass, 47 kilometres from the capital of Dakar, while a plane from new airline Air Senegal will make the first symbolic takeoff. \nWork began in 2007 on the 645 million-euro ($767 million) airport under former president Abdoulaye Wade, but unforeseen problems and a change of construction company have repeatedly delayed the project and ballooned costs. \nBlaise Diagne - named after the Senegalese MP who was the first African elected to France's parliament - is at the heart of Sall's \"Emerging Senegal\" plan, which includes the construction of a new city, Diamniadio, close to the site in Diass. \nAs the country invests more heavily in tourism, Senegal is also betting on the facility's strategic position close to several beach resorts that are already heavily frequented by European holidaymakers. \n\"The airport will be key in the promotion of 'Destination Senegal',\" Prime Minister Mahammed Boun Abdallah Dionne said in a speech on Tuesday, adding that airport services at the site would contribute to the development of the special economic zone nearby. \nREAD: Senegal to tighten driving laws \nWith a capacity of three million passengers, Blaise Diagne will still rank far below the busiest African airports and a long way off challenging Nigeria in the west African region, though plans for up to 10 million travellers are in the pipeline, according to officials. \nUncertainty for new airline \nPassenger numbers have increased in recent years at Dakar's current airport in the middle of the city, leading to long waits at security and contributing to chronic traffic jams, and the old Leopold Sedar Senghor airport will become a military airfield from Friday. \nThe new airport boasts six footbridges direct to flight cabins, and will be able to service a range of aircraft including Airbus's massive A380s. \nWork was completed on the 4,500-hectare site - with 2,000 hectares unused in case of required expansion - by Turkish consortium Summa-Limak after a disagreement with Saudi Arabia's Bin Laden construction derailed the final stage of preparations. \nBut bets on whether Blaise Diagne would open on time have lasted until the last minute amid complaints by major European airlines over fuel capacity and regulations Summa-Limak will now operate the airport for the next 25 years, furthering ever-closer economic ties between Ankara and Dakar. \nREAD: Senegalese singer arrested for criticising President Sall \nA train linking the airport with the city is not expected to open for years, leaving taxi drivers in pocket but ordinary travellers nervous of arriving on time for flights in a city with unpredictable traffic. \nBacked by loans from France's development agency the African Development Bank (ADB) , the West African Development Bank (BOAD) and Islamic lender the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) , officials are celebrating the airport's completion - but the future of Senegal's new airline is less certain. \nAir Senegal still does not have all the licences required to begin commercial flights and has a fleet of just two ATR 72-600s, but Aviation Minister Maimouna Ndoye Seck said international ambitions for the airport meant a well-performing national airline was \"a necessity\".

Still due to some unexpected and unwanted circumstances a firm had to recall its product from market. Each day or each weeks many products or different batches of products has been recalled especially in regulated countries like Europe and USA. Since from last 4 decades US FDA has been recalling the product and penalized millions of dollars to pharmaceutical companies. The number of recalls is in similar rate but its not being penalized due to voluntary product recall. The product recall frequency in those countries is not just because the product failed in quality; it is also due to astringent regulations and moral norms on which the company is doing business. Let me put a historic event of product recall. \nIn November 1994, Intel Corporation was confronted by angry customers demanding replacement of their Pentium microprocessors, which had been reported to have a flaw affecting mathematical calculations. The company\u2019s first response was to demand that customers demonstrate that their chips were faulty; only then would Intel issue replacements. Intel claimed that the flaw was unlikely to affect most users\u2014that it occurred only once in every 9 billion random calculations\u2014but consumer confidence in the product already had begun to waiver. The company stubbornly held its ground for more than a month in the face of a storm of protest. Then IBM, a major purchaser of the Pentium microprocessor, halted shipments of its computers containing the chip. At last, on the brink of market disaster, Intel instituted a no-questions-asked returns policy. Here, its not the regulatory bodies who compelled the Pentium company to return its product but well aware public and IBM company who believed in quality product. But in case of Nepal, how is the situation? Yes, Nepali market hardly see any product recall, because there is no astringent rules and even if rule can be executed, due to lack of technology, man power and well aware customers( health workers and consumers) we are unable to recall back the product. Each pharmaceutical company in market wants its market share and its goodwill, but majority of them failed to land safely during product recall. So why aren\u2019t more companies prepared to deal with recalls? We are going to answer this question but at same time, lets us discuss more on product recall. A recall is a serious process. It highlights a dangerous situation that requires fast and effective action to protect the public from harm. Product recall can be due to: a. Customer complaints (which may includes health workers, patients or consumers/users): Eg. Recently A USFDA approved company withdrew the whole batch of Product just because a customer(health worker) found different tablet in the primary container. b. Company discovery: When a pharma company finds some issue in product, be it in packaging materials, in product quality. c. Regulatory inspection: When Regulatory bodies finds any failure in product quality. Last time, DDA found quality control parameters failure in three products from national and Indian company, it immediately put notice for product recall. d. Adverse drug reactions: When a pharmacovigilance program in each health centres or Department of drug administration finds any Adverse drug reactions in particular product or batch or make, in life threatening, critical drug reactions. Product recall is a challenging job and it\u2019s a complex procedure for a country like Nepal where the distribution channel is not proper and each batch is not tracked in a proper way. During the procedure, a company has to mobilize all its distribution channel man power along with Quality assurance personnel. But, at present context, if company uses it communication power and track all the record through digitalization, its quite easy to recall the product. Hence a sound strategic recall management system has to be established by a company. If product recalls are handled properly, a company not only can keep damage to a minimum but also may find opportunities to reap unexpected benefits. Lets take an example, if a company ABC wants to recall its product from a market which has been distributed for more than 3 months, if its strategic recall management is well managed, for a country like Nepal, within few weeks a particular batch can be recalled or can be dumped locally approved local site. How can a company prepare itself properly for a recall that it doesn\u2019t even know will happen? Each of the four functions delineated earlier must make advance preparations, must react appropriately during the recall, and must take the right steps afterward. Policy and Planning (Overall Coordination of a Recall). Long before a recall becomes necessary, senior managers should be fostering an organization wide recognition of the need for recall readiness. They should ensure that employees understand the link between recalls and consumer safety and satisfaction, as well as the effect well-run recalls can have on corporate success. They also should fight any signs of a \u201ckill the messenger\u201d culture that might prevent news of a product\u2019s problems from reaching the appropriate people. Thought of broadly, this task is difficult\u2014a company\u2019s culture does not become \u201copen\u201d overnight, and it isn\u2019t easy to identify weaknesses in the chain of communication when it is not being tested with a real-life situation. But there are a number of steps managers can take to move their companies in the right direction. A User\u2019s Guide to Managing Product Recalls First, the overall responsibility for product recalls should be assigned to one senior executive. It might be the senior vice president for marketing, another senior vice president, or even the CEO, depending on the size of the company, its organizational structure, and its individual circumstances. That manager should require the development (and regular review) of a recall manual that details the company\u2019s policy and guidelines in the event of a recall. The material in the manual should derive from marketing; in effect, a recall operation is based on a reverse-marketing plan. Customer satisfaction and other marketing goals remain paramount; however, the task is to use marketing skills to retrieve the product from the customer. In creating a recall-ready organization, the person with overall responsibility should identify key managers throughout the organization who might be called on to act in a recall situation. The idea is to avoid blindsiding anyone. Some companies also enlist the help of people outside the organization in anticipation of a recall. The vice president of marketing for Netscape Communications Corporation offered cash or prizes to anyone\u2014inside or outside the company\u2014who found problems in a test version of its software designed for browsing the Internet. In the event of a recall, the senior recall manager should appoint a response team, including a \u201crecall champion,\u201d to manage the recall on a daily basis. The response team should be made up of those people the manager has tapped in advance from the various areas in the company. The team members\u2019 first task is to establish the seriousness of the situation. Such an evaluation will help them determine the speed and type of response and will be especially useful when there is a risk of customer injury or illness. An incorrect assessment of the severity of the problem can lead to lasting trouble. After the team evaluates the situation, it should determine the scale of the response necessary. It should also decide what type of recall is warranted. Does the situation require a full recall, a selective recall, a repair or retrofit offer, an optional recall, or a change in the production and distribution of the product? Can the problem be solved by offering customers an opportunity to exchange the product or by issuing an advisory? If a department of drug administration has called for the recall, is it truly warranted? Are the charges accurate? Should the company refute them? If recall action is warranted, the response team should also determine the announcement (who will make it; when and where; who should be notified; and what the script will be) and coordinate the field response program (who will be accepting the faulty products; how the company plans to monitor the products that have been returned; and who will be providing repairs or replacements). The team should keep in mind that it is critical to arrive at a decision regarding the recall as swiftly as possible. But a decision doesn\u2019t necessarily have to mean taking action. A recall made too soon could give credibility to an unsubstantiated charge. Another factor militating against hasty recall action is the company\u2019s liability exposure. Although delaying the recall may increase the size and number of claims against the company\u2014not to mention potentially endangering consumers and creating ILL WILL\u2014issuing a recall amounts to admitting that there is a problem and may open the door to a flood of lawsuits. Sofar in spite of some products being recalled we haven\u2019t found any lawsuits in Nepal. The recall response team should weigh all factors carefully before making a decision. The management task is no less important after a recall. The response team should design a resolution plan to bring the effort to a satisfactory close. Team members must set goals for closure; for example, a given proportion of distributed units returned. And they must anticipate stragglers. If the recall process is effectively shut down, how will the company deal with an unhappy consumer who somehow missed the boat? The team should also figure out how to reintroduce the product to the market. A reintroduction plan\u2014which ideally would be developed and implemented with the participation of several of the people who originally designed and launched the product\u2014might include a relaunch marketing effort to reassert brand identity and to build share. And team members should keep an eye on the competition. A product recall situation is a critical phase for a pharmaceutical company where it can lose its many loyal customers. So the team member especially the marketing response team has to keep an eye on those competitors keenly. Finally, the recall team should audit the recall. There is a lot to be learned from how a company\u2019s recall plan worked in practice. What gave rise to the recall? What factors influenced its effectiveness and success? By conducting a review after the fact, managers can identify strengths and weaknesses of the effort and plan for a more effective response should another recall situation arise in the future? When the recall is over, the recall champion should recognize and reward the major participants, especially members of the response team. During the recall, most team members will have had to perform their regular duties under intense time pressure or be covered by other personnel. Because a recall can have dire consequences for a company, one might think it would not be necessary to motivate a recall team. However, recalls are often takes few weeks to over several months and can become exhausting. Rewarding all participants, including retailers, is critical as well. For example, if a retailer played a major role in facilitating the process, the company might consider\u2014within the constraints of the law\u2014allowing preferential access to any of its products that are in short supply. Product development/Pharmaceutical production team (production, quality control and quality assurance personnel) Once a recall is issued, the product development team should focus on finding the cause of the problem and the best solution. On occasion, that team may be too close to the problem to assess it effectively. If necessary, an outside expert should be consulted to expedite the process and provide an impartial analysis of the problem. After a recall, the product development team should conduct additional studies of the product defect with an eye to identifying any glitches in the development process that contributed to the problem. Finally, the company should be involved in gathering customers\u2019 reactions to the product recall, or at least be well informed of that feedback. Are customers satisfied? Communications The communications function plays a central role in preparing an organization for recalls. In fact, the effectiveness of communication during and after a recall depends on prior communication. As part of recall preparation and to aid people in communications, the manager with overall responsibility for recalls should identify major recall stakeholders (beyond immediate consumers). These might include distributors, dealers or retailers, financial institutions, employees, service centers, sales forces, and regulatory agencies. All those parties have a vested interest in how the company weathers a recall, and all should be kept abreast of the company\u2019s plans and actions (as appropriate) as the recall unfolds. Clearly it is important to build the organization\u2019s credibility in the eyes of those stakeholders in anticipation of the need for a recall. Many companies already have crisis-management communications plans that can address a variety of crises, whether they be labor relations issues or regulatory or criminal investigations. Recalls should be included in those plans. For companies that are in the process of developing crisis-management communications plans, a recall scenario might provide a suitable prototype issue. During a recall, the response team should keep customers properly informed. Customer communications can reinforce the company\u2019s image as a responsible organization. Team members also should decide on and release appropriate messages to the media. For example, they might decide to preempt their current advertising with specially designed recall advertising. To carry out recall communications successfully, the recall response team should draw on the experience and expertise of people from public relations, advertising, and other sales and marketing resources. After a recall, communications should focus on restoring and strengthening the company\u2019s reputation and the reputation of the product in question. The extent of that effort should be determined by the impact the recall has had on the stakeholders. We recommend, however, that as general practice, the communications members of the recall response team take at least some form of the following two actions. \nThey should inform and reassure customers and other stakeholders, customizing the message to the various audiences. That action\u2014which might take the form of letters, press releases, or advertising\u2014may be conducted in tandem with the marketing efforts to relaunch the product. Performing effective recalls also requires the company to take appropriate preventive steps so that similar problems should not occur in future. Implementation of such steps helps the firm to strengthen its brand. Similarly, companies should take the opportunity to build consumer confidence in the company brands, and positively influence customer satisfaction and loyalty with increasing profits. We have seen very rare product recall in Nepal not because our product( marketed products) are in perfect shape, but because of fear of a company to lose its Goodwill. References: 1.

Well, we never! We sat around and shared interesting stories about our clothes, the hanbok. It was an opportunity to realize that clothes are products of culture and a small framework that contains history.\nLet\u2019s follow that story.\n[National Fork Museum of Korea's Collection]\nDuring the port opening era when the Western Powers came to Joseon, the photographs and paintings showing Joseon under Japanese rule were exported to Europe. They were souvenirs showing the custom of the unknown country, Joseon. These photographs and paintings showed various aspects of Joseon, from the people to games, stories, and so on. But some of these photographs showed women broadly exposing their breasts!\nSurprisingly, there were many photographs like them.\n[National Fork Museum of Korea's Collection] It was rather easy to find women exposing their breasts in the photograph books of Europeans who visited Joseon and in the recordings of the Japanese imperialists. The story about women who exposed their breasts also appeared in the writings of foreigners.\n[ National Museum of Korea's collection] Surprisingly, the jackets of most women are raised above the breasts,\nexposing the breasts entirely. \u226a Charles Varat, \u201cVoyage to Korea\u201d (1888-1889) \u226b\nThe women who did not cover their faces with long hoods were exposing their breasts. \u226a Ason Grebst, \u201cMemories of Korea 100 Years Ago\u201d (1904-1905) \u226b\nThe jackets of married women in Joseon are very short.\nAs they were too short to even cover the breasts,\nthere is a 15-18cm gap between the jacket and the skirt,\nexposing the skin uncovered by underwear. <Zanun Usuda, \u201c Korean Comics\" (1909)>\n[ National Museum of Korea's collection] A book by a Japanese reporter who spied on Joseon inserted the picture of a woman who exposed her breasts alongside blatant sarcasm. However, shouldn\u2019t there be a reason those women did so? It\u2019s hard to believe that the women of Joseon, known as the country of courteous people in the East, would stride down the street dressed like that.\n[ National Museum of Korea's collection] So we did a little research. We found such women in the paintings of Yoon-bok Shin, the famous painter of Joseon! Women exposing their breasts! However, they were not alone in the paintings. That\u2019s right. Those women were carrying babies. They are not only found in the paintings of Yoon-bok Shin. The women carrying their babies on their backs appeared here and there in photographs taken by Japanese people. And they all exposed their breasts. Can this be a coincidence?\n[Busan Modern History Museum] I lived very long. We carried babies, tightly tied up around our backs.\nThe breasts become hot in the summer.\nThat\u2019s when babies get diarrhea.\nYou usually tie your baby tightly on the back, and when the baby cried for milk,\nthen you need to pull out your breasts and cool them in cold water.\nYou clean the breasts and let them cool in the wind before you feed the baby.\nYou are busy working, so you can\u2019t milk the baby right away, but the baby cries for milk.\nWhen you pull out the breast, heated up inside many layers of clothes, and quickly clean only the nipples, then the milk inside breasts is still hot. Most babies get diarrhea this way. Verbal Description by Gyu-sook Lee, <<80 Years Lived by Mrs. Lee of Gye-dong>>, Deep Root Press, 1992\n(left- Busan Modern History Museum's collections) (right-Japanese Society of published national literature's collections)\n That\u2019s right. The women of Joseon shown exposing their breasts captured in photographs were breastfeeding their babies. They were not high-class women who could entrust wet nurses with their babies, but lower class women who had to work endlessly without any time to cool their breasts in cold water.", "highlightText":

This is among the most naive, cloying nonsense about the DUP I've ever read.\nThe DUP are not good faith actors. They have attempted to block or ignore all civil rights progress in Northern Ireland, including the Good Friday Agreement. When Arlene Foster, or Ian Paisley Jr, or Nigel Dodds talk about preserving the Good Friday Agreement, that is simply lip service. They of course also tried to portray that peace in NI is a result of their efforts only yesterday, attempting to diminish the role of the EU in the peace process and the GFA itself, which is laughable.\nThe Conservatives have allied themselves with a group that they don't understand, because barely any of them have any experience of Northern Ireland except platitudes. John Major knew, which is why he never entered into an agreement with them even in his government's most desperate moments. The current Tory party seemingly assumed that Northern Ireland was a settled issue and they could just bung the DUP, contravene the GFA, and it will all somehow work out in the end (much like their initial concept of Brexit). Now the DUP have absolutely no incentive to return to power sharing or local government, because they can dictate policy to the Tories directly without all that bother of having to represent their constituents. The British government continues to pay their salaries as ministers in the Northern Ireland Assembly regardless, and has imposed de facto direct rule, something the DUP have been more than happy to tolerate in the past.\nThe British press are still fundamentally misunderstanding the DUP. They aren't just a standard UK right wing political party that happens to have even more backwards views than usual; they are an ethnonationalist supremacist movement similar to the Republican party's fundamentalist base in the USA. To them, a hard border in NI is perfectly fine, because it creates (literally physical) distinctions between the North and South of Ireland that they can use to justify their continued existence (and their supremacy over anyone else in the region, \\\"a Protestant country for a Protestant people\\\").", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:40.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4996893da2b5cfc5b2904dc82b3b2d36e1bf4f8f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nZOCJivZzescL.JpS5yLU1ZQBoeYJpx.Y1IkiziVZsnj8I.vYFbnOr9yUGi5dcDkN3jP2KdTeS1NyNBTP_ycVtX3mUqphGTDTXaCRYkDZL1m9QZl4lnum_Hri6DjVD6HG0cR8qASdC.M-", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/commentisfree", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Opinion | The Guardian", "title": "The DUP hasn\u2019t scuppered \u2018soft Brexit\u2019.

Photo: Reuters \nALGIERS - French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday made his first official visit to Algeria, announcing that he came as a \"friend\" despite France's historically prickly relationship with its former colony. \nTies between Paris and Algiers have defrosted in recent years, a half-century after French forces brutally cracked down on independence fighters in a 1954-1962 war that left some 1.5 million Algerians dead. \nMacron, the first French president to be born after the war, told news website Tout sur l'Algerie that he was \"ready\" to see his country hand back the skulls of Algerian resistance fighters killed in the 1850s, which are held at the Musee de l'Homme in Paris. \nAlgerian and French academics have long campaigned for the return of the 37 skulls, a symbolic hangover from France's 130-year occupation of Algeria. \nMacron arrived in Algiers under bright sunshine on Wednesday after stressing that he came as \"a friend of Algeria, a constructive partner who wants to strengthen our links\". \n\"I know the history, but I am not a hostage of the past,\" he told Algerian newspapers El Watan and El Khabar by phone ahead of his visit. \n\"But from now on, I hope... that we will turn together towards the future.\" \nMacron was welcomed at Algiers airport by Senate speaker Abdelkader Bensalah, Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia and Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel. \nHe later laid a wreath at a monument in central Algiers to those killed in the war, and walked through the centre of the capital, talking with passers-by. \nMacron later held a one-hour meeting President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, 80, who has rarely appeared in public since suffering a stroke in 2013 that has affected his speech and mobility. \nHe told reporters they discussed the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, crisis-hit Libya and the anti-terrorism struggle in the Sahel. \nUS President Donald Trump's decision was \"regrettable\", Macron said, calling for efforts to avoid violence. \nSecurity cooperation \nDuring his election campaign in May, the French leader called his country's colonial history a \"crime against humanity\", prompting criticism from some in France and praise from Bouteflika. \nBut on a recent trip to west Africa, Macon called for \"neither denial nor repentance\", stressing that \"we cannot remain trapped in the past\". \nParis is keen to build ties with Algeria, a key player in the fight against armed groups in the Sahel, and the region's crises are likely to figure in meetings with officials. \nThe Sahel, which stretches from Senegal to Sudan, has sunk into lawlessness since chaos engulfed Libya in 2011, Islamists overran northern Mali in 2012, and Boko Haram rose up in northern Nigeria. \nFrance has praised Algeria's \"experience in the fight against terrorism and radicalisation\", a reference to its decade-long civil war in the 1990s. \nMacron is due to host talks in Paris on December 13 on \"speeding up deployment\" of a five-nation anti-terrorism force in the region. \nHe touched a nerve in Algiers by choosing its regional arch-rival, neighbouring Morocco, for his first visit to the Maghreb. \nBut accompanied by artists and business executives on his Algiers mission, he hopes to boost economic ties. \nIn his interview with Algerian newspapers, he said: \"Algeria must open up more, there are still many obstacles to investment.\" But he also pointed to \"promising fields of cooperation\" between the two countries. \nFrance remains the largest foreign employer in Algeria although it is losing market share to other European countries and China. \nOn a visit to Algiers in November, French economy minister Bruno Le Maire said it was \"time to raise the bar\". \nMacron is set to leave Algeria for Qatar on Wednesday evening.

In most cases, someone who is seeking to take your belongings or enter your domain for another reason has taken the time to look over your entire property to decide what they want to take or damage, as well as decide the best route for entry. When securing our homes, it is imperative we keep everything, including outside buildings and gardens, in mind. Below, we will discuss ways of taking the security of your home and the surrounding property into your own hands and making it a safe place for you and your family. \nSecurity Systems and Cameras \nSeeking professional installation of a home security system is the most obvious starting place for anyone wanting to protect their home. When attempting to include your gardens and exterior areas, the best route to take is a system that also includes security cameras. These cameras can be positioned to catch all angles of your home and garden. This will help you if by chance someone damages or trespasses on your property. Looking back at the footage will help local law enforcement catch whoever disrespected your home and property. Calling for ADT packages and pricing will help you know exactly what can be offered to fit your personal situation. \nOther Tips to Protect Your Home \nThere are quite a few tricks to helping your security system with home protection. One thing that we are all guilty of forgetting about is the doggy door. Homes that have these handy animal doors installed are able to watch their beloved pets move between inside and out with ease. Unfortunately, larger animal doors are also access points for burglars. Good exterior lighting is another great way to help detour an intruder. Having a well-lit exterior shows a would be criminal you are alert to your surroundings. It also keeps an extra protective eye on your garden and home exterior. Keeping your valuables out of sight is also another great idea for protecting your home. Vandals and burglars will see what you have through the windows and decide whether your home is the place they want to attack. \nProtecting Your Gardens and Exteriors \nAs mentioned above, security cameras and exterior lighting can help protect your gardens and outside designs. Luckily, there are other tips for keeping your garden safe . Keeping your hedges trimmed will keep intruders or vandals from having a place to hide. The same can be said for the design of your garden. Using multiple colors will leave you able to see anyone who may be lurking around. Also, in the case of vandals, your security cameras will easily be able to pick up changes in a well-designed and kept garden. Another way to keep your garden safe is to add a fence. This can help keep out any unwelcome intruders and add a feeling of safety. One last addition that many may scoff at, is the scarecrow. If your garden is a vegetable garden, of course, a scarecrow will help keep birds and other critters scared away. When it comes to the human element, they can offer the same kind of protection. An intruder or vandal who is unfamiliar with your landscaping may mistake your scarecrow as an actual person and be scared away in the process. \nThese tips for keeping both your home and garden safe from harm are excellent for relieving the stress we often find ourselves suffering when it comes to home security. Taking a few of these tips and tricks into consideration when planning your security layout or garden design will make your home safe and secure.

That fear carried over into adulthood, rocking relationships and pushing him deeper into a work-driven life. \nSteve Jobs was famously impatient and was often accused of lacking empathy . He lost employees\u2014and fresh innovation\u2014because of it. \nWarren Buffett has confessed to being slow and sloppy \u2014keeping team members on staff even when he knew they were hurting the company. Company growth slumped because of it. \nBut despite these drawbacks, Musk, Jobs, and Buffett are all considered to be wildly successful\u2014and not just because they rake in millions of dollars. It\u2019s because they\u2019re committed to personal growth and overcoming weaknesses for the benefit of their friends, their families, their companies, and themselves. \nIsn\u2019t that the most valuable lesson they can teach? \nDon\u2019t misunderstand me\u2014advice on wealth-building and productivity are valuable\u2014but must come along with a certain measure of self-awareness that acknowledges weakness and strength. Being successful is not about hiding or ignore weakness. It\u2019s just the opposite\u2014it\u2019s about acknowledging it in a way that is constructive. From an honest self-confession comes the opportunity to build and grow. \nAdam Grant, a professor at the Wharton School of Business at Harvard University, spelled this out in the context of a job interview: \u201cBy admitting your inadequacies, you show that you\u2019re self-aware enough to know your areas for improvement\u2014and secure enough to be open about them. [It shows] that you\u2019re interested in being hired for what you actually bring to the table, not what you pretend to bring.\u201d\nSo how did the \u201ccelebrity CEOs\u201d I mentioned face their weaknesses?\nFor Musk, the journey has required him to acknowledge a traumatic childhood and how it now influences his personal relationships\u2014and the sometimes overbearing control of his companies. (He\u2019s been accused at times of being too personally or emotionally invested in Tesla.) \nFor Jobs, the task demanded acceptance of his own deficiencies with a commitment to being more empathetic and humble\u2014not just in an abstract way, but in concrete, daily rituals. One of his greatest opportunities to do so came with the growth of Apple in the late \u201890s and early 2000s. Instead of controlling everything, he slowly began to turn management of projects over to others, like long-sung design eye Jony Ive. \nAnd for Buffett, the path to a stronger team started with listening to his shareholders\u2014as well as his vice chairman, Charlie Munger. His open confessions during meetings spurred action, and a commitment from Buffett to be better about personnel management. He did this so that the entire company might hold him accountable. \nThere\u2019s no arguing that these men\u2014and many other men and women who have revolutionized industries across the globe\u2014have invaluable insight into best practices in company management, productivity, and wealth-building. But each insight must be offered with three caveats: \nThere are always weaknesses to overcome before success hits. That takes time. And nobody\u2019s perfect. \nNot Elon Musk. Not Steve Jobs. Not Warren Buffett.\nIf we continue to craft celebrity out of our CEOs, then that celebrity should be as much in awe of weakness as it is of strength and success. \nPeak productivity, massive revenue, explosive corporate growth, and unimaginable innovation are all possible for us (just as they were for Musk, Jobs, and Buffett)\u2014but not without spending some time facing OUR weaknesses. \nAs best-selling author Aimee Cohen once wrote, \u201cDon\u2019t let a weakness make you weak.\u201d Instead, acknowledge it, make friends with it, and turn it into a strength. \nCan you imagine what you might accomplish when you do? \nThis article was written by Early to Rise Associate Editor Jeffrey Steen. \nOn the great path to success is self-reflection that helps define goals as well as deficiencies; focal points as well as distractions; and achievements as well as failures. In his book, \u201c The Perfect Day Formula ,\u201d ETR Editor Craig Ballantyne helps you take weakness and turn it into strength\u2014all on the path to Perfect Days and a Perfect Life.
