You're over the hill, you're not able to keep up with WWE's crazy schedule and they release you. Would you then turn to the indies , because you love wrestling so much and you want to do it for as long as possible , OR retire and look to another profession.\nDepends. I have a pretty decent paying major, so being left no choice but to retire wouldn't be a death sentence for me (like we saw with 80s and 90s wrestlers post WWF.)\nI think I would bail wrestling if I was making less than 100k a year on the indies, but there's something I keep on romanticizing about making friends on the indy scene, traveling, and having creative freedom.\nI truly do envy guys like Cody Rhodes.\n2. You're in a tag team that has a rather abrupt ending when one turns on the other. Would you rather be the sympathetic babyface that strives to prove you can make it on your own from here, or be the heel that does the turn and strives to prove your partner was holding you back\nI don't have much faith in the WWE creative team, but in a perfect world, I would rather be the heel as it's a much meatier role. There seems to be more freedom by playing the bad guy, anyways.\nBesides, it could lead to an exciting buildup to the moment I finally turn face that could take my career to new heights. This has been something I believe Bray Wyatt needs, but that is another story.\n3. Wrestle in non-traditional wrestling attire (jeans, slacks, dress shoes, etc) or super generic speedo trunks\nI'm only 5'8, so I am not very tall.\nWith the exception of a few guys, I've always felt that short guys look bizarre in tights.\n4. Have an unassuming debut and from there work hard to move your way up organically, but no guarantee you'll find success that way OR have a plethora of hype that immediately places you in the upper mid-card/main event scene, but a higher chance to fail as there's no guarantee you'll live up to said hype or if the fans will accept you (and you're not Reigns so WWE may actually care)\nIf I believed that the reason I am failing to connect with the audience is due to x reason, I would work hard to fix that issue. Maybe go up to Vinnie Mac's office and talk turkey with him.\nI typically don't go for reactionary measures, but I think wrestling is the one venture where you have to be constantly paying attention to the audience. Someone like Jack Gallagher doesn't appeal to me (I don't know how over he is with the casuals) because I think his presentation and character are horrid. I don't care how good of a wrestler he is, nor am I stating that he is an upper mid-carder or main eventer.\nI would just adapt with the WWE machine behind me.\n5. Be a successful midcard cham (think 4-6 time US/IC champ) but never a world title or win Money in the Bank, The Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, King of the Ring, and the Royal Rumble, along with whatever other unique achievement there is but never actually win a title.\nBeing a mid carder isn't bad. Guys like Dolph Ziggler belong in it, and it's a decent position on the card.\nI would love pretty lengthy title reigns filled with MOTN candidates, though.

He ordered State to build new US embassy in Jerusalem   December 7, 2017 \n\nOn Wednesday, Dec. 6, President Donald Trump made history by announcing that the US recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The city is not just the heart of three great faiths but also of one of the most successful democracies in the world, he said, a society where people are free to practice their faiths. It is the city which the Jews established in ancient times. He announced that Vice President Mike Pence would soon leave for the Middle East. \nThe president formally signed an order to the State Department to make preparations to construct a US embassy in Jerusalem as a \u201cmagnificent monument to peace.\u201d For two decades previous presidents exercised the waiver, refusing to deliver on their promise to move the embassy or recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital \u2013 although it was the will of Congress. \u201cI am delivering,\u201d Trump said. Two decades of waivers brought us no closer to peace than before and a repetition would not produce a better result. We believe that the new approach which I hereby announce is in the best interests of the US and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. \nEvery sovereign nation has the right to determine its capital. And for decades the Israeli parliament, the prime minister and president\u2019s residences and the supreme court are located here. We are recognizing reality. This is not a departure from my commitment to achieve a peace agreement, the president declared solemnly. He declined to take a position on the boundaries of Jerusalem or contested borders and said a two state solution was acceptable if agreed to by both sides. The status quo at religious site is to be observed, including Harm al-Sharif. Trump emphasized that he hopes to forge a peace agreement that is \u201ca great deal for Israel and the Palestinians.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike pence", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:06.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "820b6e2099fd738e62c971546a7e9e7225f677f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju36RX6Y9gGZL2GBpK_.1XYEbeXRu3Kk9kpfeUhZidDpmkw--", "site_full": "www.ign.com", "site": "ign.com", "site_section": "http://www.ign.com/boards/forums/pro-wrestling.10733/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Pro Wrestling | IGN Boards", "title": "Would You Rather", "title_full": "Would You Rather | IGN Boards", "published": "2017-12-06T12:51:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.ign.com/boards/styles/default/ign/ign-logo-100x100.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 383, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f1ba348c9da6cfdc57f0a0adda64352c4cd74a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju36RX6Y9gGZL2GBpK_.1XYEbeXRu3Kk9kpd1zrth8oPfswFffnL9YW1w", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Punkonator12", "published": "2017-12-06T12:51:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "ROUND FOUR\n1.

Today I am reviewing another PAC Cosmetics product. It is their Pac Zero Pore Separating Cream which is basically a Primer. Priming your face is very important before applying foundation. \nMakeup primer is a base for foundation or face makeup that allows it to go on smoother and last longer. Primer also act as a barrier against face and makeup, so that makeup cannot harm your skin by clogging pores. It comes in lot of variants for every skin type like gels, creams, water, serums etc. Investing in a good primer is a must if you are new to makeup. Hence, if you want a good quality primer which is also affordable, than keep reading my review. About Pac Zero Pore Separation Cream Primer \nRevolutionary new formula that acts as a primer to fill in pores present on the first of your skin. Pat the product on your face for best results and watch your skin transform into a smooth canvas for your foundation to sit on. A good base is key to flawless makeup. Silicon and paraben free. Available in two shades. Benefits How to Use PAC Zero Pore Separation Cream \nPat the product on skin for best results Ingredients in PAC Zero Pore Separation Cream Price of PAC Zero Pore Separation Cream \n\u20b9 650.00 for 30 g In Detail PAC Zero Pore Separation Cream Review, Shades, Swatches and My Experience \nPac Zero Pore Separation Cream comes in Pac\u2019s standard black cardboard square box. It has every necessary information printed on it. The actual product comes in a thick glass tub with black twist open cap. There is also a secure lid which I threw away. The cap closes tightly which ensures that the product is travel friendly and can be carried along easily without any hassle. The packaging is nice and sturdy. I once dropped the tub and it did not break (touchwood). \nThis primer comes in two variants which are numbered as 01 and 02. 01 has clear gel like consistency and 02 has little tinge to it. The variant I am reviewing today is 02 which has a tinge to it. Though there is no use of the tinge, I did not understood the concept of it. \nThe consistency of the primer is thick and smooth. It glides on face very smoothly and evenly. I take a pea size amount of it and massage it all over my face especially concentrating on the areas where I have pores issues that is my nose, chin and cheeks. This primer instantly smoothens out my skin and provides a smooth canvas to slather my makeup smoothly and evenly. \nIt perfectly blurs out my pores and fine lines to some extent. I really like how soft my skin feels after wearing this primer. It has an awkward smell to it which I cant even explain, but the finish it provides wins over the smell part of it. The smell lingers for few seconds and than vanishes away. \nMy makeup stays for about 8 to 9 hours when I wear this primer under my foundation. This primer is amazing for oily skin as I have extremely oily skin. It helps to control oil for a long period of time. I wear this primer and then allow it to sink in my pores and oil glands for 2 minutes. Then I apply my makeup base. I really love this primer and I am currently using it for the past 2 months whenever I wear makeup. Overall Verdict \nPac has never failed to impress me with their products. I really love this primer and I use this whenever I wear makeup for the last two months. Its thick in consistency but does not feel heavy on my skin. It instantly smoothens out my skin, fills in fine lines and pores to some extent. Currently I am using 02 variant but will definitely purchase the 01 variant as well.   Pros Of Pac Zero Pore Separation Cream Nicely packed. Comes secured with a lid to avoid spillage. Tub is very sturdy, I accidentally dropped it once and it has not break. Travel Friendly. Smoothens out my skin remarkably. Fills in my pore and fine lines. Affordable. Cons Of Pac Zero Pore Separation Cream Smells little awkward. MBF Advices Never skip a primer as it helps in fill up your pores. It also increases the staying power of your makeup. If you are looking for an affordable yet good quality primer than you should definitely try this baby out. If you have oily skin than you are going to love this primer of Pac. Allow your primer to sink in your pores for about 2 minutes and than do your makeup.

Many students take AP classes in high school. Others sign up for community college courses to save money before transferring to a 4-year institution. \nAnother option is to go online. Straighterline is a company that focuses specifically on online general education courses, allowing students to earn credits that can be transferred to over 100 colleges and universities. \nWe spoke with Burck Smith, Founder and CEO of Straighterline, about how his program can help students save money. \nHester Tinti-Kane: Hello I\u2019m Hester Tinti-Kane with EdTech Times, and today I\u2019ll be interviewing Burck Smith, CEO of StraighterLine. Thank you for making the time to speak with us today, Burck. \nBurck Smith: Thank you. Glad to be here. \nHester Tinti-Kane: So can you introduce yourself, and tell us a little bit about StraighterLine? \nBurck Smith: Sure. I am the CEO and founder of StraighterLine. We help students lower the cost and risk of starting college, and we help colleges track and retain students. We do this by offering extremely affordable general education courses, things like Psych 101 or English 101 or College Algebra, Econ 101, etc. They\u2019re guaranteed to transfer to willing colleges. Students start with a free trial and then, if they like the format, a $99 per month subscription. Which is substantially cheaper than even in-state community college prices. \nHester Tinti-Kane: So that\u2019s great. Thanks for that overview. Can you tell us a little bit about the history? How long has StraighterLine been around? \nBurck Smith: Sure. I started at StraighterLine in 2008. It was a division of my first company, which is an online tutoring service for colleges that is called SmartThinking. In 2010, StraighterLine became its own company. And for me, my background is in public policy. And really in the late 90s, what I was really interested in was the skyrocketing cost of higher education. It\u2019s something that was growing, and still is, significantly faster than the rate of inflation \u2014 obviously a problem for uhh middle and uhh\u2026 really all Americans. \nBurck Smith: And what was peculiar was that despite the skyrocketing cost of higher education, you also saw dramatic increases in online delivery. Prices weren\u2019t falling. Which is weird, because any kind of new technology tends to have lower prices in that market. And so in higher education, 93 percent of colleges still charge the same [sic] for online courses, as for face-to-face. So I did a little bit of thinking about what\u2019s going on in the market, and it became clear to me that it was very hard for new providers to come in and lower the price of essentially college credits by offering different sorts of services \u2014 accreditation and public subsidies that float a college just make it very difficult for these new providers. So what we set out to do was to start to use online courses as a way to drive down the price and the risk of starting college for students. \nHester Tinti-Kane: Interesting. So tell me how students come into contact with StraighterLine. I mean, if you think about a student searching for, you know, opportunities to take courses at universities, maybe that\u2019s face-to-face or online. How do they come into contact with StraighterLine as one of their options? \nBurck Smith: Sure. There are a few ways. First, if you are a student and you search for online college algebra or online English composition, or any of those course level search terms, we\u2019ve been around a long time and have great search engine authority. Which means that we come up high on the search engines, typically first. So when you\u2019re searching for those courses they\u2019ll come up, see us, then come over to our website and decide whether this is an option for you. \nBurck Smith: We also, this is something that\u2019s really grown pretty dramatically over the past three or three years, but colleges increasingly refer their own students to us. And they tend to do it if they have students that they can\u2019t enroll. So students that come to them and they need prerequisites for programs. Or they need to prove their ability prior to entry, or uhh\u2026.need to take math or writing courses prior to entry. A college might say, \u201cGo to StraighterLine, take your courses and come back. \nBurck Smith: They also have students who are already enrolled, but are at risk. They might be hitting financial aid caps or have affordability concerns, or summer scheduling issues or gen ed requirements \u2014 a whole variety of reasons. And when colleges do that, they may send students to us directly. \nHester Tinti-Kane: Got it. So, tell me what the typical StraighterLine student looks like. \nBurck Smith: We have many different types of students. So, it\u2019s hard to pick just one. You know, for instance, we have high school students who are trying to get credits prior to enrollment. We have international students trying to reduce the price of college. But, in general, most of our students would be classified as nontraditional. \nBurck Smith : And that\u2019s actually a term that the Department of Education uses for students who have any one of the following characteristics \u2014 if they are older, if they are part-time, if they\u2019re online, if they have families or if they\u2019re working, they\u2019re counted as nontraditional. That\u2019s actually the majority of students today. And those are the ones that are typically taking StraighterLine courses. \nHester Tinti-Kane: Got it. Can you share the story of one student\u2019s successful experience with your group? \nBurck Smith: Well again, it\u2019s really hard to pick one. We enrolled 22,000 students in the last twelve months. And so there\u2019s, there\u2019s a lot to choose from. And on our website, we have success stories covering all sorts of different categories. So I think probably the best is to\u2026 to share just a few categories. So one is uhh\u2026students needing credit to enter. \nBurck Smith: We work with a number of colleges, but one is Western Governor\u2019s University. And they have a requirement that students must have at least 12 credits to enroll. And so students that come to them who don\u2019t meet that requirement. They suggest to go to StraighterLine. Take those courses and come back. And what we see is a really strong return and then stronger persistence of those students than the rest of their cohort. These tend to be adult students who are, you know, want to work online in a competency-based environment. \nBurck Smith: We have another category of students that are essentially trying to save money. They\u2019re kind of, they\u2019re sort of shoppers. They are amassing credit from multiple sources prior to enrollment at a college. And that could be credits from other colleges, it could be from StraighterLine or CLEP. But they are doing whatever they can to reduce the costs and increase the speed with which they can get a degree. So we have a fair number of those sort of students. And then lastly, we have others kind of taking, you know, courses in ones twos or threes. You know they have a very specific need. Maybe fulfill courses prior to enroll in a graduate program \u2014 we have a number of health science students who are doing that. As well as business students. Where they may have a couple of courses in the summertime. So it\u2019s a number, a number of, a category of students just fulfilling kind of individual course needs. \nHester Tinti-Kane: Got it. So you just mentioned Western Governors University. What are some of the other successful partnerships that you have with colleges and universities? \nBurck Smith: Yeah, there are a lot. So we have a partnership relationship with 130 colleges. Over 130. They\u2019re on our website. It\u2019s probably best to sort of describe how we work with colleges. First, it\u2019s free to work with us. So there are a number of different ways really, in sort of increasing order of partnership. The first is an articulation agreement. It just is a signed agreement that guarantees that credit from us will transfer in certain ways to that college. And we do that because we don\u2019t want students enrolling with us and not getting the credit they think they\u2019re going to get. So we create these formal agreements for the college. It puts that college on our website, they have their own partner page. They become part of the selection set from which our students are choosing. And so it leads to increased enrollments for free at that particular college. And that\u2019s the group we have about 30-some relationships. \nBurck Smith: The second are colleges that want to go a little further, they actually want to refer students to us. Either exclusively or as an option. And in those cases we create tight partnerships with those colleges, so that we can work with preferred students to get them to succeed and return to the referring college. \nBurck Smith: And lastly, this is something that should launch in the next six to six months or so. We were selected as part of the Department of Education\u2019s equip program. What we will be doing is delivering up to three quarters of two associate\u2019s degrees for Brookhaven College in Dallas County Community College District. And students who enroll at the college will then take our courses as a program option within Dallas. \nHester Tinti-Kane: That sounds really exciting. \nHester Tinti-Kane: So is there anything else you want to share? I mean what\u2019s next for Straighterline? You just shared that that exciting program that\u2019s coming up. Anything else that\u2019s new? \nBurck Smith: Well it\u2019s a lot of doing more of what we\u2019re doing. I think we are addressing really big issues that are only going to get more pronounced. Higher education price has obviously been a big issue for a long time. Risk I think is also something that is becoming better appreciated is a problem. You know for many students, starting college is a very high risk decision, especially with the success rates, or the lack of success rates that we\u2019re seeing at the college level. So starting in a way that\u2019s low price, low risk\u2026 you know we have a free trial. Then you go into a subscription model that\u2019s WAY cheaper that starting directly and then not succeeding. \nBurck Smith: So the issues we\u2019re addressing are big and going to get bigger. And I\u2019m particularly excited about some of the programs we have in the works. When we can add a title four financial aid pathway for our students. Because we are not a college, we\u2019re not allowed to be accredited \u2014 We have agreements with accredited colleges but we are not a college ourselves. We can\u2019t use title four, or our students can\u2019t use title four. So perhaps it\u2019s pretty exciting. \nHester Tinti-Kane: That is exciting. Thank you so much for speaking with us today.

Satyavathi is a musician and scholar of rare perception. She has been conferred the Musicology Award by the Music Academy, Chennai for the music season 2017-2018 Dr. T.S. Satyavathi \u2013 utter this name in the music and literary circles of Karnataka, and the response is more or less homogenous. \u201cWhat a scholar, what oratory, and such an immaculate sense of music\u201d. There\u2019s more to add: Satyavathi is a warm host and modest in her demeanor. A Carnatic musician trained by the veteran R.K. Srikantan and her sister Vasanta Madhavi, a Sanskrit scholar, trained in musicology by the revered BVK Shastry, and a mridangam student under Bangalore Venkataram -- Satyavathi is all this and more. With all these multiple areas of specialisation, Satyavathi\u2019s musical aspiration however, moves in a single direction -- which is aesthetic perfection. \nIn her long career of innumerable concerts, lectures, demonstrations, workshops etc. Satyavathi has earned an army of admirers. She is looked upon as a serious and committed scholar and has earned prestigious accolades across the country and globally as well. If Music Academy has conferred the Musicologist award for the year 2017-18 on Satyavathi, it is no surprise. \nExcerpts from an interview with her: \nYou are a family of musicians. Your two sisters, your brother and you are musicians. Your mother seems to be the central figure in your lives. \nMusic came to us by birth. People would say even doors and windows of our house sang. So, it was like we almost had no choice but to learn music. My sisters were much older to me, and they had been receiving good training from the veteran, D. Subbaramaiah. My mother herself was trained in the Tyagaraja tradition. She was a hard taskmaster. As a child, I was listening to my sisters all the time, as a result of which I picked up music rather early. \nBoth me and my brother would be woken up by 5 a.m. and had to practice as long as my mother wanted us to. A practice list for each day would be ready. If we were obedient we even got incentives. Eight annas for an atta tala varna, four for vilambakala kriti , so on and so forth. We easily made ten to 12 rupees a month! But if we didn\u2019t practice, we would get it from her. Her passion for music is extraordinary. Even at 90, she remembers every kriti and prompts us if we forget. \nShe took us to Ramanavami concerts in Fort High school premises: tickets were too expensive, so we sat outside. With groudnuts and raw mangoes in our hands, we sat close to the speakers and listened. From our childhood experience, I believe that casual listening is of immense value. If you force the child to recognize raga, identify the composer...etc. they may develop revulsion. Instead, if you get them to listen without any of these pressures, I am certain it is more beneficial. You listen and it automatically creates a samskara . \nMy mother studied only up to high school, but was a voracious reader. Triveni, Aryambha Pattambhi, all the Bengali translations\u2026 she is immensely well read. At five, I knew all the stories from Ramayana and Mahabharatha. I have gained much from this great combination of literature and music -- one illuminates the other, and the meanings that emerge are endless. Even when I taught Sanskrit later in my life, I used to feel that music and literature have an inseparable relationship. \nOnce I did my vidwat exams and was awarded the national scholarship, I decided to learn under the veteran R.K. Srikantan. I was so fascinated by his music that I listened to everything he composed and sang. With the scholarship I could afford to pay his fees. That is how it was possible to learn from him. \nMy older sister Vasanta Madhavi was very strong in theory. She was our guide and had answers to all our questions. Music was a huge part of our lives and my mother undoubtedly has a big role to play. However, I feel, we too on our part did everything she asked us to, without asking her too many questions. \nWhere did your father figure in all this? \nMy father was not much of a samsari . He had given all the responsibilities of the family to my mother. He was a Gandhian: very mild, benign, unambitious, unassuming, and a simple person. I don\u2019t even have memories of him paying attention to our music until much later in life. It was only after I started performing he came to my concerts. \nHe used to walk a lot, nearly five kms a day. He washed his own clothes, and led a highly disciplined life. He never desired for anything. Neither did he question my mother\u2019s decisions about us. So my mother chose our school, college, the subjects we should study\u2026 everything. We faithfully took her advice. \nI did get a feeling that my father was not very much for educating girls. But he never interfered in my mother\u2019s decisions; he was very liberal in his attitude. My parents were remarkable \u2013 they never tread each other\u2019s toes, and had deep respect for each other\u2019s personality. \nMy mother is very intelligent -- she was far ahead of her times. To marry off her daughters was never her priority. She had great awe for knowledge, and groomed her daughters as women of substance. \nWhat kind of musical relationship did your siblings share? \nTill a point, my sisters were my teachers. My second sister Vasundhara was a wonderful teacher. But surprisingly, she had no ambition. She wanted to quietly settle down as a house wife. \nMy older sister Vasanta Madhavi\u2019s circumstances were different, though she was the first graduate from both sides of the family. She had to face many restrictions as she was the oldest among us. Of course, she did eventually take to teaching and performing. It was she who meticulously nurtured and honed my talent. None of us had ever imagined music as a profession. \nDo you share common views with Vasanta Madhavi on music? \nWe both used to discuss a lot on music. Each time we returned from a concert, we spent hours discussing and dissecting all its aspects. \nI think we do have minor differences, but these are things that I have gathered, and not something that has emerged from a discussion with her. For instance, I, like my guru Srikantan, believe that the composition is sacrosanct. I don\u2019t accept any changes in the way it is rendered. But my sister, I think, feels that there should be a creative element in it. It need not be sung in the same way each time it is rendered. \nYou studied percussion under Bangalore K. Venkataram. How did you get there? \nWhen I was 16, I sang Pallavi at Ganakala Parishath competition and won the first prize. Venkataram sir felt my sense of laya was good and asked me to be his student. I was excited because I was very interested in the intricacies of laya. He wanted me to become a mridangist since there was no other woman who had taken up this instrument. But my goal was set. I was interested in the study of laya, and not in the business of rhythm. I wanted to embed my musical practice into the philosophy of laya, so that it would enrich the experience of music. Also, I wanted to study Sanskrit. When he learnt this, he was indeed disappointed. \nHe was a gentleman, when women musicians were being fixed into their gender, he was modern in his thinking. He gave me an important role in Ganakala Parishat because of which I could interact with so many musicians. But the one thing he could not tolerate was indiscipline. He would leave for work by the 7.10 a.m. bus and expected me to reach his house by 6 a.m. Even if I was late by five minutes he would shout at me. I am so grateful for meeting such wonderful people who cared so genuinely for music\u2026 \nWhat sort of a teacher was R.K. Srikantan? \nHe was wonderful. Clear in his ideas, and chiselled in his approach. The frame of the raga was like a piece of sculpture \u2013 no flaws, no excesses. He was always studying the scripts of vaggeyakaras. That is how he grasped the nuances of the ragas. He would say, \u2018If you call, a raga it should come. No other raga should come.\u2019 He was so sure of his musical vision. \nHis training has taken me a long way. If I just see a script, and it says raga Surutti, I can sing. How Surutti should be interpreted was perfectly taught in his lessons. Even the way in which he fixed speed, it was neither slow nor fast. In his musical vision was a Madhya vilamba laya\u2026 he believed that it took you close to the vision of the composer. \nYour connection with literature is very intense. \nI had a huge exposure to literature from childhood. After my master\u2019s in Sanskrit, and subsequently becoming a lecturer, I attended huge international seminars in college. There was an art appreciation club to which all the great literatteurs were invited. Putina, Masti, Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar, Bhyrappa, G.S. Shivarudrappa, Ramachandra Sharma, DVG and more. Putina was our neighbour and I spent a lot of time in his house. He would make me sing his Shri Haricharite , indicating exactly how the notes had to flow with the rise and fall of his hands. What a great poet! \nThere would be a programme called Jignaasa Goshti at our college for which scholars like S.K. Ramachandra Rao used to come. I too have done several lectures on Kalidasa and other Sanskrit poets. \nTradition has become a difficult word today. It is associated with a political ideology, it is regarded as obsolete, whereas visible innovation and experimentation is considered modern and progressive. How do you react to this? Tradition is such a dynamic space, isn\u2019t it? \nCulture is so rich. The more you learn the more there is. It is unfathomable. But if you are not loud, and do not wear modernity on your sleeve, you are doomed to be seen as an obsolete traditionalist. Most people in a round about way tell me, \u201cFor you, old is gold after all.\u201d Our musicians are so alienated from their roots. Sadly, they have audience endorsement\u2026, people like me are almost unheard. \nWhen you discuss all this in small groups, musicians agree with you. But the circumstances are such that if you need to survive you will have to follow the trend. Most musicians have to go with the trend to make a livelihood. They understand the value of good music, but are helpless. They make a choice against their beliefs. \nTradition is a continuous flow, who ever knows how it was to begin with? Even though it is a flow, only when some things remain unchanged it can be called tradition. If the change is too drastic sudden and radical, then it cannot be called tradition. I always say that with respect to tradition, you can widen the frame but cannot change the frame. The changes are like the body, but what remains unchanged is the soul. \nThere must be a harmonious relationship between music and literature. You cannot bring all your musical ideas into sahitya. A sense of propriety and balance is very important. I cannot bear when people break down Tyagaraja and interpret him. That\u2019s too much. Lyrics, emotion and music \u2013 they must never be severed from each other. \nAs someone who has studied musicology too, do you like the current trends in music? \nFor me, music is not an intellectual exercise, it is emotional. Music should not incite, but should be replete with insights. Now music is about technique, intellect, volume and loudness. It is display of voice. Why should you sing raga Athana for 20 minutes, if its inherent nature demands only a compact presentation? \nShastra should be implicit, emotion should be explicit. Your shastra should never be visible in your singing. This is something my guru R.K. Srikantan stood by all his life. You must absorb technique, craftsmanship and allow it to be processed through your bhaava \u2026it will blossom into something beautiful. \nToday, connoisseurship has acquired a new meaning. It is all about brain now. They love loudness and display. Such music doesn\u2019t interest or inspire me. \nWhether we like it or not, gender is a huge issue in music. Do you feel you would have done better if you belonged to the other gender? \nI feel good in my own place. Not just that, I feel sorry for men who treat us as inferior only because of our gender. I laugh at them. \nThere is this violinist who I honed and encouraged. The last few times I invited him to accompany me, he always came up with excuses. One day, I asked him straight. \u201cYes, it is true I do not like to play for women,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is not true in the case of Sheela madam and you.\u201d Wasting no time I told him: \u201cBut we are also women. Please do not sacrifice your principles for us. I will not trouble you anymore.\u201d \nMusic will get better only when all kinds of egos are shattered. The good thing to do is draw a bigger circle next to you, you will realise how small you are. \nWhat is your personal vision of music? \nMy vision of true good music constitutes an aesthetic approach, double underlined. Be good to others, and see the other person as your own self\u2026 this is what music has taught me. \nWhen I go to a concert, I always praise their positives first, and then speak of the loopholes. If you cannot appreciate, be good, generous, your music will be a sad reflection of your miserliness. \nT.S. Satyavathi gets the Musicologist award from Music Academy for the year 2017-18.

On the other hand, if you invest too heavily in breakout potential, you can end up breaking your season when they fail to produce the hoped for return.  We'll start a series on breakout candidates with Matt Olson, 1B, Oakland A's.  He's a big guy at 6'5\", 230 lbs., B-L, T-R.  He is a former 1S round draft pick from 2012 who has worked his way up through the A's farm system.  He was called up in late May 2017 and struggled in his first month, then caught fire.  His overall line for the season was .259/.352/.651, 24 HR, 10.2 BB%, 27.8 K%, .238 BABIP in 216 PA.  In the second half, Olson hit .286 with 20 HR in 158 PA. \n\nIf you look back at his minor league record, the numbers are not dissimilar.  Some would say he has already broken out, but his 2017 HR's project to 70 over 600 PA while his 47 dingers combined between AAA and MLB likely offer a reasonable projection of what he might do in 2018.  The A's traded Ryan Healy at least in part to give Olson a clear shot at full time play.  He does have a fairly extreme L-R split and his numbers my suffer if he has more exposure against LHP's.\n\nJust for comparison, let's look at Cody Bellinger's stat line for 2017:  .269/.352/.581, 39 HR, 11.7 BB%, 26.6 K%, .299 BABIP, 548 PA.

This functionality will allow Onapsis customers to quickly evaluate if SAP systems are meeting the requirements of this mandate to protect EU data subjects information. As with any new policy, the first stage is to identify those SAP systems that are in scope. In the case of GDPR, these are any systems that process, handle or store user information. \nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an EU regulation with an enforcement date in May 2018 concerning the protection of EU data subjects\u2019 personal and sensitive information. Research conducted by the UK & Ireland SAP User Group shows 86% landscapes and how to reach compliance. It is almost certain GDPR will have an impact, in some way or another, on any company large enough to have chosen SAP, which touches all aspects of a business. In fact almost every SAP system includes GDPR\u2019s core element: personal data. \n\u201cIn speaking to our customers, we know that GDPR is a complicated mandate and many organizations are struggling to determine if or how their SAP landscapes are relevant. With this in mind, Onapsis\u2019s automatically evaluates any SAP system through the lens of the data protection requirements of GDPR. This includes both data at rest, data in transit and the assessment of data access or authorizations,\u201d commented Alex Horan, Director of Product Management, Onapsis. \nThrough the execution of this new policy, enterprises leveraging OSP can identify SAP systems that do not have adequate protection of the data and processes. Users will receive detailed guidance on how to address these security gaps. As new systems are brought in, scoped and tagged as GDPR, they will automatically be included in the next audit. \nFor further understanding of GDPR and how it affects SAP, download the recently released white paper from the Onapsis Research Labs titled, \u201c SAP \nOnapsis\u2019s Director of Product Management, Alex Horan, will host a live webcast to help organizations understand the complex issue of GDPR and SAP on December 19th at 9:00am and 1:00pm EST.

The wicked streak is dead. So where was this winning Broncos team all year? Will the world\u2019s largest passenger airliner \u2014 the A380 \u2014 ever come to Denver? Grading the Broncos in their 23-0 victory over the Jets Broncos snap eight-game losing streak with shutout victory over Jets The Broncos defensive line has shined during an ugly season. The group got its reward Sunday. He kept his Star Wars legacy a secret in Boulder for decades. At 85, the sci-fi pioneer is ready to step out. WASHINGTON \u2013 The animal experts could tell there was something off with the adult bald eagle as soon as it was brought in to City Wildlife, a rehabilitation center in Northwest Washington.\nThe bird wasn\u2019t flying and wasn\u2019t using its legs properly.\nAnd it was feisty.\nAll possible signs, experts said, pointed to lead poisoning, and a blood test confirmed that the eagle had high levels of lead, according to Paula Goldberg, executive director of City Wildlife.\nShe said the eagle was brought to her group Tuesday by a Maryland Natural Resource officer who found it in Nanjemoy, in Southern Maryland. She said the bird was found in some woods, sitting on its haunches, about 100 feet from a road.\n\u201cThere was clearly something wrong with it,\u201d Goldberg said. Wildlife veterinarians at City Wildlife examined the bird. Goldberg said it is not uncommon for bald eagles to have elevated levels of lead.\nRaptors are susceptible to lead poisoning because they often eat dead animals that have been hunted with ammunition that contains lead. Goldberg said, for example, that if a bald eagle eats a deer that has been shot with lead ammunition instead of cooper bullets, the lead stays in the deer\u2019s body and then it is digested when an eagle eats the deer.\nGoldberg said her staff believes that\u2019s likely what happened to this bald eagle.\nRelated Articles December 9, 2017 \u201cWe stood there crying\u201d: Video of emaciated polar bear seen on Canadian island kicks off discussion about climate change December 9, 2017 Former Colorado undersheriff guilty of leading illegal hunts December 9, 2017 As coal falters, a large polluter in Colorado could close its doors December 9, 2017 Are Colorado\u2019s cattle feedlots a risk to waterways?

She would not say where the eagle was being taken out of concerns the center has for its safety.\nCity Wildlife said this is the third bald eagle that the rescue operation has taken in since this summer and the only one with lead poisoning.\nRaptors suffering from lead poisoning can suffer muscle and central nervous system weakness and damage, experts said.

Follow these steps to ensure you're stocked up for your seasonal baking and feasting. by Ana Hotaling   unimaginable has happened \u2026 again. A couple of years ago, Easter came very early in the year. Too early: Our hens had not yet come out of their winter dormancy, and we had no eggs to color. When I suggested buying a dozen supermarket eggs for our sons to dye, my husband\u2019s horrified expression immediately trashed that idea. Paas did not visit our house that spring. \nI could handle a year without Easter eggs. However, as I prepare the menu for the winter holidays, I realize I\u2019ve reached an impasse. Too many recipes require eggs as ingredients. I must buy eggs. I can only imagine Jae\u2019s face when I tell him. \nYes, I understand that I can use egg substitutes such as applesauce and Egg Replacer in my baking. My youngest son, Bryce, spent the first six years of his life allergic to eggs, an irony I appreciated as a poultry farmer. As the holiday hostess, however, I have expectations to meet that involve properly preparing longtime family favorites. Eggs are therefore on my shopping list. \nDon\u2019t think for a minute that I\u2019ll simply send one of my sons down the dairy aisle for a dozen. I also won\u2019t send Jae for eggs. He\u2019d just stand there, arms crossed, contemptuously glaring at the tidy rows of cartons. Instead, I\u2019ll follow these four steps to ensure that the eggs served on my holiday table will be as delicious as those laid by our hens\u2014or as close to that as possible. 1. Phone A Friend \nBirds of a feather flock together and so do poultry farmers. We see each other at the feed store, at the community fairs and in the online groups. Chances are you know a few folks who keep the coop lights on for eggs year-round. Check with these fellow poultry farmers first. You might luck out and get yourself some homegrown eggs without having to head to the market. 2. Check Other Local Resources \nMost agricultural towns offer a setting for farmers can publicly sell their products. While this most frequently is a farmers market, agricultural co-ops and farming supply stores also often feature a section for such locally produced goods as honey, maple syrup, bread, dairy and produce. Our farm regularly stocks our town\u2019s mom-and-pop feed store with chicken, duck and turkey eggs. Contact your poultry-feed supplier or co-op to see if it has eggs in stock, or stop by the egg stall at your community farmers market if it\u2019s still operating. 3. Visit Specialty Markets \nMost big towns\u2014and some small ones, too\u2014have boutique markets stocked with non-GMO, organic and locally produced foods. These stores won\u2019t offer just white eggs and brown eggs. They\u2019ll have eggs labeled by the breed of layer, sorted according to eggshell shade and arranged according to geographical area. Many markets even post little information placards with factoids about the poultry farms producing these eggs. Look for eggs from a farm located as close to your home as possible. Its hens will have been exposed to the same pollens and will have foraged amongst the same types of grasses as your girls. The flavor of such a farm\u2019s eggs will therefore come close to yours. Keep in mind, however, that specialty markets tend to charge specialty prices for eggs. 4. Take A Grocery Store Gamble \nIf your only option is to buy eggs at a supermarket, don\u2019t despair. While store-bought eggs won\u2019t have the depth of flavor as your hens\u2019 eggs, they can still serve as binding agents for your baking and as ingredients in your holiday casseroles. Select your dozen carefully by using these guidelines: \nPack Date . Look for the U.S. Department of Agriculture shield on the egg carton. Egg cartons displaying the USDA shield must show the eggs\u2019 pack date (the day the eggs were washed and packed). This is a three-digit code representing that calendar date; for example, 335 would stand for Dec. 1, the 335th day of 2017. \nSell-By Date. The use of sell-by dates is regulated by each state\u2019s agriculture department and can vary greatly from state to state. Some states even prohibit the use of sell-by dates on egg cartons. Egg cartons bearing the USDA shield, however, must display a sell-by date within 30 days of the listed pack date.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ana hotaling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jae", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. department of agriculture", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grocery store gamble", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usda", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:09.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b1842d2eda497186605f0e564ac32075e23689b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTKE3QmNveSUyz11rsAuhFBE8q0Koc6oO0Av.QBFL7oVqY6HL7eIHAzvPfGrm8_jQNMfKtfKs5UDY9wZpfrHcCm", "site_full": "saltlakecity.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://saltlakecity.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist salt lake | personals search", "title": "Kissing", "title_full": "Kissing", "published": "2017-12-07T09:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b1842d2eda497186605f0e564ac32075e23689b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTKE3QmNveSUyz11rsAuhFBE8q0Koc6oO0Av.QBFL7oVqY6HL7eIHAzvPfGrm8_jQNMfKtfKs5UDY9wZpfrHcCm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "Kissing", "text": "favorite this post Kissing hide this posting unhide   Would love to kiss tonight.

Anyways.\nOne of them is all mahogany, 000 body size, solid top, the other is spruce and rosewood, Grand Auditorium, solid top as well. I know the basic differences between spruce and mahogany. I've listened to both and the differences are huge. The spruce one is brighter than my goddamn future and sounds more metallic, crisp and with stronger attack. The mahogany one sounds fine to me, and slight \"blending\" only pops up when strumming. Muddiness would be too much to say. I've heard muddy guitars before. It seems like a well made guitar all in all, so i would choose that one. But...\nMy questions are the following:\n1. How versatile are the tonewoods?\n2. Does mah really sound muddy or is that just the consequences of a poorly made instrument? (From what i've read, it's supposed to sound mellow, not dull and unclear)\n3. As a general rule, do spruce tops give the guitar a better note separation? Some lean towards spruce, other towards mahogany.\n4. Which one is more balanced sound-wise?\n5. Gives they are both solid tops, which one of them tends to get better with age/withstand wear, intensive use/time?\n6. The mah guitar has a satin finish, while the spruce one has a glossy finish. Does that affect the sound?\n7. Some guitar care lifehacks as a bonus?

It has the best strength to weight ratio of any traditional tonewood making it loud, bright, and responsive. Mah tops are heavier which gives them a fuller, warmer tone but they are quieter and less responsive ultimately making them a tad less versatile than spruce.\n2) Mah will typically sound a bit more muddy than spruce but I wouldn't necessarily call it a muddy top wood. If you are playing a spruce guitar next to a mah one and you think the mah sounds muddy by comparison that is normal. If the mah guitar sounds muddy all on it's own with nothing to compair it to then that particular guitar might just be dud. No 2 acoustics sound exactly alike so you could have 2 guitars side by side made from wood that came from the same tree built to the same spec and 1 will still be brighter and more clear than the other.\n3) Spruce typically gives better note separation to my ear.\n4) It depends on what you are looking for when you say balanced. Mah have a flatter frequency response so some would say that makes it more balanced. Others think the stronger top end from spruce is all part of having a balanced tone.\n5) Mah isn't affected by humidity is less prone to splitting and is resistant to bumps and dings. If you keep your guitar in the proper climate and you are careful not to bang it around then spruce holds up to string tension and playing just as well as mah.\n6) It's better to focus on what the finish actually is rather than how shiny it is. Waterbase lacquer is different than nitro which is different than acrylic which is different than poly. Typically poly sounds the least musical and can be dull but it is the most durable.

There are different types of spruce and some are brighter than others. Sitka probably isn't for you if you think spruce is a bit bright. Lutz or Adirondack have a fuller midrange than sitka but they are pretty expensive. Engelmann has a softer top end than sitka and it's clearer than cedar. It provides more warmth than Sitka but slightly less than cedar. Cedar can be too dark for some people and is the darkest sounding of the traditional top woods but you do actually get more bass from Sitka, Adirondack, or Lutz. The drawback with Englmann and cedar is that they are both pretty soft (engelmann isn't as soft as cedar) and don't stand up to the test of time as well as the other types of spruce and mah. I suspect you could be happy with Engelmann spruce, cedar, or mah. Not taking any online orders.

Shame that cedar doesn't last too long, i didn't know about that, it truly is a beautiful tonewood and has always been one of my favorites.\nI actually heard a Fender Adirondack before and it sounded way more crisp than i think Adirondack should be. Fender PM-3, though. Now that is a gorgeous sound as to what concerns an all mahogany guitar.

I do like the brightness of spruce, but it tends to become too crisp for my taste, and also the bass dominates too much. Maybe, maybe not. Guitars which are either, mellow, dull, or laminated, tend to go through strings every couple of days..After their strings lose their resonance, the guitars projection and top end goes along with them.\nBody size in a big arbiter of perceived high end. Jumbos tend to balance the stridency of spruce, with a full rich bottom end. In fact, Guild 12 strings, which were alleged to be the worlds best, were sitka topped, with maple B & S!.\nAll that notwithstanding, my vote goes for mahogany as a 2nd guitar in your collection, not a first.\nA lot of finger style players opt for spruce topped, orchestra model guitars. The smaller bodies are very responsive, and more articulate than cedar or mahogany. Paying with flesh gives a lot of high end away from the jump. If you're committed to growing your own fingernails, using CyA to harden them, putting on fake fiberglass nails, or dicking around with metal finger picks, by all means, buy the \"mellowest\" .guitar you can find. Otherwise, go for the spruce.\nEven my Taylor sitka and sapele 12 string mellows right out and purrs like a kitten, when I put down the pick.\nThat's my .05 cents, adjusting for inflation..\nCODA: I should add that I'm fairly old, and have listened to a lot of loud music over the years, so that may be coloring my opinion, so to speak.

Apart from the physical properties of the timber, it depends on construction. I'm a fingerpicker, and generally prefer spruce to mahogany and cedar for steel strings, but my mahogany-topped kona lap steel is ultra light weight (about 2 1/2 lbs) and sounds just fine to me, bright, loud, aggressive, fairly complex and good note separation. The only criticism I have is that it sounds too \"cheerful\" for my style of music.

A difference in the hearing frequency spectrum is part of Homo sapiens sexual dimorphism. Women have a much sharper high frequency hearing response than men. After men pass 18 or 19, they really can't hear above 15 Khz very well. It is believed that teenage and younger girls, can hear well up into frequencies that we consider ultrasonic.\nMen have, as a rule better eyesight.\nI used to sell stereo equipment, and my worse nightmare was when a husband and wife team came in to buy speakers The man would groove to tweeters that spit razor blades, while the missus curled up next to the woofers, holding her ears in pain.\nIn any event, I cooked up a seemingly sexist explanation for the sensory differentials. \"Men have better eyesight so they can spot game, whereas women have better high end hearing so they can hear their babies crying\". It really is a observation that good old Chuck Darwin would most likely make, if he were able to join this discussion. The HF loss in men reaching marriageable age, could also be to render us somewhat impervious to nagging. It's not that we don't listen, it's just that evolution has helped us to tune you out.\nBTW, I've researched all the facts in paragraph one as being correct. (Over several decades). And reasonably speaking, the differences in hearing and vocalizations between the male and female of our species, can easily be explained and compared with,behaviours and traits in other mammalian species.\nOne oddity of humans though, is we're the only mammal that's never truly weaned: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactase_persistence Last edited by Captaincranky at Dec 8, 2017, 3:20 PM Dec 8, 2017, 7:07 AM Like Reply Quote: T00DEEPBLUE Gentlemen...

For example. I've never felt the urge to suffer the pain of childbirth, or to date another man. Evolution has both tasked us with, and assigned us to, a purpose. With 7 billion of us on the planet, one could argue it has done its job all too well.\nKeep in mind I view man as the most successful, ruthless, deadly, and greediest predator to ever walk the face of the earth, not with the arrogance and hubris of something that, \"god created in his own image\".\nI think neither dogs or cats can tolerate chocolate or aspirin. But, they tolerate benzodiazapines very well. In fact, you can use them to treat litter box issues, and anxiety in kitty and Fido. It gives one pause to wonder if millenniums of inclusion of the two species into human society, has altered their brain chemistry and allowed them to be burdened with our neurosis. or they're more like us than we care to admit or imagine.\nBut that can't be true because, \"god gave man dominion over the animals, didn't he? (Which sort of tacitly states we don't believe we're animals).\nBut, the fact still remains, a woman might prefer a more mellow guitar than a man, based purely on biological factors which affect that preference. .

India clinched the three-match series against Sri Lanka 1-0 after the third and final Test ended in a draw at the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium in New Delhi.\nFull scorecard\nWith this series victory against Sri Lanka, Kohli has now led Team India to nine consecutive Test series victories. Kohli equalled former Australia captain Ricky Ponting's record of nine consecutive series victories as captain. Under Ponting, Australia won nine straight series' from 2005 to 2008.\nIndia have now joined England and Australia with nine successive series wins. England recorded nine straight series triumphs from 1884 to 1892.\nComplete coverage: Sri Lanka's tour of India\nKohli's first series victory as captain came against the same opposition in 2015 in Sri Lanka. He followed that up with victories against South Africa (home), West Indies in 2016 (away), New Zealand in 2017 (home), England (home), Australia (home), Bangladesh (home), Sri Lanka (away).\nKohli and India will have the chance to topple Ponting's Australia when they face South Africa in a three-match series starting on January 5 at the Newlands. It won't be easy however, as the visitors have never won a series at the Proteas' den.\nKohli remains the third most successful Indian captain in the history with 20 victories from 32 matches. Mahendra Singh Dhoni leads the pack with 27 victories from 60 Tests as captain. Sourav Ganguly is second with 20 wins from 49 Tests as captain.\nPhotos: Meet India\u2019s 15-man squad for Sri Lanka ODI series\nMeet India\u2019s 15-man squad for Sri Lanka ODI series 2017 has been a momentous year for the Indian captain personally as well.\nKohli finished 2017 with a staggering 2818 international runs across international formats. The India captain scored 1059 runs in 10 Tests, 1460 runs in 26 ODIs and 299 runs in 10 T20 Internationals.\nThe 29-year-old hammered 11 hundreds including three double centuries (one vs Bangladesh and two vs Sri Lanka). He has been rested from the ODI and T20I series against Sri Lanka and will now play for India only from January 5 when the first Test against South Africa gets underway.\nSri Lankan legend Kumar Sangakkara (2868) holds the record for most international runs in a calendar year. Former Australian batsman Ricky Ponting, who had amassed 2833 runs in 2005 is second in the list. Kohli is third.\nThe dynamic Indian captain is likely to finish the year as the highest run-scorer in ODIs unless Rohit Sharma has an outstanding series against Sri Lanka this month. Currently, Kohli is also the third highest-run scorer in Test cricket in 2017.\nIn the course of a dominant year for India, Kohli also went past Ricky Ponting and is now second in the list of century scorers in ODIs. The Delhi dasher has 32 hundreds so far in the 50-over format and is well on course to topple Sachin Tendulkar with most tons in ODIs.

Among the latest introduction approaches in this sector are the new forms of equipment such as the crane. They have led to the elimination of huge loads of manual work and the overall increment of efficiency. In any investment, investors should be wise and smart in setting up their plans and targets. Consider the following features when starting a crane Rental NJ business.\n\nThe site. It should be strategic and accessible. Customers passing by while driving or even pedestrians have to see the location of the business. This in one way triggers them to want to know the services offered and may eventually turn to hiring them. The locality chosen has to be spacious to accommodate various sizes of gadgets. It allows mobility and flexibility of the machines.\n\nRelief of land. The owner has to, first of all, consider the type of land that the crane will be taken to work on before release. If it is a sloping area, costs of hiring are likely to be relatively higher than places that will be flat. This will dictate the potential dangers such as damages and accidents to workers on sites. Both parties must be in a consensus about charges before embarking on tasks.\n\nQualities of work. They include all the sets of attributes and features likely to be borne by machinery. Either directly or indirectly, rates of output are determined by how equipment is made to perform. The newest models are the best to consider hiring since they are likely to have latest features to allow faster rates of delivery. Old ones can easily break down along the way or become slow.\n\nTaxes to be paid. For these types of gadgets in construction sector, owners have to settle some amounts with authorities. They will then be given permits to operate them and have work done by professionals. These charges must be directly linked to the hiring costs so that after payment of the taxes, profits accrued and other costs of maintenance are met in the long run.\n\nAge of machinery. It will either entail whether the equipment is old or new. For the new one, they will often be higher valued since they will come with modern features enabling faster operations. You certainly want your work done within the shortest time thus need to go for those machines in the best condition to perform. Refrain from old ones since their rates of breakdowns will also be high.\n\nStability of the company. This tells more about when a given organization was established. It also gives an insight of whether technical operators of types of machinery are qualified and experienced to handle challenges that crop up. Normally, customers are always advised to give priority to those institutions well established since their output is well competent, professional and up to good standards.\n\nLogo of business. It is the mark of quality that must be designed by an expert. It is a true reflection of what is offered by a business and how competent they are. It must be made in such a manner that differs with that of other competitors. By simply viewing the logo, a prospective client should be able to tell whether amenities likely to be received are up to standards.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can get fantastic tips on how to select a crane rental NJ company and more information about a reliable company at http://www.newjerseycranerental.com/Crane-Rental-NJ-Services.html right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "frank stewart", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:11.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a7cf6bfa05e52d4f6799d95f83563ff9d9a7c936", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpSSZAO9dmJfBgAhqqB5U8.YQAse3KLGlejJF5YVTqyIvoPHyoKckC8WfJziTzCXThYW2ZFiBqwoBA--", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual?page=3", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK - HotUKDeals - page 3", "title": "Maplin Outdoor Laser Projector Light - \u00a319.99 (C&C)", "title_full": "Maplin Outdoor Laser Projector Light - \u00a319.99 (C&C) - HotUKDeals", "published": "2017-12-05T04:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2847908_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a742c145b272a6bab5d025b3840e4ad15f0a521a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpSSZAO9dmJfBgAhqqB5U8.YQAse3KLGlejJF5YVTqyIvoPHyoKckC8WfJziTzCXThZw4H0YpKYYtcYzX.ZWAIbdHQZpxe7Z6sM-", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "jeeeeeez", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "j z 5 h, 43 m ago Has this site lost all ability to shop around?

Nowadays, literature can be classified into numerous categories and subgenres and each one has different characteristics that define it. In society and pop culture, the process of composing these works of literature can further be categorized into different aspects, including one for professionals, those that have a journalistic approach, and some for academic purposes.\n\nNot only that, the act of composing messages and creating these works has also become a primary means of communicating and relaying new information in most societies. Due to this, a person needs to learn how to effectively incorporate it into their lives to adapt. There are all kinds of workshops and classes that focus on its practice and propagation. In line with that, the succeeding paragraphs will be focusing on the innumerable benefits of joining creative writing tutoring .\n\nAny person that joins a course the focuses on this area has to compose a lot of works and share them with the class and appointed instructor. This means that constant practicing enables them to widen their range of vocabulary, which entails learning new words and their meaning, to use them in an appropriate manner. After the entire workshop is over, they are guaranteed to have a wider knowledge on words and their meaning.\n\nWhenever a new assignment or a piece of work is issued out, it entails coming up with new ideas. This is most apparent in writing short stories, wherein one has to come up with a good plot that captures the interest and also when composing papers that focus on nonfiction topics. However, this cannot be successfully done when the person writing does not know how to arrange their points and the overall topic. This can be changed or improved regular attendance and practice as well.\n\nUpon completion of certain projects assigned to you, the appointed mentor will then review the submitted output for corrections and feedback. At this point, it is important and beneficial to pay attention to their feedback, especially considering that it aids in developing a better creative process and improving technical facets of your writing. It benefits you in many ways because composing such outputs is essential in many careers and subjects in school.\n\nFurthermore, joining a workshop or securing a tutor to help you with the creative process of writing will challenge your skills in organizing. The entire process involves you constantly organizing ideas to create a better outline or plot for a story or essay. This is most apparent in writing stories or screenplays, wherein one has to ensure that the plot makes sense and is written in a chronological manner, where readers will not have a hard time comprehending the contents or timeline.\n\nJoining a class that specializes in this also aids in developing persuasive abilities. Even though being persuasive mainly benefits persons working in certain fields such as retail, everybody can benefit from learning how to persuade or motivate a reader. This comes in handy for many applications and professions, such as advertising products, teaching new topics, coaching sports, and other activities that involve communication.\n\nInteraction is often necessary within this field or environment because some projects or tasks require brainstorming and providing your own idea or judgment in something. Due to this, you get to learn from other people and broaden your perspective on many topics or life in general. Having the benefit of attending a class of diversified people aids in being more tolerant and open minded to the ideas or practices of others. Though you may not necessarily agree with them, you at least have put some thought into it before making a final judgment or decision.\n\nApart from that, joining a course is an excellent way to meet new people and develop new friendships with them. Since you already share a common experience and passion, it makes for a great foundation for a friendship. Not only that, it can aid you later on when networking for jobs or broadening your contacts for business.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can find an overview of the advantages you get when you use creative writing tutoring services at http://www.writers.consulting right now. \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "deborah morgan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:12.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0cdc248d16a7610f6fb838621defcd41f405bb7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpg6jl4hUeH26XPVjqmpfmRDaGRWdgvLLpohZ9BVfhxvruq4bagRnH7e1ShfgQ6JQhd5qcEItHigAArSt_VV3h.H2QdZI.9duexE3l0ryRIKA--", "site_full": "silkycaress.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://silkycaress.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "SILKY CARESS", "title": "Working With The Best Animal Communication Specialists", "title_full": "Working With The Best Animal Communication Specialists", "published": "2017-12-07T11:17:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0cdc248d16a7610f6fb838621defcd41f405bb7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpg6jl4hUeH26XPVjqmpfmRDaGRWdgvLLpohZ9BVfhxvruq4bagRnH7e1ShfgQ6JQhd5qcEItHigAArSt_VV3h.H2QdZI.9duexE3l0ryRIKA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "John Becker (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:17:00.000+02:00", "title": "Working With The Best Animal Communication Specialists", "text": "Working With The Best Animal Communication Specialists By Frank Fox Having a pet at home is quite wonderful.

The interface will be available next year at sales-api.hsl.fi. At the same time, HSL is inviting all transport operators, in Finland and abroad, to develop and innovate new mobility services using the interface. \n\u201cWe are building a highly innovative and advanced digital retail API. A lot of work remains to be done but we are confident that we will have many types of businesses and innovative pilot projects generating creative value-added services using the interface. We also aim to actively contact transport operators both in Finland and abroad,\u201d explains Mari Flink, director of HSL\u2019s Customer Experience and Sales Department. \nHSL has solid expertise with and traditions in open interfaces. For example, the highly popular journey planner service, Reittiopas, has already been using open interfaces for 15 years. However, in an open sales API, information security and minimizing business risks are critical factors. \n\u201cOpening interfaces for accessing data is considerably easier than opening a public sales interface, which moves plenty of money and high transaction volumes. We want to ensure that the interface poses no information security or credit risks. Some 370 million journeys are made annually on HSL\u2019s transport services, and there are dozens of millions of sales transactions. We are talking about a huge volume here,\u201d emphasizes Hannu Heikkinen, director of HSL\u2019s Technology Solutions Department. HSL\u2019s interface will continue to be developed after its first launch. \nAt the same time, HSL will start a two-year Idea Lab program for mobility services, and invites transport market operators from Finland and abroad to participate in the program. HSL\u2019s Idea Lab project tests the operating models of mobility services as a joint operation. \n\u201cWe are currently allocating resources at HSL for the MaaS project and assembling a team to develop mobility services in the HSL area through a variety of pilot projects. As part of the Idea Lab, there will be an innovation contest for mobility services, from which we will select the ideas to be piloted. The ideas can apply to physical mobility services, ticketing and marketing collaboration, combination and relaying services for travel chains, or experimenting with automated transport. The experiences from the pilots will be assessed and used as a basis for further developing HSL\u2019s services,\u201d says Flink. \nContacts \nMaaS and HSL Idea LabMari Flink", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hannu heikkinen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mari flink", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labmari flink", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flink", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "helsinki region transport to launch world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "first public transport retail interface open to everyone helsinki region transport to launch world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hsl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helsinki region transport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hsl\u2019s customer experience and sales department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hsl\u2019s technology solutions department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "helsinki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idea lab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:12.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf77ed16b33864e63be11d09bc2749c0d374bf95", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsK2dxfA2KvfIrmH3TtVdeZI8ta2UkSllwIOgStoN2Gso8vWQhbr3RhpljF5_1N0boDHxorFE8xRAi", "site_full": "community.breastcancer.org", "site": "breastcancer.org", "site_section": "https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/91", "site_categories": ["health", "non_standard_content", "cancer", "adult"], "section_title": "Breast Cancer Forum: Surgery - Before, During, and After ", "title": "December 2016 Surgeries", "title_full": "Breast Cancer Topic: December 2016 Surgeries", "published": "2016-10-20T06:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31570, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9b3bb18ca827c0e7545d2302d0d86b48ba190fbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsK2dxfA2KvfIrmH3TtVdeZI8ta2UkSllwIOgStoN2Gso8vWQhbr3RhpljF5_1N0boDI8W0QPwC3I80WHDfkQYo7o-", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "MyJourneys", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hi Everyone!

I hope they don't find anything when they do the pathology, because then I really will be starting over. For some reason, I think they will. I hope I'm wrong, though. Lobular cancer is sneaky, so even though I had clear margins with my lumpectomy, it could still be hiding in there.

He added that he was directing the US State Department to develop a plan to move its Israel embassy from its current location in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nTrump framed the decision as a way to put his own stamp on one of history\u2019s oldest conflicts.\n\n\u201cThe record is in: after more than two decades of waivers, we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result.\u201d\n\nThe move showed Trump\u2019s inclination to prioritize domestic politics over the desires of U.S. allies in the Middle East and Europe who warned the announcement could spark violence in a region that is already a powder keg.\n\n\u201cWhile previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\u201d the president said. \u201cToday, I am delivering.\u201d\nIt will hardly play out that way. As Bloomberg notes , leaders across the Middle East, including from Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the Arab League have also spoken out against the plan, and Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called Trump\u2019s plan a sign of U.S. \u201cfailure and impotence.\u201d\n\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II, warned him the announcement would have \u201cdangerous\u201d repercussions for regional stability. Separately, the Palestinian delegate to the United Kingdom said on Wednesday that President Trump\u2019s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel signals \u201ca declaration of war\u201d in the region. \u201cHe is declaring war in the Middle East, he is declaring war against 1.5 billion Muslims, hundreds of millions of Christians that are not going to accept the holy shrines to be totally under the hegemony of Israel,\u201d Manuel Hassassian told BBC 4 Radio\u2019s \u201cToday.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish government\u2019s spokesman on Wednesday said that the United States\u2019 decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel will plunge the region and the world into \u201ca fire with no end in sight\u201d.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the \u201cwhole world is against\u201d Trump\u2019s move. He says that moving the embassy to Jerusalem would be a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d and would \u201cnot bring any stability, peace but rather chaos and instability.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has also blasted Washington\u2019s decision to relocate the US embassy to Jerusalem as a display of incompetence. \u201cThat they claim they want to announce Quds as the capital of occupied Palestine is because of their incompetence and failure,\u201d Khamenei said, using the Arabic name for Jerusalem.\n\nThe Syrian government also weighed in on the planned move. \u201c[The move] is the culmination of the crime of usurping Palestine and displacing the Palestinian people,\u201d a Foreign Ministry official told state news agency SANA.\n\nPalestinian Christians in Bethlehem were spotted burning photographs of Donald Trump and holding signs reading \u201cMove the embassy to your country, not ours,\u201d and \u201cJerusalem, Palestine\u2019s heart, is not up to negotiations.\u201d\n\nPalestinian Christians in Bethlehem were spotted burning photographs of Donald Trump \nThe declaration of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital carries deep symbolic significance and could have dangerous consequences. The competing claims to east Jerusalem, the section of the city captured by Israel in 1967, have frequently boiled over into deadly violence over the years. East Jerusalem is home to the city\u2019s most sensitive Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites, as well as its 330,000 Palestinian residents.\n\nThe United States has never endorsed the Jewish state\u2019s claim of sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem and has insisted its status be resolved through Israeli-Palestinian negotiation.\nThe mere consideration of Trump changing the status quo sparked a renewed U.S. security warning on Tuesday. America\u2019s consulate in Jerusalem ordered U.S. personnel and their families to avoid visiting Jerusalem\u2019s Old City or the West Bank, and urged American citizens in general to avoid places with increased police or military presence.

Today we\u2019re talking about how universities are transforming to the cloud. Here with us is John Rome from Arizona State University. Hi John. How\u2019s it going? \nJohn Rome: Good. How are you today? \nHannah Nyren: So John, tell me, in a sentence or two, what do you do at ASU? \nJohn Rome: So my title is actually deputy CIO. And I work in our central IT organization. But really, my day job is dealing a lot with analytics. So, I would say probably more than 50 percent of my day is dealing with, \u201cHow do I provide data to the university?\u201d\u201cHow do we report on that data?\u201d And, \u201cHow do we use it to advance the institution?\u201d \nHannah Nyren: That\u2019s interesting. And data has become more important in the role of higher ed. So tell me, why is this data so important today? \nJohn Rome: Well, I think the idea is that we can spend our lives trying to do things anecdotally, but we think because we think a certain way, that we should react a certain way. But when you have data, it\u2019s fact. Whether it\u2019s survey data, or whether it\u2019s data about enrollment \u2014 I now can then look at that data and take an action from it. Versus saying, well, I think students feel this way. Versus, you know, here is a survey of how students feel. So I think that\u2019s really the importance of data. And ASU is really taking data seriously. \nHannah Nyren: So how is your university transforming to adapt to newer technologies today? \nJohn Rome: Well, I can\u2019t have an interview without letting everyone know that ASU is the most innovative institution three years running. \nHannah Nyren: Oh really? \nJohn Rome: So, I think, clearly we\u2019re using technology to help. Help us to be innovative. But I think it goes more than that. I think really one of the things we really focus on here is really around student success. How do they become successful? How do they learn? Because ASU is such a big place, one of the first things we do is, you know, how do we use technology to make our base feel much smaller, and much more much more intimate. And I think technology has that ability to do that. \nHannah Nyren: And how? How can technology make it more intimate? \nJohn Rome: Well, I think they have the ability now to scale. You have the ability to to look at data and and just use that technology to make things easier for our students. \nJohn Rome: And I think the way that we do that is that we provide them the information that they need. We provide them one-stop shopping. So instead of them having to go all these different websites, we provide information in this one place. If they\u2019re trying to get into the learning management system, or they\u2019re trying to to go to parking, it\u2019s it\u2019s one-stop shopping. And then also, like in the residence halls, we\u2019re putting technology there as well. \nJohn Rome: You know, we recently put [Amazon] Echo Dots in the new engineering residence halls. So, now they can ask ask Alexa a question and get a response back. So those are the ways that we\u2019re really trying to use technology to help our students. \nHannah Nyren: And how does the cloud play a role in the integration of your technologies on campus? And you know, off campus? \nJohn Rome: You know, that\u2019s a great question. I think that the cloud is just really helping us to be able to move faster. \nJohn Rome: You know, there\u2019s a fear of the cloud. But I think ASU is in a unique position where we\u2019ve used private clouds in the past, and now we\u2019re moving more towards public clouds. But just the ability of the services that are out there that we can, you know, build servers much faster. Instead of us taking six weeks to get a server online, now it takes, let\u2019s say six minutes to get a server online. \nJohn Rome: You know the beauty about the cloud, especially the public cloud, is that you have this ability to move much faster. And the services that are available out there are just, are amazing, in how they\u2019ve grown. As I\u2019ve noticed in the past few years. \nHannah Nyren: Yeah, they certainly have grown. What way, specifically, has the technology that\u2019s available changed over the past few years? \nJohn Rome: Well one thing I think, alone, is really just the performance. I think in the past, you know, the cloud was still a little bit sketchy in terms of say, up time, or performance in terms of speed. And I think that a lot of those issues have been have been taken care of. And so, now that you have the ability to run in the cloud as fast as you would, or almost as fast as you would running things on-premise. I think that has been one of the major milestones, or the big jumping point of saying now, I can do a lot of the things that\u2026 I couldn\u2019t do before in the cloud. Now I can do those in the cloud. \nHannah Nyren: So where is ASU in the process of implementing cloud technologies within your systems? \nJohn Rome: I think that we probably adopted the private cloud a lot faster than others. But when people typically talk about the cloud today, they\u2019re talking about the public cloud. I would say that we\u2019re probably now probably into the second quarter of the game. \nJohn Rome: You know, and I would say, a lot of higher ed, basically the game is just starting. \nHannah Nyren: So can you give a specific example of like what part of the process you are in? Are you implementing HR software, are you planning, trying to choose what software you\u2019re going to use. \nJohn Rome: Some of the applications that we\u2019re running in the cloud, that would include Salesforce. Also ServiceNow. We also just kicked off a Workday implementation for a new financial system. And so those are all, you know, our true SAAS application, software as a service, running in the cloud. When we look at our other major systems, ERP systems, like student and H.R., those are running in a private cloud, right? \nJohn Rome: So those are. Those are some of the systems that we\u2019re running in the cloud. Where, what I\u2019m thinking of as a little bit more, a little bit differently in terms of trying to run our servers up in the cloud like infrastructure is. So, we\u2019re in the process right now of of moving all of our business intelligence, that would be all the databases where our data is. And the reporting that\u2019s associated with that, into the, into the into the public cloud right now. And that would include everything from from running databases out there, moving data there, and then also providing the tools where where our customers can go and run queries or run reports to get the data that they need to to run the institution. \nHannah Nyren: And for such a huge university with an even bigger online program, that must be really complicated. \nJohn Rome: Yeah. It gets, it gets very complicated. You know, this is a huge place with a lot of different technology groups as well. And so I think that part of it is that, as being part of the central I.T., we\u2019re kind of making those inroads into this environment. You know, it\u2019s a little bit harder than we thought in terms of some of the technology around it, but I think the thing now where we\u2019re doing the inroads now that will help us move much faster as an institution. So if departments like our our online community, our ASU online technology group, wants to take advantage of the cloud. We\u2019re prepared to help them. Or say the colleges or businesses around the university want to use the cloud. We\u2019re kind of making those inroads for them to come in and then just join us as we go on this journey to the cloud. \nJohn Rome: It\u2019s almost like the cloud is becoming more safe than a lot of your stuff on-premise. \nHannah Nyren: So what are the unique challenges of implementing cloud technology in higher ed, and how have you overcome these challenges so far? \nJohn Rome: Sure. I would say that, one of the biggest challenges that a lot of folks have is really around security and privacy. About now, I\u2019m taking this data that that either I\u2019ve stored it on premise for all these years, about Now I\u2019m going to move it the cloud. And, you know, is is is that data going to be safe there? And I would say, that the amount of resources that our cloud providers have now in terms of protecting that data, is much greater than it\u2019s ever been. And it\u2019s in some ways almost safer than a lot of the data that we have locally. \nJohn Rome: So that\u2019s I think that\u2019s one of the first major challenges you have to go over. And then I think some of the other challenges that we\u2019ve had here is that, our staff have to be sort of re-trained or sort of rethink about how they do things, that you know no longer do I have to worry about hardware because the public cloud is taking care of that. A lot of our staff now are, you know, they\u2019re no longer worried about unloading boxes and bringing servers in, they really can spend their time about how do I set up infrastructure and services. \nJohn Rome: So those are some of the big challenges. Then how do I, how do I then move up the value chain? And I think those those are probably the two biggest challenges that I can think of. And then it\u2019s just a brand new set of tools and software and user interfaces that you just have to become accustomed to, that over time, it\u2019ll just become more and more familiar. And I think we\u2019re on that road we\u2019re on that road right now to, how do we become more and more comfortable in the cloud. \nHannah Nyren: And how has your staff responded? I know a lot of people in IT worry that they\u2019ll be displaced but umm, you know, it\u2019s a little bit more complex than that. Can you tell me how your staff has responded to this shift? \nJohn Rome: I mean I think that most of them have responded really positively. They see this as a, you know, the new opportunity. They understand that over time, you know, mainframes go away and then we have service technology. They understand that with technology, it\u2019s changing constantly. I mean, who would have thought that something like a mobile phone would have transformed the industry like it did. So I would say that those who adapt to change do fine. And so I think there\u2019s this huge opportunities for a lot of the staff, who are of course skeptical. But I would say that when I look around our organization, again being this innovative institution that we are, they in our staff are looking for these opportunities to grow their skill sets, to look at new opportunities. and they know by using these new technologies they\u2019re just going to make lives easier for everyone either for themselves, or for our customers who use technology or. \nHannah Nyren: Yeah I think that\u2019s the case with a lot of different people I\u2019ve talked to about this subject. And I\u2019m glad actually that your staff has adapted so well. Because some people have a little bit more resistance to change. \nJohn Rome: Yeah, no doubt about that at all. And umm you know one of the other things I would mention is that the other thing that we\u2019re trying to do too. So in addition to using the cloud to run our systems that run the university, whether these are ERP systems or reporting systems, or just servers alone, we\u2019re actually doing more and more looking at how does the cloud help help the classroom. And so I teach a big data course in our business college. And we\u2019ve decided in this class to move all of the assignments, all of the work into, the public cloud. First of all, it\u2019s great experience for our students who, you know, don\u2019t necessarily understand the complexities of how do I build servers. But they don\u2019t have to worry about now, because they can now build servers in the cloud. And having that ability to sort of teach them about the cloud and the advantages of that, but then also just having the ability of not having to run things locally and having things go down, it seems that the cloud is so resilient. All that really makes for a great experience for students to start learning this. And then as an instructor, I really don\u2019t have to worry about the technology. Is there enough memory in that machine? Is this database going to have enough capacity to for all the students to query it? \nJohn Rome: So not only are we seeing it in in running our infrastructure in the institution. We\u2019re now seeing it being used more and more in the classroom, and in classroom delivery. And there\u2019s just huge opportunities. And of course we\u2019re starting primarily in the computer fields. But I see other opportunities as we look in other disciplines as well. \nHannah Nyren: Great. So what outcomes do you expect in the next five to 10 years. How will the technology innovations that you\u2019re implementing now change the way that ASU looks online and off-line? \nJohn Rome: Well I have to look into my crystal ball now, because you know who would have thought that technology changes like it does. First of all, the cloud is inevitable. When we talk to all of our vendor partners, a lot of those who are running our systems right now, guess where they\u2019re moving? To the cloud. These companies who use to manage their own data centers, where are they moving their technology? To the cloud. \nJohn Rome: So, first of all, it\u2019s inevitable that it\u2019s going to happen. And, you know, it\u2019s really hard to sort of see what the future is going to look like, five years, let alone 18 months out. But I think that you\u2019re just going to see services. These micro services, or this ability to take advantage of technology very quickly. \nJohn Rome: Let me just give you one example. We decided that students really complain about Wi-Fi at Arizona. And like, how do you really get a pulse on that? Well first of all, we realized that social media is the place that it happens. And we were able to quickly, within a three or four day period, first go out there to social media like Twitter and find all the tweets that had the word ASU and the word Wi-Fi in them. And we were able to take that streaming data, we get almost a million tweets a year about ASU, and we were able to pare those down to Wi-Fi. And then we actually shipped those off to our help desk in a slack channel. \nJohn Rome: So within a five minute period, the ideas of students complaining about Wi-Fi we had the ability that an agent, a helpdesk agent at ASU, responds to that saying, \u201cHey, Johnny I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having problems with Wi-Fi. Please call this number and we\u2019ll help you out.\u201d Just that ability to move that fast to provide service. We we don\u2019t have that ability in the past to do it. Clearly it would take six months to get a server and then you have to write all the technology and services a round that. And you wouldn\u2019t have the programming interfaces to go get the Twitter feeds and load databases and push it to technologies like a Slack channel. We just didn\u2019t have that ability. \nJohn Rome: So I think that our ability to move much faster, to provide better services, that\u2019s really really going to be the change out there. And then just looking at the technology that\u2019s coming, whether it\u2019s big data, artificial intelligence, virtual reality. All of that capability that\u2019s coming with the cloud, sort of helping enable that, is just going to make this world a\u2026I think just a great place. And you know that students\u2019 experiences are just going to be so so great for them to be in these learning environments. And that\u2019s really what the cloud is going to be able to provide. \nHannah Nyren: Great. Well, I\u2019m excited to see what really does happen in the future. See if your predictions are correct. \nJohn Rome: Yeah. Let\u2019s have this in five years and see see what happens. \nJohn Rome: Let\u2019s come back in 18 months, because I think\u2026 you know, the other thing that we\u2019re noticing right too like, just within the last year alone. I\u2019m talking about voice enablement. Whether it\u2019s the Amazon Echo or the Apple device or the google home. No longer are we talking about graphical user interfaces on mobile phones, now we\u2019re talking about voice user interfaces. I can speak 150 words a minute versus type say 40 words a minute. Students can ask questions versus type questions. You know, think about Star Trek and that ability to sort of live in that world. That\u2019s becoming more and more reality. And I think that there\u2019s clearly some novelty that goes along with that. \nJohn Rome: But I think that in the end you know as these markets sort of these new innovations, whether it\u2019s voice enablement, whether it\u2019s virtual reality, as these things play out, this is really going to be world up there. And technology is really going to help it. And technology is really what helps us scale at this university, as I said earlier. This gives us the ability to provide great service to our students. And we have over 1 students at ASU. A lot of online students. And that ability to deliver content is pretty incredible in making that experience great. \nHannah Nyren: Great. Well thank you for speaking with me. I\u2019ll go ahead and schedule our next interview five years from now. \nJohn Rome: Ok. Great. \nHannah Nyren: But that was very insightful. So thanks for speaking with me today. \nJohn Rome: Thanks, Hannah, for this is opportunity. It\u2019s always great to talk about about ASU. It\u2019s just a great institution. Not only innovative, it\u2019s just a great place for students to be and to learn. \nHannah Nyren: Awesome.

One of the major risks that could ruin a portfolio\u2019s chances of generating adequate dividends are purely psychological. Investors who act/are overconfident in their abilities, tend to rush through, and make silly mistakes that could be disastrous. Being cocky might work in certain areas of life, but not in investing on the financial markets. One of the risks that overconfident investors take is when they create a concentrated dividend portfolio . These concentrated portfolios typically include no more than ten to fifteen individual securities. These cocky investors claim that they create these concentrated portfolios because they are only investing in their best ideas . According to these investors it is much easier to focus all your energy on ten individual stocks and research all there is to them, than to focus on thirty or more companies. The reason why I view these investors as overconfident is because they are forgetting that sometimes, no matter how great you are at analyzing investments, some unknown factor might cause you to still lose money. If just one out of ten companies eliminated dividends and fell substantially in the process, it could mean trouble. Contrast this to a portfolio of 30 companies, which is properly diversified and allocated to different sectors. An unexpected blow to one company would not jeopardize the dividend income stream. One other thing that makes me wonder about investors with concentrated portfolios of stocks is the sleep well at night factor . I sleep very well at night knowing that I personally own more than 40 individual dividend paying stocks. That way, if I picked the next Enron or Bank of America (BAC) who cut or eliminated dividends , I would still have 38 more positions which would maintain and even increase dividends. In a ten stock dividend portfolio, one or two stocks that cut or eliminate distributions could spell trouble. In my portfolio, I have a decent allocation of Energy stocks. I own or have owned Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), British Petroleum (BP), ConocoPhillips (COP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS/B). In 2010 BP had the big issue with the oil spill . I truly believed that it would not have that big of an impact, and imagined it would be similar to the Valdez issue with XOM in 1989. At this point I was speculating that nothing would happen. In hindsight, I should have sold right when the first bad news broke in 2010, but instead I held on. I replaced BP with Royal Dutch Shell when the dividend was eliminated. Some would argue that in a concentrated portfolio where BP was held, the owner would have had a much faster response than myself. To this I say, great but you cannot simply afford to sell at the moment that there is any slight chance of trouble in a business you are invested in. Otherwise you would never hold any company for any period of time. My ability to hold on to positions has been rewarded in the case of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), when they had big recalls in 2010. In addition, simply selling all financials indiscriminately during the 2007 \u2013 2008 financial crisis would have been a mistake as well, as some companies actually maintained distributions. M&T Bancorp (MTB) is a prime example of a company which maintained its dividends, despite the fact that it was one of the TARP recipients. I never added money to my small position from 2008 however, which is why it is merely a footnote in my list of dividend holdings today. However, I have recovered almost one-third of my purchase price from the dividends received since 2008. Another argument that proponents of concentrated dividend investors use is the quote from Warren Buffett \u201cDiversification is protection against ignorance\u201d. I have a great respect for Buffett , but know that unfortunately, there is only one Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha has had his Berkshire Hathaway investment\u2019s pretty diversified over the past 40 - 50 years. He has made some pretty bad bets in the past, including purchasing the ailing Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) in the first place in the late 1960s. I for example own over 40 individual stocks. They are the best ideas I have accumulated over the past six - seven years of focusing exclusively on dividends. In a previous article I explained that researching stocks and keeping up with major developments doesn\u2019t really take that much time. Once you learn the story behind a successful company, it does not take as much time to update your knowledge every year. I have observed people with concentrated portfolios, and I have been able to classify them in two categories. The first category is those who are using \u201cplay money\u201d. At the end of the day, I would never take an \u201cexpert\u201d dividend investor seriously, if they do not have substantially most of their investable portfolio in dividend stocks. An investor who purchases some dividend stocks, while having the majority his/her investable assets in other vehicles, all the while claiming to be an expert is probably teaching you the wrong skills. After all, how can someone who does not actually plan to rely on dividend income for retirement teach you about dividend investing for retirement ? The second category consists of people who want to outperform the market , and believe that this is the easiest way to do so. These are the gamblers, who know that concentrating their portfolios in a few risky investments could pay off big time. Their goal is to generate some impressive track record in a short period of time, in order to sell investors their managed fund services. After all, if you find one company that would go up 100% in a period where the market is up only 10%, this looks pretty impressive. However, your portfolio results would be much better if you have 9 other stocks versus 29 other stocks in an equally weighted portfolio. As a dividend investor, my goal is not to outperform the market but to generate a stable income stream that will proving a growing amount of income every year. That is why I invest most of my money in dividend growth stocks. I would not receive a pension, and I also plan on retiring much earlier than 55. As a result, safety of principle and income is as important to me as growing it over time. It would be stupid to risk my nest egg in an ego boosting exercise to prove that I can outperform the market. While I know that even the best researched top dividend stock can ultimately cut dividends in the future, my goal is to minimize this risk, while maximizing the potential of my income portfolio to grow distributions above the rate of inflation, all the while principal is safely growing as well.

Bach sensed vast, untapped healing energies coursing through flowers, energies that could be extracted through a process he devised. \nBetween 1930 and 1936, Bach lived in various parts of rural Britain, testing local flowers and perfecting his new medicines. In all, he created and proved 38 Bach flower essences, or remedies, and a five-flower blend he named Rescue Remedy, many of which can be used on your chickens. Petal to the Mettle \nBach Flower Remedies are still manufactured across the world and are marketed as natural, nontoxic, self-chosen, self-administered, over-the-counter remedies. It\u2019s impossible to overdose using flower essences. They cause no side effects. They\u2019re inexpensive. And, according to many, they\u2019re surprisingly effective. \nWhat isn\u2019t simple is explaining why they work. Practitioners say that water has the ability to hold an etheric imprint of a flower\u2019s vital life force energy and that each species emits a different energy. This life force, they say, the active ingredient in flower essences, has the ability to alter faulty mental and emotional states and physical symptoms caused by stress. \nIs it New Age mystical gobbledygook? Depending on your viewpoint, maybe so. Buy a bottle of Bach Rescue Remedy, and see for yourself. For the next few weeks, whenever you\u2019re stressed, drop two drops under your tongue. See how you feel 15 or 20 minutes later. \nThe same flower essences are used in the same dosages for treating the same quirks, foibles, behavior problems and emotion-based illnesses displayed by any animal, including humans and chickens. To choose which remedies to use, consult a dosing reference; buy a book or check out a reputable website online. If you aren\u2019t intuitive, read the descriptions and choose whichever essences sound best for you or your birds. If you are intuitive, honor your hunches. Select two to five (no more) single essences to combine. Note: In mixtures, Rescue Remedy counts as a single essence. \nYou can purchase flower essences at vitamin shops, food co-ops and some pharmacies, or order them directly from manufacturers and distributors. The bottles are tiny. Bach remedies come in 1\u20448- and 1\u20444-ounce glass dropper bottles. A 1\u20444-ounce bottle holds 175 drops, so at two to four drops per dose, they go a long way. Stored in a cool, dark place, away from electromagnetic devices such as television sets, microwave ovens and computers, commercially prepared tinctures remain potent for decades. \nFrom these single essence stock bottles, you\u2019ll need to make a dosage bottle. To do that, you\u2019ll need a brown, amber or blue, 1-ounce dropper bottle, which you can purchase from a local pharmacy or online from a flower essence supplier; you can also simply reuse an empty, sterilized herbal tincture bottle. You\u2019ll also need a small, sanitizable funnel; brandy, liquid vegetable glycerin or cider vinegar; and spring, distilled or bottled water \u2014 just not straight out of the tap. \nTo sterilize your dropper bottle, remove the cap and boil it with the bottle and funnel in a glass or enamel-coated pan for 10 minutes. Drain and allow everything to air dry on a clean paper towel. \nTo prepare the dosage bottle, drop two to four drops of each essence into the clean, dry dosage bottle. Fill it nearly to the brim with water. Add 1 tablespoon of brandy, cider vinegar or glycerin as a preservative. Cap the bottle, and then hammer the bottle against your palm about 100 times to mix it up. That\u2019s it. \nA standard dose is two to four drops from the dosage bottle, given four times a day. Most bird owners recommend two drops. Essences can be administered much more frequently, even minutes apart, to address emergencies. Giving more drops at a time doesn\u2019t increase the medicine\u2019s potency nor does adding more drops of stock bottle essence to the dosage bottle; just administer the standard essence more frequently. \nFlower essences work quickly when administered as first aid in emergency situations, such as when a chicken has been mauled by a dog and left stunned and battered. For chronic problems, flower essences are generally given no more than five days in a row. If an essence or combination of essences hasn\u2019t worked in that amount of time, they\u2019re probably the wrong essences. \nThere are several ways to dose a chicken. Drop two drops of essence in its mouth or on the tip of its beak. Don\u2019t let the dropper touch skin \u2014 its or yours. If it does, when you\u2019re finished, re-sterilize the dropper. Add the dose to a smidge of water, and place it in the chicken\u2019s mouth with a disposable syringe. Add the dose to the chickens\u2019 water dispenser. If an essence isn\u2019t needed, it won\u2019t have any effect, so it\u2019s safe to add it to water fonts shared by other chickens. Add the dose to a cup of water and sponge it on, apply it as a compress to an injury or lightly spritz a chicken using a mister bottle. Place the dose on a favorite treat, and feed it to your hen from your hand. Massage drops on its comb, wattles, legs, feet or any other exposed skin. You can also add essences to unscented cream, oil or lotion and rub it in. You can even dose hostile roosters or hens by squeezing two drops of flower essence into a water-filled household sprayer and shaking and then squirting the chicken from a distance. Flower Power \nNot all of the 38 Bach remedies apply to chicken maladies, but many do. First and foremost is Rescue Remedy, sold under slightly different names by other manufacturers but always a combination of cherry plum, clematis, impatiens, rockrose and star of Bethlehem. Bach created Rescue Remedy to deal with emergencies and crises, when there is no time to stop and select individual remedies. It\u2019s recommended for shock or trauma of any kind and is known to help wounds heal more quickly. It\u2019s said to help egg-bound hens relax and pass stuck eggs. \nHere are some of the other popular Bach flower remedies and their indications. Aspen is perfect for fearful chickens. It helps restore natural breathing and reduces muscle tension. It\u2019s great for chickens that panic when handled for wing clipping or parasite dusting and can quickly comfort a bird you find cowering or trembling, with a frightened look in its eyes. Centaury helps chickens at the bottom of the pecking order deal with bossy, pecky hens in the flock. It\u2019s also indicated for tired and weak chickens recovering from illness or injury. It combines especially well with olive as a strengthener for convalescing chickens. Cherry Plum , a component in Rescue Remedy, can sooth flighty chickens prior to, during and after shipping or shows, when they may go berserk when taken into new environments or handled by strangers, or for any other bird in a frenzied state. Gentian can strengthen a lethargic and depressed chicken recovering from injury or illness, especially one that has given up and refuse to eat. Gorse is another remedy in this situation, as it boosts endurance and vitality. Holly is the remedy for prickly hens that pecks your hand when collecting eggs or an ornery rooster that chases your kids. Oak is the prime remedy for sick chickens fighting to survive and for exhausted, worn-out hens you might rescue from a battery hen situation. It combines well with olive when treating cases of illness and exhaustion. Olive remedies deep emotional and physical fatigue. It restores strength and the ability to heal. It\u2019s especially useful for treating predator-mauled chickens that are on the verge of giving up. Rockrose , another component in Rescue Remedy, is the best single remedy for chickens in the throes of deep panic and terror. It, or Rescue Remedy, is your first line of defense for treating survivors of a recent predator attack. Star of Bethlehem is yet another component of Rescue Remedy used to restore mental, emotional and physical calmness. It eases the shock associated with intense emotional or physical pain. Walnut helps chickens adapt to change, be it adapting to a new home or a new coop or changes in diet or routine. It\u2019s especially useful before or after long journeys caused by shipping or participation in shows. Wild Rose boosts life force and imparts the will to live in critical situations when a chicken appears to be giving up and its body is cold. It\u2019s the remedy of choice for chronically sad, bored or apathetic chickens and for use during long-term debilitating illnesses. \nIf you investigate only one natural healing modality for yourself, your family, your pets or your chickens, make it flower essences. The system is easy to learn, and with flower essences, you can do no harm. Get a bottle of Rescue Remedy, and use it a few drops at a time direct from the stock bottle. Try it when you\u2019re nervous, when your dog trembles during thunderstorms or the flock pecks your favorite, but low-in-the-pecking-order, hen. You might be surprised. Plant Proof \nIn 2007, Complementary Health Practice Review published the results of a double-blind clinical trial of Rescue Remedy conducted by researchers at the Miami School of Nursing in conjunction with The Sirkin Creative Living Center. Researchers gave 111 individuals between the ages of 18 and 49 a standard dose of Rescue Remedy or a placebo, administering the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, a standard means to evaluate anxiety, before and after the use of Rescue Remedy or a placebo. Their findings: \u201cStatistical analyses indicated that only the high-state anxiety treatment subgroup demonstrated a statistically significant difference between pretest and posttest scores. The results suggest that BFE Rescue Remedy may be effective in reducing high levels of situational anxiety.\u201d Seeds of Wisdom", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "edward bach", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sue weaver", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "holly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wild rose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bach", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "flower essences help chicken health", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "miami school of nursing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mettle  bach flower remedies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flower power  not", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sirkin creative living center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rockrose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "complementary health practice review", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bfe rescue remedy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bethlehem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aspen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:14.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "09eec0f497ecb21516a3102852f317dc024c9a7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEsGb1woyjFsJsng59qESkFcZa3gfFFq.MTTDNmALltb9.O_s3cvGBegk.0yzVcQhuvf_yTLeVeKIU5x2GUm8grJWRbMfeqOhmY9ABGfaw7XslaC9DInbsvQ", "site_full": "onlinerelationshipadvices.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://onlinerelationshipadvices.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Online Relationship Advice", "title": "Google Alert - relationship", "title_full": "Google Alert - relationship", "published": "2017-12-07T11:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "09eec0f497ecb21516a3102852f317dc024c9a7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEsGb1woyjFsJsng59qESkFcZa3gfFFq.MTTDNmALltb9.O_s3cvGBegk.0yzVcQhuvf_yTLeVeKIU5x2GUm8grJWRbMfeqOhmY9ABGfaw7XslaC9DInbsvQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Othisforince79 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google Alert - relationship", "text": "relationship As-it-happens update \u22c5 December 7, 2017 NEWS Lindsay Lohan: I couldn't be in a relationship with anyone at the moment Montrose Daily Press Lindsay Lohan doesn't believe \"anyone\" could be in a relationship with her at the moment.
