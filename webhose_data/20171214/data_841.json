Questa versione, nonostante sia pi\u00f9 leggera, offre tutte le funzionalit\u00e0 principali del sistema operativo progettato da Google. \nIl progetto della versione Go Edition si basa su tre pilastri principali: migliorare le prestazioni, mantenendo la stessa sicurezza in termini di privacy e gestione informazioni, integrare un nuovo set di applicazioni semplificate ed infine alleggerire il Play Store che mette in primo piano nelle ricerche le applicazioni perfettamente compatibili con lo smartphone con cui ci stiamo collegando sul marketplace. \nUna mossa pensata per cercare di raggiungere il prossimo miliardo di utenti Google, ma anche altri colossi tecnologici, guardano con estremo interesse ai mercati in via di sviluppo, dall\u2019Asia all\u2019America Latina, dove le reti non sono sempre potenti e dove sono diffusi smartphone con prestazioni pi\u00f9 limitate. \nAndroid Oreo (Go Edition) far\u00e0 parte come detto della release di Android 8.1 e sar\u00e0 finalmente disponibile per produttori di smartphone e sviluppatori.

READ MORE Iconix Brand Q3 non-GAAP diluted EP $0.09 The earnings of $0.25 in the third quarter of 2016 included approximately $0.18 per share related to a gain on the sale of our equity interest in Complex Media. The loss of $0.10 in the third quarter of 2017 includes the non-cash tax charge of approximately $15 million or $0.26 per share. The company expects non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2017 to be approximately $0.24, as compared to $0.18 in the third quarter of 2016. The Company expects licensing revenue for the third quarter of 2017 to be approximately $53.2 million, a 12% decline as compared to $60.5 million in the prior year quarter. Revenue in the prior year's third quarter included approximately $2.3 million of licensing revenue from the Sharper Image brand which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2016 and approximately $1.3 million of revenue from its Southeast Asia joint venture which was deconsolidated in the second quarter of 2017. As a result, there was no comparable revenue for these items in the third quarter of 2017.

The SDL report ( Measuring the Increasing Impact of Technical Product Information ) highlights a change in searching preferences with more than half (53%) of global customers now consulting manuals, FAQs and technical content to learn more about a product before purchasing. \nThe research also reveals the need for brands to promote and make product-related content easily accessible to customers. Three-quarters (76%) of customers say product information is essential to customer service, and makes it easier for them to buy additional products from the same manufacturer. \nIn fact manufacturer websites are among the top three most trusted sources of content, and among the most frequently consulted by customers before buying a product. Search engines (64%), company websites (61%) and print/ PDF manuals (35%) were cited as the top three most trusted source of content, according to the research. \n'These results highlight the critical role of quality technical product information in building strong relationships with customers across the buying journey,' said Peggy Chen, Chief Marketing Officer, SDL. 'With the majority (94%) of respondents wanting to search for information in one single place, companies need to ensure they can manage both their marketing and technical content and deliver them into a seamless digital experience to customers across the pre- and post-sale cycle.' \nThe report also reveals a decline in customers turning to traditional customer service teams. Customers now prefer online self-service access to product information, and technical videos, over contacting representatives. In fact only 8% of respondents now consider customer services a point of value in a purchasing decision, and four-fifths (81%) admit product information makes it easier to solve service problems on their own. The research results demonstrate that contextually-aware, multimedia product information is a must-have in any customer engagement strategy. \nMore than 2,000 customers across U.S., U.K., Germany, Japan, Norway, Denmark and Sweden were involved in the report, which highlights the importance of high-quality technical product information to global consumers. It also links the impact of quality technical material to strong business performance. \nSolutions are available to help businesses support this level of engagement across all aspects of the customer journey. SDL recently launched SDL Tridion DX, the definitive solution for building compelling digital experiences (DX) that shape customer journeys. It includes SDL Tridion Sites and SDL Tridion Docs. Powered by SDL's powerful machine learning, content management and translation technology, SDL Tridion DX provides a complete environment for marketing and product-led content across global web, digital and mobile properties. \nSDL plc published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 10:06:09 UTC . \nOriginal document http://www.sdl.com/about/news-media/press/2017/sdl-research-signals-shift-in-customer-buying-behavior.html#126718 \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/2799DEAC3CB5596D4C0C26B742C1A83ECA004D7F", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peggy chen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "research signals shift", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "increasing impact of technical product information", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:23.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "84a7c83d3e0029db154dcdc7f3707627319d0790", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvhF1jgg5X9XLOJCMJpfXMt_9rdK.HlutpS0J_9e2cgUZa_YpibSXoM.T1g0SjTIIBVSnFAzKkNHTQ35R0u3hmMvq_CmT_HkLB1dfrUmxBFepdFuFGCCx1gaB6pUZHEPI3yDCe7KHGa7LzIlopFT_OswLKCktJZS0NDWwbCPhYH__9aRYn.GEwL5x2VSVm6RGvdJl_lVEhRskzdA5b546PHmqC0Vf.OKgP", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news - Company News  - 4-Traders.com", "title": "Bayer : Many disease-causing pathogens that are transferable from pets to humans are spread by common parasites, such as fleas and ticks ... | 4-Traders", "title_full": "Bayer : Many disease-causing pathogens that are transferable from pets to humans are spread by common parasites, such as fleas and ticks ... | 4-Traders", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27554, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "16f9cd30da2274da7ec406248815e42b9e6c9b4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvhF1jgg5X9XLOJCMJpfXMt_9rdK.HlutpS0J_9e2cgUZa_YpibSXoM.T1g0SjTIIBVSnFAzKkNHTQ35R0u3hmMvq_CmT_HkLB1dfrUmxBFepdFuFGCCx1gaB6pUZHEPI3yDCe7KHGa7LzIlopFT_OswLKCktJZS0N1aOr.BwmFZ8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "www.4-traders.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Bayer : Many disease-causing pathogens that are transferable from pets to humans are spread by common parasites, such as fleas and ticks ... | 4-Traders", "text": "Leverkusen, December 7, 2017 - Cat and dog ownership has increased globally over the last 5 years, and in many situations, they live in the home and are considered as part of the family. This, and the ubiquitous nature of parasites mean it is inevitable that more pets and their families are also being exposed to unwelcomed pests like fleas, ticks, worms and sandflies, as well as the harmful diseases that they can transmit. \nSouth America and South East Asia have experienced a particular pet boom, with dog ownership increasing in Vietnam by nearly 9.4 per cent and in Brazil by 8 per cent since 2012. (1) South Amercia is now the region with the highest percentage of pet owners in the world. (2) It is estimated that Chile has more pet dogs per person than any other country in the world. (3) Germany leads the cat lovers however, with cat ownership increasing by 11.3 per cent over the past 5 years, now making it the home to nearly 12 million feline citizens. (1) \nWith increasing numbers of pets, there are also more opportunities for parasites to flourish. Common parasites such as fleas, ticks and sandflies act as vectors of pathogens, facilitating the spread of many diseases, sometimes between animals and humans. There are measures that pet owners can take to reduce the risk to their pet of infection with parasites, such as avoiding tick habitats, discouraging their pet from hunting, and removing and disposing of pet faeces quickly and securely. However, some uncontrollable aspects, such as community animals or wildlife can also act as infection reservoirs of parasites. This means that the correct use of effective parasite protection is now more important than ever before and plays a key role in keeping pets safe. \nThe specific parasite risk profile for a pet is dependent on various factors, such as climate, housing conditions, access to outdoors, and contact with other pets. As these factors change, the 'typical' habitat of parasites, and the diseases they transmit, can shift too. In Brazil, potentially fatal disease leishmaniasis, which is spread by sandflies and can affect dogs and humans, used to be considered a disease of rural areas. With the rise of large Brazilian cities and associated community dog populations, human cases are now reported mostly in urban areas and the number of cases reported annually has more than doubled in 30 years. (4) \nSome parasites, such as ticks, spend the bulk of their life cycle in the environment and their development and survival depend on climate. The effects of global warming on ticks can be seen in a 30-year study conducted in Sweden, which showed a clear expansion of the parasite's distribution range towards northern latitudes. (5) Climate change means that parasite species previously unseen in some regions might start moving in, along with the diseases that they can carry. This may be accelerated by factors such as the growing trend for people to travel with their pets between countries. \nIn some instances, the understanding about the role of different parasites as vectors of diseases has changed. For example, cats can harbor infected fleas that carry Bartonella bacteria that can be transmitted to a person during a scratch and can cause serious disease. It is only in the last 10-15 years that we have understood that some species of Bartonella can also be transmitted by ticks, opening up a whole new area of risk for infection. \nHead of Global Veterinary Scientific Affairs for Companion Animal Products, Animal Health at Bayer, Dr Markus Edingloh explains why it is important for pet owners to take action against parasites, 'Companion animals offer many benefits and more people than ever before are sharing their lives with dogs and cats. But the factors that influence parasites and the pathogens they can carry are constantly shifting. This means that it is essential for pet owners to know that parasite protection is not optional, and that repelling parasites like ticks and fleas before they have any opportunity to bite and transmit diseases can go a long way towards ensuring the health of a pet, and ultimately, that of the family.' \n\nPet owners are advised to consult their local veterinarian for information and advice on effective parasite protection, which is the best way to ensure the health and well-being of their pet. \n1) Bayer consolidated data from various sources \n2) GfK Global pet ownership report - June 2016 https://www.gfk.com/fileadmin/user_upload/country_one_pager/AR/documents/Global-GfK-survey_Pet-Ownership_2016.pdf \n3) Euromonitor Pet Care report - July 2015 \n4) Visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil: rationale and concerns related to reservoir control.

In human terms, this represents around 2.3 million deaths and roughly 374 million non-fatal work-related injuries and illnesses a year. \nThe knock-on effects of these statistics go beyond both the individual and the business, they also affect the wider community, which has to shoulder the burden of fatalities, early retirements, lengthy staff absence and higher insurance premiums. \nIn order to Improve health and safety standards in the workplace an organization requires a clear and determined approach to its health and safety management. Organizations need to develop and implement a clear OH&S policy that will protect their workers and other interested parties. It must have clear objectives, be focused on risk and facilitate compliance with legal and other requirements. \nCurrently, there is no definitive standard for OH&S available globally. The most common specification - OHSAS 18001, is currently available in 40 different versions and has been adopted in 127 countries. \nThe International Labour Organization has also produced its own set of guidelines for OH&S management systems - ILO-OSH 2001 - which can be followed by those who have responsibility for OS&H management. \nThe World's First OHS Standard - ISO 45001 \nSince March 2013, the International Standards Organization (ISO) has been working with Project committee PC283 to develop a single standard for OH&S. Building on the success and popularity of ISO 9001 for quality management and ISO 14001 for environmental management, the new standard will be aligned through the Annex SL framework. \nISO 45001 has been designed to act as a single standard to promote better OH&S management around the world. It will take into account existing national and international standards, specifications and guidelines, such as OHSAS 18001 and ILO-OSH 2001, making it the first international standard for OS&H. \nISO 45001 will incorporate new concepts on OH&S management, helping to strengthen both leadership, management of risk and worker involvement. It is anticipated that the new standard will reduce the potential for risks to both the employee and the employer, by reducing the cost of lost work days and regulatory action that can result from poor OH&S management. \nISO 45001 can be applied by any organization regardless of its size and the nature of their work. An organization implementing ISO 45001 needs to: \nDevelop and implement effective OHS policies and objectives Implement processes that reflect the organization's context and help them manage risk. Implement processes for managing compliance with applicable legal and other requirements Manage operational risk within the workplace by identifying hazards and implementing effective controls. Implement processes for managing subcontractors and suppliers Introduce monitoring and measuring processes that facilitate continual improvements through involvement of the workforce in OHS matters The final stages of development will be a period during which a Final Draft International Standard (FDIS) ballot will be issued and a ballot of the project committee. Should there be no significant comments or objections to the FDIS, ISO 45001 will be published in the first quarter of 2018. If a significant number of technical comments are received, publication may be put back to the third quarter of 2018. \nMigration from OHSAS 18001 to ISO 45001? \nIt is expected that OHSAS 18001 will be withdrawn after a period of three years from publication of ISO 45001. Any organization that is currently certificated to OHSAS 18001 will have three-years to migrate to the new standard. \nThe key to a smooth migration from OHSAS 18001 to ISO 45001 will be the identification of differences between the two standards. As the world's leading testing, inspection and certification company, SGS can help your business smoothly migrate to the new standard. \nEffective implementation of the standard will help you protect your assets and improve your business. \nFor further information, please contact: \nCarl Deaves \nUK Technical and Accreditational Manager /\nGlobal Product Manager - OHSMS\nt: +44 (0)151 350 6756 \nSGS SA published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 10:06:09 UTC . \nOriginal document http://www.sgs.com/en/news/2017/12/making-workplaces-safer-iso-to-unveil-new-occupational-health-and-safety-management-systems-standard \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/A826E8CD572519147FD08D2991BD1C533FE628D2", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "carl deaves", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "unveil new occupational health and safety management systems standard", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "iso", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "international labour organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international standards organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sgs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sgs sa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohsas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:23.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c04ac28d64307d839d0deb586ece07fa2e6bc31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWec9fkRAd9SZ4p8TVUGtCHi3zdnGwZYSUIwBebU1wDnKFSRJOGoeMbFl_FpGsZsEKXtqKhhqhcBo1V0372_Ap35Tn_4T00MEi", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-kitchen-organizer-storage/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Kitchen Storage &amp; Accessories - Buy Kitchen Storage &amp; Accessories at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "S Shape Dish Drainer (2 Layer)", "title_full": "S Shape Dish Drainer (2 Layer) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-05-31T12:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 264, "participants_count": 246, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d955f817b3c5f496a8b5190e24aa195dbff4317", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWec9fkRAd9SZ4p8TVUGtCHi3zdnGwZYSUIwBebU1wDnKFSRJOGoeMbFl_FpGsZsEKXtqKhhqhcBo1V0372_Ap3x8bRSBcxjG7hH.D2R9K50w-", "ord_in_thread": 245, "author": "Jamilah M.", "published": "2017-11-29T10:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Dish drainer", "text": "Awesome", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:23.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "09ba55d76ad3251fd99abc323c337c70550b893f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqIzbcwd62mGVR6gaZKdjGEEVS7aw8lU8nPufF22VzU3y_YV7DNaUXExYz5L03rkNx5Ymo8WSqudb8.29Xm7F88kwNvNWgDtTCK1FBb7mQMlt4gjRqww.Z6KpfvJkr5GhyI-", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "http://www.marketwatch.com/rss/topstories", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "MarketWatch.com - Top Stories", "title": "Here\u2019s how the stock market has handled past government shutdowns", "title_full": "Here\u2019s how the stock market has handled past government shutdowns - MarketWatch", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 48, "participants_count": 25, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FZ722_shutdo_ZG_20171206165334.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 900, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9c4ba72c5b917aaa93a98029f09d07bc2eb2356e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqIzbcwd62mGVR6gaZKdjGEEVS7aw8lU8nPufF22VzU3y_YV7DNaUXExYz5L03rkNx5Ymo8WSqudb8.29Xm7F88kwNvNWgDtTCK1FBb7mQMlt4gjRqww.Z6K4qLxujJupe36P9qAfPEL.kAZC5xDAr7A", "ord_in_thread": 40, "author": "Jeff Horne", "published": "2017-12-07T02:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Today, we need Bill Clinton as President.

Society of Hematology\u2019s Annual Meeting | 4-Traders", "text": "Data from Phase II-equivalent study demonstrated improved survival and hematological recovery of non-human primates (NHP) exposed to high levels of radiation PLX-R18 cells are in late-stage development as a treatment for ARS, supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) HAIFA, Israel, Dec. 07, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --   Pluristem Therapeutics Inc . (NASDAQ:PSTI) (TASE:PSTI), a leading developer of placenta-based cell therapy products, announced today the company will present data from its Phase II-equivalent study of PLX-R18 cells for the treatment of acute radiation syndrome (ARS) at the American Society of Hematology\u2019s (ASH) 59 th Annual Meeting to be held in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 9-12, 2017.\nThe results of the study will be presented during Program Session 506: Hematopoiesis and Stem Cells: Microenvironment, Cell Adhesion, and Stromal Stem Cells. The poster, \u201cIntramuscular Administration of Placenta-Derived Stromal Cells Enhances Survival of Rhesus Macaque Monkeys Exposed to Total Body Irradiation,\u201d will describe data from a recently announced Phase II-equivalent study under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Animal Rule. The data demonstrate improved survival and hematological recovery of NHPs exposed to different levels of radiation. This study was conducted and funded by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the NIH. The poster abstract will be published online in the supplemental volume of Blood , a peer-reviewed medical journal published by ASH.\n\u201cWe are excited to present these promising data on our PLX-R18 cells in the treatment of ARS to the world\u2019s thought leaders in hematology at this year\u2019s ASH conference,\u201d said Yaky Yanay, president and Co-CEO of Pluristem. \u201cWe believe that there is a crucial need for a therapy capable of effectively treating populations in case of nuclear or radioactive incidents. These findings, which show recovery of the hematologic system, suggest that PLX-R18 has the potential to treat a large population exposed to different levels of radiation and might also be used for additional hematologic indications.\u201d\nAbout PLX-R18 \nPLX-R18 is Pluristem\u2019s second cell therapy product in development. It is designed to treat bone marrow that is unable to produce enough blood cells due to a variety of causes including ARS, certain cancers or cancer treatments, or immune-mediated bone marrow failure. Pluristem is currently enrolling patients in a U.S. Phase I trial of PLX-R18 in incomplete bone marrow recovery following hematopoietic cell transplantation. PLX-R18\u2019s first animal studies in ARS were performed in collaboration with Prof. Gorodetsky at Hadassah Medical Center. Further preclinical data from trials conducted by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Hadassah, the Charite in Berlin and other prominent research institutions, have shown that PLX-R18 cells secrete a range of specific proteins that trigger the regeneration of bone marrow hematopoietic cells, thereby supporting the recovery of blood cell production. With its capabilities, PLX-R18 could potentially treat a broad range of hematologic indications, which together constitute a substantial global market.\nAbout Pluristem Therapeutics \nPluristem Therapeutics Inc. is a leading developer of placenta-based cell therapy products. The Company has reported robust clinical trial data in multiple indications for its patented PLX (PLacental eXpanded) cells, and is entering late-stage trials in several indications.

This year's decline in volume, load factor and increased yield reflect a normalization of the traffic volumes.\n\u2022 Scheduled traffic (RPK) decreased 6.1% and the capacity (ASK) was up 0.9%.\n\u2022 The load factor decreased by 5.1 p.u. versus last year to 68.6%.\n\u2022 Scheduled number of passengers amounted to 2.3 million in November.\n\u2022 The preliminary currency adjusted yield and PASK increased 9% and 1% respectively in November 2017 vs. last year. The nominal yield increased 6% and the PASK decreased 2% in November 2017 vs. last year. \nMarket development and capacity outlook\nThe capacity in the Scandinavian market has accelerated during the autumn in line with SAS's expectations. This development is expected to continue during the winter program 2017/2018. SAS's overall load factor and traffic volumes declined versus last year at the same time as the yield improved strongly. This is explained by last year's 70 year's anniversary campaign, that resulted in record high volumes and weak yield, combined with the phase in of larger aircraft in 2017. The traffic volumes in November 2017 and load factor are therefore more in line with the levels prior to 2016. This trend is expected to continue during the winter program 2017/2018. \nIn fiscal year 2017/2018, SAS plans to increase capacity (ASK) by around 1-3%, driven by longer European routes and the fact that the Airbus A320neo has more seats than the aircraft being replaced. \nSAS scheduled traffic development in November \nSAS increased its scheduled capacity in November by 0.9% and the traffic decreased by 6.1%, resulting in a load factor of 68.6%, 5.1 p.u. lower than last year. This is driven by last year's campaign and larger aircraft. \nSAS's intercontinental capacity was reduced by 2.6% and the traffic decreased 12.8%. During the next months, the capacity on SAS's long haul routes is also planned to decrease as one wet leased Boeing 737 was phased out in August 2017. \nThe traffic on SAS's European/Intrascandinavian routes decreased by 1.5%. At the same time the capacity was increased 3.5%. The traffic continued to grow on leisure oriented routes in Europe. \nOn SAS's domestic routes, the capacity was increased by 1.3%, driven by higher capacity on Danish domestic routes. The traffic decreased by 2.1%. \nSAS AB published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 10:06:09 UTC . \nOriginal document https://www.sasgroup.net/en/sas-traffic-figures-november-2017/ \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/66894EA9120C0F8B89631A6F5B18147473DFD35D", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "sas", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sas ab", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boeing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pask", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:23.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c04ac28d64307d839d0deb586ece07fa2e6bc31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWec9fkRAd9SZ4p8TVUGtCHi3zdnGwZYSUIwBebU1wDnKFSRJOGoeMbFl_FpGsZsEKXtqKhhqhcBo1V0372_Ap35Tn_4T00MEi", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-kitchen-organizer-storage/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Kitchen Storage &amp;

On 10 December 2017, the high speed section between the cities of Erfurt (Thuringia) and Ebensfeld (Bavaria) will start its operation. This line is connecting Berlin with Munich over Erfurt and Nuremberg. \nAlstom equipped 70 ICE T, 66 ICE 3 and 40 ICE 1 high speed trains with its proven solution Atlas 200 for Deutsche Bahn. This Baseline 3 [2] is the latest technological ETCS standard and secures the smooth and safe operation of high speed traffic. [i] \nCurrently, VDE 8 is the biggest infrastructure project in Germany. The project started in 1991 to improve the rail connection between East and West as well as North and South for passenger and freight transportation. The high-speed section between Berlin and Munich is a closure in the German high-speed network and at the same time an important section of the Trans European Network (TEN). \n' We are proud to open together with Deutsche Bahn a new chapter in the European rail transport and to make it more secure for passengers. To travel by train from Berlin to Munich in less than four hours is a great success offering a competitive and environmentally friendly alternative to roadways and airplanes . We have been the first company to put this kind of ETCS into practice. It demonstrates the wide range of our portfolio in the mobility sector', said Gian-Luca Erbacci, Senior Vice President Alstom Europe. \nERTMS has several objectives: facilitate border crossings, open up the rail signalling market, increase commercial speeds, reduce intervals between two trains, decrease maintenance costs and guaranteeing maximum safety. \nThe project was realized under the direction of the Alstom ERTMS competence centre of Charleroi, Belgium (development and adaptation of the software) in close cooperation with the project office in Berlin, Germany, Villeurbanne, France (Hardware) and the German sites in Salzgitter and Braunschweig (vehicle integration and installation). \n[1] European Train Control System (ETCS) / European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) \n[2] Baseline 3 Maintenance Release 1 \n[i] With the opening of Berlin-Munich and associated a travel time reduction of 2 hours 20 min, it will make the 4th ICE ETCS retro-fitment contract that Alstom is delivering on-time to DB. In June 2009, the ICE3-M/BR406 started commercial service with ETCS on Frankfurt-Brussels, reducing the travel time by 25 minutes. In December 2012, the ICE-T/BR411 started commercial service with ETCS on Frankfurt-Wien, reducing the travel time by 20 minutes. In December 2015, ICE-T/BR411 & ICE-3/BR403 started commercial operation with ETCS on VDE8.1 route (1 st section of the VDE 8 project).\nToday, nearly all 206 DB ICE-1, ICE-T and ICE-3 trains have been retro-fitted with Alstom ATLAS ETCS allowing DB to connect faster and safer main German and European cities. \nAlstom SA published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 10:06:09 UTC . \nOriginal document http://www.alstom.com/press-centre/2017/12/alstom-secures-new-high-speed-operation-in-germany-with-its-onboard-signalling-control-systems-for-ices/ \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/43613C676433A5C6DE821FBAFC2D2BBD7016E3F6", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gian-luca erbacci", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "alstom", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "deutsche bahn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trans european network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alstom sa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european rail traffic management system", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unity transport project vde", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "munich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thuringia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erfurt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alstom europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bavaria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ebensfeld", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charleroi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "villeurbanne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "braunschweig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nuremberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salzgitter", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:23.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c422c384ffc9006c1a9c20f9f310fbb511e10e15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qic34R6yQCoErBfpOczynFBNsBwdg6AKP2wjT7jg_jXjb0H9VY.esRVJ8_41fCNSZC1udAuTb7g--", "site_full": "www.wehrmacht-awards.com", "site": "wehrmacht-awards.com", "site_section": "http://www.wehrmacht-awards.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=26", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "John Burnett Helmet Forum - Wehrmacht-Awards.com Militaria Forums", "title": "M35 DD with battle damage and blood stained liner", "title_full": "M35 DD with battle damage and blood stained liner - Wehrmacht-Awards.com Militaria Forums", "published": "2017-12-02T21:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e7b14d4fd9a3754cd3dc5e33ce413649fc6fa7d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qic34R6yQCoErBfpOczynFBNsBwdg6AKP2wjT7jg_jXjb0H9VY.esRVJ8_41fCNTHWDHtMJv5H7EpM_3cBdXsm9umv2w_KvE-", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "hagen.191", "published": "2017-12-04T00:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : Very interesting points. My impression (which I already stated in my first post) is that this helmet is probably something the soldier kept after being\nwounded in the head, and not something from when he was killed.\nIf you want to verify this theory, and also increase the historical and monetary value of your helmet, you should get his family to send a request for his\nmilitary file from the Deutsche Dienststelle. It is a simple letter to send, and you can write the letter and just ask the family to sign and send it.\nIf it turns out that he had been wounded in the head in 1943, then the theory that this was a souvenir kept from when he was wounded would be reinforced.\nWhen helmets are hit by fast projectiles, there is a nice neat entry hole.

Mike Morsell (Towson University) \nPublished on Dec. 6, 2017 \nDec. 6, 2017 \nTowson University is creeping on a come up. \nThe Tigers have jumped out to an 8-1 start, winning two tournaments on two different continents, heading into their matchup against in-state rival Morgan State (Md.) on Wednesday. Riding an eight-game winning streak, including victories in the Florida Gulfcoast Showcase and the Belfast Invitational in Northern Ireland, Towson received a vote in the AP top 25 poll for the first time since 2013 this week. \nMORE: Villanova's Mikal Bridges is ready to lead \nIts early r\u00e9sum\u00e9 doesn't include triumphs over any top-ranked teams, logging wins against the likes of Florida Atlantic, Penn, Georgia Southern, La Salle and Marshall. But Towson has shown it could be a cut above its competition among mid-majors, posting an average margin of victory of 19.1 points per game, a figure on par with the season-long totals of both No. 16 Arizona State and No. 21 Purdue. \nLarger tests loom, however. After Towson's meeting against UMBC on Saturday and Oakland (Mich.) on Dec. 20, it'll travel to Pitt on Dec. 22 for its biggest non-conference game, scheduled to be shown live on ESPN3. \nLed by top scorer, sophomore Zane Martin (17.4 ppg), and seniors Mike Morsell (12.8 ppg) and Brian Star (10.1 ppg), Towson is winning the old fashioned way \u2014 sharing the ball on offense, getting after it on defense and crashing the boards. Seven different Tigers have scored in double-digits this season. The Tigers boast the nation's fifth-stingiest defense , limiting opponents to just 59.6 points per contest on 37.7-percent shooting, including 24.7 percent from 3-point range, fifth-best in the NCAA . They're also 25th in rebounding margin (9.1). \nDespite having the highest RPI (39), among the 10 schools which comprise the Colonial Athletic Association, the Tigers (RPI 14) remain behind league foe and ninth-ranked Charleston in the College Insider men's mid-major top 25 . Coincidentally, those two face off in the teams' league opener Dec. 30. The Tigers have made just two trips to the NCAA tournament in school history, in 1990 and 1991, losing both times in the first round.

U.S.: We could stay home Staff Writer | Thursday December 7, 2017 3:54AM ET South Korea voiced regret over the decision to ban Russia from the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.   READ MORE Russia banned from 2018 Winter Olympics They are saying the participation of the country's athletes was crucial to the success of the event. The South Korean sports ministry urged Russian athletes to compete as neutrals following the International Olympic Committee's unprecedented ban, saying in a statement it had \"worked hard over the past seven years to make meticulous preparations\" for a peaceful and harmonious Games. \"The participation of winter sports athletes from around the world, including Russia, is the key to the success of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and a crucial factor in realizing the Olympic spirit,\" said the ministry, which is responsible for preparing the Games. Whether US athletes will be able to attend the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea remains an \"open question,\" US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Wednesday night. The Winter Olympics are set to be held February 9-25 in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The situation with neighboring North Korea, which has grown increasingly hostile while pursuing its nuclear ambitions, is \"changing by the day,\" Haley said on Fox News, making the security of U.S. athletes uncertain. Still, Haley said she believes President Donald Trump's administration will work to \"find out the best way\" to make sure the athletes are protected. \u25a0 What to read next", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "haley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nikki haley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyeongchang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:24.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1082c7dd1cee06a7a1afe71b3cf8a898abfc8abe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.A9AAJWwGUb7_03vDPnoaqOWzAk1HkjUDM2wHTs2ndCvqtqzvnMteEwYOCzUPzaXWz202oSCj4fHXUEEAqTSnC5hiNg5UCc_I55WNHV6YyCEmE_ZXcUCRe", "site_full": "www.star-telegram.com", "site": "star-telegram.com", "site_section": "http://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/?widgetName=rssfeed&widgetContentId=714290&getXmlFeed=true", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Politics & Government News | Fort Worth", "title": "Where protected lands stand after national monument review", "title_full": "Where protected lands stand after national monument review", "published": "2017-12-07T11:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/lc0edl/picture187842479/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Utah_Federal_Lands_88104.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23240, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1082c7dd1cee06a7a1afe71b3cf8a898abfc8abe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.A9AAJWwGUb7_03vDPnoaqOWzAk1HkjUDM2wHTs2ndCvqtqzvnMteEwYOCzUPzaXWz202oSCj4fHXUEEAqTSnC5hiNg5UCc_I55WNHV6YyCEmE_ZXcUCRe", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BRADY McCOMBS Associated Press", "published": "2017-12-07T11:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "Where protected lands stand after national monument review", "text": "Mobile & Apps FILE - In this undated file photo, the Upper Gulch section of the Escalante Canyons within Utah's Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument features sheer sandstone walls, broken occasionally by tributary canyons.

Douglas C. Pizac, File AP Photo Where protected lands stand after national monument review By BRADY McCOMBS Associated Press December 07, 2017 03:43 AM SALT LAKE CITY \nPresident Donald Trump ordered U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke earlier this year to conduct an unprecedented review of 27 monuments established by former presidents over more than two decades on lands and waters revered for their natural beauty and historical significance. \nZinke said Tuesday that he's confident the president will follow his recommendations, which include calls to reduce two other monuments in the U.S. West and to modify rules at six others. He also has said he's recommending the creation of three new monuments. \nZinke released his full report Tuesday, which was previously leaked. Here's a breakdown of Zinke's recommendations: \n___ Never miss a local story. Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access. SUBSCRIBE NOW \nMONUMENTS TO BE DOWNSIZED \nTrump will shrink Bears Ears National Monument by about 85 percent to 315 square miles, divided into two separate areas. He plans to downsize the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by nearly half to 1,569 square miles, divided into three areas. \nTribal and conservation groups are suing to block those cuts. \nZinke also advised trimming Gold Butte in Nevada and Cascade Siskiyou in Oregon, but the president hasn't announced final decision on those monuments. \nZinke said Tuesday the cuts at Gold Butte would mainly come around a water district that shouldn't have been included in the boundaries. He said he recommends making clear that hunting and fishing are allowed and asking Congress to approve a co-management plan to allows Native American tribes to help run the monument. Gold Butte protects nearly 300,000 acres of desert landscapes featuring rock art, sandstone towers and wildlife habitat for the threatened Mojave Desert tortoise and other species. \nZinke declined to specify how many acres he wants to remove from monument status, stressing that the administration is working with Nevada's governor and congressional delegation to find a solution. \nSimilarly, Zinke declined specifics on Cascade-Siskiyou, which protects about 113,000 acres in an area where three mountain ranges converge. Changes will center on recent expansion of the site, which was first created by Clinton in 2000. Much of the additional land is on private property, while some is on land previously designated for timber production, Zinke said. \n___ \nNO DOWNSIZING, BUT RULE CHANGES \nZinke proposed more access for people and industry and other changes at six monuments: \n\u2014 Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks and Rio Grande Del Norte, New Mexico: Modifications will be made to protect the long-standing culture of grazing and ensure hunters and fishers don't lose access, Zinke said. At Organ Mountains, the U.S. Border Patrol will do a border-safety assessment to give Zinke a list of possible improvements to ensure they can do their job. He will also request congressional authority to give tribes co-management. \n\u2014 Katahdin Woods and Waters, Maine: Zinke said he wants to allow more trees to be cut in some parts by a National Park Service company, and not commercial logging, to make the forest healthy by thinning and landscape improvement. He also wants to ensure that \"traditional uses\" like snowmobiling and hunting are taken into account in a management plan. \n\u2014 Northeast Canyons and Seamounts, Maine: Allow commercial fishing in the first marine monument in the Atlantic Ocean. \n\u2014 Pacific Remote Islands, Pacific Ocean: Allow commercial fishing within the marine monument that covers nearly 87,000 square miles (225,330 square kilometers) near Hawaii. \n\u2014 Rose Atoll, Pacific Ocean: Allow commercial fishing in the 13,500-square-mile (34,965-square-kilometer) marine monument around the Rose Atoll in American Samoa, a U.S territory. \n___ \nZinke didn't suggest changes to 17 other monuments in seven states and the Pacific Ocean: \n\u2014 Arizona: Grand Canyon-Parashant, Sonoran Desert, Vermilion Cliffs and Ironwood Forest. \n\u2014 California: Sand to Snow, Mojave Trails, San Gabriel Mountains, Berryessa Snow Mountain, Giant Sequoia and Carrizo Plain. \n\u2014 Colorado: Canyons of the Ancients. \n\u2014 Idaho: Craters of the Moon. \n\u2014 Montana: Upper Missouri River Breaks. \n\u2014 Nevada: Basin and Range. \n\u2014 Pacific Ocean: Marianas Trench southwest of Guam and Papahanaumokuakea near Hawaii. \n___ \nNEW MONUMENTS \nZinke also recommended Trump create three monuments, including one in his home state of Montana: \n\u2014 Badger-Two Medicine in an area within the Lewis and Clark National Forest in northwest Montana. Zinke said he sees a great opportunity to help generate some income for the locals and foster more cultural understanding by creating a monument in a sacred place for the Blackfeet Nation. He said he would request congressional authority to give the tribe co-management. \n\u2014 Medgar Evers' home in Jackson, Mississippi, where the first field secretary for the NAACP was assassinated on June 12, 1963. Evers organized boycotts over segregation during the civil rights movement. \n\u2014 Camp Nelson near Nicholasville, Kentucky, which was established in 1863 as a 700-bed Union Army hospital, supply depot and recruiting center for African-American troops in the state.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "douglas c. pizac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014 rose atoll", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan zinke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zinke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014 medgar evers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014 katahdin woods", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rose atoll", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mobile & apps file", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "escalante canyons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interior", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blackfeet nation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brady mccombs associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. border patrol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northeast canyons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mojave trails", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national park service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naacp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ancients", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clark national forest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "union army", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "upper gulch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicholasville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lake city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "organ mountains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san gabriel mountains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonoran desert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carrizo plain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "camp nelson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ironwood forest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific remote islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rio grande del norte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "papahanaumokuakea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samoa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cascade-siskiyou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berryessa snow mountain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idaho", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:24.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9af7111d533c46c12d49ecc0f8cdc40f1f7c44e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEu2Sov4owQNUT5FVNL_E7mVhrSYhiLE3TzGJ6Efeavyb_IEuG7El39j01N6BDIE7jGwxiSVePz6J_wpmghtazJTraYDdFGK8sQ-", "site_full": "openstack-news.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://openstack-news.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "OpenStack News Archive", "title": "OpenStack \u5b9f\u8df5\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9 (impress top gear) -

The country's largest electric company said Tuesday the customers paid a bill by check or cash at 550 walk-in payment processing centers in the Carolinas, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky since 2008. Those payments were processed by TIO Networks, which was hacked in an attack disclosed after the company was purchased in July by PayPal Holdings Inc. Duke Energy customers make up nearly a quarter of the 1.6 million TIO Network customers potentially compromised. The personally identifiable information that may have been stolen from Duke Energy customers includes names, addresses, electricity account numbers and banking information if a customer paid power bills by check.

A worthy winner.\"\nPublic nominations opened earlier in the year and an expert panel chose six finalists from the 22 nominated trees, which went to a public online vote in September.\nThe other finalists were the Beauly Sycamore in Beauly, the Carnegie Oak in Dunfermline, David McCabe's Spruce in Crieff, the Greenock Cut Oak and the Old Holly Bush of Castle Fraser.\nTwo runner-up trees - McCabe's Spruce and the Beauly Sycamore - will also receive \u00a3500 care packages.\nThe awards can be used to arrange an expert health check, provide interpretation or educational materials or hold

Marijuana Sales In March, Los Angeles voters endorsed a plan to bring order to the city\u0092s long-unruly marijuana market while clearing the way for recreational sales to begin next year, making L.A. the biggest city with legal pot sales in the country.\nBut it\u0092s taken months to work out the fine print.\nOn Wednesday, the City Council is expected to consider a dense set of regulations that will dictate where pot can be grown and sold in the new market, along with how businesses that grow and trade in the leafy plant will be licensed.\nThe rules would keep pot businesses largely out of residential neighborhoods, while creating buffer zones around schools, libraries and public parks.\nThe long-delayed guidelines would be a milestone: Growers and sellers need local licenses before they can apply for state permission to operate in the new, legal pot economy.\nBut with the new year just weeks away \u0097 and the holidays coming \u0097 industry experts say it\u0092s not clear how many L.A. businesses will be ready to open their doors on Jan. 1 \u0097 if any.\nHow many businesses will be licensed in the city on Jan. 1 for legal recreational sales?\n\u0093I don\u0092t know,\u0094 said Adam Spiker, executive director of the Southern California Coalition, a cannabis industry group.\nSpiker and others fear a bottleneck in the emerging system that stalls or slows recreational sales could encourage customers to turn to the illegal market that has flourished in California for years.\nIf demand is not satisfied by legal sales then \u0093you are just giving oxygen to the black market we all want to eradicate,\u0094 Spiker said.\nThe route to legalization began last year when state voters approved Proposition 64, which opened the way for recreational pot sales to adults in the nation\u0092s most populous state.\nCome January, the newly legalized recreational sales will be merged with the state\u0092s two-decade-old medical market, which is also coming under much stronger regulation.\nFor years Los Angeles has been largely unregulated terrain for the marijuana industry, where hundreds of illegal dispensaries proliferated.\nEarlier this year, L.A. voters endorsed another attempt to regulate the pot business locally, leading to the regulations that will be considered Wednesday.\nThe legal marketplace is seen as a way to impose order, pushing out rogue operators while raising tens of millions of dollars in taxes for City Hall.\nIn general, California will treat cannabis like alcohol, allowing people 21 and older to legally possess up to an ounce and grow six marijuana plants at home.\nCalifornia is among 29 states where cannabis is legal, either for medical or recreational purposes.\nAs recreational sales approach, anxiety is widespread.\nMany cities are struggling to fashion local rules for pot shops and growers. Without the regulations, there could be limited options in many places for consumers eager to start the new year with a legal pot purchase.\nAt first, the state will issue only temporary licenses.

On Museum Night, the Helvetia Art Foyer will be opening its doors to visitors. This new sponsorship is part of Helvetia's multifaceted commitment to art. \nBasel Museum Night is gaining a new partner in the form of Helvetia Insurance. For the first time, Helvetia will be sponsoring the 18th Museum Night on 19 January 2018. Together with Novartis and the Basler Kantonalbank, it makes up the Basel Museum Night's sponsorship trio.\n\nEva Keller, Head of Museums and Cultural Marketing Unit in the Culture Department, is delighted about the collaboration with Helvetia: \"Our awesome sponsorship trio will enable young people under the age of 26 to gain free entry. It's fabulous to watch over 10,000 children and young people embark upon this night-time journey of discovery and culture.\" Philipp Gm\u00fcr, CEO of Helvetia, is also pleased about the new commitment: \"Art and the City of Basel are held in high esteem at Helvetia. Museum Night ideally combines these two things and is extremely popular with young and old alike.\"\n\nGuided tours and children's workshops in the Helvetia Art Foyer \nThe Helvetia Art Foyer - the company's own exhibition space - will be opening its doors to visitors on Museum Night. The programme, named \"Goodbye blue sky\", includes guided tours by artists and curators of the \"Save Our Souls\" exhibition by the artistic duo huber.huber, plus workshops for children.\n\nChampioning art \nThe new partnership with Basel Museum Night is part of Helvetia's existing multifaceted commitment to art. The Helvetia Art Foyer, a public exhibition space in Basel, is used by the insurance group for up to four exhibitions each year, in which works from the company's own collection are also displayed. With over 1,700 works by around 400 artists, this is one of the most significant collections of contemporary Swiss art. Helvetia is also one of Switzerland's leading art insurers, and is sponsoring digitalization projects at the Kirchner Museum in Davos and the Art Museums in Basel, Bern and Lucerne. Helvetia additionally awards an art prize each year which helps support young artists as they embark upon their careers.\n\n\nKey information on the 18th Basel Museum Night \n19 January 2018, 6pm to 2am\nHelvetia Insurance, Helvetia Art Foyer, Steinengraben 25, 4051 Basel\n\"Save Our Souls\" exhibition by huber.huber\nYou can find information on ticket prices and sales on the website www.museumsnacht.ch/en \n\n\n\nhuber.huber: Detail from \"Butterfly\" from the photo series \"Save us\", 2013 to 2017.\n\n\n\nhuber.huber: \"Shelter\" installation, 2017.\n\n\nThis media release can also be found on the website www.helvetia.ch/media .\nFor further information please contact: \n\nHelvetia Insurance \nJonas Grossniklaus \nMedia Relations Manager \nSt. Alban-Anlage 26 \nCH-4002 Basel\n\nLinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/jonasgrossniklaus \n\nPhone: +41 58 280 50 33\n[email protected] \nwww.helvetia.ch \n\n\nAbout the Helvetia Group \nIn almost 160 years, the Helvetia Group has grown from a number of Swiss and foreign insurance companies into a successful international insurance group.
