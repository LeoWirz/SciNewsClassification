It comes with a guaranteed \u201830 day money back guarantee\u2019 too! With Microsoft Access database 2016 is genuine business tool which can add value and benefit SME sized businesses which makes up part of the 'back-office' operations and is vital to have in place even if you are very focussed and keen to go out into the field and promote and sell your products or services. \nThe key benefits for SME\u2019s are: \nLow cost - If you have a copy of Microsoft Office (Professional or higher) installed on your desktop or accessible as part of the Office 365 plan, then you probably have Microsoft Access sitting there too since its part of this suite of powerful applications. \nTrue flexibility - Anyone can create and use an Access database and you do not need a degree in programming either. With some structured training and having no knowledge of computer programming (which is optional for this system), you can have a database to be proud of and pay you dividends in the long term. \nScalable, ready for data migration - In the true sense of the word, Microsoft Access is not a true client/server database system and the built-in data management tools do not handle data scalability all too well. However, this system can be migrated into a larger database system (SQL Server for example) as and when the business has out grown the current database. There\u2019s no worry for now as MS Access is very flexible! \nLongevity - Any system designed should always be planned and built to a defined life cycle. I normally gain an insight into the business requirements and their goals and normally allow for a 5 to 10 year life span which Access caters to. \nCollaboration - The thing I like about Access is the ability and seamlessness of how it integrates with the other Microsoft applications namely Excel and Outlook (email) - all paid up as part of the plan. \nMy latest Access database 2016 eBook will guide from start to finish and build a polished and professional database application for your business.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:41.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b9be54e840706e877e1ffd09a36ce744c25ed92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0HA8U7qLdcgFV9OkFkqeZ7cSR8mGLHvaC5LA49T_W74DVvwwvEAWm7_QzDVZSp2TSX12kOkufN2R41_ExKEFHWCMXc.ZsGAhZwG5Ze80Zgw--", "site_full": "www.nbr.co.nz", "site": "nbr.co.nz", "site_section": "http://www.nbr.co.nz//feed/Politics", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Treasury urges government not to rush on tax review", "title_full": "Treasury urges government not to rush on tax review", "published": "2017-12-07T02:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NZ", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.nbr.co.nz/sites/default/files/story_imgs/michael-cullen.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4b9be54e840706e877e1ffd09a36ce744c25ed92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0HA8U7qLdcgFV9OkFkqeZ7cSR8mGLHvaC5LA49T_W74DVvwwvEAWm7_QzDVZSp2TSX12kOkufN2R41_ExKEFHWCMXc.ZsGAhZwG5Ze80Zgw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "businessdesk", "published": "2017-12-07T02:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "Treasury urges government not to rush on tax review", "text": "Treasury urges government not to rush on tax review Sophie Boot Thursday December 7, 2017 8 Play NBR radio on \nThe Treasury warned the government's planned review of the tax system will be too rushed and suggested it extend the timeframe along with other reviews of New Zealand's monetary and fiscal policy settings. \nLast month the government announced former finance minister Sir Michael Cullen will lead the tax working group, tasked with brainstorming a fairer and more balanced tax system. It will come up with a series of recommendations by February 2019, which the government will then use to inform its policy direction at the next general election. \nThe working group has been told to consider the economic environment over the next five to 10 years and how that's affecting changing business models, demographics and business practices; whether some form of housing, land or capital gains tax would improve the system; whether a progressive company tax with lower rates for small businesses would improve the system and business environment; and what role tax can play in delivering environment benefits. \nIn its October briefing to incoming Finance Minister Grant Robertson, released today, the Treasury recommended the working group include the treatment of capital income and assets in the tax system, \"allowing for the consideration of a wide range of options\" but warned the group will not be able to undertake a comprehensive assessment of all aspects of the tax system in its indicated timeframe. It suggested a longer timeframe, or \"further targeted reviews of strategic issues in the tax system.\" \nThe Treasury also said the government may want to look at the corporate tax rate, which at 28% is above the OECD median, but said it could look at ways to reduce effective tax rates on business investment such as modifying depreciation rules. \"Significant misalignment between personal and company tax rates could put pressure on the integrity of the revenue base,\" it said. \nThe agency said the government has signalled significant monetary policy priorities, including reviewing the Reserve Bank Act to broaden the central bank's objectives. The agency suggested Mr Robertson use the signing of the policy targets agreement with the next governor of the Reserve Bank, which he will do by March next year, as \"an early chance to reconsider how monetary policy objectives are specified\" and said it may be a good time to consider broader issues about governance and monetary and financial stability frameworks in the act. \nThe Treasury recommended a review of the statutory framework for financial stability policy to ensure the country can respond to emerging financial risks. \n\"The growth in the scope of prudential policy over recent years makes it timely to stand back and consider whether the statutory framework is fit for purpose, particularly given there are aspects of our approach that differ from international norms,\" it said. \nThe Treasury said progress toward Labour's budget responsibility rules can be achieved through greater increases in operating and capital expenditure than in previous budgets, as the government indicated in its pre-election fiscal plan. The agency is reviewing aspects of the fiscal management approach, which gives fixed baselines to government agencies with no automatic adjustments for inflation and other pressures in each budget, meaning spending comes through the budget process and allowances. Mr Robertson must decide whether to keep this approach. \nThe government has said it plans to reinstate contributions to the New Zealand Superannuation Fund in this financial year, and the Treasury recommended establishing a review of the fund's contribution and withdrawal formula \"to ensure that settings support the objectives of the NZSF, including intergenerational fairness.\" \n(BusinessDesk) 8 \u00b7 Got a question about this story?

The menu does not use any refined sugar, wheat, or additives. \nThere are two tables outside, and one large table inside seating twelve, with ten additional stools for counter-style seating. There is one unisex, accessible toilet with a nappy changing table. Bottles of tap water and glasses are available to bring to tables. \nCoffees, flavoured nut milks, smoothies, and fresh juices are available made to order with a selection in a chilled display cabinet near the till. Baked goods including wrapped Deliciously Ella branded energy balls are available as well as a selection of cookbooks. Breakfast is served till 11am weekdays and 12pm weekends. Weekend brunches are served all day from 9am and include a smoothie (\u00a39.50). \nBec and Steve visited for breakfast in September 2017. A mixed soundtrack of pop and hip hop was playing, not too loud. There were a few other customers when we arrived and as the breakfast menu changed to lunch, a queue had formed. Orders are placed and paid for at the till and brought to tables. \nThe limited breakfast menu was further shortened on this visit as there was no porridge available. Granola with apple & berry compote and coconut yoghurt with coconut flakes (\u00a34.25) was a good sized portion, with good proportions of cereal to compote and yoghurt. Coconut milk lattes (\u00a33.25) were fine, albeit pricey. Steve's rye toast with almond butter, banana and maple syrup (\u00a34.50) was very good, however served on only one slice of bread. \nAccessibility: Step-free throughout including the toilet. \nChild-friendliness: There is a children's menu and plenty of space for pushchairs and buggies, although I did not see any highchairs. \nBec 's verdict: The food was good quality and service fast and friendly. I would return to try the lunch menu and sample a baked treat. \nSee also: Last visited by Bec and Steve, September 2017.

In what sounds like a production of The Prisoner of Zenda, we welcomed Baron Jean-Christophe Von Pfetten with his cousin and joint-master, Prince Georg-Constantin von Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach. Try saying that after a second Martini. \nThe French hunting connection in Leicestershire began, of course, when first we were cowed by the Norman yoke. However, Baron Pfetten has more recent ties with the Belvoir, which began a mere 200 years ago. In 1817, the fifth Duke of Rutland gave Jean-Christophe\u2019s ancestor, the Duke of Saulx, two foxhounds for The Equipage de Selore, the family pack of buckhounds. \nFast forward to 2017, and the Baron brought along seven couple of hounds from his pack of foxhounds \u2014 he has hunted both the buckhounds and the foxhounds for 27 seasons. So possibly the first Anglo-French joint-meet of foxhounds on British soil took place in Lincolnshire. Vive la France! \nLanguage was no barrier for hounds, who hunted well together during a busy morning. However, the Ruritanian accents caused some concern among the car followers, who speculated whether the prince and the Baron, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Bonaparte himself, were part of a Franco-German attempt to frustrate Brexit. The Baron, also a prominent politician on the world stage, assured us that that is not the case and, in fact, he thought the UK had made a brilliant choice. Vive l\u2019Angleterre! Big shoes to fill \nThere are two momentous changes afoot in 2019 of which Brexit on 29 March is only one. By far the most important is that on 1 May, when the second most famous pack of hounds in the world, the Quorn, will be requiring a new huntsman. Peter Collins, who presently fulfils the position, has announced his intention to step down on that date. \nIf you enjoy reading our exclusive columns, vet clinic reports and other VIP content that was first published in Horse & Hound magazine, perhaps you\u2019d like to upgrade your H&H VIP membership to a magazine subscription?

The Quorn country, like everywhere, has changed over the years, but still retains some lovely areas and a special reputation. I\u2019m sure that competition will be fierce. A lady from a different era \nAnother \u201cmember of the quality,\u201d Lady Ursula d\u2019Abo, died on 2 November, aged 100. The eldest daughter of the ninth Duke of Rutland was an avid hunter and crossed the vale of Belvoir alongside her friend, the future Edward VIII, during a different era, which seems like another world now. \nI met Lady Ursula at Belvoir Castle when she was a mere 95 years old and still as sharp as a tack. She memorably told me that I was sitting in the same chair as Churchill had been when a footman brought in a silver tray, upon which was a telegram informing the First Lord of the Admiralty that war had been declared on Germany. \nTime has marched on. Notwithstanding Brexit, we hunters are getting along just fine. Vive la diff\u00e9rence! \nRef Horse & Hound; 7 December 2017 Most read this week", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john holliday", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "james cooper", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "baron pfetten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bonaparte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prince georg-constantin von sachsen-weimar-eisenach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edward viii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lady ursula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baron jean-christophe von pfetten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean-christophe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ursula d\u2019abo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "churchill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter collins", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "duke of saulx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duke", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "scredington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lincolnshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belvoir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rutland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belvoir castle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leicestershire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:42.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8adf4a98e30954c627b5271f2876409ed2e297c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pkSOsKXlzaruRkldzhZ30O_ocMlK88cGh", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/o/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/o/ - Auto - 4chan", "title": "Where I live (in America) car-jackings are way up", "title_full": "/o/ - Where I live (in America) car-jackings are way up - Auto - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-04T07:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 172, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d24cf6215b49b1fb358685360414dadc3315ae2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pkSOsKXlzaruRkldzhZ30O6Ma1jzjlzcR4UcbIz9jOQk-", "ord_in_thread": 29, "author": "that nig with an E30", "published": "2017-12-04T21:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>18307930\nwrong.

Facebook The government is pushing for an increase to the quota of Cambodian migrant workers allowed in South Korea, while at the same time fearing that a deal reached recently between Laos and Seoul on workers may actually lead to decreases in the number of Cambodians welcomed abroad. \nPrime Minister Hun Sen yesterday weighed in on the topic during a speech to garment factory workers after meeting with South Korean Ambassador to Cambodia Kim Weon-jin. \n\u201cThey regard Cambodian workers as having high standards, highly respecting the rules and having high professional ethics .\u2009.\u2009. His Excellency [Minister of Labour] Ith Sam Heng needs to work on this task in order to increase the quota,\u201d he said.\n\nCambodian Ambassador to South Korea Long Dimanche, however, said on Tuesday he was concerned the quota may be reduced, as South Korea had just inked an agreement with Laos, which is not yet publicly available, on welcoming workers. \n\u201cSo when Laotian workers come [to South Korea] it will cause Korea to reduce workers from all other countries,\u201d he said, adding there are about 60,000 Cambodians in the country.\n\u201cWe are requesting them not to cut the Cambodian labourers, just other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease keep the quota between 8,000 to 9,000 labourers.\u201d \nBut Ministry of Labour spokesperson Heng Sour said there was no need to worry, and that South Korea \u201calways\u201d reserves a quota for \u201cfriends\u201d. \n\u201cSo, with the special request of .\u2009.\u2009. Samdech Prime Minister Hun Sen, the total quota for Cambodian worker[s] in 2018 will not be declined but increased,\u201d he said in a message. \nThe South Korean Embassy could not be reached yesterday. \nAdditional reporting by Leonie Kijewski \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "leonie kijewski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimanche", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heng sour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim weon-jin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hun sen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ith sam heng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samdech", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "south korea long dimanche", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of labour", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambodia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:44.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a1b329a5640314f44fb3c6c09f3bbdeacbfa8b1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9EnZRaY.EbMlqnfGDUNNS0EOsAp1c4pnhJDBqOSQpo4yC6oxVhN74Xvvh2AHMGflONdBLoKt031aTFsTGB6scZJKGelQ3ScbtBEKkrAtKYpjHNmGIVvUVD9PN4iCSzTvyDjJF27Co4acbWjRLCEnoF", "site_full": "www.qtellbuyandsell.com", "site": "qtellbuyandsell.com", "site_section": "http://www.qtellbuyandsell.com/feed/posts/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Buy and Sell Free Classified Ads Free Post Buy and Sell Free Classifiedads Free Advertise World Global Free Post sell Free Classified  - Buy and Sell Free Classified Ads Free Post Buy and Sell Free Classifiedads Free Advertise World Global Free Post sell Free Classified", "title": "Cruise Shore Excursions in Dubai ( Sharjah)", "title_full": "Cruise Shore Excursions in Dubai ( Sharjah)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a1b329a5640314f44fb3c6c09f3bbdeacbfa8b1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9EnZRaY.EbMlqnfGDUNNS0EOsAp1c4pnhJDBqOSQpo4yC6oxVhN74Xvvh2AHMGflONdBLoKt031aTFsTGB6scZJKGelQ3ScbtBEKkrAtKYpjHNmGIVvUVD9PN4iCSzTvyDjJF27Co4acbWjRLCEnoF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "Cruise Shore Excursions in Dubai ( Sharjah)", "text": "Posted on : Thursday, 07 December, 2017 08:35 Updated On : Thursday, 07 December, 2017 08:35 Expires On : Friday, 07 December, 2018 08:35 Hits : 146 \nOrient Tours established the cruise ship department in 1996; providing cruise ship tours and shore excursions in Abu Dhabi \u00bb , Dubai and Muscat. \nContact : \nORIENT TOURS LLC - HEAD OFFICE \nAl Rooba Street,PO Box 26820 \nSharjah,UAE", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "orient tours", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sharjah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muscat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rooba street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu dhabi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:44.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "31d67fef20002db1ed215647e23f8ae5e9703203", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Ybdg4T5gCPvJxRin332tNi0k4mHUkHpU99qanAKGUKFmjj3oivQaTdUPR8GASZ2A-", "site_full": "www.goldenskate.com", "site": "goldenskate.com", "site_section": "http://www.goldenskate.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?576", "site_categories": ["figure_skating", "sports"], "section_title": "2017-18 Junior Grand Prix Final of Figure Skating", "title": "Pairs SP", "title_full": "2017 JGPF Pairs SP", "published": "2017-11-27T14:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ef1ba7f5abc22e6f7a53dcbb355c0f8e99ad173", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Ybdg4T5gCPvJxRin332tNi0k4mHUkHpU99qanAKGUKFmjj3oivQaTzbCx9IqtfA0M9dCyB5SCQd2ST47U9VFd", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "lavoix", "published": "2017-12-06T08:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "These Russian pairs are different every year!

All is available to take away as well as eat in. They also have small savouries such as samosas, mini quiches, and savoury muffins, as well as sweet patisserie items such as macarons. Fridges hold interesting soft drinks, bottled beers, wines, and liqueurs (though we're not sure if they have an on-licence), and Italian groceries are stacked on the shelves. \nInside seating is limited to two small tables plus half a dozen low stools at a waist-high counter running around the inside of the bay front window, but they also have a small garden with five or so tables. \nKake visited on a Thursday afternoon in August 2016. There were two or three other customers in when I arrived around 3pm, and a few others were in and out while I was there. No music was playing, but the hum of the fridge was fairly loud. Service was friendly and helpful. \nA ham and cheese muffin (\u00a32.65 for eat-in) photo was light, pleasant, and savoury, not too doughy, and with a slight hint of sweetness that worked well with the saltiness of the ham and cheese.

One time, I remember hearing that he was the most famous rock star that you've never heard of. As far as English speakers go, and particularly Americans, I think that's pretty accurate. \nJohnny Halliday is to France what perhaps the Rolling Stones are. He's a historical act, a huge act going way back - we're talking decades here - to the early days of rock 'n roll. He sort of was comparable to a French version of Elvis, if you will, although he has managed to redefine himself more times than perhaps anyone I know of. He took a slightly more Hippie-ish turn later on, then was very seventies, very eighties, and so on and so forth.  \nIt can almost be comical, yet he is a very talented musician. After all, no one lasts that long in such a tough business without some strong measure of talent, and he not only has survived, but has thrived over the course of decades now. He has some truly incredible stuff. \nWhere he seems most comfortable is as a biker, seemingly. He particularly seems to enjoy coming to America, perhaps for more or less the same reason that some celebrities here enjoy going to Europe - for some anonymity, the privilege of being just another person, and not a celebrity with tons of people following your every move. \nUntil fairly recently, he lived in a town called Louveciennes, which borders the town that my family traditionally was from - Marly-le-Roi. Neither Marly nor Louveciennes are exactly like Hollywood or anything. Marly is a normal town, and hardly a rich man's paradise. Yet, many French celebrities seem to come to Louveciennes to live. It is convenient, being a pretty suburb of Paris. Close enough to be convenient, but far enough to be quiet. That certainly has it's advantages. \nIt is hard to get people to understand just how huge this guy is in France. He truly is an icon for French rock 'n roll music, and he has been at the forefront for nearly half a century. He works out and keeps himself in decent shape, too, which perhaps explains how he is able to move so well throughout the show. Johnny puts on a great one, and I was fortunate enough now to have seen him twice - in Montreal in 2000, and now in New York City in 2012. \nApparently, the show at Beacon Theater was this legendary rocker's was his debut in the Big Apple, a fact that I'll admit to finding a bit surprising. \nHe joked with the crowd a bit, saying that the crowd had been louder in Canada. Hallyday had played in Montreal on October 4th and 5th. \nJohnny donned his familiar biker look for this concert - the same look that he wore the previous time I had seen him, in 2000. Seems that in his older age, that is evidently his look of choice. \nThe crowd, which seemed to be at least in huge part of French extraction were loud and enthusiastic. Cries of \"Johnny!\" could be heard prominently throughout the night. \nHe played some of his staple songs along the way, including Que je t'aime (which got a huge and wildly enthusiastic reception!), L'envie (my personal favorite Johnny song), Allumer le feu, among others. He also did some tributes to other great musicians hat he liked and found influential, including Jimi Hendrix, with a French language version of Hey Joe (I should note here that Hendrix once opened for Johnny in Evreux back in 1966, and there is old, black and white footage of the two partying together). He also did a French language version of Creedence Clearwater's Fortunate Son. He closed by paying tribute to another great French musician, covering Jacques Brel's Quand on n'a que l'amour, after nearly two hours on stage. \nJohnny is a professional, and knows how to put on a good show! He did not disappoint on rainy and chilly Sunday evening in New York City, either. \nJohnny Hallyday will have a new album, \"L'Attente\" coming out next month, in November. One person, Livius44, who read that post shared a video from this concert from New York's Beacon Theater.

It cost Napoli a berth in the knockout stage. Napoli's defeat combined with Shakhtar Donestsk beating group winner Manchester City 2-1 to finish second, meant Napoli heads to the Europa League. Midfielder Piotr Zielinski put Napoli ahead after just 96 seconds, firing the ball hard into the roof of the net after Feyenoord failed to clear a free kick from Amadou Diawara. Nicolai Jorgensen equalized a half-hour later and substitute Jeremiah St. Juste headed an injury-time winner while Feyenoord was reduced to 10 men. With Feyenoord already eliminated after losing its first five Group F matches, coach Giovanni van Bronckhorst gave second-choice goalkeeper Kenneth Vermeer a start and 18-year-old Tyrell Malacia a Champions League debut. After conceding the early goal, Feyenoord scrambled to keep down the score. Vermeer came off his line fast to deny Dries Mertens in the 18th minute and Renato Tapia made a good sliding challenge barely a minute later as Jose Callejon looked set to poke the ball into an empty net. Van Bronckhorst's team was less composed near the Napoli goal until the 33rd when Jorgensen rose between three Napoli defenders to head home a Steven Berghuis cross from the right. Feyenoord played the closing minutes with 10 men after Tonny Vilhena was sent off for his second yellow card and with visibility reduced by smoke from flares lit up by fans at De Kuip Stadium. The home team pressed despite being a man down, and St. Juste crowned Feyenoord's best European performance of the season with a headed goal a minute into injury time.

Here is what I did for my Lenovo T410 when it was having this shutdown problem. The steps are generic enough for any laptop.\nConfigure your bios to be more battery/power friendly Restart and boot to your Bios (you press some function key or, in Lenovo, the \"ThinkVantage\" button) and go to the power options and choose more performance friendly ones. Here are the settings I changed in my Lenovo's BIOS. Don't worry if your BIOS settings are different, just hunt around for what sounds Power related and make sure it's not set to maximize performance type options. My laptop's example BIOS settings: \nSpeed Step Technology set to \"Enabled\" (I still have a need for speed). But \"Mode for AC\" and \"Mode for Battery\" both set to to \"Maximum Battery\" (NOT \"Maximum Performance\"). Adaptive Thermal Management \"Enabled\". \"Scheme for AC\" and \"Scheme for Battery\" both set to \"Balanced\" ( NOT \"Maximize Performance\"). CPU power Management, PCI Power Management and PCI Express Management to \"Automatic\" (NOT \"Disabled\") Don't forget to save the bios settings before exiting.\nUpdate your BIOS Sometimes the way the laptop talks to its parts (like the fan) changes in later BIOS versions. If you get the latest BIOS installed, there's a chance that if there was some issue in the BIOS that was causing the overheat, it might have been fixed. \nWarning!!! Back up your data before updating your BIOS! It's usually safe to update but there's a chance things could go wrong. \nLenovo, in your case, makes it easy to update by having a bootable cd. You can google it like this: Lenovo T410 \"Bios Update\" \"Bootable CD\" (insert your model number instead of T410). You burn the .iso image and boot off of it and follow the on screen instructions to update the BIOS.\nCut down on heavy graphics effects in your Desktop Go into your Display settings and make sure that you don't overdo it with effects.

The failures join the Army and control politicians who, if they are not happy with, they kick or kill them Best of all those who did not attend any school, become prophets & witch doctors, and everybody follows them. 1 Like 1 Share Re: 10 Nigeria Jobs For SSCE Certificate Holders by Damfostopper ( m ): 7:57am donconior :\nbeing a nairaland mod too hahahahahahahah Abi... ur not serious", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:46.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "96cd851c8c67b5effdd02d83079cabb96980ec23", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacJJZSVCVOZR5pG8z.skFwPBTI.xrUh3AHA1gOYyOYcXJ57vHHucy4803Id43xqIvu", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/jobs", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Jobs/Vacancies - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "10 Nigeria Jobs For SSCE Certificate Holders (1)", "title_full": "10 Nigeria Jobs For SSCE Certificate Holders - Jobs/Vacancies (1) - Nigeria", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.441, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 951, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "34e21be6a2d95b7bea47d0d6282dc9d424507a26", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacJJZSVCVOZR5pG8z.skFwPBTI.xrUh3AHA1gOYyOYcXJ57vHHucy483BNpvyx9PHJ0PGyxX0PFlo-", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "chimezie198", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "But these jobs listed above, even B.

The event, that will take place from 16 to 19 April next year at  Fira de Barcelona (Spain) expects to attract an increasing number of exhibiting companies from Asian countries.\n\n\n\n\n          With a net exhibition space of over 100,000 sq. m, the joint organisation of the show with Hostelco , the International Exhibition of Equipment for Restaurants, Hotels and Mass Catering, offers both the retail and HoReCa sectors the most comprehensive offering to date. Some 4,500 exhibiting firms - some 300 coming from Asia- and more than 150,000 professional visitors are expected.\n\n          Performing a strong growth, China is the most dynamic external market for Spanish products, with EUR 1,1 biillion in 2016, with an increase of 49% of the purchases, according to the Spanish Federation of Food and Drink Industries (FIAB). Pork meat, wine and live oil are the most exported goods. On the other hand, Thailand -with EUR 72 million spent in Spanish food products- is becoming an attractive market as it experienced a growth of 36% in its purchases from Spain, especially frozen fish, fish flours and olive oil. Japan, India, South Korea and Indonesia are other Asian key markets for Alimentaria.\n\n          Gastronomic and innovative Excellence\n          Boosting innovation and gastronomic quality remain two major hallmarks of Alimentaria. Consequently, as well as promoting business opportunities the show's activities are geared towards identifying the main trends and enhancing the connections between the food, gastronomic and tourist industries. Thus, in the area The Alimentaria Experience over 200 workshops, tastings and cooking shows will take place, with a selected group of chefs that own close to 40 Michelin stars (Carme Ruscalleda or Andoni Luis Aduriz, among others), while top international wine experts such as Jancis Robinson and Nick Lander will participate in the Vinorum Think event. On the other hand, the area The Alimentaria Hub will become a knowledge, trends, innovation and business centre, in which some 11,200 meetings between international buyers and exhibiting companies from more than 70 countries will be developed.\n\n          Source: Fira de Barcelona\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nick lander", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jancis robinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hostelco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andoni luis aduriz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "exhibitors            alimentaria barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fira de barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spanish federation of food and drink industries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michelin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alimentaria hub", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alimentaria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:46.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "96cd851c8c67b5effdd02d83079cabb96980ec23", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacJJZSVCVOZR5pG8z.skFwPBTI.xrUh3AHA1gOYyOYcXJ57vHHucy4803Id43xqIvu", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/jobs", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Jobs/Vacancies - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "10 Nigeria Jobs For SSCE Certificate Holders (1)", "title_full": "10 Nigeria Jobs For SSCE Certificate Holders - Jobs/Vacancies (1) - Nigeria", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.441, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 951, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "49bc5e05a6345642d39f1ae67b4d1fa87b88d667", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacJJZSVCVOZR5pG8z.skFwPBTI.xrUh3AHA1gOYyOYcXJ57vHHucy483BNpvyx9PHJIev58FSNMSs-", "ord_in_thread": 14, "author": "heylius", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "destiny322 :\nBe reminded dat u dnt need SSCE to go into d 'G' business...
