It is a possible bet, even if the odds are fading into a Hail Mary range. \nThe Lions' odds of winning their first-ever Super Bowl have fallen to 100/1 following last Sunday's 44-20 beatdown at the hands of the Baltimore Ravens, per Bovada.lv . That's tied with the Dallas Cowboys for the 17th-best odds in the NFL. \nThat loss marked a second straight and dropped Detroit to 6-6 and in the emergency room of playoff hopes in a stacked NFC. That's why its Super Bowl odds dropped so steeply from 66/1 the week before. Its margin for error is shrinking that fast. \nThe Lions' odds of winning the NFC -- which would also be a first in the Super Bowl era -- have fallen to 50/1, good for 10th in the league. Only eight teams in the conference will even make the playoffs. \nOnly the Washington Redskins and Arizona Cardinals have worse NFC title odds among teams that still have any betting odds at all. \nThe Lions have no odds left to win the NFC North. At 10-2, the Minnesota Vikings just need to win any one of their remaining four games to wrap that up. \nDetroit is two games back in the wildcard race with four to go. The tiebreaker losses to the 8-4 Carolina Panthers and the 7-5 Atlanta Falcons make their chances of breaking into the playoffs for the third time in four years slim. \nAlso on Bovada's odds, Matthew Stafford has been taken off the board in the MVP race for the first time this season. He leads the NFC in passing yards and as of just a few weeks ago held Bovada's fourth-best MVP odds, but he's dealing with a hurt hand now, and losses kill a player's chance at winning that award.

Plus i can just as easily mist the aspen if i need to bump up humidity for a shed. Contrary to what a lot of people say about aspen molding, i have had ReptiChips and Eco Earth both mold on me, yet never had aspen mold for me. I believe its due to waste material being locked into the substrate and then staying wet. I find aspen easy to spot clean and get everything.\nI've never used Reptile Prime but it looks pretty much like a less fine version of Eco Earth. If it is like it, the stuff sucks for baby snakes. I had to hold my surinames' mouth open 2 times and swab Eco Earth out with a Q-Tip and then use a spray bottle and hang her head down and rinse her mouth out. She wasnt very happy as this was our beginning meeting with each other in the first month lol.\nAnyways, I'm sure you will get varied experiences with the any substrate and my advice is order a brick of whatever you are interested in and give it a try yourself. If you like it, then ignore everyone else and stick with it. If you hate it, then order something else and give that a try until you find something you and the snakes both seem to like :)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:44.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c0afa16e7eef9bedce8f96571ade452c158c508", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuYQ9wS2Ww9NmBqTfA2lf0yO4_HQ6SP5ZuAssq7CNLGtSXoh1spwqXmYf6QH3yZW9.ImFnvmB___tsr07HvP26oY8crTzsgSrDvyofSGIMWbZtRk1UXsul3_AjX808HWG4-", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript?page=10&sort=newest&pagesize=15&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'javascript' Questions - Page 10 - Stack Overflow", "title": "Mock modules using jest that are imported using import * to test react components", "title_full": "javascript - Mock modules using jest that are imported using import * to test react components - Stack Overflow", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c0afa16e7eef9bedce8f96571ade452c158c508", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuYQ9wS2Ww9NmBqTfA2lf0yO4_HQ6SP5ZuAssq7CNLGtSXoh1spwqXmYf6QH3yZW9.ImFnvmB___tsr07HvP26oY8crTzsgSrDvyofSGIMWbZtRk1UXsul3_AjX808HWG4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "asked 3 hours ago", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Mock modules using jest that are imported using import * to test react components", "text": "File name Postman.js\n\"use strict\"; define([], function() { var postManSingleton = (function() { var postManInstance , createPostMan = function() { var events = {}; return { publish: function(event, payload) { if(!events.hasOwnProperty(event)) return; events[event].forEach(function(listener){ listener(payload || {}); }); }, subscribe: function(event, listener) { if(!events.hasOwnProperty(event)) events[event] = []; var index = events[event].push(listener)-1; return { remove: function () { delete events[event][index]; } } } } }; return { getInstance: function() { if(!postManInstance) postManInstance = createPostMan(); return postManInstance; } } }()); return postManSingleton.getInstance(); });\nImporting this file as in index.test.js\nimport * as Postman from 'postman.js';\nHow do I mock its publish and subscribe events in jest.

Exactly my point. Have no idea why it won't hold humidity. Maybe its me, the way I'm using it. Before I used it, it was all completely dry. I've opened and expanded the compressed bricks weeks before even getting the snake. So, it was in a tub drying out. This stuff was completely dry. So, when it came time to put it in the enclosure, I would wet it and mix it around in a smaller tub, then drop into the enclosure. I didn't soak it, just wet it a little. Figuring, that over time I'll mist it inside the enclosure to bring it up to what I'm happy with. So, I'd bring it up to about 60, and the next day it'd be down to high 40's. Spray again, bring it up, next day back down.\nMaybe I'm not putting a thick enough layer? I'm putting in only enough to cover the floor. Maybe a little deeper? Should I heavily soak the substrate, and then squeeze out all excess, and then place it in there? Not sure. Will play with it, of course.

Yeah, the stuff I get has the consistency of dirt, the two main reasons I got it was it looks good and it holds humidity. Also, the added chemicals was one of the problems with cocofiber that I forgot to list down.

Have no idea why it won't hold humidity. Maybe its me, the way I'm using it. Before I used it, it was all completely dry. I've opened and expanded the compressed bricks weeks before even getting the snake. So, it was in a tub drying out. This stuff was completely dry. So, when it came time to put it in the enclosure, I would wet it and mix it around in a smaller tub, then drop into the enclosure. I didn't soak it, just wet it a little. Figuring, that over time I'll mist it inside the enclosure to bring it up to what I'm happy with. So, I'd bring it up to about 60, and the next day it'd be down to high 40's. Spray again, bring it up, next day back down.\nMaybe I'm not putting a thick enough layer? I'm putting in only enough to cover the floor. Maybe a little deeper? Should I heavily soak the substrate, and then squeeze out all excess, and then place it in there? Not sure. Will play with it, of course. And, more than likely will also try the Reptile Prime.\nHow do you prep it before using? How deep a layer? You need to soak some of it and then mix it up if that makes sense. Dont soak it all or else you will have a mess lol. The stuff absorbs LOTS of water and will transfer the humidity to itself. So if you have like half of it fairly wet and mix it up together with drier stuff, it will all even out. Once it dries out, you have to add a decent amount of water to get it back to moist. When i used it, i would just push the stuff into a big mountain and then pour a glass or two of water on it and stir it up and then spread it out again. Misting it really wont do much unless you are seriously misting it like crazy.\nAnd like you said, play with it. obviously just misting it wont work for your set up so try the soak and squeeze method. Try the method i suggested with half wet, half damp and mix it all up. When i mixed up batches of it, i would just throw a brick in a big tub and pour a few glasses of hot water on it and let it sit for 15 mins or so, then crumble it up. Then when i got to dry stuff, rinse and repeat with pouring more water glasses on it. The extra substrate i would just put the lid on the tub and put it next to my cage stacks.

I think I am all set until next year. The Big Bad Wolf is yearly event and it opens twenty four hours for two weeks. It would be nice to shop during late night and just be with all the books without that many people around. I might try midnight shopping next year. Oh I also signed up for Big Bad Wolf member.

(PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nElected officials, business leaders, and SAVE OUR HOSPITAL (SOH) will now use the newly released proforma to clear hurdles and pursue an alternative provider for 55,000 people in the Freeborn County area. The report shows that another entity could operate the hospital in a different, more cost-effective manner, and would be profitable to at least $4.4 million annually. Furthermore, inpatient revenue that is currently being transferred to Rochester could be added back into Albert Lea\u2019s economy. \nThis encouraging report signals to medical providers in the Midwest to come to Albert Lea, because not only is the county designated as a Health Professional Shortage Area (Appendix A), but also patients would be extremely welcoming of a better performing organization. \nElected and community leaders recognize the need for a second provider scenario. Dan Sparks, Minnesota state senator, District 27, stated, \u201cOn behalf of my constituents served by Albert Lea\u2019s hospital and in light of the Quorum report, I support community efforts to bring an alternative provider to Albert Lea. I will work with my colleagues in the Minnesota Senate to ensure any legislative roadblocks are lifted. I also believe competition is sorely needed in Southeastern Minnesota\u2019s health care market, and patients could receive high-quality health care at lower prices with another provider.\u201d \nThe market is controlled by only one provider with the highest overall costs in Minnesota and no clear quality differentiation. Research shows that health care monopolies don\u2019t serve patients well . This is driving up the cost of health insurance for businesses and individuals by 30-40% or more compared to the metro area. \nGerry Vogt, president and founder of Mrs. Gerry\u2019s, a major employer in the city, stated, \u201cSince our first plant opened in Albert Lea, Minnesota, in 1973, Mrs. Gerry\u2019s has innovated and expanded in every way. Our continued success depends on our ability to recruit and retain talent, and we need to ensure we offer our employees high-quality, affordable health care as part of our benefits package. I support efforts to bring an alternative provider to the city, and I look forward to working with providers to offer the most attractive health care benefits to our 200 employees in Albert Lea.\u201d \nAn alternative provider would gain market share and attract both physicians and patients. Patients like Don Sorensen are motivated to seek a new provider. \u201cIt appears that our dominant health care organization is doing everything possible to steer patients away from Albert Lea, but there are other very qualified facilities available. I want to go to a different provider,\u201d he observed. \nReports also indicate that rural communities such as Wabasha and Belmond are successfully attracting physicians, debunking generalizations about physician shortages. \nA ripple effect is spreading across southern Minnesota because of Save Our Hospital\u2019s efforts in Albert Lea. Citizens who desire local input in their communities\u2019 health care choices have formed the Rural Healthcare Coalition and will take their voices to the legislature this session. \n###", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gerry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan sparks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert lea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerry vogt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "don sorensen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert lea", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "minnesota senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rural healthcare coalition", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "minn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert lea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "midwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wabasha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rochester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeastern minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freeborn county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:45.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b7d30a01b99d976d0291b2b94255ac0dd5fcee0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXa6PYGoqR3m0hpyMNDUsnlKvBhjXD7TQ0XT1Tz6xbkvwDHzyu_VphrnzbyRW1Jcjw-", "site_full": "nutritionhealth.xyz", "site": "nutritionhealth.xyz", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Sports Diet or Supplement", "title_full": "Sports Diet or Supplement", "published": "2017-12-07T12:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.209, "main_image": "http://nutritionhealth.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/weightfood-300x200.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b7d30a01b99d976d0291b2b94255ac0dd5fcee0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXa6PYGoqR3m0hpyMNDUsnlKvBhjXD7TQ0XT1Tz6xbkvwDHzyu_VphrnzbyRW1Jcjw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "Sports Diet or Supplement", "text": "0 Getting Sport Nutrition and performance enhancing Supplements Supplements for acne On Discount \nSport nutrition Supplements for depression are gaining much recognition nowadays because of their many benefits which have been realized by a lot of people.

The children were shown either a black child, white child or grey square. Milliseconds later, they were shown an ink blot and asked if the blot was pleasant or unpleasant. Researchers say the answer exposes bias toward the image shown before the ink blot.    \nThe researchers found, overall, there was no evidence the children displayed either negative or positive attitudes toward black children.\n\"They were showing positivity toward white kids, but not necessarily negativity toward black kids,\" lead researcher Jennifer Steele told CBC News.\nEgocentric attitudes One reason for the bias may be the fact that young children \u2014 up to about eight years old \u2014 tend to be egocentric, believing that they are better than others, researchers say. \nThough the children didn't express negativity toward black children, Steele says they were still indicating a preference for other white children.\n\"It's still a racial bias, but it just gives us a little more information about the nature of that bias, which then can allow us to reflect a little bit on what an appropriate intervention might be or what might benefit kids if we're just trying to increase a positive attitude toward a diverse group of kids in a classroom, for example.\"\nYork University researcher Jennifer Steele says teaching children positive attitudes early on could benefit them as they get older. (Shutterstock/Rawpixel.com)\nThe study found that in the AMP test, older children \u2014 aged nine to 12 \u2014 didn't show a positive bias toward white children. The researchers suggest this is because they've developed an appreciation for the differences in others, and have begun focusing on associating with those who share common characteristics, such as social interests. But that doesn't necessarily mean the implicit bias they might have displayed a few years earlier won't return.\nIncreasing positivity Steele, who also plans to study bias in black children, says most research suggests trying to eliminate implicit bias by focusing on getting rid of negative attitudes isn't the best approach.\n\"Instead, focusing more on trying to help children acquire positive attitudes to people from ... different racial groups or different ethnic groups or people from different backgrounds, I think, is probably the best approach.\"\nAnd while some experts believe that teaching children to be colour-blind and not place people into racial groups might be a way to eliminate racial bias, Steele and others argue this could leave children unable to identify discrimination when they witness it. \n'Through positive role models we can point out that there are successful, interesting people who come from all sorts of different backgrounds.' - Jennifer Steele, York University \"It's that lack of discussion that can lead to increases in bias,\" said Sarah Gaither, an assistant professor in Duke University's department of psychology and neuroscience.\nHowever, having those discussions is a delicate matter with its own challenges, she says.\n\"If you're not taking the colour-blind approach ... that leads to the question: do you teach white children that perhaps they're privileged in our society instead? It's this awareness of privilege that we need to figure out how to talk to kids about,\" she told CBC News. \"No one likes to be told that they're biased or privileged.\" \nAnd doing so, she says, could increase that bias accidentally.\nTake the test implicit bias test: Marketplace Police must acknowledge racial bias to fix it Steele says exposing children to a variety of races and cultures at an early age is important.\n\"Fortunately, now with the internet there are so many different ways we can expose children to diversity, and through positive role models we can point out that there are successful, interesting people who come from all sorts of different backgrounds,\" Steele said.\n\"And exposing them to that so they're aware of that is valuable and important.\"\nDo babies show bias?

Both US political parties have long promised to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and Palestinian-aligned regional forces have long threatened violence against the US and Israel. Trump's announcement allows him to tick the box on another campaign promise with no input from Congress and only at the cost of antagonizing the Muslim world, which he seems ok with.  \nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday stirred the pot across the Muslim world on by announcing the US would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel .\nInflamed regional leaders didn't even wait for the announcement to become official before promising a violent response.\n\"He is declaring war in the Middle East, he is declaring war against 1.5 billion Muslims (and) hundreds of millions of Christians that are not going to accept the holy shrines to be totally under the hegemony of Israel,\" Manuel Hassassian, Palestinian general delegate to the UK,  told the BBC  on Wednesday.\nTurkey's deputy prime minister said the move \" will be a major catastrophe. \"  Turkish President  Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan termed the move  a \"red line\" for Muslims. \nHamas, a militant Palestinian Sunni Muslim group, used the occasion to call for another intifada, or uprising, against Israel.\nAn Iranian-backed militia operating in Iraq said the move would give some \" legitimate reason to target American forces.\" In response,  US embassies across the Middle East braced for violence .  \nTrump's announcement \"will change nothing on the ground\" \nDespite the fury it provoked, \"the Trump announcement will change nothing on the ground itself,\" Michael Koplow, the Israel Policy Forum's policy director wrote at the Jewish Telegraph Agency .  \nIsrael considers Jerusalem its capital. The policy platforms of successive Democratic candidates have considered Jerusalem Israel's capital. The US has planned since 1995 to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nYet Hamas frequently calls for intifadas. Iranian-backed forces have several times attacked or imperiled US forces operating in the Middle East . Turkey and Israel had just normalized relations after a six years of difficult silence .  \nAbsent from Trump's speech was a timetable.  \n\u201cAs a practical matter, no embassy is constructed today anywhere in the world in shorter than three or four years \u2014 no embassy,\u201d a Trump administration official told the Washington Examiner .  \nThe US will first study sites, evaluate security concerns, and then begin a lengthy construction process that will likely stretch into the next US presidential administration. \nAs far as endangering the already dubious Palestinian-Israeli peace process, Trump made it clear that the US took no position on how the city should be divided between the two . \nWhat actually happens now that the US recognizes Jerusalem \nBesides inflaming an already inflamed Middle East, Trump's announcement makes a few material changes. \nAs Koplow points out, it will irk the US's Sunni Arab allies who support Palestine and don't want to be seen as siding with the US and Israel. \nDomestically, the move allows Trump to tick the box on another campaign promise completely unilaterally. \nThe president has total authority to conduct the type of foreign policy decision Trump made on Wednesday with no need for a lengthy legislative battle.  \n\"Some say [past presidents] lacked courage, but they made their best judgments based on facts as they understood them at the time,\" Trump said during the announcement.  \nIsrael is pleased by the decision. The Palestinian Authority, such as it is, protests it. Fundamentalist groups have called for violence against Israel and the US. Trump's Secretaries of State and Defense cautioned against the move out of security concerns , but Trump is the executive. \nPolitically at home, Trump has executed on a promise and again demonstrated that for his administration, antagonizing the Muslim world is an acceptable price to pay. \nSEE ALSO:  A key part of US policy on Jerusalem is staying the same \u2014 even after Trump's big embassy announcement \n\n  Share the latest business news with your network: \n\n   \n\nEmail sent to: nguyenvu1187.love5@blogger.com   |   Manage your email preferences   |   Unsubscribe \n\nTerms of Service   |   Privacy Policy \n\nBusiness Insider. 150 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10011 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael koplow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koplow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex lockie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdo\u011fan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manuel hassassian", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jewish telegraph agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel policy forum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington examiner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestinian authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifth avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:46.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22d72c1e7ba5a77e437e1b2fffffad30a7fbbd80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzkFm.Gn_QEzZ0Oj2XQ1HMtGl9f6Qa4JAz6UlDZ0xFut3i3E2Nvuw5JZ9rPNEXbI0w-", "site_full": "forums.azbilliards.com", "site": "azbilliards.com", "site_section": "http://forums.azbilliards.com/forumdisplay.php?f=6", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Main Forum - AzBilliards.com", "title": "Oscar Dominguez in UK tabloids, not good.", "title_full": "Oscar Dominguez in UK tabloids, not good. - AzBilliards.com", "published": "2017-12-06T09:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 97540, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "48394d4c93e322e8e1f83e5e545f0e91f31bdbaa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzkFm.Gn_QEzZ0Oj2XQ1HMtGl9f6Qa4JAz6UlDZ0xFut3i3E2Nvuw5J3NuEYc1Rfm7l8M6Yl9N2T_IMmluBiA4A", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "8BallWonderland", "published": "2017-12-07T09:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : Poolnut What does that even mean?

The panel were Justina Robson, Christopher Priest, Gavin Smith, Al Robertson and Tricia Sullivan, chaired by Richard Edwards. \n\nRichard began by asking people to define science fiction as opposed to science fact. Tricia said, as a scientist, that there didn\u2019t need to be any relevance. SF is a way of running experiments on the world \u2013 it\u2019s a form of scientific method, to see what happens. Justina doesn\u2019t pretend to understand science at a deep level \u2013 she can probably do pop science books level. She pointed out that you only have to understand it to the level of explaining it in the book, but involving actual science is tricky.\nAl pointed out that nothing dates like science, which is another reason to keep tech out of your stories. He\u2019s not interested in the science, but in how people react to it. He said that before AI, we conceptualised foreign intelligence through ghosts and beasties. But with old SF, the science is the most dated thing about it.\nChristopher said that the word \u2018science\u2019 actually means knowledge. So you can talk about the science of behaviour, society, sex, science \u2013 anything. So then you are liberated from needing to know about science. He doesn\u2019t understand it, but he knows what he thinks about it.\nGavin said that trying to predict science is a waste of time. There are two kinds of SF \u2013 positing and testing an idea, and using SF as a setting. He said that the best SF is experimental. But Tricia said that the tendency to think in binaries needs to be resisted \u2013 actually, SF is all these things.\nChristopher said that what you write about is always going to be the present day, and encouraged listeners to write truly of what they see in the world. Al pointed out that we\u2019re always travelling into the future (that\u2019s how time works) so any future you invent will always be tested. Gavin said that BBC\u2019s Tomorrow\u2019s World is a lie, and Al said that they were right about Kraftwerk being the future of music. Gavin laughed at him.\nTricia suggested that SF future isn\u2019t actual future \u2013 it\u2019s a possibility space. Justina had a real problem with future writing because she didn\u2019t want to admit that in the future we were still going to be a little bit rubbish. Tricia raised the fact that The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is now being acted out on the world stage. Christopher asked who could have predicted Trump, but Tricia pointed out that Octavia Butler had him in a novel in the 90s. Christopher asked who could have predicted the phone, or the internet.\nTricia agreed, and added the contraceptive pill to the list. She posited that SF is bad at predicting social change. Al pointed out that one person\u2019s future warning is another person\u2019s user\u2019s guide. Because of that, Tricia feels a responsibility as a writer to imagine ourselves better. She argued that we need something to strive for. She quoted one writer (I didn\u2019t catch the name, I wish I had) as saying \u201cWe don\u2019t need grimdark in Barbados\u201d \u2013 because there are already hurricanes and disasters, there is grimdark in real life.\nGavin pointed out that Star Trek \u2013 and its values \u2013 was responsible for a whole generation of NASA employees. Al wondered if optimism is the new tech we need to exploit. Justine said that everything we create starts with imagination, but we see \u2013 and write \u2013 the bad more than the good. The problem is that utopia has no drama.\nTricia argued that Star Trek was both wonderfully optimistic and full of drama, and asked for a show of hands on who would like to read positive optimistic nonsense. Definite majority yes. She said that if you\u2019re surrounded by negativity, it\u2019s hard to shake that off to write optimism.\nChristopher recommended having children to feel optimistic about the future, and actively hope for better (though I have to say I disagree with him. You should be able to experience empathy and hope without children \u2013 otherwise there\u2019s another problem there). We acknowledged that we are in hard times, but doesn\u2019t feel the negative effect of Trump or Brexit. Tricia pointed out that Trump and Brexit are symptomatic of others, but Christopher said that he doesn\u2019t get bogged down \u2013 he just carries on with his life (sorry, Christopher, but your privilege is showing).\nAl argued that the tech changes, but people stay the same. We are always worried and in danger.\nRichard asked the panel for science that would improve lives. Justina is interested in genetic engineering \u2013 not necessarily living longer, but more healthy lives. But she did think that the technology will be exploited as soon as it\u2019s capable of that. It will have an enormous impact, but she hoped it would be more good than bad. Christopher agreed that medicine is where a lot of development is happening, especially in advances in what we know about the body.\nGavin suggested that we escape gravity. He also argued for a new metanarrative \u2013 we\u2019ve always had something to collectively get behind, but we seem to have lost that now. Al is interested in social technologies, living more constructively. Also, teleportation. He\u2019d like a bathroom in the Alps, a bedroom in the clouds\u2026 distributed living based on teleportation. How would house prices react? How would we combat obesity if we weren\u2019t walking anywhere any more? Tricia loves the idea of green tech, the return of the forests, and living more sustainably. Al agreed \u2013 we can learn about community from trees. Christopher mentioned that they\u2019re working on rewolving Scotland, where he lives \u2013 and also reintroducing osprey and eagles. Tricia mentioned that they\u2019re also reintroducing red kites to Wales.\nStay tuned tomorrow for my summary of the next session, Where Do You Get Your Ideas?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christopher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "octavia butler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tricia sullivan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard edwards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al robertson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavin smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraftwerk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justina robson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tricia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher priest", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "star trek", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "alps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barbados", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:46.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22d72c1e7ba5a77e437e1b2fffffad30a7fbbd80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzkFm.Gn_QEzZ0Oj2XQ1HMtGl9f6Qa4JAz6UlDZ0xFut3i3E2Nvuw5JZ9rPNEXbI0w-", "site_full": "forums.azbilliards.com", "site": "azbilliards.com", "site_section": "http://forums.azbilliards.com/forumdisplay.php?f=6", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Main Forum - AzBilliards.com", "title": "Oscar Dominguez in UK tabloids, not good.", "title_full": "Oscar Dominguez in UK tabloids, not good. - AzBilliards.com", "published": "2017-12-06T09:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 97540, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "94cbfee3b79e5c0a4503f5289d4c2ea77457e982", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzkFm.Gn_QEzZ0Oj2XQ1HMtGl9f6Qa4JAz6UlDZ0xFut3i3E2Nvuw5J3NuEYc1Rfm5gziqlzz8xtaoRvCAYT0gJ", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "Kid Dynomite", "published": "2017-12-07T09:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Touch in pool = control\nSo if I say you have the touch of a feather it would be a compliment!\nIf I say you have the touch of an ax murder!

Keeping the uniquely classic Scandinavian style of the Seattle, New York also features Active Noise Cancellation up to 27 dB allowing users to enjoy their tunes without the disruption of background noise on their commute or in the office. \nNew York connects to devices through Bluetooth technology so music lovers are free to enjoy their crisp sound without any wires holding them down. The headphones' impressive battery life means they can be used continuously for more than a day, at 25 hours with ANC switched off, and for 16 hours with ANC turned on - and they only take 2.5 hours to charge! ANC can effortlessly be switched on or off through a discreet button. \nUnlike most wireless headphones, New York also comes with a complimentary cable - so if you do face the dreadful event of running out of battery, they've got you covered! Listeners can easily pause and play music, answer calls and activate voice assistant (e.g. Siri) through the headphones using iOS, Android and Windows devices. \nAnders Andr\u00e9en, CEO of Urbanista says: ' Urbanista had an incredibly successful year with the Seattle wireless headphones receiving numerous 5* ratings and being nominated for three major industry awards. Seattle was recognized for value and we're proud to offer users high quality at affordable prices. We have no doubt New York will be even more successful with its ANC offering - we can't wait for everyone to fall in love with them! ' \nNew York is available in two stylish colours. Minimalistic style and individuality is at the forefront of the design but New York doesn't fall short on comfort. Made with soft memory foam cushion that molds to the user's ear and an adjustable, seamless headband, New York provides ultimate comfort. They're also a practical choice with a folding feature that makes it easy to slip them into your handbag or rucksack on holiday or commute. \nNew York is available to purchase now on www.urbanista.com. \nAbout Urbanista\nWe love cities. The constant inspiration of urban life. Based in Stockholm, Sweden, Urbanista is a brand for active people all over the world. Bringing a fusion of individual design and frontline technology. Wear Your Music! - our earphones collection - is available in over 10,000 retail stores in 60 countries worldwide. Like all our products developed without compromise for everyday use. We design for life in motion.

Begins a Fruitful Year For the Integration of the Western Balkans December 7th, 2017 \n\u201dLast year, a 15-point plan was adopted at a meeting of Heads of State and Government to improve connectivity in the region. For the past 10 years, trade in countries in the Balkan region has doubled, but trade within the region has not increased, and this is untapped potential.\u201d \nThis was said by the Commissioner for European Neighborhood Policy and Negotiations on Expansion Johannes Hahn, BGNES reported. \n\u201dGreater flexibility in legal aspects is needed. I am grateful that during the Bulgarian Presidency we will have strong support and it will continue during the presidency of Austria.
