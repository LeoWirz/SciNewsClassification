When his daughter, Hafsa, became the Prophet\u2019s wife, his relations with the Messenger of God were reinforced. \nIn this connection, he was like Abu Bakr. We wrote that the Prophet (S) made them brothers by contract. They were inseparable throughout the entire life of the Prophet (S). They held common stances in the developments of Saqifa and it was because of \u2018Umar\u2019s insistence on stabilizing Abu Bakr\u2019s caliphate that Imam \u2018Ali (a) accused him of working for his own future. This was well justified for others. \nThe Caliph\u2019s Character \nThe caliph was a quick-tempered man and an extremist and both characteristics seriously affected his political and administrative career. Management to him was some kind of strictness by which he did his best to maintain control over the Bedouin Arabs. His inner being was easily detectable in his thoughts and deeds during the lifetime of the Prophet of Islam. \nWe know that in the war of Badr, he asked the Prophet (S) to kill all captives. His harsh treatment with Suhayl Ibn \u2018Amr, in the case of the Hudaybiyya peace deal, has been recorded in history. He also held extreme stances against the Hudaybiyya peace accord. On his first day of caliphate, he said, \u201cO God! I am hot-tempered. Soften my behavior!\u201d \nHe knew he could not live without his lash. Therefore, he was the first one in Islam who took the lash of \u201cDirra\u201d in his hand. They have said his cane was more horrendous than the sword of Hajjaj. \nAs said, Talha objected to Abu Bakr as to why he imposed \u2018Umar upon them knowing that he is hot-tempered \nAccording to Ibn Shubba, a man told \u2018Umar, \u201cPeople are mad at you; they hate you.\u201d \n\u2018Umar asked, \u201dwhy.\u201d \nHe replied, \u201cThey complain of your tongue and cane!\u201d \nUmar\u2019s Functionaries \nWith the expansion of this period\u2019s conquests, vast lands fell under the rule of the Medina government. Running these lands needed managers with new values who could open the way for more conquests. In fact, the most important point for the caliph and Muslims in those conditions was further enlarging the conquered lands. \nFor running the affairs of border regions, mostly those people were chosen who had enough military capability and experience. Thus, one of the main criteria of the caliph for selecting a functionary was someone with such an ability who could properly run the city and the region under his control. \nA list of \u2018Umar\u2019s functionaries in the cities was as follows. Mecca, Muhriz Ibn Haritha Ibn \u2018Abd Shams; Qunfudh Ibn \u2018Umayr Taymi; Nafi\u2019 Ibn \u2018Abd al-Harith Khuza\u2019i; Khalid Ibn \u2018As Makhzumi; Bahrayn, \u2018Ala\u2019 Ha\u010frami, Qudamat Ibn Maz\u2019un, \u2018Uthman Ibn Abi l-\u2018As, Abu Hurayrah, Ayyash Ibn Abi Thawr Yemen, \u2018Abd Allah Ibn Abi Rabi\u2019a Makhzumi Yamama, Salama Ibn Sallama Ansari \u2018Amman, Someone from the Ansar and then \u2018Uthman Ibn Abi l-\u2018As Palestine, Yazid Ibn Abi Sufyan, \u2018Amr Ibn \u2018As Basra, Shurayh Ibn \u2018Amir, \u2018Utba Ibn Ghazwan, Mughira Ibn Shu\u2019ba, Abu Musa Ash\u2019ari Kufa, Sa\u2019d Ibn Abi Waqqas, \u2018Ammar Ibn Yasir, Jubayr Ibn Mut\u2019im, Mughira Ibn Shu\u2019ba Ta\u2019if, \u2018Uthman Ibn Abi l-\u2018As, Sufyan Ibn \u2018Abd Allah Thaqafi Greater Syria, Abu \u2018Ubayda Jarrah, Mu\u2019adh Ibn Jabal, Yazid Ibn Abi Sufyan, Mu\u2019awiya Ibn Abi Sufyan60 Egypt, \u2018Amr Ibn \u2018As Hijaz and Adharbayjan, \u2018Aya\u010f Ibn Ghanam, Habib Ibn Maslama Fihri, \u2018Umayr Ibn Sa\u2019d Ansari \nWhat are the Thoughts of the Second Caliph? \nThe second caliph, more than any other personality, influenced the thoughts and ideas of the Sunnites. As his period of caliphate was a highly crucial juncture in the history of Islam, his thoughts and deeds, too, were of great significance for Sunnites Muslims. This is the extent to which he is considered as a role model who made no mistakes and every word or act of him can be trusted as a religious tradition. Therefore, it is necessary to talk about him here. \nThe high status of \u2018Umar in Sunnites thinking, cannot be compared to anyone else. In the narrations told about \u2018Umar\u2019s good traits, the ranking attributed to him is a little lower than prophet-hood! This status has been interpreted as \u201cMuhaddath\u201d. Muhaddath is said to be someone who receives \u201crevelations\u201d.

This functionality will allow Onapsis customers to quickly evaluate if SAP systems are meeting the requirements of this mandate to protect EU data subjects information. As with any new policy, the first stage is to identify those SAP systems that are in scope. In the case of GDPR, these are any systems that process, handle or store user information. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an EU regulation with an enforcement date in May 2018 concerning the protection of EU data subjects' personal and sensitive information. Research conducted by the UK & Ireland SAP User Group shows 86% landscapes and how to reach compliance. It is almost certain GDPR will have an impact, in some way or another, on any company large enough to have chosen SAP, which touches all aspects of a business. In fact almost every SAP system includes GDPR's core element: personal data. \"In speaking to our customers, we know that GDPR is a complicated mandate and many organizations are struggling to determine if or how their SAP landscapes are relevant. With this in mind, Onapsis's automatically evaluates any SAP system through the lens of the data protection requirements of GDPR. This includes both data at rest, data in transit and the assessment of data access or authorizations,\" commented Alex Horan, Director of Product Management, Onapsis. Through the execution of this new policy, enterprises leveraging OSP can identify SAP systems that do not have adequate protection of the data and processes. Users will receive detailed guidance on how to address these security gaps. As new systems are brought in, scoped and tagged as GDPR, they will automatically be included in the next audit. For further understanding of GDPR and how it affects SAP, download the recently released white paper from the Onapsis Research Labs titled, \" SAP Onapsis's Director of Product Management, Alex Horan, will host a live webcast to help organizations understand the complex issue of GDPR and SAP on December 19th at 9:00am and 1:00pm EST.

You can read my January sentences here , my February sentences here , my March sentences here , my April sentences here , my May sentences here , my June sentences here , my July sentences here , my August sentences here , my September sentences here , and my October sentences here . November 1, 2017 I gave my first midterm today, did a lot of grading, completed a lunchtime barre class, went on an afternoon walk and did a short interval workout at the gym while the kid was at Taekwondo. November 2, 2017 I started the day with a barre class (class 23 in 26 days), went on a long hike with a good friend, and then got caught up on work.November 3, 2017 I gave my last midterm today and went to a beer release party with Andy in the evening.November 4, 2017 I started the day again with a barre class, got a bit caught up at home, did some grading, and then we went to a very fun birthday party in the evening. November 5, 2017 I started the day with a barre class, did a lot of grading, grocery shopped, and we went on a long afternoon walk. November 6, 2017 Started the week not really prepared but quickly caught up by making soup for our lunches as soon as I got up, taught my class, held office hours, wrote a blog post, graded, and made time for a barre class. November 7, 2017 I started the day with a barre class and went on several walks throughout the day that ended up totaling 20,000 steps. November 8, 2017 I was in a bit of funk all day, so I bought some beautiful flowers to cheer me up; I also took a barre class at lunch time. November 9, 2017 I started the day with a barre class and then got caught up on work and took care of some details for our Germany trip. November 10, 2017 It was nice to have the day off; we went on a morning walk, out for lunch for Pho, and explored downtown San Jose a bit. November 11, 2017 I went to a barre class, on a walk, to a stress management workshop, and in the afternoon Andy and I stopped by a new brewery for a while. November 12, 2017 I started the day with a barre class, we walked 2 miles to a cafe for lunch (and back), went grocery shopping and got ready for the week. November 13, 2017 I took a lunchtime barre class and got 17,000 steps by the end of the day; I may need to rest a bit soon. November 14, 2017 Lots of grading and prep work after a morning barre class; in the evening the kid presented in front of the School Board, and we are very proud. November 15, 2017 The kid finally got California rolls, which he had been asking for. Unfortunately, they were not very photogenic. November 16, 2017 I met a dear friend of mine who recently moved back to California 2.5 hours away for lunch; since it was raining a lot it turned into quite the adventure. November 17, 2017 I started the day with a barre class, and I brought treats for my 3-hour class. November 18, 2017 It was a cool day, and we got some tofu soup for lunch. November 19, 2017 We walked to our neighborhood cafe after my barre class, and I did some shopping at Old Navy in the afternoon. November 20, 2017 The kid is off this week, and we went on a nice hike in the afternoon. November 21, 2017 The kid and I walked to our neighborhood cafe for lunch and had the best time talking on the way. November 22, 2017 Held office hours, taught my class, went to a barre class, and saw Wonder with the kid in the afternoon - such a good movie! November 23, 2017 Our Thanksgiving plans changed abruptly, but we ended up having a nice day after all, including a last second meal. November 24, 2017 The older kid and I have a standing Black Friday date for ten years now, ever since the younger kid was a tiny baby; we had fun doing a bit of shopping, going out to lunch and getting some coffee; in the evening we checked out the Winter Fest at Great America and then stopped by my friend's house. November 25, 2017 I had some of my friends from grad school, some of whom I hadn't seen in years, over; it was good to catch up. November 26, 2017 The kid's friend slept over and we went out for Japanese ramen. November 27, 2017 I'm still trying to get organized after Saturday's party; plus, I realized today that we'll be in Germany in three weeks! Yikes!!! So not feeling prepared... November 28, 2017 After several really difficult months, I feel there was a breakthrough today, and I'm very thankful; I'm also thankful for my daily walks. November 29, 2017 It's week ten of the quarter and my students are losing steam; I tried to motivate them today... November 30, 2017 I started the day with a barre class, got a haircut, and got lots of work done. Questions: What were your highlights in November?

Astr100 is the former.\nIt, along with 101, 220, 230, and probably a few others, are basically devoid of math outside of maybe some algebra or the teeniest trig. Please done think of this as me disparaging them! I think it's really important for them to exist and they offer a really intro to basic scientific literacy for a lot of people. You'll learn a lot, and yes, they won't be too hard on your social life or gpa. So if that's what you want, go for it.\nOn the other hand, if you want some more math and to learn a bit deeper, may I suggest the 'real' astr courses (only real in the sense that it is what the majors take, the others are real too obviously). Astr120 and 121 are the 'intro sequence' the majors take and it usually not hard to get into them for nonmajors too. Protip, this is basically true of every astr course if you know who to talk to. The dept is really small and they have little qualms opening up classes to people who have an interest+something resembling the requires math background.\nSo uh yeah, probably said more than you care about but maybe some other lost soul will find this thread and be helped by it. So there you go. If you like physics, astr will probably be of interest to you, so it's overall a good pick.

Stone was the preferred material in colder regions, whilst cane frameworks were used in warmer areas. \nUnfortunately, Australia\u2019s pre-colonial architecture is rarely discussed during conversations about the country\u2019s architectural history. Settlers arrived with their own ideas about architectural beauty and integrity and their own technology, dismissing the structures which pre-dated their arrival by centuries. Colonial Architecture \nFollowing settlement, Australian architecture was heavily influenced by the structures colonial leaders were accustomed to back home. Architects demonstrated notable apprehension about creating a national architectural identify for Australia, a phenomenon not limited to Australia. \nSpanish architectural styles could be seen throughout the Americas, whilst Dutch architecture could be seen across South Africa and South Asia, and Portugese trends in parts of India and Sri Lanka. British architectural styles can still be seen around Australia to this day and even persist in newer buildings, with ties between Australian and Great Britain remaining close. \nClassic examples of British colonial architecture in Australia include the Georgian St. James\u2019 Church in Sydney, Melbourne\u2019s Gothic Collins Street, and the Victorian city of Ballarat. Wartime Influences \nAlthough construction work slowed significantly during the two World Wars, the structures built around this time began to diverge from the British colonial styles typical of early settlement Australia. It was around this time that the California Bungalow which, despite its name, was a style that actually originated in Bengal, India, offered Australians the experience of \u2018 cottage luxury \u2019, with enclosed porches and exposed redwood beams. California Bungalows were hugely popular in Melbourne, Sydney, and South Australia, with each area bring its own unique take on the style, with red brick in Melbourne and limestone materials in SA. \nAnother major trend was French-inspired art deco design, focusing heavily on geometric shapes and, of course, classic enclosed balconies. Art deco fashion eventually made its way around the world, perhaps most famously ending up in Miami\u2019s South Beach, and while the trend has largely fallen out of favour today, there are many reminders of the style to be found throughout Australia. Melbourne\u2019s Mitchell House on Lonsdale Street, for example, demonstrates many well-known, traditional art deco features. Finding an Architectural Identity \nUp to this point, Australia was still very much borrowing ideas and trends from around the world, and had not yet cemented its own architectural identity. However, post-war migration, coupled with the great resurgence of Australian art in the 1950s, provided just what the country needed to find its own style. \nAustralia found its own identity in blending ideas, mixing trends, and juxtaposing styles; incorporating both domestic and international influences into a single vision that was both fresh and avant-garde, whilst often wearing its influences on its sleeve. \nClassic examples include the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Sydney Opera House, constructed between 1959 and 1973 and designed by Danish-born architect J\u00f8rn Utzon, and Canberra\u2019s Parliament House, built in the 1980s and designed by Italian Romaldo Giurgola. A country that prides itself on its multiculturalism, that pride is evident in the clash of styles and inspirations that make up Australian architecture. The Future of Australian Architecture \nWhilst Australian architecture has embraced modernity (and post-modernity, for that matter) and set as many trends as it has kept pace with, one of the most recent and promising trends in Australian architecture is the long overdue focus on traditional Indigenous styles. \nNeglected for most of Australia\u2019s post-colonial history, Aboriginal culture is slowly coming to the forefront of culture, evident in art, architecture, music, film, and in language. Much of the Indigenous influence in the world of architecture comes as a result of the first generation of Indigenous architecture students graduating from university architecture and design programs. \nContemporary Indigenous architects such as Andrew Lane, Queensland\u2019s first registered Indigenous architect, Carroll Go-Sam, and collectives such as Merrima Design Group, who designed the Aboriginal Medical Service, incorporate different elements and symbols of traditional Indigenous culture into their work. Others, however, avoid referencing Aboriginal ancestors or making references to The Dreamtime, and instead use architecture as a conduit to explore themes of identity and place. An Architectural Revolution \nAustralia\u2019s architectural landscape is a reflection of its demographic landscape, a meeting of styles, tastes, trends, and influences blending and juxtaposing against one another. A drive through the streets of Melbourne can take you from the early colonial period, right through to the post-War period and beyond. Ultimately, Australia\u2019s architecture is an illustration of its history and the result is a unique blend of styles, designs, and trends that simply cannot be found anywhere else. Australia is an architectural melting pot. \nAuthor: Ryan Lewis is a director at Lovelight . He has a keen eye for detail, is passionate about quality and is also a huge lover of bikes.

Cooking has lost it's joy , because you're not there to ask all those questions : mummy what are you cooking now ? What's that ? Why do you put that ? Mummy please can I stir the contents of what you're cooking ? Can I get a piece of meat ? No more will I hear you say : mummy my sleep mode is not activated yet , when I say : Chimnonso go to sleep right now ! No one to ask me : mummy how come am getting pimples on my face and you don't have ? And I have to answer : Joshua , you're in your puberty years and becoming a young man ? h my son , my baby , the most considerate child , my six feet four inches ( 6ft , 4 inches tall ) adorable giant , I miss you . Be that as it may , I want to use this medium to wholeheartedly appreciate God , the eternal rock of ages , the all knowing emperor of the universe , the pillar of my life , for it all .

(\" Hill Top \") and Big Wind Capital Inc . (\" Big Wind \" or the \" Company \") (CSE:BWC)(CSE:BWC.CN)(CNSX:BWC)(OTC: BGGWF ) announce that Hill Top has filed a patent for a biometric security application designed to protect bitcoin and other crypto-currencies from theft and loss. Missing passwords and theft have become the biggest issues plaguing the crypto-currency industry, with more than 35 major reported hacks of bitcoin exchanges alone since 2011, leading to the theft of over 980,000 bitcoins. In total, as much as 23% of Bitcoins mined to date are estimated lost forever 1 (approx. $US30 billion at current market value). Hill Top's biometric crypto-currency application helps solve this issue by adding a new, high-level of personalized security for crypto-currency users worldwide. Hill Top recently signed a letter of intent with Big Wind, pursuant to which Big Wind intends to acquire various interests in HTSI and its assets (the \"Transaction\"). The patent filing covers UxToken: Biometric-enabled, GPS trackable crypto-currency private key safe storage. The new application was developed by Hill Top's in-house team, which is comprised of former US military officers and personnel. Importantly, this new crypto-currency security helps bridge the divide between completely anonymous transactional parties and a reasonable assurance of participant identity, that is aligned with compliance requirements in standard, market-based asset transactions. Corby Marshall, CEO of Hill Top Security, said, \" The potential of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is vast, however, it is becoming constrained by cyber crime, as well as missing passwords, which can render coins irretrievable. In fact, as many as 3.79 million Bitcoins are estimated as lost forever - that's nearly 23% of all Bitcoins in circulation, which is close to $30 Billion at current market value. This patent application covers our new biometric crypto-currency security app, which will provide biometric protection of these currencies, in particular, with offline (cold) storage and the recovery of lost passwords .\" Completion of the Transaction is subject to a number of other conditions, including but not limited to acceptance by the Canadian Securities Exchange and entering into a formal definitive agreement.

It was Boston\u2019s fourth consecutive victory. The Mavericks, who had won 6 of their last 8 games entering tonight, caught fire in the first half. Dallas shot 47.6 percent and was a +8 at the free throw line through two quarters. The Celtics allowed 57 points by halftime and dug themselves into a 10-point deficit. They turned up the defensive intensity in the second half, limiting Dallas to only 31 percent shooting. They cut the lead to three after three quarters, and pulled away from the Mavericks in the fourth. After pouring in 47 points against the Mavs on November 20, Kyrie Irving was outstanding again tonight, and finished with 23 points and 5 helpers on 10-of-18 shooting. Per usual, the MVP candidate came alive in clutch time with 7 points, 1 steal, and 1 assist in the final four minutes of the game to help the C\u2019s pull away. After a brief confrontation with Dennis Smith Jr. in the first quarter, Irving decided to take out his aggression on the young rookie. Kyrie\u2019s offensive barrage included this nifty hesitation move that left Smith Jr. in the dust. Kyrie puts the defense on \u26f8 pic.twitter.com/IyOKbvR1vC \u2014 Boston Celtics (@celtics) December 7, 2017 Irving also displayed some sensational defensive recovery skills with this backboard pinning block: \u2014 Boston Celtics (@celtics) December 7, 2017 Once again, Al Horford stuffed the stat sheet with 17 points, 8 boards, and 8 assists. The Dallas bigs couldn\u2019t figure out how to defend Horford, who terrorized them from the outside and rolling to the rim. Jayson Tatum added 17 points and 10 boards on a clean 5-of-11 shooting night. He also upped his league-leading three-point percentage by going 2-for-3 from behind the arc. In a contest that prominently featured three German players, Maxi Kleber was the most impactful of the group. The rookie combo forward finished with 13 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 blocks. Kleber, who entered the night with only 4 blocks on the season, sent back multiple monster denials in one possession in the second quarter. \u2014 Dallas Mavericks (@dallasmavs) December 7, 2017 Harrison Barnes led Dallas with 19 points and 7 boards. For the second consecutive contest between these teams, Barnes was unstoppable when he was able to get isolation catches near the free throw line. Other than Shane Larkin and Daniel Theis, the Celtic bench struggled mightily on a night where Boston was missing two key rotation players. Larkin contributed 11 points, 2 dimes, and 2 steals in a semi-revenge game against the team that drafted him in 2013. Theis, the other bright spot, finished with an efficient 7 points and 11 rebounds in 17 minutes. For the second unit, inconsistent offense and poor shot creation has been a major issue as of late, and this game was no different. The backups were a combined -20, and looked lost in the first half without Marcus Morris\u2019 scoring presence. The lack of offensive production resulted in surrendered leads in the second and fourth quarters. Morris (knee rehabilitation) sat out as he continues to monitor some nagging left knee soreness. In total, the combo forward has missed 11 of Boston\u2019s 26 games this season. Morris remains on a minutes restriction. Jaylen Brown (inflamed right eye) was also a late scratch. The team is calling it a non-basketball related injury, and his status for Friday\u2019s game remains undetermined. Next up, the Celtics will travel to San Antonio for a nationally televised matchup against the Spurs (16-8, 3rd place in the West) on Friday night. Reports are circulating that two-way superstar Kawhi Leonard could make his season debut. Boston downed San Antonio 108-94 in the TD Garden on October 30. The C\u2019s have not had a season series sweep against the Spurs since 2011.

Those transactions do not have the same risk profiles as cash transactions, and they should not be subjected to the same costs, timelines and procedures.\u201d \nRemit tokens are being issued in partnership with Stellar, with the tokens generated to be the primary tool for accessing digital shopping vouchers, utility bill payments and mobile airtime services within the SureRemit app. \nSureRemit already has access to over 500 redemption points of major retail chains within the SureGifts merchant ecosystem across Africa, with partnerships to acquire thousands of ecosystem merchant partners in India and the Middle-East in the works. Expansion into other major remittance corridors is planned for next year. \nTo finance the project, SureRemit is launching an ICO pre-sale tomorrow (December 8) at the Turkey Innovation and Entrepreneurship Week. The pre-sale runs till January 5, 2018, and early members of the SureRemit community will get the chance to buy the first Remit tokens with bonuses. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on the concept-development of SureRemit for a while now, and the primary motivation for integrating cryptocurrency into the technology is for cross-border payment processing and transaction costs, since it\u2019s a global project, not an African one,\u201d said Adeoye Ojo, co-founder of SureRemit. \n\u201cThe ICO is the initial token generation and distribution event, and while it is also a fundraising mechanism for the project, the primary motivation for it is not as an alternative route from traditional fundraising.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laolu samuel-biyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adeoye ojo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sureremit", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "turkey innovation and entrepreneurship week", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle-east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:18.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eee10ca582acea1ef54abed6c234b5addc4acb1a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9d70Q6t7WcvEYceV4Wr5TY6J7n4CAQwULwm.JVnks5v3hj.fsGqdtipcodN.icm2yDFFrIjtqFbg--", "site_full": "www.livestrong.com", "site": "livestrong.com", "site_section": "http://www.livestrong.com/conversations/thread/142-quit-smoking", "site_categories": ["health", "exercise"], "section_title": "Quit Smoking | LIVESTRONG.COM", "title": "Here Is My LIVESTRONG MyQuit Coach Daily Progress", "title_full": "Here Is My LIVESTRONG MyQuit Coach Daily Progress | LIVESTRONG.COM", "published": "2017-12-07T07:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.059, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 907, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a1452ed0178e3c4507d3c92111cc331624084525", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9d70Q6t7WcvEYceV4Wr5TY6J7n4CAQwULwm.JVnks5v3hj.fsGqdtipcodN.icm2zO8z3i4a1XrA--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "oniglove", "published": "2017-12-07T08:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "That's great news.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:19.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "304a9ec066ff772c7b945d7a52dc4149ca21af2a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8vPZA6toGHkl1dV4_QYkwrQoWXEeAafce0L1vl2u00ywfDahQ333pEs1GWag_nAdmUczFmhRycDK6umUwHwbqorjYSK.803moGbsTUIRvHi5IWMVr7qPg5lrDzGOvvXp3RTIL0CT11BxETfP1jw2j", "site_full": "uk.reuters.com", "site": "reuters.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/UKSportsNews", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Reuters: Sports News", "title": "PGA tees up China partner to help drive through red tape", "title_full": "PGA tees up China partner to help drive through red tape", "published": "2017-12-07T10:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 408, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "304a9ec066ff772c7b945d7a52dc4149ca21af2a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8vPZA6toGHkl1dV4_QYkwrQoWXEeAafce0L1vl2u00ywfDahQ333pEs1GWag_nAdmUczFmhRycDK6umUwHwbqorjYSK.803moGbsTUIRvHi5IWMVr7qPg5lrDzGOvvXp3RTIL0CT11BxETfP1jw2j", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "PGA tees up China partner to help drive through red tape", "text": "December 7, 2017 / 9:00 AM / in 14 minutes PGA tees up China partner to help drive through red tape Reuters Staff 3 Min Read BEIJING (Reuters) - The world\u2019s leading golf tour is handing the reins of its China circuit to a new local partner, a move which should help smooth the path with regulators amid a long-running crackdown on the sport as it battles to clear bureaucratic hurdles. The PGA Tour had agreed a deal with Shankai Sports, whereby the Chinese partner would operate PGA tournaments in the country for a 20-year period starting from 2018, the golfing body\u2019s China head said at an event in Beijing on Thursday. The move, which will involve Shankai paying an undisclosed sum to the PGA to operate its China series, follows a lengthy stagnation surrounding the golf market in China since a crackdown on corruption and bans on officials playing the sport. The PGA itself has faced issues, especially since a three-year deal with the China Golf Association (CGA) expired in 2016. \u201cWe had some differences of opinions, tried to work through those, and decided to reform and reorganise,\u201d PGA Tour Greater China Managing Director Greg Gilligan told Reuters. He added that the decision to bring on a new local partner on board was driven by \u201cthe size of the opportunity and the complexity of doing things here (in China)\u201d. Golf has grown in popularity in China but hampered in recent years by a sweeping anti-graft campaign under President Xi Jinping, as tales of officials\u2019 high living, including expensive rounds on the golf course, stirred public resentment. In January, China\u2019s state planner said it had ordered the closure of more than 100 golf courses in a multi-year campaign launched in 2011 to tackle illegal development in the sector. David Han, chief executive of private equity firm Yao Capital, also told Reuters at the event that the firm had invested 300 million yuan (33.9 million pounds) in Shankai along with IDG Capital. In October, PGA Tour officials said the China series would return with a full schedule of tournaments in 2018 after this year\u2019s planned event was scrapped. In September, the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) had to cancel a tournament in Shanghai less than a month before it was due to tee off after failing to get local government approval for the event.

The goal was credited to Vitinho.\nCSKA drop into the Europa League, while Basel reached the last 16 for the third time this decade, the Swiss champions beating Benfica 2-0 in Lisbon with goals from Mohamed Elyounoussi and Dimitri Oberlin.\nLast season\u2019s beaten finalists Juventus progressed from Group D thanks to their 2-0 win away to Olympiakos in Greece, Juan Cuadrado opening the scoring early on before Federico Bernardeschi completed the victory late on.\nThe Italian champions go through behind Barcelona, who rounded off their group phase by easing to a 2-0 win at home against Sporting Lisbon.\nLionel Messi was left on the bench at a sparsely populated Camp Nou as Paco Alcacer headed the hosts in front on the hour and Jeremy Mathieu then scored a late own goal against his old side. Sporting drop into the Europa League.\nChelsea drop to second\nRoma knew they would go through from Group C with a win, which they got, although they could only edge out Qarabag of Azerbaijan 1-0 at the Stadio Olimpico with a Diego Perotti effort early in the second half.\nThat turned out to be enough for Roma to win the section ahead of Chelsea, who had to come from behind to draw 1-1 at home to Atletico.\nSaul Niguez headed Atletico in front on 56 minutes at Stamford Bridge, but Eden Hazard\u2019s ball across goal was turned into his own net by Stefan Savic to restore parity.\nDiego Simeone\u2019s Atletico, who have only been knocked out by Real Madrid in each of the last four years, reaching at least the quarter-finals every time, must now accept a spot in the Europa League.\nThey won that trophy in 2010 and 2012.\nTolisso double for Bayern Bayern and PSG had already secured qualification from Group B but met at the Allianz Arena with first place still up for grabs.\nHaving lost 3-0 in Paris in September, Bayern needed to win by four goals to leapfrog Neymar and co.\nThey gave themselves a chance, with Robert Lewandowski and Corentin Tolisso both heading home in the first half.\nKylian Mbappe got one back just after the break, leaving Bayern with too much to do, although Tolisso did score again to make it 3-1.\nPSG will be the happier side at winning the group, although possible last-16 opponents for them are Chelsea, Juventus and Real Madrid.\nCeltic, who lost 7-1 at PSG last time out, lost 1-0 at home to Anderlecht after Jozo Simunovic put through his own net in the second half.\nDespite a fifth loss in six group games, they limp into the Europa League in the new year.\nLiverpool are among the sides hoping to secure a place in the last 16 on Wednesday, with more four more berths still up for grabs for next Monday\u2019s draw.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

Xavier Rolet: the man at the centre of the intrigue (PA) \nThe raging controversy at the LSE has even drawn comment from the Bank of England, with Governor Mark Carney earlier this week saying he was \u201cmystified\u201d by the tussle. \nMr Rolet\u2019s departure comes after more than eight years in the top job, during which time the LSE has seen its stock market value soar from \u00a3800 million to nearly \u00a314 billion. \nHis tenure has seen LSE seal a string of acquisitions, although it was marred by the recent failed attempt at a \u00a321 billion merger with German rival Deutsche Borse after it was blocked by the European Commission in March.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mr rolet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher hohn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald brydon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xavier rolet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brydon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rolet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark carney", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "london stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institutional shareholder services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank of england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "children\u2019s investment fund management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche borse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:20.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7785c6e2404e1cbc41baae6a92264e929a3d7ad6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpMfouZbcTsqM3wju51VzJARTDDaTWBtWqfTT.QoLuK5LV2ClpwjQHwqlq1maY0Odua4lRrMg6NZDh4Cownvao", "site_full": "onehallyu.com", "site": "onehallyu.com", "site_section": "https://onehallyu.com/forum/14-love-relationships/", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Love &amp; Relationships - OneHallyu", "title": "Is this kind of douchy of me", "title_full": "Is this kind of douchy of me - Love & Relationships - OneHallyu", "published": "2017-12-03T04:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://onehallyu.com//public/style_images/master/meta_image.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15761, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4bc876fb47c7153ed8078e7a7bc1a121bda91766", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpMfouZbcTsqM3wju51VzJARTDDaTWBtWqfTT.QoLuK5LV2ClpwjQHwqlq1maY0Odua4lRrMg6NbGjpV2L.smu", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Ga\u2113axunnie\u2730Superoppa", "published": "2017-12-02T16:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "If I were you I'd tell the guys the kind of thing you're going for from the get go.

This has seen a sharp increase in the reliance on fleet management systems to efficiently manage their fleet and get critical data that will help them make informed decisions. \nhttps://static.pexels.com/photos/193667/pexels-photo-193667.jpeg \nWithout a fleet management system, it\u2019s hard for businesses that use vehicles within their services to achieve the level of efficiency needed to grow and be successful. Why should you invest in a modern fleet management software for your business? Cost Reduction \nThe primary objective of every business is to reduce costs. How can you do that with a large fleet of vehicles? Maintaining a fleet can be expensive, both in fuel costs, paying drivers and maintaining the vehicles. Many businesses are blindly investing in technology without really considering the benefits they get. \nBy investing in fleet management tools like a GPS fleet tracking system , you can easily reduce business operational costs. With real-time data on fuel consumption, scheduled maintenance reports, non-scheduled repairs, driver downtime and others, fleet management software helps manage business costs. Better Driver Management \nMost businesses ignore the importance of having a proper driver management system. This is terribly wrong. Drivers are at the core of any fleet management plan. With fleet management software, you can easily create specific driver profiles based on their average speeds, the routes they travel, choice of gear, delivery speed and other details. \nWithout vehicle telematics, such details are impossible to track. With the generated driver profiles, you can now ensure that every driver on your fleet is meeting their key performance indicators (KPIs) and if not, you can use the collected data to remind them or create a more efficient fleet management plan to help achieve the desired business goals. Fleet Management Aids Efficiency \nAchieving efficiency is perhaps the biggest challenge for businesses running large fleets of vehicles. Fleet management software is one of the core investments you should have if you want to ensure fuel efficiency. Monitoring your drivers\u2019 speed will let you know if they are wasting fuel. Telematics software can be used to plan travel routes for your fleet and check that drivers stick to them, ensuring that fuel efficiency is achieved. \nThe demand for telematics software is increasing as more businesses look for increased connectivity between the office, mobile workers and drivers. As telematics software is adopted by commercial vehicle manufacturers, fleet owners are set to benefit immensely as they get more detailed data to help them improve efficiency across the entire business. Fleet Maintenance \nHow often should your vehicle\u2019s be maintained? The answer mainly lies in the user manual, but how do you know when maintenance is due? Installing a fleet management software will keep you updated on all your fleet maintenance needs. This will lead to fewer breakdowns and driver downtime, reduce future repair costs and increase vehicle resale price. Route Planning \nhttps://static.pexels.com/photos/21014/pexels-photo.jpg \nRoute planning is key to streamlining fleet operations. With fleet management, you can plan routes easily, and in advance, so your drivers can know exactly what routes to follow to deliver goods and products faster and more efficiently. Route planning helps reduce fuel costs and time, which is the essence of a fleet management software. Automatic Logging \nA fleet management system comes with automatic logging features that help you record critical data like speed, location, re-routing and mileage in real time. A database saves all these logs. It can later be accessed to solve issues, streamline operations and even create a better risk management strategy. Conclusion \nDo you have to spend more money to enjoy all these benefits? Yes, investing in fleet management is critical if you want to achieve better cost efficiencies and improve productivity. Think of it in the long-term and your business will benefit greatly. Just make sure you follow the right steps when choosing fleet management software .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "better driver management  most", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:20.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7785c6e2404e1cbc41baae6a92264e929a3d7ad6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpMfouZbcTsqM3wju51VzJARTDDaTWBtWqfTT.QoLuK5LV2ClpwjQHwqlq1maY0Odua4lRrMg6NZDh4Cownvao", "site_full": "onehallyu.com", "site": "onehallyu.com", "site_section": "https://onehallyu.com/forum/14-love-relationships/", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Love &amp;

It\u2019s true that many businesses still cling to their older systems because they\u2019re used to them and want to recoup the investment they\u2019ve made in in-house equipment. But even here, partial migration to \u201cthe cloud\u201d is often underway. \nSo, does your business use the cloud? If not, you are likely putting yourself at a needless business disadvantage and leaving money on the table. Cloud migration is now easier than ever: the process is typically seamless. But why should you want to make the transition? \nHere are 5 key benefits that relocating to the cloud can bring: 1. Bolstered Security Levels \nCyber attacks are now costing world businesses trillions of dollars annually, soon to hit $6 trillion per year . Only by availing yourself of the cutting-edge cybersecurity systems and updating them regularly can you stay ahead of the criminal mind. With cloud, that kind of up to date security is built into the package: and you don\u2019t even have to think about it, much less deal with it, yourself. \nIn-house systems may seem more secure at first glance, but in reality, they expose you to in-house data theft in ways that won\u2019t happen when you \u201clive in the clouds.\u201d 2. Affordability \nCloud-based IT is now very affordable to businesses of all sizes, even small ones. You save money because you don\u2019t have to buy a lot of expensive equipment and maintain it. Also, you can periodically upgrade it yourself . \nYou also no longer need a large in-house IT staff; and that saves you a bundle. With 24/7 technical support, issues can be resolved quickly, in most instances, without calling in any mobile IT worker company to come to the rescue either. 3. Reliability \nCloud computing as a business service means greater reliability and consistency than its in-house counterpart. In fact, most cloud providers guarantee a 99% or higher service level in an official agreement, which means they almost always keep you up and running 24/7/365. \nOften, even if a server fails, your service provider can quickly transfer hosted apps to another server to keep you going. The interruptions are minimal compared to in-house. 4. No-hassle Management \nWith cloud, you won\u2019t be hampered and burdened with constantly having to manage your own IT. You will be given options, and you can use a simple online interface to access all your software, apps, and services. \nBut the bottom line is that, being cloud-based, someone else is managing all of the nuts and bolts for you. You still have access to and control over what you need to manage, however. But there is minimal management hassle to deal with, which saves you time and stress. 5. Always Up to Date, Always Cutting-edge \nThere is no sector of the economy, no industry, that advances more rapidly than does the IT sector. It\u2019s almost impossible to keep up to date if you handle your IT 100% in-house. So why try? Why be forced to choose between the rock of spending too much on new IT equipment/software and the hard place of always being behind the times? \nThis may be the last of the five cloud-based IT benefits we mentioned here, but it surely is not \u201cleast\u201d in any sense. Virtually automatically staying up to date on your technology through the cloud keeps your business running faster. You\u2019ll avoid glitches and always quickly avail yourself of the latest IT break-throughs. \nMigrate to the cloud? \u201cGive me one good reason,\u201d perhaps, one might retort. But there are at least 5 good reasons: better cyber security, easier affordability, greater reliability, simplified IT management, and always staying technologically up to date. \nContributed by Josh Nelson \nJosh Nelson is an influencer marketing pro with brownboxbranding.com who is passionate about building authentic relationships and helping businesses connect with their ideal online audience.

We've actually been seeing each other a lot too. I spend the night at his place every two days.\nHe's been seeming to like me a little bit more than just for sex these days though. I tried to cancel once because I was on my period and he was all, \"that's fine, we can just watch shows. It still will be fun\" I ended up going and it was just that. Also he's suggesting that we go out to the movie theater and go out to dinner. He casually tried to find out if I was seeing other guys the other day too. Plus today when I left his place he was talking about how he wishes we could spend more time together\nProblem is I don't know if I see him like that. I tend to only date to get laid on a regular basis. Really for me it's just a sex thing. I mean I can see it becoming exclusive.. maybe. But I'm kinda having fun dating around right now. I'm a little worried this is heading towards exclusive territory too soon. Usually I never make things exclusive, I usually say no when guys ask.

In all honestly, I was glad for the company for while I have enjoyed my travels and recent adventures it was nice once more to be in the company of one of my own - even if for gnome he was a bit particular.\nTurns out my fellow traveler was a young gnome named MacGibble and his staunch bravery was due in part to him belonging to a secretive band of heroes named the Crescent Protectors. MacGibble was a fascinating companion. He had travelled the world and met all sort of folk. His father had even stormed the Lich King's fortress but sadly had perished a few years back by Deathwing\u2019s fires.\nAs he beguiled me with tales of fighting dragons and romancing Worgen women, whom he assured me were not merely, monstrous creatures of legend but instead intelligent thoughtful allies, we shared flask of Fizzy Faire a drink he said he had procured at the Darkmoon Faire. Whether it was my empty belly or the strength of the sweet wine, after a short while I will admit to being quite light headed and was much relieved when finally I spotted the lights of the Goldshire inn.\nBut what had transpired during my absence? Outside, where just earlier there had only been a small handful of people now there were throngs on the road and not just humans but, dwarves, gnomes and even night elves. At this point I must confess that my story diverges in my mind and the events are less certain to me. For you see for some reason, the sight of all the different people and even the presence of night elves did not shock me as clearly it should have. Maybe I was simply overcome by the days adventure or the wine MacGibble and I had shared or just my sense of self was lost to the hustle and bustle around me but I took it all in and somehow remained quite calm. I turned to MacGibble to remark about this odd composure I felt but unfortunately, we had become separated in the crowd. I assumed he had made his way inside the inn since we had agreed to break bread together upon arrival. Light headed and with my stomach growling from hunger I made my way to the entrance of the inn. And that\u2019s when things got strange.\nI don\u2019t mean to leave this story on such a cliff hanger but I have rambled on for quite a bit and am still a bit light headed from both the drink and the ordeal. The telling of this very strange occurrence should not be rushed and I need some time to compose the events in my head for they are still a bit jumbled.

In fact, the cumulative SEO spending is forecasted to hit $80 billion by 2020 . This means that many businesses are actively investing in marketing their products and services online. However, that doesn\u2019t mean they are all bound to be successful. \nThe SEO technique has a proven track record of measurable and successful results. But, if your results are giving you a headache, then something is wrong. Read on to learn more. \nhttps://pixabay.com/en/analytics-charts-graphics-marketing-2618277/ 1. Poor Keywords and Research \nKeywords are one of the major building blocks of a successful SEO campaign. Typically, they allow you to target people that are searching for your products and services online. Failing to research the right keywords will certainly hurt your bottom line. \nFor example, if you settle on high competition keywords, particularly those with a difficulty score of 50 and above, it\u2019s going to be difficult for you to rank for them. Plus, you\u2019re likely to spend more to target such keywords. Also, don\u2019t just choose your own keywords based on what you believe or think. Instead, start by researching the best possible terms and search phrases to use. 2. Poor Budget and Timeframe \nIf you\u2019re using the SEO method for the first time, it usually takes about three to six months for you to start noticing results. But, your specific time hinges on various factors, including your niche, keywords, and budget. In most cases, a single campaign might not be adequate to bring the results you want . \nFirst, be sure to set realistic timeframes. Just because SEO is glorified and celebrated doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a magical technique with instant results. For some niches, it can even take you up to a year to start noticing real results. You also need to know what services and tools your campaign needs, so set aside enough funds to suffice your needs. 3. Wrong Service Provider \nOne great thing about SEO is the convenience of connecting with professionals online. So if you\u2019re looking for SEO in Seattle , you can simply do a search to find a local company. But, not so fast. By rushing, you can end up with the wrong service provider. \nDon\u2019t rush to get your campaigns live without reviewing SEO companies. Let them show you their results. For example, they should give you a keyword(s) they are ranking for at the top of SERPs. Referring you to some of their past clients will also help you to establish their professionalism and track record. 4. You\u2019re Not Making Improvements \nOne thing you need to note is that success with SEO is not a one-shot thing. If you have a reasonable traffic streaming to your site, you need to capitalize on this data to learn more about your audience and make improvements. That\u2019s how it works. Launching your SEO campaign and stopping there won\u2019t earn you the right results. \nAnalyze your data, identify the mistakes, and make effective changes to your website and other properties to ensure you\u2019re on the right track. Also, it\u2019s a mistake to measure the results based one data point, such as phone calls, rankings, or traffic. You can be getting high rankings and traffic, but your conversion rates are poor. Look at the whole grid to see how rankings are affecting your traffic and conversion. Take SEO Marketing Seriously! \nSearch engine optimization is an excellent tool for business growth when used in the right way. It offers measurable results which you can actually compare month after month. However, delving into it without any plans will lead you to failure. Instead, take time to plan, set up the right team, and determine what services and tools you will need.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "seo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "poor budget", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "research  keywords", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:20.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b6796b3b3e89d4d710a71262f22fefc0dc887ff3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQoK1RZozHqPaWoMJBzgl3EVbPFEri.th5sZfltKDqIISsZoUna5RL0uAfcWAaBAXnM9WYrFRwF0Hn.9ZEif.YvEXjOU6wEa_eAwTDJgcZt57_7gkVrJuOuS5HJN7I5dE4-", "site_full": "violetscarf1theodore.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://violetscarf1theodore.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Serving The Best: A Wine Enthusiast\u2019S Guide \u2013 violetscarf1theodore's blog", "title": "Serving The Best: A Wine Enthusiast\u2019S Guide", "title_full": "Serving The Best: A Wine Enthusiast\u2019S Guide", "published": "2017-12-07T11:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b6796b3b3e89d4d710a71262f22fefc0dc887ff3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQoK1RZozHqPaWoMJBzgl3EVbPFEri.th5sZfltKDqIISsZoUna5RL0uAfcWAaBAXnM9WYrFRwF0Hn.9ZEif.YvEXjOU6wEa_eAwTDJgcZt57_7gkVrJuOuS5HJN7I5dE4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "violetscarf1theodore", "published": "2017-12-07T11:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "Serving The Best: A Wine Enthusiast\u2019S Guide", "text": "When it comes to wine, you may be surprised just how much information there is out there.

Wine is great in helping with your heart, especially red wine. Do not drink too much though, as excess wine can cause you to feel groggy and can hurt your health.\nUnderstand the types of fruits that are used in your wine and the ones that you like. This can go a long way in determining your favorite types of wines, as you can look at the content before you purchase. This will allow you to filter out the wines that do not have the ingredients you prefer.\nOne good thing to do when you\u2019re getting wine is to give a single a bottle a try first. With such a variety of wines to chose from, you need to find out which ones you actually like. Always try a bottle before opting to purchase a case.\nTry one of the many discussion forums about wine online. You can learn much from other people by interacting in the forums. Prior to signing up, check out the board to make sure it \u201cfits\u201d you.\nWhen buying wine for dinner, take into consideration the food you will be serving. As a general rule, red wines pair well with beef based dishes, while white wines work well with seafood and vegetarian dishes. If you are not sure about which wine to pair with your meal, ask at your local wine store to receive a little help.\nclick this link now can be a useful product to have. If you have not been able to get one, or if you do not like them because of the time involved in using them, think about getting an aerator instead.

Adding some fruit, a bit of sweet soda and a little ice can completely change the taste. This makes for a nice addition to a baby shower or birthday party, and one of your guests is sure to enjoy.\nIf you are planning to cook with wine, examine your recipe closely.

Avoiding a wait time for the bottle can also enhance the evening for everyone.\nRiesling wines are made from white grapes and offer consumers a mouth full of delicate floral wine with hints of peach, honey or apricot. This wine pairs perfectly with seafood and chicken. Or, if you prefer, you can serve this delicate wine alongside an assortment of cheeses or desserts.\nA good tip if you\u2019re offering wine at a restaurant is to make sure you know how to properly care for the wine. There\u2019s nothing more annoying than ordering some wine by the glass, only to find out that it wasn\u2019t properly cared for and it wasn\u2019t very good because of it.\nDon\u2019t stick to the old rules about which color wine goes with which food. Color is not as important as taste. There are some red wines, like certain pinot noirs, that taste great with fish.

And occasionally even entrepreneurs have car accidents. An auto accident attorney specializes in car accidents and represents victims who have been involved in them to make sure they get the highest compensation for their injuries and damages. \nAlthough minor accidents do not require a lawyer\u2019s intervention, car accidents caused by recklessness and drunk driving result in serious injuries, even fatalities, which means injured parties will require legal representation. Finding the right legal representation in such cases can be daunting. \nBecause the insurance company will be gearing up its lawyers, you need to hire an experienced lawyer to counter their offers. You need to make sure you get enough compensation for the damages caused. This means you have to find the best lawyer for the job. Here are some tips that will help you hire the best lawyer to represent you : Window Shop \nEven if you are in a hurry, do not hire the first attorney you come across or fall for an ambulance chaser. Instead, you need to take your time and check out different lawyers then come up with a list of potentials. You can start by asking your family and friends for references or check online for qualified lawyers. Once you have a list of potential lawyers, start researching each candidate before you contact them. Consider A Local Attorney \nAlthough hiring an attorney from another state might be tempting, look for a local lawyer instead. Local lawyers are well-versed in national and state transportation laws, making them ideal for the job. Another reason why you should choose locals is that they know their way around local courts of law. There are many types of car accidents; this means you need a lawyer who specializes in car accidents. Run Background Checks \nIn auto accident cases, you will probably have to go toe to toe with corporate insurance company attorneys. Such lawyers are known for trying to make you settle for a lesser amount than you deserve. They will look for inaptness in your lawyer and try to use it against you. \nIf you want to avoid getting less than you deserve because of an incompetent attorney, you should run background checks on potential lawyers. Make sure you look at customer testimonials and ratings before you sign any contract. Hiring experienced and reputable lawyers like Albany personal injury lawyers will allow you to have the upper hand, which means you will get the justice you deserve. Consider Professional Attorneys \nInstead of asking your family\u2019s corporate lawyer to handle your case, hire a person who specializes in car accidents. An auto accident lawyer spends his career learning the ropes of the industry, making him/her the best choice for your case. Experience and Legal Fees \nIn an auto accident case, your lawyer needs to have experience for you to win the case . Although some newbies know what they are doing, it is better to choose an experienced lawyer who has been practicing for years. Moreover, you need to discuss the legal fees with all potential candidates before selecting one. A good attorney will work on a contingency, which means you will only pay after winning the case. Interview the Candidates \nNo matter how good a lawyer\u2019s resume is, meet him or her in person for an interview. During the interview, you should ask all the important questions you want answers to and gauge the lawyer\u2019s knowledge. Meeting face to face will also help you figure out whether you are compatible \u2013 work with a person who makes you feel comfortable.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "albany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:20.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "37f1d0eaaf912500d810d2ea3570a45093b52d3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvz4a.GC4xHxQV75Ooxj5gni", "site_full": "forums.warframe.com", "site": "warframe.com", "site_section": "https://forums.warframe.com/forum/36-general-discussion/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "General Discussion - Warframe Forums", "title": "Umbra?", "title_full": "Umbra? - General Discussion - Warframe Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T15:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://content.invisioncic.com/Mwarframe/monthly_2017_07/warframe_share.png.bec3c989c4517e865df9b45a300e63e0.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7793, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b475903dcff01ccba4a2e871268feadaecc32a65", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvz4a.GC4xHxQXAxNo76jyJ3QNWYK1ESb1c-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "(PS4)s3d_sas", "published": "2017-12-07T15:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "9 minutes ago, WhiteWingCat said: umbra related", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://media.giphy.com/media/YPIrsRqqO7oB2/giphy.gif"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:20.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "37f1d0eaaf912500d810d2ea3570a45093b52d3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvz4a.GC4xHxQV75Ooxj5gni", "site_full": "forums.warframe.com", "site": "warframe.com", "site_section": "https://forums.warframe.com/forum/36-general-discussion/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "General Discussion - Warframe Forums", "title": "Umbra?", "title_full": "Umbra? - General Discussion - Warframe Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T15:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://content.invisioncic.com/Mwarframe/monthly_2017_07/warframe_share.png.bec3c989c4517e865df9b45a300e63e0.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7793, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e58c9ab2592d2ee19aaa6ee21120baeae7fc6112", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvz4a.GC4xHxQXAxNo76jyJ3a.ervoS09eQ-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Inquizitor", "published": "2017-12-07T15:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "All warframes, and their prime versions never had any other different stats in terms of \"abilities\" or passives (except the Void Orbs giving 250 energy thing)\nExcalibur Umbra Prime is pretty much just so non-founders will be able to have replacement of original Excalibur Prime.\nAll you can expect is regular Excalibur with a very slight stat difference.\nLike +10 armor, +10 base shields, +10 health, +15 base energy etc...
