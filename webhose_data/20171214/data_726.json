Your m92 w/brace is still a pistol and not a sbr, and our betters say a vertical grip on a pistol is a no-go.\nFrom the ATF website:\nATF has long held that by installing a vertical fore grip on a handgun, the handgun is no longer designed to be held and fired by the use of a single hand. Therefore, if individuals install a vertical fore grip on a handgun, they are \u201cmaking\u201d a firearm requiring registration with ATF\u2019s NFA Branch. Making an unregistered \u201cAOW\u201d is punishable by a fine and 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. Additionally, possession of an unregistered \u201cAOW\u201d is also punishable by fine and 10 years\u2019 imprisonment.\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong. Once the overall length of a pistol reaches 26 in. Its legal to have a vertical grip. ATF has a letter on it.\nThe question is does the brace count towards the overall length on an AK pistol? There is not a specific letter to anyone that I know of about an AK pistol. All I have seen have been AR's. But by definition its a pistol. AR pistol, AK pistol with braces are legal. So I would interpret as the same as an AR pistol.\nI have a feeling this is all going to,change next year. All these letters being wrote to the atf, they have to be catching on to what's going on.

Esotericism (X): Esotericism (\u0392')", "text": "Nikodemos \n\n1. What is esotericism?\n\nThe word comes from Greek, the adverb es\u014d \u2018inside, within\u2019. From this is generated the adjective es\u014dteriko \u2018inner, internal\u2019 and from this the English esoteric which then gives esoteric-ism \u2018study, subject, system, thinking connected with what-is-internal, not obvious\u2019.\n\nThis applies not just to anything but religion, psychology and philosophy. The esoteric aspect of a religion focuses on a teaching that is not immediately or directly apparent in the official and general setup of the particular religion. E.g in Christianity the official main doctrine is that one believes that Jesus Christ was the one and only Son of God and worships him and thereby obtains salvation; it helps if one applies the ethic taught by Jesus to love and forgive others, not to kill, or steal and the like.\n\nThe esoteric aspect of Christianity is that by applying rigorously Jesus\u2019 commandments and following certain practices of austerity like intensive prayer, fasting and the like, one rises mentally or psychologically to a higher level of consciousness, knowledge and being and acquires new out-of-the-ordinary powers like healing, telepathy etc.\n\n2. Philosophical schools/systems like Platonism or materialism and psychological ones like those of Freud of Jung do not strictly have an esoteric aspect but there is a large, non-academic thinking which is both philosophical and psychological, which is \u2018esoteric\u2019.\n\nAs with esoteric Christianity, this fairly broad study termed \u201cesotericism\u201d examines the possibility of man\u2019s rise in consciousness, knowledge and being and the manifestation of powers that are latent but not accessible in our usual state.\n\nIn higher states of consciousness (higher mind, knowledge and being) manifestations are much more frequent and lasting and can even be produced at will, if one has reached a very high state.\n\n3. These higher states and their powers are not things a man may acquire like implantations of teeth or kidneys or prosthetics of arms and legs.\n\nThese states are natural to man and latent within everyone. But to have them established permanently like the states of sleeping and being awake, the man must undergo a discipline and re-education in moral and spiritual values in a Group or School under the guidance of a teacher who has some knowledge about this having himself gone through such a discipline and received permission from his own teacher to teach.\n\nThe process can be long and at some points may seem difficult and painful as the aspirant begins to see several sides of his character that he does not like at all. He has no inner unity and consistency, no will and control over most functions; he lies to others and to himself about everything; his feelings change frequently, suddenly and intensely; his thoughts run on and on incessantly; he decides one thing only to change a few minutes later; and so on\u2026\n\n4. Here one should beware of pseudo-esoteric organizations. In our days they are legions and thousands of people flock to them allured by the promise of higher states and new powers. And because of this propensity to lying, people invent spiritual experiences, visions, communication with spirits and all sorts of self-delusions.\n\nOften, a man drops out of a school for various reasons and decides he will form his own \u201cschool\u201d and use whatever published material he can find. He deceives people, perhaps for very long, pretending he has esoteric knowledge and can do things. The more acute students soon see through the pretence, the others continue to be deceived and may even imagine that they \u201cdevelop\u201d and \u201cevolve\u201d into higher beings.\n\nSome start their enterprise for money, others for power, self-aggrandizement or self-glorification. They change the little knowledge they acquired and their imagination invents astonishing fantasies about superhuman beings and extraordinary paradisiac worlds.\n\nThe genuine aspirant will not be deceived for long. A genuine teaching would make him/her face useless habits of thinking and feeling and dissolve them; also and mainly face egoism and false notions about oneself thus leading to a truer and larger feeling of oneself.

Woods swung freely and with no sign of back pain at the Hero World Challenge, finishing tied for ninth in the 18-man exhibition which featured eight of the world's top 10 golfers. Mark Calcavecchia saw enough to know it would be foolish to write off the former world number one. \"His name is Tiger Woods after all. You don't just forget that he has won 14 majors and 79 (PGA Tour) tournaments,\" the former British Open winner told a conference call to promote the Diamond Resorts Invitational. \"I watched most of last week and I was very impressed with a lot of things. He's going at it full speed, he's certainly not holding back trying to protect what we all thought was still going to be a tender back.\" Following spinal fusion surgery and a lengthy layoff, Woods arrived at the Bahamas event ranked 1,199th but after posting a 31 on his opening nine holes, his odds to win the U.S. Masters in April dropped to 15-1, according to one Las Vegas bookmaker. In August, he had opened at 100-1 odds to win the year's first major. Calcavecchia said Woods, who remains four majors behind Jack Nicklaus's record of 18, would be well served to play in more events than usual to get into a groove. While Woods drove the ball as well as he had in a decade, he was rusty when it came to chipping, but that was no concern for twice U.S. Open winner Lee Janzen. \"Tiger Woods has a variable that is unmeasurable that you can never count him out,\" said Janzen. \"He always has in his pocket somewhere the ability to do something dramatic and to pull off the right shot at the right time. \"His putting looked really good. But if he regains that touch with chipping I would be surprised if he wasn't in contention in a major.\" Woods will turn 42 on Dec. 30 and the competition he faces from the game's younger players is deeper than in his prime. But just as Nicklaus came out of nowhere to win the 1986 Masters at the age of 46, Janzen felt the same could be in store for Woods. \"That is the biggest question, can he win a major now because he is playing against a bunch of Tiger clones, basically,\" he said. \"All these young guys are playing like he used to play and it isn't just one of them. \"So he has to beat the younger version of himself now and there's a handful of them, at least. \"But just like Jack Nicklaus, when they tried to write him off he showed everybody that he wasn't done yet.\" (Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Ian Ransom) 2017-12-07 11:43:49  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "janzen", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "calcavecchia", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "janzen tiger", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mark calcavecchia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicklaus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack nicklaus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woods", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank pingue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tiger woods", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee janzen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian ransom", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pingue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bahamas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:19.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e6b359050a1c7a9bcd6d41661811595f223da0ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTl96VBwqvpyHTnVEYIJsu9TTTMrlIlN0utfmBfSQfoSWDMmfMgnTwT", "site_full": "www.xossip.com", "site": "xossip.com", "site_section": "https://www.xossip.com/forumdisplay.php?f=69", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Requests - Xossip", "title": "Want full set of this..& if avalable the thread also..", "title_full": "Want full set of this..& if avalable the thread also.. - Xossip", "published": "2017-11-30T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4254, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19b6e3662f5b74b2abc37cbd932eeda72fd35738", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTl96VBwqvpyHTnVEYIJsu9TTTMrlIlN0utfmBfSQfoSf3tGozlntDTMBgxYGb94PE-", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "waand_ati", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "guys..pl if anyone has cluster of pics.. plzz post", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:19.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d6368002ad2e6e7db2611172a59f385fa38bce3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJ1kPWdq.bCTwb6wlnFOGQ3pemRS6msYQczR7in9gCaWJIn1GGixedkMjqlWNbnFVp_OLluQLo0ISmZGjyS0Kgj_vxwaK520M8NYq7ZkIQ5zpEQGUx2d3t0U6bSPGOiua9", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Supplies-All-Purpose-Cleaners/N-5yc1vZcb2p/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Simple Green 128 oz.

Or better yet, point me to the actual ATF letter that says an arm brace counts towards oal.\nThanks. They also measure with the flash hider or muzzle attachment removed, which means the least overall length that is possible with any removable parts gone from the gun.\nThe braces are easily removed by one (or two) screws, so measure from the muzzle of the gun (flash hider removed) to the rear of the buffer tube.\nFurther, nalioths example of measuring with stocks extended is inappropriate due to the fact that when measuring rifles, the buttstock is measured due to the fact that a rifle is a shoulder fired stock, whereas a pistol brace is not, and I do not think that same criteria applies.\nI believe with all non-essential parts removed (brace and flashider) should give you the correct overall length.\nNo, I don't have a letter saying so.

No way around it.\nOP, I don't pretend to know how ATF would look at OAL for a 92 where a stabilizing brace is concerned.\nI can go back and forth with reasons why it would, and a few why it wouldn't, but at the end of the day, my opinion isn't what matters even as much as I would like to help.\nStill, I hope you find your answer one way or another.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:19.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e0997eee7a49b47eb002c5e09a474fd8d76e2940", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSjijWRdDTVARXpZtwE36ThfQk6X3V0Qgw4mfmWnt5g4Q--", "site_full": "weheartit.com", "site": "weheartit.com", "site_section": "http://weheartit.com/tag/couples.rss", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "couples on we heart it", "title": "Image about love in couples by S2M on We Heart It", "title_full": "Image about love in couples by S2M on We Heart It", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://data.whicdn.com/images/302803969/large.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1473, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e0997eee7a49b47eb002c5e09a474fd8d76e2940", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSjijWRdDTVARXpZtwE36ThfQk6X3V0Qgw4mfmWnt5g4Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "Image about love in couples by S2M on We Heart It", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:20.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "62826ab57ee543076091a3c7c59e0439584d58e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Udh5pUJ8GH8pVbDffv2SgImkYPwT_hbMwXzoWdroSruav96XBWAHcNxotGLbCkjPpVx1VHB9vuryqsejgUin9_E", "site_full": "divirteteaprediendoen4.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://divirteteaprediendoen4.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1YA ESTAMOS EN PRIMERO!!!", "title": "FELIZ PUENTE", "title_full": "FELIZ PUENTE", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "62826ab57ee543076091a3c7c59e0439584d58e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Udh5pUJ8GH8pVbDffv2SgImkYPwT_hbMwXzoWdroSruav96XBWAHcNxotGLbCkjPpVx1VHB9vuryqsejgUin9_E", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "OLGA (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "FELIZ PUENTE", "text": "A DISFRUT R ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:20.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b8f4447dd7dd1db4eb88f5fb1ee55d28c7e46725", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodRXmGbHbqRP1SQUFKnnr35F60zvWIYljZNBQ6.PNDeq1Up05v_Jjz3OXc1AClxyw.J6pxuR_8ElL32UOvi241AffsUBNt3.Rzw--", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/politics/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Political Talk | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Cartoon: Conversation between Trump and Roy Moore | Page 2", "title_full": "Cartoon: Conversation between Trump and Roy Moore | Page 2 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T06:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3d87d75ed23cb5838e13def40b6bfa14dd413d68", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodRXmGbHbqRP1SQUFKnnr35F60zvWIYljZNBQ6.PNDeq1Up05v_Jjz3OXc1AClxyw.J6pxuR_8ElL32UOvi241Af.UihsTawiv_Zd26_Lw0ZB", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "bhtigerfan", "published": "2017-12-07T06:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: :\nDonald Trump is a charlatan and a dangerous one, and this will become abundantly clear as the rest of the campaign unfolds.

According to a new CareerBuilder survey, companies lost an average of $14,900 on every bad hire in the last year, and it's a common mistake \u2014 nearly three in four employers (74 percent) say they've hired the wrong person for a position. The survey was conducted online by Harris Poll from August 16 to September 15, 2017 and included a representative sample of 2,257 full-time hiring managers and human resource professionals and 3,697 full-time workers across industries and company sizes in the U.S. private sector. \"It's important to note that there's a ripple affect with bad hires. Disengagement is contagious \u2014 poor performers lower the bar for other workers on their teams, and their bad habits spread throughout the organization,\" said Rosemary Haefner , chief human resources officer at CareerBuilder. \"The best thing hiring managers can do is put in the time and effort on the front end to make sure they have the best available pool of applicants for every job opening. And, just as importantly, have good procedures in place for evaluating candidates.\" When asked how a bad hire affected their business in the last year, employers cited less productivity (37 percent), lost time to recruit and train another worker (32 percent) and compromised quality of work (31 percent). What Makes a Bad Hire How do you know if you've hired the wrong person? When asked what made them think they had made the wrong decision, employers who have made a bad hire said: While the candidate didn't have all the needed skills, thought they could learn quickly: 35 percent Candidate lied about his/her qualifications: 33 percent Took a chance on a nice person: 32 percent Pressured to fill the role quickly: 30 percent Had a hard time finding qualified candidates: 29 percent Focused on skills and not attitude: 29 percent Ignored some of the warning signs: 25 percent Lacked adequate tools to find the right person: 10 percent Didn't do a complete background check: 10 percent Didn't work close enough with HR: 7 percent Overall, this is how employers categorize someone as a bad hire: The worker didn't produce the proper quality of work: 54 percent The worker had a negative attitude: 53 percent The worker didn't work well with other workers: 50 percent The worker had immediate attendance problems: 46 percent The worker's skills did not match what they claimed to be able to do when hired: 45 percent Workers Have Regrets, Too Employers aren't the only ones making regretful decisions. Two in three workers (66 percent) say they have accepted a job and later realized it was a bad fit, and while half of these workers (50 percent) have quit within six months, more than a third (37 percent) have stuck it out. Workers who said they had taken a job only to realize it's a bad fit said they noticed their mistake based on toxic work culture (46 percent), boss' management style (40 percent), job didn't match what was described in the job listing and interviews (37 percent), and a lack of clear expectations around the role (33 percent). Don't Let the Good Ones Go While the cost of hiring the wrong person can be high, the cost of letting a good worker go is even higher. According to employers, the average cost of losing a good hire was $29,600 this year. And while 75 percent of workers say they're loyal to their current employer, much less (54 percent) say they feel their company is loyal to them, and nearly a third (31 percent) say they are likely to change jobs in the next year. Survey Methodology This survey was conducted online within the U.S. by Harris Poll on behalf of CareerBuilder among 2,257 hiring and human resource managers ages 18 and over (employed full-time, not self-employed, non-government) and 3,697 workers ages 18 and over (employed full-time, not self-employed, non-government) between August 16 and September 15, 2017 (percentages for some questions are based on a subset, based on their responses to certain questions). With a pure probability sample of 2,257 and 3,697, one could say with a 95 percent probability that the overall results have a sampling error of +/- 2.06 and +/- 1.61 percentage points, respectively. Sampling error for data from sub-samples is higher and varies.

It is the method of attachment which is utilized to determine if the muzzle device is permanently attached. In order to be considered as \u201cpermanently attached\u201d a muzzle device would have to be attached to a weapons barrel by means of welding, high-temperature (1100\u00ba F) silver soldering; or blind pinning.\nOverall length is measured from the end of the arm stabilizing brace to the end of the barrel, be sure that the weapon is level, a large framing square can help with this.\nIf a vertical forward grip is fitted and the stabilizing brace is needed to keep the pistols overall length at 26 inches or greater then the vertical forward grip must be removed before the stabilizing brace. If a vertical forward grip is placed on a pistol which is less than 26 inches in overall length an \u201cany other weapon\u201d (AOW) is created. Creating an AOW without first completing the proper NFA forms, paying the required 200.00 tax and receiving approval from the ATF NFA Branch is unlawful and would subject the violator to arrest and prosecution.\nQuote: from ATF letter:\nWe thank you for your inquiry and trust that the foregoing has been responsive to your evaluation request.\nMichael S Knapp Program Manager Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Firearms and Explosives Industry Division", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:20.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2df2c5b697267cba2dc38313a143cf99907a7097", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8vUdzJk69cXLbt6Og5ndAlgtfCJTNxg62rYaDUD89A9b0MkFR8J2RIusakRFLzEOg-", "site_full": "www.akfiles.com", "site": "akfiles.com", "site_section": "http://www.akfiles.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=2", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "General Discussion - The AK Files Forums", "title": "Does an arm brace count towards overall length?", "title_full": "Does an arm brace count towards overall length? - The AK Files Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T15:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 23, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 73634, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d8db3edf715001fcbfb935c4e2152282f055cdb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8vUdzJk69cXLbt6Og5ndAlgtfCJTNxg62rYaDUD89A9b0MkFR8J2RIDQLFP8o.c7jyFoLVoAcz29Bp1WiXwhxX", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "John A.", "published": "2017-12-06T16:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : I think it has to do with classification instead of OAL.

ECB monthly asset purchases are set to halve in January to 30 billion euros for nine months as the bank starts to unwind the extraordinary monetary stimulus launched in 2015 that has pulled down borrowing costs. The ECB will still suck up new euro zone bond supply, while the overall stock of ECB bond purchases will remain a powerful force keeping bond yields from rising too far. But analysts expect to see the first signs that the central bank's heavy influence in one of the world's biggest bond markets is starting to ebb as quantitative easing in the bloc enters its a fourth year. For the past three years, the weight of ECB buying has meant net bond issuance -- after central bank purchases -- has fallen as much as 400 billion euros, according to some estimates. That has created a shortage of bonds, pushing a large chunk of the market into negative yielding territory. \"This year, ECB buying is much bigger than net issuance, next year ECB buying is roughly in the same ball park as net issuance,\" said Seamus Mac Gorain, fixed income portfolio manager, JPMorgan Asset Management. ABN AMRO forecasts net issuance will nudge into positive territory for the first time since before the ECB embarked on quantitative easing. It estimates that net adjusted bond supply will up end up at 3 billion euros next year versus a decline of almost 300 billion euros this year. Even banks that believe ECB demand will still exceed the new supply see the mismatch reducing dramatically. DZ Bank said if new net purchases are discontinued at the turn of the year 2018/19, the net issuance volume adjusted for ECB purchases comes to minus 63 billion euros, having stood at minus 407 billion euros in the previous year. \"The eurozone government bond market will be supported significantly in 2018 as the ECB will virtually take away all of the new supply flow,\" said ABN AMRO senior fixed income strategist in Amsterdam Kim Liu. \"This comes on top of the already existing inventory on the ECB's balance sheet. However, this is still less favourable than in 2017.\" DIVERGENCE Bond strategists expect sharp divergences in the supply and impact of ECB bond buying to show up across the region. France and Italy were two countries in particular that were forecast to see supply outweigh ECB purchases next year. France, one of the first euro zone countries to provide details of its 2018 borrowing plans, said in September it would lift bond issuance next year as the state budget deficit and redemptions rise. It will issue 195 billion euros of medium and long-term debt next year net of buybacks, up from 185 billion euros this year. \"We estimate that net supply minus ECB bond buying will be 32 billion euros, the first positive figure since 2014,\" said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. In contrast, net supply in Germany and the Netherlands when ECB asset purchases are taken in to consideration, were expected to remain in negative territory. In the Netherlands, an economic recovery, additional cash flows from the sale of private assets had reduced the state's need to borrow money and means net bond supply is expected to be negative for a third straight year. Shrinking bond markets in these two \"core\" euro zone countries is a reason why ECB bond buying was expected to keep bond yields at relatively low levels. \"Relating our issuance estimates to the anticipated ECB purchase activities next year it becomes clear that the central bank's buying flow still remains an important factor, even after net monthly bond volumes will have halved,\" said Benjamin Schroeder, senior rates strategist at ING. More generally, overall euro zone debt supply was expected to fall given stronger economic growth and better public finances. Commerzbank, ING and ABN AMRO Bank expect debt sales to decline by 40-75 billion euros across the 19-member bloc in 2018.

1000 Wonders. I wanted to find a new way to share some fabulous quotations from reads old and new. The inspiration for this feature came from the character Pudge in John Green\u2019s Looking for Alaska . \n\nSummer and Brad are slated to get married but things go awry in Kissing Bridge! Brad\u2019s younger sister, snowboarding champion, Kacey Anderson is forced to come home to heal from a bad accident. After being told she can no longer compete she begins to train at her home while still missing her beloved Olympic gold medalist Brody Jenkins. Against doctor\u2019s orders she begins to regain her strength in the hopes of competing in the 2016 Olympics. When a young Climate Change activist enlists her help to bring awareness to the cause, Kacey begins to think that her future may be much different then she imagined.

Wins I\u2019ll Prove It to You \nIt is not uncommon to lose track of why you wanted to lose weight in the first place. The first few steps of your journey may have been easy, but you soon find yourself on rockier terrain. How can you gain inspiration from more motivated people around you? What are the habits of successful people?\n\nDo a bit of thinking about your goals first. Do you have an upcoming social function for which you want to look your best? Is there a certain number of pounds you want to lose? Are you aiming to increase the amount of energy you have? Do you need to lose weight to improve your health? Those are the questions you need to answer.\n\nKeeping track of the weight you are losing on a weekly basis is very important. Make a list of everything that you eat, no matter how small. Maintaining a daily journal will make you feel accountable for the things that you have eaten throughout the day. Keeping this diary will remind you to eat healthier and make better choices.\n\nIf you let yourself get hungry, you will begin to think with your tummy rather than your head. To avoid this problem, make sure you bring healthy and satisfying food with you wherever you may go, just in case. You can avoid eating out by packing your own lunch. When you prepare your own lunch, you can regulate your calorie intake and save yourself from ordering high-calorie restaurant meals. Because it normally costs less to bring your lunch than to dine out, you will most likely find that you are saving money while whittling your waistline.\n\nIf losing weight is really important to you, then you need to focus on both diet and activity. Pick an activity you love and include it as part of your exercise routine. Some activities that you may want to try include joining a dance class or sports team, or going for a walk, run or swim with a friend. Making this work for you requires a bit of creativity, but it\u2019s all worth it in the end when you meet your goals.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t bring foods into the house that you won\u2019t be able to eat. In the beginning, this might be difficult for you and all others in your household, but anything that is bad for you is bad for them as well. Pack your pantry and refrigerator with healthy food choices instead of junk. However, this doesn\u2019t mean you have to suffer from a lack of snack foods. Both adults and kids will benefit from eating fruit. Granola is another healthy snack you can enjoy while on a diet.\n\nReach out to your family and friends. Your true friends will be glad to answer. Make sure that you have a support system of people who will cheer you on when things get tough. Your friends can be there to motivate you when you really need it. Don\u2019t be afraid to turn to your friends when you\u2019re having a bad day.\n\nClick To Learn The Full Story ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:20.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b8f4447dd7dd1db4eb88f5fb1ee55d28c7e46725", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodRXmGbHbqRP1SQUFKnnr35F60zvWIYljZNBQ6.PNDeq1Up05v_Jjz3OXc1AClxyw.J6pxuR_8ElL32UOvi241AffsUBNt3.Rzw--", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/politics/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Political Talk | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Cartoon: Conversation between Trump and Roy Moore | Page 2", "title_full": "Cartoon: Conversation between Trump and Roy Moore | Page 2 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T06:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a5f414209865de6ff5f19516298e7093eb5c02f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodRXmGbHbqRP1SQUFKnnr35F60zvWIYljZNBQ6.PNDeq1Up05v_Jjz3OXc1AClxyw.J6pxuR_8ElL32UOvi241Af.UihsTawiv1pzl.owDJWQ", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "Dead End", "published": "2017-12-07T07:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "No wonder you homos lost the MEME War.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:20.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b8f4447dd7dd1db4eb88f5fb1ee55d28c7e46725", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodRXmGbHbqRP1SQUFKnnr35F60zvWIYljZNBQ6.PNDeq1Up05v_Jjz3OXc1AClxyw.J6pxuR_8ElL32UOvi241AffsUBNt3.Rzw--", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/politics/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Political Talk | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Cartoon: Conversation between Trump and Roy Moore | Page 2", "title_full": "Cartoon: Conversation between Trump and Roy Moore | Page 2 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T06:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e08cf6ead421b7f58ac42970bc26475fc22b218", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodRXmGbHbqRP1SQUFKnnr35F60zvWIYljZNBQ6.PNDeq1Up05v_Jjz3OXc1AClxyw.J6pxuR_8ElL32UOvi241Af.UihsTawiv8.FnUNqdiJ2", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "FT", "published": "2017-12-07T10:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: :\nAnthony Wiener, John Conyers and Al Franken walk into a bar...

The duo are at the forefront of the influence of Korean fashion in Singapore and we jumped at the chance to fire them a couple of questions on what they do and their favorite Korean street style brands. Interview Grace Khong, Photos Elissa Wong First things first, tell us about yourselves: We are KENNY LIM and ANDREW LOH, ex-advertising writer and art director respectively. We started DEPRESSION , a street-goth label in Singapore back in 2006 and opened our multi-label store \u2014 SECTS SHOP SINGAPORE (#SSS) in 2014. Next would be the launch of our sub-line \u201cMAKE NOISE NOT WAR\u201d ( @makenoise.notwar ) at the end of this year. What is SECTS SHOP? SECTS SHOP SINGAPORE is a men\u2019s streetwear multi label store, carrying things that we like. That\u2019s pretty much how we do things, but we do have a soft spot for Korean street fashion and labels that are anchored on subcultures like Goth, Punk, K-Pop, and Skater. We also like things that make you look fierce and mean, like a street warlord of sorts that you don\u2019t want to mess with. Have people questioned your brand name? Definitely. Well, naming is something we feel very strongly about and think is VERY important. We enjoy conceptualizing and creating new identities. It\u2019s important that the name we choose gets a reaction out of people. People either get it, or they don\u2019t. SECTS SHOP is about collecting subculture fashion. Hence, SECTS represents different sections of fashion. There is the goth section, the retro section etc. Of course, it was deliberately made to sound like sex so it\u2019ll be fun when you\u2019re asking for directions to the store. Why Korean streetstyle? We admire Kpop, and we admire the K-Fashion eco-system. We like Korean street style because it\u2019s LOUD and YOUNG. That\u2019s exactly the style we like \u2014 nothing to be shy about, just bold fashion from the streets. Other cultures of street fashion tend to be more subtle and simple. Also, we only carry emerging labels, rather than the obviously hyped ones. And in Seoul, there are many up and coming labels waiting to be discovered. MORE THAN DOPE , D-ANTIDOTE and OY Korea are some of your latest additions. Do you look out for brands that you feel will be easily accepted among Singaporeans, or simply brands that you like? Seoul Fashion Week is the cool alternative to the big four fashion weeks of the West. This is why it really appeals to us. And since our shop specializes in emerging Korean brands, we enjoy returning every season to discover new labels. Currently we stock Drink Beer Save Water, YOUSER, MORE THAN DOPE, Chaos From Undermind, DbyD, Heta, OY, Master Number, Unplugged Museum, D-ANTIDOTE, 14 Studio, Antimatter and more. Among our current brands list, D-ANTIDOTE and MAXXIJ are the sickest, and they\u2019ve both taken the current retro sportswear trend to the next level. Overall, as a progressive select shop and designers ourselves, we feel that it\u2019s our responsibility to spot and introduce trends and brands to the Singapore audience. We shouldn\u2019t have to wait for a trend/brand to become famous before we bring it to Singapore. In fact as a fashion insider, we should be the first ones to introduce the latest to our market, and hence, play a part in educating the consumers about fashion and the subcultures. So I hear there\u2019s a collaboration happening with YOUSER ... \nYOUSERhas approached us to create a YOUSER X SECTS t-shirt for their SS18 collection. It will be exclusively available at our store. What other brands do you wish to work with in future? Korean brands on our radar include CHARM\u2019S, Baroque and Dozoh . Outside of Korea, we would be happy to collaborate with FILA, Kappa or Jansport. What do you think is the future of Korean fashion and Korean streetstyle in Singapore? Korean street fashion is considered new and niche in Singapore. However, there is an increasing influence from the K-Wave as a whole, and more stores are beginning to introduce Korean brands to Singapore. The rise of Korean celebrities with international appeal is a major factor for the popularity of brands such as Gentle Monster (which recently opened a big store in Singapore), Charm\u2019s and Andersson Bell among others. Now, for Korean street fashion, the only way is up.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "grace khong",

Rockwell 5 inch Random Orbit Sander with Vibrafree CHARLOTTE, N.C. (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 Rockwell\u2019s new 5-inch Random Orbit Sander with Vibrafree and 20V brushless Sonicrafter are tools that continue to bring joy long after the holiday season is over. Skip the tie, sweater and slippers and give tool gifts that provide solutions to jobs throughout the house and beyond. The Rockwell 5 inch Random Orbit Sander with Vibrafree technology makes a big difference when it comes to reducing vibration. In fact, the Vibrafree sander features up to 50 percent less vibration than other leading-brand sanders. Unlike conventional random orbit sanders with a single sanding disc, Vibrafree employs an inner and outer disc that move in opposite directions of one another to cancel vibration. Vibration is redirected into sanding, and not the operator\u2019s hand. As a result, there\u2019s greater productivity, due to the sander\u2019s rapid removal rate. Dust removal capability is up to 50 percent greater than that of conventional sanders with cloth dust bags. Vibrafree\u2019s bag-less, filter-less Cyclonic Dust/Air Separator system\u2019s air flow design separates dust from the air, while maintaining constant suction. This cyclonic action eliminates clogs. The dust box has a pushbutton release for easy emptying. Random orbit sanders are handy in the workshop. Their speed and aggressive action is like a belt sander. The sanding disc moves in small ellipses to help produce smooth, swirl-free finishes. The variable-speed 5-inch diameter random orbit sander is powered by a 3.3 amp motor that delivers 6000 to 13,500 orbits-per-minute (no load speed) for fast and smooth material removal. The 3.3 lb. sander\u2019s ergonomically designed, elongated palm grip handle features a comfortable rubber overmold grip for optimum balance and control. Its on/off rocker switch is conveniently located and sealed for long life. Included with the sander and the dust box is a 15-pc. accessory set, including 5 pcs. each of 60,120 and 180 grit hook-and- loop sandpaper. Other features include a 7-ft. power cord and carrying bag. The Rockwell 5 inch Random Orbit Sander with Vibrafree technology (RK4248K, $69.99) is available at rockwelltools.com, Menards, and online at Walmart and Amazon. The Vibrafree sander is covered by Rockwell 3 year warranty. One of the most versatile power tools is an oscillating multi-tool. This compact workhorse can cut, grind, sand, polish and hone just by swapping out accessories. Oscillating tools can handle a myriad of jobs and projects around the house and shop to save time, energy and money. The latest oscillating tool from Rockwell is the 20V Brushless Sonicrafter. It\u2019s Rockwell\u2019s first brushless oscillating tool, and it features a 20 year warranty with free batteries for 20 years, once the tool is registered. When an independent lab tested the 20V Brushless Sonicrafter against a leading competitor, it achieved 20 percent more cuts-per-charge in HDF boards, and 35 percent more cuts in 1 in. oak dowels. The multi-tool features a 4\u00ba oscillating angle. Most tools in this category have 3.2\u00ba oscillating angles. The advantage of a wider oscillating angle is its enhance cutting capacity by making quicker cuts. Rockwell pioneered Universal Fit, the industry\u2019s first true universal accessory system, which enabled Sonicrafters to accept other major brands\u2019 accessories without adapters. Rockwell\u2019s universal accessories are manufactured to fit all other competitive oscillating tools as well. The 20V brushless Sonicrafter also features Hyperlock, a tool-less blade change system that eliminates blade slippage by providing one ton of clamping force. The Rockwell\u2019s 20V Sonicrafter\u2019s brushless motor features up to 10 times the motor life and 25 percent more power than a comparable, conventional brushed motor. Highly magnetic rare earth metals increase power output. Plus, battery run time increases by up to 50 percent per charge versus standard brushed motors. The brushless motor features computer-controlled power distribution, which improves motor efficiency and durability by reducing heat, friction, noise and wear. The 20V brushless Sonicrafter has a tapered, compact body powered by a 20V 2.0 Ah MAX battery. The tool\u2019s variable speed brushless motor has a no-load speed of 8,000 to 18,000 oscillations-per-minute (opm). The 3.1 lb. (with battery) multi-tool has a full metal head and also features constant speed control, which electronically maintains speed-of-cut under load. Plus, an integrated LED light helps illuminates the work area. The 20V brushless Sonicrafter includes an 8-pc. accessory kit, one 20V 2.0 Ah MAX battery, one hour charger and carrying bag.

This\ndate is believed to be the starting point of the Cuban missile crisis, a\nstandoff between the United States and the Soviet Union, which nearly \nturned the Cold War into an open confrontation.\nOne year before the \ncrisis broke out the US deployed 15 Jupiter mid-range ballistic missiles\nnear Izmir, Turkey, which were capable of destroying Moscow and other \nmajor cities in the European part of the USSR just within 10 minutes. \nWashington believed that the move would make Moscow incapable of a \nfull-scale retaliation strike in case of war.\nFor the first time, \ndeployment of Soviet ballistic missiles and troops to Cuba was proposed \nby Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev on May 20, 1962 during his meeting \nwith Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, Defense Minister Rodion Malinovsky\nand Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan.\nBy that time, the global standoff between Moscow and Washington had reached its peak. \nThe\nSoviet Union could not compete with the US in the number of \nintercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). The US had 144 SM-65 Atlas \nmissiles and some 60 SM-68 Titan missiles. Moreover, 40 Jupiter missiles\nwith a range of 2,400 kilometers were deployed in Italy and 60 PGM-17 \nThor missiles with similar capabilities were stationed in Britain.\nThe\nSoviet Union at the time had only 70 R-7 ICBMs, but only up to 25 of \nthem could be launched simultaneously. Moscow also had 700 mid-range \nballistic missiles, but they could not be deployed close to American \nterritory.\n.\nFAIR USE NOTICE: This video contains copyrighted \nmaterial the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by\nthe copyright owner.

And does standing against the people seem to them to be their job? Is it their job to take away the tax breaks working families depend upon (state and local tax deductions, property tax deductions, etc.) in order to shower upon big corporations and wealthy inheritors unearned and unneeded tax breaks? Is it their job to force cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security because of the massive deficits their tax \"reform\" plan creates? Is it their job to refuse to face the people in townhalls over their tax \"reform\" plan? They may not know what their job is, but we know what our job is. \nIn a related note, the Fairness Project helps you tell your Congressfolk to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP . You may want to follow up with a phone call, in which you add that you want clean CHIP reauthorization, without poison pill amendments or hostage crises. CHIP's funding authorization lapsed on September 30, since the Senate was too busy trying to take health care away from at least 20 million Americans; the House has passed a CHIP reauthorization bill since then, but one larded with poison pills. Lately, Sen. Hatch (R-UT) has opined that though he'd love to get CHIP reauthorized, he's sick and tired of all these people demanding that government do everything for them, or something. Funny that he'd indulge in that critique when discussing children's health insurance, a matter that children can literally do nothing about . Unless Mr. Hatch wants them all to work factory jobs! And for him to go on about \"spending and spending\" when he literally blew open a trillion-dollar hole in the national debt is just icing on the cake. Might shame finally descend upon these politicians? Or must we wait for a Doug Jones victory in Alabama that's far from a sure thing? \nFinally, if you've missed previous opportunities to tell President Trump to abandon his plan of opening up the Grand Canyon area to uranium mining corporations , then Environmental Action helps you do that. If you wanted to sum up the problem here in seven words, here they are: uranium mining pollutes water that people drink. Specifically, uranium mining in the Grand Canyon area would pollute the drinking water of the Colorado River, which serves five U.S. states and two Mexican states and which, quite frankly, gets a little shallower every year, not just from corporations and people using more and more water, but also from climate change drying out the land. But you know how the unregenerate mammon-worshiper Donald Trump thinks: if some executive can make money, then screw everything and everyone else. And this is not about \"creating jobs\" for miners, because corporate executives won't create jobs for anyone unless one of two things happen: demand rises, or we make them . Sadly, in this age, the latter has to precede the former. Uranium mining is, for the Trump Administration, all about making mining executives richer, and nothing else.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "environmental action", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "children's health insurance program", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "grand canyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:23.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "868e40f71685bd6596bbc655e7b0b756cdf85f00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWrX.FoZpwUjqk9.rzIJzti0o0g0JidHPfFEkRARaROhlflyeDkrO2nCWVyct1xFtMSEsWSOtlVILBGTzb1MfAzzI4AjgHAwCz4fYdEjfKjQt6PUAi2vpffbumk6oO4LOR06esCPk_nyoMlOo_PWkuTCg9Z_urufTDGeHan5M7uuU-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-women-tote-bags/?spm=a2o4k.category-090103000000.0.0.SaY8qG", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Women's Tote Bags - Buy Women's Tote Bags at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "2 in 1 New Bucket Design Fashion Girl Women Shoulder Handbag Tote Bag (Black)", "title_full": "2 in 1 New Bucket Design Fashion Girl Women Shoulder Handbag Tote Bag (Black) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-04-03T13:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f36bbec3aee7853e132802cedc4c81c6671859db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWrX.FoZpwUjqk9.rzIJzti0o0g0JidHPfFEkRARaROhlflyeDkrO2nCWVyct1xFtMSEsWSOtlVILBGTzb1MfAzzI4AjgHAwCz4fYdEjfKjQt6PUAi2vpffbumk6oO4LOR06esCPk_nyoMlOo_PWkuTCg9Z_urufTDyEHWr1iVNz_gHVomSrgLfQ--", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "nur hasyahida", "published": "2017-11-29T13:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "The best ever product", "text": "I was mistaken about the postage at first but now i know that the product arrive on time and at a good quality.

Development of the rubber industry is ascribed to factors such as spatial distribution of resources, technological sophistication in manufacturing, and introduction of wide range of industrially focused products. The manufacture of rubber products can be divided into tire manufacturing and non-tire manufacturing. The non-tire manufacturing segment produces sophisticated and high technology products by molding the uncured rubber, while tire manufacturing segment comprises automotive tire production. \nRubber molding can be defined as the process wherein uncured rubber, usually with inserts of textile, metal, or plastics is cured under high pressure in a mold of desired shape. Most automotive rubber components are manufactured through the molding processes. Generally, three types of rubber molding processes are used: compression, injection, and transfer molding. Under the compression molding process, the uncured rubber is placed in a mold with the sample under pressure for vulcanization. After vulcanization, cavity pressure is applied to the slightly overfilled mold. It is then held closely in a hydraulic press under heated environment to design the shape of the rubber. Injection molding is a semi-continuous process. Piston system and an extruder are combined with heat suppliers in a rubber reservoir, wherein curing of the rubber is done and piston system continuously extrudes the molded rubber out after undergoing all the process. Some basic instructions, such as optimization of the compounds before curing and pressure maintenance of the mold, should be followed during the injection rubber molding process. \nRequest Report Brochure @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=22214 \nThe automotive rubber molded components market is expanding globally due to rapid industrialization and globalization and introduction of the latest and cost efficient technologies. The global automotive rubber molded components market is projected to generate revenue of more than US$75 Mn by the end of 2017. Recent growing demand for environmental friendly, and fuel efficient vehicles is driving the market for automotive rubber molded components. Many chemical companies are coming up with better molding processes for the automotive rubber molded components manufacturing and it is expected to generate the annual revenue of more than USD 50 billion by the end of 2022. Technological breakthroughs such as development of environmentally-friendly rubber parts using vegetable soy oil, and the use of EPDM rubber are boosting the market for automotive rubber molded components. Furthermore, implementation of stringent automotive emissions norms has compelled the automotive sector to produce more efficient vehicles with lower carbon emissions. This is expected to significantly augment the market for lightweight automotive materials made from rubber-molded components. EPDM rubber molds are more durable vis-\u00e0-vis the conventional molded rubber parts. They can also withstand high pressure conditions and offer excellent impact resistance and stiffness. This is likely to encourage automakers to adopt EPDM-based molded rubber components. Molded rubber components can significantly reduce the weight of the automotive product and also provide help in reduction of vibrations. Shortage of advanced raw materials in emerging economies and fluctuation in prices of raw materials are the major restraints of the automotive rubber molded components market. \nRequest For Customization@ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=CR&rep_id=22214 \nAB SKF, Continental AG, Cooper-Standard Automotive, DANA Holding s Corporation, and NOK Corporation are the key players operating in the global automotive rubber molded components market. Improvements in the EPA regulations and CAFE standards in The U.S. are also projected to boost the help automotive industry.
