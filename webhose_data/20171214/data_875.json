The event alternates every year between cars and trucks. This year's Mercedes-Benz Global TechMasters Truck focused on the titles 'Best Service Team' and 'Best Performance in Job Profile'. \n60 participants in twelve teams from twelve countries \nThe national heats in June of this year resulted in the qualification of twelve teams from twelve different countries. And so the grand final of the TechMaster World Championship in Stuttgart saw 60 participants aged between 22 and 57 go head-to-head. At the Global Training Centre, the competitors were required to take a theory test, which was specifically tailored to each job profile, as well as a practical test on the vehicle or in a customer role play. Points were awarded, among other things, for identifying faults in vehicles or for professional customer advice. Further points were on offer for the correct use of, for example, the diagnostic tester or of systems as well as for complying with Mercedes-Benz standards. Finally, teamwork also played a role in the scoring. In addition, there were individual tests in the job profiles selected for the competition: service adviser, maintenance technician, diagnostic technician as well as parts/accessories salesperson. \nThe one-hour theory test examined the competitors' commercial and technical knowledge. In the 90-minute practical test, on the other hand, the participants in the various job profiles were called upon either to carry out maintenance and diagnostic tasks on a truck or to master everyday situations in simulated conversations with customers. To be able to compare the performances of all the competitors at the end, the questions and requirements were adapted beforehand to the current product/service portfolio in the individual markets. \nPresentation of prizes at the 'Award Evening' \nThe three-day event came to a close with the 'Award Evening', on which the winners of Global TechMaster Truck 2017 were named. Alexander Willhardt, Head of Customer Services & Parts MB Trucks, presented the trophies together with Till Oberwoerder, Head of Head of Marketing, Sales and Services MB Trucks, to the winners: 'All in all, it was an exciting competition, and at the end of the day the team from Italy topped the overall ranking to take the title of Mercedes-Benz Service World Champions.' The teams from Austria and Germany finished second and third. The winners in the individual job profiles were also delighted and proud of their victory. In addition to the competition, Global TechMasters 2017 focused on two things in particular: the training of after-sales staff and an exchange with experts from all over the world, for which the supporting programme of the three-day event offered a host of opportunities. Hence, the participants paid visits to, among others, the Mercedes-Benz plant in W\u00f6rth and the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart. \nDaimler AG published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 10:06:09 UTC . \nOriginal document http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Global-TechMasters-Truck-2017-Good-service-pays-off.xhtml?oid=32272111&ls=L2VuL2luc3RhbmNlL2tvLnhodG1sP29pZD00ODM2MjU4JnJlbElkPTYwODI5JmZyb21PaWQ9NDgzNjI1OCZib3JkZXJzPXRydWUmcmVzdWx0SW5mb1R5cGVJZD00MDYyNiZ2aWV3VHlwZT10aHVtYnM!&rs=0 \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/E2DFB17EFC10FF1969936B0F39DC81D4F8443869", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexander willhardt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "head of customer services & parts mb trucks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "head of head of marketing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercedes-benz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercedes-benz museum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sales and services mb trucks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercedes-benz global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daimler ag", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "stuttgart-vaihingen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global training centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuttgart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "w\u00f6rth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:08.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "55eeee6f08bdb8a64859b430472ec5b6a1ece5df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSI2dkqnAXwE7VpppOlxOjG5DVIqOGV42_zCMn7lQTnu6yjYNBSG3mGbVYJ0QHmZCaBYtySh6MxSOvJHw9YlvWtg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Qtum Official subreddit", "title": "Why is QTUM falling so hard ?", "title_full": "Why is QTUM falling so hard ? : Qtum", "published": "2017-12-07T11:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "edd347b3ba050963b6f1caeea952053f70dcd289", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSI2dkqnAXwE7VpppOlxOjG5DVIqOGV42_zCMn7lQTnu6yjYNBSG3mGbVYJ0QHmZCaBYtySh6MxSM6GMQxZCve_XLEKjJuE93c00KDy8FHP1s-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "iioottaa", "published": "2017-12-07T15:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "lol man, ok yeah it's falling .. sucks for us holders, but it's just not the flavour at the moment that's all.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:08.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "04459bceee6055a0b70ccde01a1b10de3fe58560", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXMSd2yHTQiO6QUSClJobCFqQ1deYbWTZvKXhmS785V7lKY4CYq5SjUHHV3sD8FMW9SBYnh23wfZSb_rlbWbS6gneShqEeazzwGSRs6R0yqZoyQcx1NLOnIs", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g150768-i6-Mexico.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Mexico Forum, Travel Discussion for Mexico - TripAdvisor", "title": "Chiapas trip/travel agencies - Southern Mexico", "title_full": "Chiapas trip/travel agencies - Southern Mexico Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-07T07:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1378bd3320953171d5e0ef3122a26e2c76c2f121", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXMSd2yHTQiO6QUSClJobCFqQ1deYbWTZvKXhmS785V7lKY4CYq5SjUHHV3sD8FMW9SBYnh23wfZSb_rlbWbS6gneShqEeazzwGSRs6R0yqZo7M94sTEzMxf.Mz5jdfph84-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "ParisTravelDreamer", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "@Londinense and @PacificNWFamily Thank you for your response, will definitely be posting in the Chiapas forum.

Electrical Safety First, who conducted a series of safety tests on fake iPhone chargers purchased in the UK, found that 98 per cent of the chargers tested could cause a fire or deliver a lethal electric shock. Of the 50 brands tested, all but one failed one or more of the tests and more than one in three chargers failed every part of the safety screening - a worrying prospect for anyone who has purchased a replacement charger online. In some cases the chargers came from sellers who claimed they were genuine Apple products. It is not the first survey  of its kind to yield such concerning results. The US consumer product safety organisation, Underwriters Laboratory tested 400 counterfeit and lookalike Apple chargers last year and found a 99 per cent failure rate. E lectrical Safety First also tested 14 EU chargers as part of this research.  All 14 failed all of the safety tests in every respect. \u201cIt is extremely concerning that 49 out of 50 UK chargers we tested failed basic safety checks,\u201d said Martyn Allen, technical director at Electrical Safety First. \u201cAnyone purchasing an iPhone charger from an online marketplace or at an independent discount store is taking a serious risk with their safety. \u201cThe majority of chargers we tested had the potential to deliver a lethal electrical shock or cause a fire.\u201d Apple has introduced wireless charging  on the latest versions of its smartphone, the  premium iPhone X  and the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus models.  It has not brought out its own branded charging pad yet, although several third-party chargers exist.

He has held a position in Tencent, the Chinese gaming and messaging company since 2007 when the stock traded at $0.77 a share. Recently Tencent was trading down 1.79% or $0.86 to $47.16. For the year, shares are up close to 90%. Meanwhile, Alibaba, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, has a stock that is up 85% this year. Recently shares were trading 1.9% higher or $3.24 to $172.20. Those stock price surges have boosted Leverenz\u2019s fund, which Bloomberg said has had 31% returns this year and is on track to have its best 12-month period in eight years. \u201cThese companies have the capacity to go global and change the world,\u201d Leverenz said in an interview with Bloomberg this week. (See more: Alibaba Group Sells $7B Worth of Dollar Bonds .) Extended Reach \nIn the case of Tencent, Leverenz thinks the company will gain market share in electronic payments and advertising, two areas where it has lagged behind Alibaba, which should boost its stock price. The company can also make money investing in companies for a minority stake. In November, Tencent disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it purchased 145.8 million non-voting shares of Snap Inc. ( SNAP ), the maker of the messaging app Snapchat, during the last quarter that ended in September, giving it a 10% stake. Last weekhe Wall Street Journal reported that the company's Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Spotify, the U.K. streaming music service company, are in talks to swap stakes in each other\u2019s companies ahead of potential initial public offerings by the two in 2018. (See also: Tencent Music, Spotify in Talks Ahead of IPOs .) \nAs for Alibaba, the fund manager said it can expand its digital payments, media and retail businesses in China, which should help it grow even more.

It is a vital component for managing Internet connections and other related network functions. Also, computers in a network communicate with each other with the help of Ethernet controller. It decodes the data received from the Internet cable into a form which could be easily recognized by the computer. Ethernet controller reviews each packet of data and determines whether the data is required for local computer or any other computer on the network. If the information is meant for local computer it will be accepted and information meant for other computers will be discarded. Most of the new generation computers have built in Ethernet controllers; however, older versions of computer used network interface cards having an Ethernet controller chip. Software drivers are used in order to manage the Ethernet controllers. Read Report Overview @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/ethernet-controller-market.html Increased penetration of Internet and related services worldwide has resulted in rising demand for Ethernet controllers used in devices such as personal computers and laptops. Also, failure of Ethernet controllers results in loss of Internet connection and instead of buying a new device, customers prefer to replace the controller due to the low cost. USB Ethernet controllers provide mobility and in case of failure new USB controller could be easily installed by simply plugging the device in the computer or laptop. USB capability has increased the overall popularity of Ethernet controllers due to the ease of use and portability. Ethernet controller also performs an important function of receiving and transmitting data related to bidirectional data bus used for data transfer within microprocessor and memory input or output devices. Ethernet controllers obtain the IP address from dynamic host control protocol (DHCP) server. It helps in sending the right information to their respective destinations. Integration of Ethernet controller with the microcontrollers is expected to drive the demand for Ethernet controller market. Microcontrollers are small computers on a single integrated circuit, it contains input/output peripherals, processor core and memory. Products such as telephones, automobiles and other home appliances use microcontrollers for control purpose. As the requirements for microcontroller increases, the Ethernet controllers used in these microcontrollers are also experiencing growing demand. New gigabit Ethernet controllers are helping to reduce the cost related to supporting components such as crystals and bridge chips. Also, these controllers provide full integration and interface capabilities with media access control (MAC) and physical-layer (PHY). However, the Ethernet controllers depend on the specifications of systems for stable performance. Whether the controller supports the current Mach version or other functionalities such as threading must be checked. Ethernet controllers are managed through the software drivers installed in the computer. New and advanced drivers of Ethernet controllers are providing enhanced functionality such as the ability to communicate from the computer to any specific device. These advanced software applications are expected to provide tremendous growth opportunities for the Ethernet controller market. Major players in the Ethernet controller market include Renesas Electronics Corporation, Intel Corporation, OMRON Corporation, Cirrus Logic Inc., Silicon Laboratories, Inc., Microchip Technology Inc., Mindspeed Technologies, Inc., Broadcom Ltd. and Siemens AG.

The sales charge is paid to a financial intermediary (broker, financial planner , investment adviser, distributor, etc.). Sales charges are expressed as a percentage of the investment value. BREAKING DOWN 'Sales Charge' \nSales charges are required by many mutual funds. Sales charges are quoted in percentages and equate to a percentage of the investment. Therefore, for an investor, their actual investment in the fund is equal to the difference between the investment value per share and the total sales charge. By regulation, the maximum permitted sales charge is 8.5%, but most loads fall within a 3% to 6% range. \nInvestors can incur various types of sales charges which are often associated with specific share classes of a fund. Sales charges are commission charges paid to financial intermediaries for their partnership in selling the fund. Sales charges are not paid to the fund itself and therefore are not factored into the gross and net expense ratio of a fund. \nSome common types of sales charges include the following: \nFront end \u2013 A front end sales charge is paid as a percentage of the purchase price at the time of the investment. Class A shares often have front end sales charges. \nBack end \u2013 A back end sales charge is paid as a percentage of the selling price. Back end sales charges are often associated with Class B shares of a fund. \nDeferred \u2013 A deferred sales charge is typically a back end sales charge that is often charged during a specific timeframe with a decreasing rate over time. \nFor example, assume an investor invests $10,000 in a mutual fund with a front-end load of 5.75%. The investor\u2019s actual investment in the fund after the sales charge would be $9,425. Sales Charges with Investment Funds \nSales charges can vary across different types of funds and shares classes. Many funds may not require sales charges due to distributor relationships. Investors should ensure they clearly understand the sales charges and fees associated with a fund. Fund companies typically provide comprehensive disclosure on their sales charges. Sales charges are also usually discussed in a fund\u2019s prospectus. \nFranklin Templeton for examples provides a comprehensive report on the fund company\u2019s sales charges by share class: Franklin Templeton Sales Charges and Breakpoints . The company has tiered sales charges by purchase size. Sales charges vary based on share class and fund category. \nTo read more about fund fees and sales charges see also A Guide to Investor Fees and Mutual Fund Classes, Sales Charges and Expenses .

A new commodity index even offers data on the going rates for greenhouse and field-grown weed.\nGertner still gets surprised reactions to his career change, as when his mother asked: \u0093Can\u0092t you just get another job at Google?\u0094\nAnd yet he\u0092s raised $10 million in capital in ten months as the chief executive of Toyko Smoke, despite the continuing taboos and legal risks in the industry.\nThe legal cannabis market, currently worth about $8 billion, is predicted to triple in size to $22.6 billion in total annual sales by 2021, according to cannabis industry tracker, Arcview Market Research. That could make it bigger than the America\u0092s most profitable sports organization, the National Football League, which saw about $13 billion in revenue last year and aims to reach $25 billion by 2027.\nSo far in 2017, there have been at least 27 investments by venture capital funds in cannabis companies, compared with just 10 deals in 2016 and 9 deals in 2015, according to venture capital data provider CB Insights.\nThe influx of capital helps finance the paychecks of 150,000 workers in the legal U.S. pot industry, representing job growth of 20 percent from a year ago, according to an estimate from the cannabis website Leafly, a marketing firm for dispensaries and other cannabis firms.\nEric Eslao, founder of Defonce Chocolatier - which makes artisanal cannabis-infused chocolates costing $20 a bar - was a senior production manager at Apple just over a year ago. He feared the stigma of joining the weed industry, but it didn\u0092t stop him.\n\u0093The opportunity was too good not to make the jump,\u0094 he said.\nLEGAL RISKS, CHALLENGES\nThirty states have legalized marijuana for recreational or medical use, but possession and sale is still banned at the federal level.\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has sent mixed signals on its enforcement policy. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has vowed to crack down on the pot trade in states with legalization laws, but Trump has extended a ban on using federal funds to interfere with the industry through the end of this year.\nAmericans increasingly support marijuana legalization, according to the Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. The number of adults who believe it \u0093should be legal\u0094 to possess small amounts of marijuana rose to 54 percent in a poll conducted between Oct. 27 and Nov. 10, up from 41 percent in a similar poll in 2012.\nStill, the specter of federal enforcement makes it difficult for cannabis-related firms to get banking services. Many continue to deal in cash or pay hefty fees for accounts.\nThe banks that work with cannabis-related firms are mostly community institutions in states where the industry is legalized, and their service is limited to accepting cash deposits.\nCannabis investment is still dominated by wealthy individuals, but that is changing as the industry grows, attracting venture capitalist and equity investors who until recently were reluctant to finance cannabis firms.\nThey are drawn by a wide-open landscape of opportunity, said Eric Hippeau, managing partner at Lerer Hippeau Ventures, a New York-based venture capital firm well-known for its investments in high-profile media startups such as Twitter Inc and Buzzfeed.\n\u0093It\u0092s an industry that is starting from scratch with no infrastructure,\u0094 Hippeau said. \u0093There are many promising cannabis-related software startups that are able to easily raise money.\u0094\nSome of these startups provide seed-to-sale cannabis tracking system software and inventory management. Hippeau Ventures earlier this year joined a $3 million funding round for LeafLink, a business-to-business platform that provides a market for dispensary owners to buy inventory.\nOther prominent venture firms that have warmed to cannabis include Founders Fund, started by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, which has invested in Privateer Holdings, a cannabis private equity firm. Prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalists 500 Startups, DCM Ventures, along with New York-based Great Oaks Venture Capital, have all backed Eaze, a medical marijuana delivery app that allows patients to order cannabis on demand.\n\u0093The stigma is slowly going away, and you are seeing some real talent, in terms of technology entrepreneurs and quality engineers,\u0094 said Kyle Lui, a principal at DCM Ventures.\nInvestors who have taken the initial plunge into the quasi-legal marketplace seem eager to take on more exposure, said Jim Patterson, CEO of Eaze, a three-year old company has raised $51.5 million in five rounds from more than a dozen investors.\nSuch firms believe its \u0093a good time to double down,\u0094 Patterson said.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nSome investors have steered toward technology and support services, which carry less legal risk than cultivating or selling the weed itself.\nThese include dating apps for cannabis users such as High There and My420Mate, as well as WeGrow, an educational app that teaches people how to grow cannabis. HelloMD is an online platform connecting doctors and cannabis patients.\nAmong the signs the market is maturing is the development of information services that collect data on trading of cannabis and publish guideline prices. Similar services are common across commodity markets - from oil and gas to corn and cotton - and are used by industry participants as price benchmarks.\nNew Leaf Data Services LLC, a Stamford, Connecticut-based start-up, published its first assessment of U.S. cannabis prices about two years ago. Newleaf compiles information gathered from cultivators and dispensaries, transaction data from market participants and data from vendors and associations.\nInvestors can also follow the value of marijuana firms through stock market indexes such as the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF, which tracks the performance of a selection of publicly listed cannabis companies in North America.\nThe value of the index is up about 70 percent over the last three months, thanks to star performers such as Canopy Growth Corp, a producer and retailer of medical cannabis products - up 112 percent for the year - and Aphria Inc, a cannabis producer, up 132 percent this year. \u0093The cannabis business is really about risk arbitrage. There are chances of a higher return because the risk is high,\u0094 Patterson said. \u0093Investors get that.\u0094\nThe long-term risk may be lower, however, as a growing number of Americans express support for marijuana legalization and the industry creates jobs and tax revenues.\nU.S. residents also seem increasingly aware of the futility in preventing illegal marijuana use, said Ian Laird, a lawyer and co-founder of New Leaf.\n\u0093The evolution or rollback of prohibition is inevitable,\u0094 he said. \u0093It\u0092s not like it stopped anyone from getting it.\u0094\n High tech, high finance and high times for U.S. pot industry | Reuters\nAuthor: Angela Moon, Chris Prentice\nContact: Reuters Online Support\nPhoto Credit: Getty Images\nWebsite: Business & Financial News, U.S & International Breaking News | Reuters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.reuters.com/", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cannabis-investment-insight/high-tech-high-finance-and-high-times-for-u-s-pot-industry-idUSKBN1E01U1"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:12.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3f618871782bbc27844f97c9ecc530bc8ad3b60e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxeicLObmMPlok6v24IkS789D40OpxUjzodq3R9lUZHDl", "site_full": "blog.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/blog?query=u&start=7&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "\uc74c\uc545 POP : Text Me Merry Christmas", "title_full": "\uc74c\uc545 POP : Text Me Merry Christmas : \ub124\uc774\ubc84 \ube14\ub85c\uadf8", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "KS", "spam_score": 0.992, "main_image": "http://blogthumb2.naver.net/MjAxNzEyMDdfMjky/MDAxNTEyNjM5NTAxMjMz.32bGD-LeNa9Ohxllk-SZtUQcYwjGNEx3Da2-9SP_WBIg.UogUrPQBrxl4jFjD-2RwbHxlH6FoZ50lUHf0apU6Co4g.JPEG.ssoo1523/23181_72503_232_20161223113307742.jpg?type=w2", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3f618871782bbc27844f97c9ecc530bc8ad3b60e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxeicLObmMPlok6v24IkS789D40OpxUjzodq3R9lUZHDl", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "\ubbfc\uc058\ub2dd", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\uc74c\uc545 POP : Text Me Merry Christmas", "text": "<\uac00\uc0ac>\n Kristen:\nThis holiday\nYou\u2019ll be far away\nAnd I\u2019ll be all alone\nSo please remember\nThis December\nTo fully charge your phone\nAnd\nText me Merry Christmas\nLet me know you care\nJust a word or two\nOf text from you\nWill remind me you\u2019re still there\nYou don\u2019t have to add much to it\nOne smiley face will do\nBaby text me Merry Christmas\nCause I\u2019m missing kissing you\nMike:\nText me Merry Christmas\nMake my holiday complete\nThough you\u2019re far from me\nSay you\u2019ll brb\nThat\u2019s a text I\u2019ll never delete\nChoose just the right emoji\nOne that makes me lol\nAnd if you text me something naughty I promise I won\u2019t tell\nKristen and Mike:\nI don\u2019t care if you spell things right\nI just want to hear from you tonight\nStroke those keys with your delicate touch\nAnd type those little words that mean so much!\nMike: Hi\nKristen: Hey\nMike: How are you\nKristen: Ok\nMike: Miss u\nKristen: Miss u too\nMike: Xmas sucks without you\nKristen: I know lol\nMike: Love u\nKristen: Love u 2\nMike: Kthxbye\nKristen and Mike:\nA facebook message isn\u2019t quite as sweet\nKristen:\nA need more from @you than just a tweet\nMike:\nA snap on snapchat doesn\u2019t last\nKristen and Mike:\nAnd voicemail?

The sixth-generation Nissan Patrol has arrived in South Africa. It shares much with the Infiniti QX80. Plenty of safety assistance technologies come standard. The ride on 18-inch alloys is cosseting. Old-school design and plenty of space inside. December 7th 2017 Peter Palm posted in Driving Impressions \nMAGALIESBURG, Gauteng \u2013 It\u2019s not often a manufacturer has the chance to introduce a new vehicle that essentially needs no introduction. Yes, the Nissan Patrol is a heavyweight, go-anywhere vehicle that has been around since the 1950s. And the latest model is finally in South Africa. \nNow in its sixth generation, this version of the Patrol has been available in some overseas markets for many years. Now fully modernised to current expectations of luxury and safety, it remains slightly old-school in a manner preferred by customers who require a vehicle for long trips, often away from civilisation or repair centres. \nThe single derivative on offer boasts various mod cons as standard and is fitted with a naturally aspirated V8 petrol engine delivering 298 kW and 560 N.m of torque through a seven-speed automatic gearbox. The reason for the lack of a diesel option is simply because there isn\u2019t one available. The apparent trend towards phasing out diesel and then petrol would, in theory, eventually leave us with electric power alone. This might be tricky for overland vehicles such as the Patrol, but that\u2019s for the future to thrash out. \nThe eight-cylinder engine has hydraulically adjustable valve timing plus electrically controlled lift to compensate for less dense air at high altitudes. Drive is normally to the rear wheels, but the system automatically switches to all-wheel drive when necessary. In addition, a low-range transfer case with various off-road programmes can be selected via controls in the centre console. \nImposing styling \nAppearance wise, the Patrol has an imposing presence with reasonably attractive styling (much better than the Infiniti QX80 with which it shares its underpinnings), although the rear lighting is quite heavy on the bling. While the sheer size makes it tricky to park, even with the camera aids, it does serve up a special interior with supple leather upholstery (in a beige/biscuit or black hue), loads of legroom and three smaller seats at the back \u2013 making for a total of eight pews, although it is officially still classed as a seven-seater. \nThe powered tailgate opens to reveal something unusual for a seven- or eight-seater with all perches in use \u2013 there is still some luggage space on offer. A full-size spare wheel is mounted under the body, while the suspension comprises a double-wishbone independent setup all round and is enhanced by hydraulic body motion control. \nThe Patrol boasts a plethora of modern safety features, including blind-spot detection, lane-departure warning and automatic braking to avoid collisions. A 360-degree camera view helps the driver to safely guide the massive vehicle and a rear-view camera image can be displayed in the rear-view mirror. Plenty of small touches, such as sun-visor extensions, can also be found in the cabin. \nThere are USB and 12V outlets in various places and a DVD system for rear-seat passengers ships standard, along with a sunroof, triple-zone climate control and electrically adjustable front seats that are both heated and cooled. The large centre armrest furthermore houses a refrigerated cooler box. \nComfortable ride \nOn the road, the Patrol is extremely comfortable and easy to drive with effortless acceleration accompanied by a just-audible V8 note. With seven ratios, there is often plenty of cog-swapping taking place, but more gentle use of the throttle does mitigate this. \nThe braking system is up to hauling the 2,8 tonnes to a stop, while there is little body roll round bends, thanks largely to the hydraulically compensating suspension. We achieved a sub eight-second zero to 100 km/h sprint time with the similarly engined QX80, so this Patrol will likely also be no slouch. Also important with the Patrol is its towing ability, which comes in at a claimed 3 500 kg. The 140-litre fuel tank should provide sufficient range, too. \nUnlike the QX80 with 21-inch wheels we tested in November 2015, Nissan has sensibly decided to fit what just may be perfect-sized wheels to the Patrol. These are 18-inchers with a tyre (Bridgestone Dueler A/T) size of 265/70 R18. This provides a cosseting ride that includes an admirable ability to soak up bad potholes and bumps. We did some serious off-road rock-crawling and the only thing that might be missed is the inability to adjust the ride height for scaling really large rocks. \nSo, who will buy the new Patrol? Well, this vehicle may be considered by those who need to tow large caravans (or boats), serial overlanders and politicians with a penchant for flashing blue lights. And it\u2019ll certainly be up to all three jobs\u2026 Fast facts Model: Nissan Patrol 5,6 V8 Premium 4WD 7AT Price: R1 299 000", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter palm", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nissan patrol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nissan", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gauteng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magaliesburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:12.031+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a9335053298574ccfab43452c67047f38f73384", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8_SBCsJBDbv7VWGtitJ3tITViRaD3upZ27a_VHkae1TsL1eL4humeTKtEzxQPWtdCil_g1j5t_8z_CHh.CgQHdTCDjL7yS.pcrnn7b8cwPmz2fqniqMZFHzyLxAfFGN2ofe2kYV2IQmNsWMOaZLSN4k44In.fojlDKZXeiqeB.7g--", "site_full": "www.minecraftforum.net", "site": "minecraftforum.net", "site_section": "http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/servers-java-edition/server-recruitment", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Server Recruitment - Servers: Java Edition - Minecraft Forum - Minecraft Forum ", "title": "NanoHQ Server Recruitment (A lot of positions needs to be filled on)", "title_full": "NanoHQ Server Recruitment (A lot of positions needs to be filled on) - Server Recruitment - Servers: Java Edition - Minecraft Forum - Minecraft Forum", "published": "2017-12-01T22:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.083, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2077, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ec38a875e1090f229433d657a4663c8bd18e58d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8_SBCsJBDbv7VWGtitJ3tITViRaD3upZ27a_VHkae1TsL1eL4humeTKtEzxQPWtdCil_g1j5t_8z_CHh.CgQHdTCDjL7yS.pcrnn7b8cwPmz2fqniqMZFHzyLxAfFGN2ofe2kYV2IQmNsWMOaZLSN4k44In.fojlCewOlDPBtOePuWFnREfOn8", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "XectartheGreat", "published": "2017-12-07T16:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Still hiring.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:12.038+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a39ec3fe8f76e58a884efca86060639214a7486f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9uyfWgXy.UDgrfezwPAGv_p5Si3Af5d7.ekagxdm9rG5CfZb0tnaiT4YCj_xiV72PkYH.vhx.lyJ5je7iRTghwq_hu7hOqUj4LKGRnMUDsk9D6e3XMBbKHyfmfasSjJ3Y2shum._FJBg--", "site_full": "www.siliconera.com", "site": "siliconera.com", "site_section": "http://www.siliconera.com/feed", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Siliconera", "title": "Roguelike RPG Dragon Fang Z Journeys To North America On December 19 For Switch", "title_full": "Roguelike RPG Dragon Fang Z Journeys To North America On December 19 For Switch", "published": "2017-12-07T10:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.siliconera.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DragonFangZ_thumb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13740, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a39ec3fe8f76e58a884efca86060639214a7486f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9uyfWgXy.UDgrfezwPAGv_p5Si3Af5d7.ekagxdm9rG5CfZb0tnaiT4YCj_xiV72PkYH.vhx.lyJ5je7iRTghwq_hu7hOqUj4LKGRnMUDsk9D6e3XMBbKHyfmfasSjJ3Y2shum._FJBg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sato", "published": "2017-12-07T10:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Roguelike RPG Dragon Fang Z Journeys To North America On December 19 For Switch", "text": "Roguelike RPG Dragon Fang Z Journeys To North America On December 19 For Switch By Sato .

December 6, 2017 . 2:00pm \nRosenkreuzstilette Freudenstachel is a sidescrolling shooter about witches, magic, and saving lost friends, having players blast their way through various stages and deal with varied bosses. Drawing heavily from Mega Man, players will find themselves gaining new magic powers as they defeat bosses, growing in power as they find victory. \nSiliconera reached out to WOMI, developer of Rosenkreuzstilette Freudenstachel , to learn more about what the developer wanted to draw from the Blue Bomber, as well as how they wanted to diverge from the Mega Man formula. \nThe Rosenkreuzstilette series has some long, complicated names. What do they mean? What drew you to name your games this way? \nWOMI, developer of Rosenkreuzstilette Freudenstachel \u2013 \u201cRosenkreuzstilette\u201d is based on the German for \u201cStiletto of the Rose Crucifix\u201d, and \u201cFreudenstachel\u201d is based on the German for \u201cThorn of Joy\u201d. Both the titles and characters were originally taken from a visual novel game project by one of the creators. Personally, I liked how it starts with an \u201cR\u201d, like \u201c Rockman \u201d [Japanese Mega Man ]. \nThere were comments about it being unreadable in Japan, and about the spelling being impossible to remember, but I think they were good titles, with the preceding comments considered. \nRosenkreuzstilette Freudenstachel mixes magic and Mega Man -like play, like the previous game. What new things did you want to do with this title that you couldn\u2019t do in the last one? What made you want to make a new game in the series? \nOne of the bigger things we weren\u2019t able to do with the previous title was the boss character solicitation thing. Six of the characters were selected from entries from fans. \nAs for in-game stuff, the boss algorithms have been changed greatly. In the previous title, we copied the NES style and purposely included movements with fewer patterns, but for this title we went for a more SNES-and-beyond feel and added more attack patterns and less random movements. We\u2019ve also added vertically-scrolling areas and double-screen boss fights to the latest game. \nOriginally, we had no plans to make this game. We decided to make it after receiving so many requests for a sequel. (Since we made the decision for a sequel without thinking very carefully, it ended up taking us five years to develop it, though\u2026) \nHow did you want to create your own vision of a Mega Man -like game? How did you want to make this play style your own? \nSince it\u2019s a game with a long history, I feel like what is considered \u201ccharacteristic\u201d of it would differ between people, but I personally feel that the way the game is made \u2013 in which it can be enjoyed by beginners and veterans alike \u2013 is very Mega Man -ish. \nAt the time, for most games, you\u2019d start at Stage 1 and would have to clear one stage at a time, and if you couldn\u2019t clear the first stage then you\u2019d be stuck with just the one level. But then, suddenly, there were these games where you could play six stages, and if there was a boss you weren\u2019t good with, you could find their weak point and attack accordingly. \nI think the game was designed really well in that it allowed the player to first find a boss\u2019 weak point, then once you\u2019ve gotten used to the boss, you could take it out with normal shots, and then once you\u2019ve gotten further acclimated you could clear the game without taking damage and have fun with time attacks and stuff like that. The game was made so that players of all levels could enjoy it. \nFor this game as well, we wanted to make it so that even beginners could somehow get through it, so we really put a lot of work into balancing things out. Since hardcore fans tend to make them, Mega Man -style games usually have difficulty levels that are really hardcore themselves. \nPlayers who keep firing in Rosenkreuzstilette Freudenstachel will find their shots weakening. Why did you choose to add this hindrance to players\u2019 weapons? What does this add to the game? \nDuring development, the main shot could be used unlimitedly, but with the rapid-fire function it became so that simply holding down the fire button became the easiest way to play, and it made it more like a Contra -style game. As far as the Megaman style goes, while I felt that the limited main shot was a kind of heresy, we had to include it in order to avoid players simply holding down the fire button. It\u2019s actually really fuel-efficient, and each time you miss, the main shot gauge refills completely, so I don\u2019t think players will end up getting weakened very often. \nRosenkreuzstilette Freudenstachel features many challenging bosses with neat powers to collect. What thoughts go into making a useful, interesting magical power for players to get from bosses? How did you design so many different attacks and keep them useful? \nSince the normal shot is extremely powerful in this game, I remember being really careful in making sure that the different types of magic were exceptionally effective in specific parts of the game. As a result, we ended up with a lot of \u201cpeaky\u201d weapons and somewhat useless ones\u2026 But I feel that this too is in the Mega Man tradition. \nRosenkreuzstilette Freudenstachel has many nods to classic video games with some of its enemies and levels. Why put in these nods to older games? Why did you want to include them? \nThe way we included elements from other old-school games in the Game Over screen of the previous title actually turned out to be a bit of a hit, so we included a bunch of new joke references while making sure to maintain the main Mega Man style. \nDo you feel like you will make another game in the series? What else do you want to do with the Rosenkreuzstilette franchise now? \nWe still receive requests for a sequel, and we would love to make one, but since one of the team members left during development of Rosenkreuzstilette Freudenstachel , meaning it\u2019s just me by myself, and since I\u2019m also involved in other things as well, it would be pretty difficult to do. \nGame development isn\u2019t my actual main job, so it\u2019s hard for me to maintain my motivation unless it\u2019s in the sort of situation where a few friends toss ideas around and get all excited while creating a game. If I were to do it, I feel like it would be fun to make something based on the dash and close-range attack mode included in this latest title as a bonus.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rosenkreuzstilette freudenstachel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joel cou", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mega man", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siliconera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosenkreuzstilette", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:13.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2e793cb66abf7e59ab6b542eedd9ee3dfd710fec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyVoqURIAkyqmOCTAlMz_bfnUclc_pw0dHe20GzliFu_KGK_cur6xkMhcDaTKEgEXnZGb48sRkeU86.L.3tb0sDN8N7Eptb1whJCYli7DxbVnmxzZCqWs.0", "site_full": "paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://paenvironmentdaily.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "PA Environment Digest Blog", "title": "DEP Blog: A News Life For Monocacy Creek In Bethlehem", "title_full": "DEP Blog: A News Life For Monocacy Creek In Bethlehem", "published": "2017-12-07T12:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2e793cb66abf7e59ab6b542eedd9ee3dfd710fec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyVoqURIAkyqmOCTAlMz_bfnUclc_pw0dHe20GzliFu_KGK_cur6xkMhcDaTKEgEXnZGb48sRkeU86.L.3tb0sDN8N7Eptb1whJCYli7DxbVnmxzZCqWs.0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David E.

That\u2019s the new life for Monocacy Creek in Bethlehem, Lehigh/Northampton counties. For nearly 40 years, old railroad ties embedded into the creek\u2019s banks controlled erosion and limited the amount of sediment that had accumulated. Those ties also acted as barriers to channel the flow of the stream. The idea was that the wooden structures would stabilize the stream bank and control erosion. It did. For a while. However, by late 2015, erosion began and the creek started to suffer. The water muddied, and the stream bank began to fall. Staff at the Wildlands Conservancy , a Lehigh Valley-based conservation organization, felt the railroad ties were not good for the health of the stream and the fish and other habitat that relied on it for survival. They had a plan to rebuild and renew the stream. But the project needed funding.  Enter DEP\u2019s Growing Greener Grant Program . Ron Yablonsky, water quality specialist in DEP\u2019s Northeast Regional Office, reviewed the proposal by Wildlands to remove the railroad ties and other dam structures on the creek. The plan was to replace the ties with rock to ease the flow and create a natural channel. This would also help to create a deeper body of water so fish can have more oxygen, and migrate. Other work involved removing old dams and replacing them with modern V-shaped rock structures that span the width of the stream.   ( Click Here to see more photos.) Yablonsky, now retired, felt the plan would improve the overall quality of the stream and make it make it more appealing for fisherman and other recreational uses. \u201cThis stream restoration project would not only enhance the quality of aquatic life, but protect it as well, and make the stream flow in a more natural state,\u201d said Yablonsky. In the summer of 2016, DEP awarded Wildlands Conservancy a $55,000 Growing Greener Grant for the project. Work began in the fall of that year and continued throughout the year. Large machinery moved in, and the railroad ties were ripped from the banks. Old structures on the stream were also dismantled. The creek sediment was removed. One highlight of the project was the installation of several fish hatcheries along the stream. Those structures provided an area where fish can grow and be released, creating more opportunities for fisherman to catch fish during the season. The creek bank also now has a more natural cover: a coconut fiber mat designed by the Conservancy. Over the years, the mat will naturally decompose once vegetation takes root to keep the newly created bank in place. \u201cIt\u2019s a more natural creek now,\u201d said Yablonsky. \u201cThe fish can flow more freely and the banks are stronger and will only get stronger. It is what nature intended.\u201d For more information on funding opportunities, visit DEP\u2019s Growing Greener Grant Program webpage.

They can set out into the world, searching through caves to find fights and treasures. They can also battle for control over territory to ensure their clan of cats has the most land, hunt down mice and squirrels to ensure they have a supply of food.

This type of fund is considered to be one of the most conservative investments in the investment market. Investors invest in short-term investment funds to protect capital. Short-term investment funds are generally expected to keep pace with inflation and earn marginally higher returns than a standard personal savings account. Short-term investment funds are also generally considered to be liquid investments. BREAKING DOWN 'Short-Term Investment Fund - STIF' \nShort-term investment funds offer investors the opportunity to protect capital while earning a marginal rate of return. Many short-term investment funds benchmark their fund returns to a Treasury bill index. Short-term investment funds typically include cash, bank notes, government bills and conservative bond holdings characterized as safe short-term debt instruments. \nShort-term investment funds are also known for liquidity. These types of funds are often used by investors who seek a short-term holding before moving their investments to another investment that will provide higher returns. These funds traditionally have low management fees , usually well below 1% per year. They also typically have low transaction costs. Short-Term Investment Fund Managers \nMoney market funds are the most broadly known short-term investment funds. Short-term investment funds can also invest in short-term bonds in various categories. Below are examples of investment providers that offer a wide array of money market funds for investors. \nSchwab Purchased Money Funds are grouped into three categories: prime, government and treasury, and municipal. Investor share classes require a minimum investment of $1. \nVanguard \nVanguard offers three taxable money market funds and numerous non-taxable municipal funds. Prices of the funds are $1. Expenses range from 0.09% to 0.16%. \nJPMorgan \nJPMorgan offers approximately 60 money market funds. JPMorgan money market funds have a net asset value of $1. The JPMorgan Prime Money Market Fund (CJPXX) has the best one year return as of October 31, 2017. The Fund\u2019s one year return is 1.03%. The Fund has an expense cap of 0.18%. \nAmerican Century \nAmerican Century offers five funds in their money market category. American Century money market funds offer free check writing for liquidity and easy accessibility. The Prime Money Market Fund (BPRXX) is one of the category\u2019s top performers. Its total year to date return as of December 1, 2017 was 0.52%. The Fund has over $1 billion in total assets with an expense ratio of 0.58%.
