(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

Kikwete (JMK) Park in Dar es Salaam yesterday.\n\nMorgan together with Orlando City SC midfielder Servando Carrasco of Major League Soccer are visiting the country as U.S. Department of State sports envoys. \u201cI went through the same path as you have taken but now, I enjoy the fruits of my work. This should also be applied to you. Make sure that you train hard everyday and always aim high for you to succeed,\u201d Morgan issued an advise to young girls.\n\nAdding, the star lauded the management of JMK Park for having good sports facility, which she said will greatly help to improve youth talents in the country. In his words, Carrasco advised the promising future players to always respect their mentors and exercise a lot on the pitch since success in sports takes long time.\n\n\u201cChallenges are always there but if you know where you are going, definitely, you cannot get lost,\u201d he said. Adding, the midfielder said their visit has in some way or the other inspired the young talented sports stars in such a way that they will also work hard to reach their intended dreams.\n\nIn her remarks, USA Ambassador to Tanzania Inmi Pettersen, urged the young players to put education first for them to reach far. \u201cSports is important but education is very important hence make sure that you study hard in class for your own benefit,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso in attendance was the president of Tanzania Football Federation (TFF), Wallace Karia, who thanked the duo for spending time with the young players and instill to them important skills, which will highly help them to realise their football dreams.\n\n\u201cI believe that your visit today (yesterday) has big impact on these youths. We will continue as the federation to provide all necessary equipment for them to do better in sports,\u201d Karia said. On Monday, Morgan and Carrasco had time helping to bolster the United States\u2019 cultural and social ties with the youth of Tanzania, including the Maasai people in Monduli District, Arusha region.\n\nFrom Dar es Salaam, the American stars will head to Zanzibar for their last clinic before flying back to USA. This sports envoy programme\u2019s focus on girls and women in sports also builds on the \u201cEqual Playing Field\u201d initiative, which in June 2017 saw 30 women from six continents, including previous U.S. Sports Envoy Lori Lindsey, play the world\u2019s highest soccer match at 18,747 feet (5,714 meters) on Mount Kilimanjaro.\n\nSince 2003, the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs has sent more than 250 U.S. athletes to more than 85 countries on Sports Envoy programmes, which help reach overseas audiences that other forms of diplomatic engagement do not to promote collaboration on priority U.S. policy goals . \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallace karia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "servando carrasco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "inmi pettersen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carrasco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lori lindsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jakaya m. kikwete", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fifa women", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando city sc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tanzania football federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bureau of educational and cultural affairs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arusha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tanzania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jmk park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount kilimanjaro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dar es salaam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monduli district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zanzibar", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:40.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a83ab479a9688c1a9f2f4179324994d5bcf0832", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRlMZXQJsgoaCrzQT6T0tcczXjpUdVNRg3ezUCAIVecLMFVanOcreIYShUzdbcNX2.oZ77oRq8_ndHHKr65FHlNPP69BN1QGvNfp2AdXfEtRybrPRDpl0N2Vsr6kj6apUwaScCYiVXKwsmMnt0oZqwVapPklACsiK4-", "site_full": "www.timesofmalta.com", "site": "timesofmalta.com", "site_section": "http://timesofmalta.com//rss", "site_categories": ["media", "education", "business"], "section_title": "Times of Malta", "title": "Last concrete chimney at Marsa power station going down", "title_full": "Last concrete chimney at Marsa power station going down", "published": "2017-12-07T11:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/f2603395a8d22b1813085b68d6ad6fff36dfff7e-1512639601-5a290c71-620x348.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 4829, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 204, "comments": 0, "shares": 204}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a83ab479a9688c1a9f2f4179324994d5bcf0832", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRlMZXQJsgoaCrzQT6T0tcczXjpUdVNRg3ezUCAIVecLMFVanOcreIYShUzdbcNX2.oZ77oRq8_ndHHKr65FHlNPP69BN1QGvNfp2AdXfEtRybrPRDpl0N2Vsr6kj6apUwaScCYiVXKwsmMnt0oZqwVapPklACsiK4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "Last concrete chimney at Marsa power station going down", "text": "Thursday, December 7, 2017, 10:38 Watch: Going, going, gone. Marsa power station chimneys demolished \nThe last two of the Marsa power station\u2019s five chimneys were demolished on Thursday morning with a roar that was powerful enough to be recorded on the University's seismic recorder. \nThe chimneys were among the few remaining structures of the 1953 Marsa Power Station, which was put on cold standby in 2015 and fully disconnected from the national electricity network to be demolished earlier this year. The site is expected to be completely cleared in the beginning of 2018. \nDuring Thursday\u2019s operation, the company\u2019s contractors used a high reach demolition excavator and remote-controlled excavators to remove a section of the base of the two chimneys. As the excavators cut their way through the circular foundations, the structures gave way, tilting forward in a pre-defined direction and crashed to the ground. Mounds of wet debris were placed along the path of the taller chimney\u2019s fall, to absorb the impact. \nThe first structure to be demolished, a 42-metre concrete chimney, was built in 1970. It formed part of the first extension of the Marsa B Power Station, which included two HFO-fired boilers and two 30-megawatt turbines. \nThe second chimney that was pulled down on Thursday was part of the 1986 Unit 8, the largest electricity generator of the Marsa Power Station, which was switched off for the last time in February 2015. This unit included a dual-fuel (HFO/coal) boiler and a 60-megawatt steam turbine, which was brought to Malta from a power station in Little Barford, Bedfordshire, England. \nAt 81 metres above ground level, this 5-metre wide concrete chimney was the tallest structure of the Marsa Power Station. The highest structure on site, however, was the 69-metre steel stack of Unit 7, which was situated on higher grounds a few metres away. This chimney was dismantled earlier this year, along with other structures of the Power Station. \nIng. Fredrick Azzopardi, Enemalta chairman, thanked the Company employees and contractors who planned and implemented the decommissioning and dismantling of this old power station during the last few years. \n\u201cEnding the use of our old HFO-fired plants was an important step forward in our long-term plan to transform the country\u2019s energy generation mix into a diversified, efficient combination of sources including new gas-fired plants, the Malta-Italy Interconnector and grid-connected renewable energy sources. This historic infrastructural development enabled us to achieve increased security of supply, drastically reduce air pollution and ensure some of the lowest energy tariffs in Europe for our customers.\u201d \nHe said the remaining Marsa Power Station structures will be demolished and carted away next year.

This is esp. important now that consumer use of bare Li-ion cells has become much more widespread - percolating into market segments where users may have (far) less technical knowledge than here (e.g. some vapers and hoverboard users). In fact it was this recent rapid rapid expansion of consumer use of bare Li-ion cells (and the consequent dangers it posed) that motivated me to begin posting more on safety matters - with hope that this information would be made available widely via web searches. If my posts helped only one reader from losing an eye or burning a hole in their leg or tongue then I consider my time well spent.\nAlas, I'm not aware of any such guide.\nProtected cells are not manufactured or endorsed by any of the top-tier cell manufacturers. The protection circuits are added by rewrappers whose competence may vary widely. Here too there are no safety standards. Poor quality protected cells may end up being less safe than nonprotected cells in certain contexts (e.g. the added tab running down the cell increases the surface area where shorts can occur from small metallic objects). It's dificult to say if a protected cell will be more safe than a nonprotected cell without performing tests and knowing more about the intended application context.\nFurther, it's not only the enclosure that differentiates protected cells from laptop batteries. Besides this extra mechanical protection from the case, laptop batteries also have much more extensive electrical protection, e.g. multiple levels of redundant failsafe protection (tested to meet international safety standards using rigorous methods, e.g. fault tree analysis, FMEA, etc, e.g. see here ) Thank you for your engagement with safety. I am actually a safety engineer and one of the reasons I started this topic is that I always want the safest solution even with some tradeoffs like price. Now I'm learning about Lithium cells to get up to date\nI just want to ask what you would use if you were me?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:41.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0f4d34379417b15560a18fc801ba4f57b0b08c78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9DTVHCegRGa6iIDa7NpvvDkG8AtHaDjNJdKiCEKoddjMH8YHGi73yvKDCsp7lB6L3pLn9KGyDjfYhPIuwr37z8xI7sMmeEakMOgxwNDTH8CzDt9QQkDMMt", "site_full": "www.cafonline.com", "site": "cafonline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["world_soccer", "sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Shaban brace sees Uganda stun Zambia on opening day", "title_full": "Shaban brace sees Uganda stun Zambia on opening day", "published": "2017-12-07T10:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.023, "main_image": "http://www.cafonline.com//Image.ashx?path=/portals/0/LinkDev.News\\1033\\9e064821-6a1f-466a-9848-aa4c53376e38.jpg&width=560&height=340", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 83322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0f4d34379417b15560a18fc801ba4f57b0b08c78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9DTVHCegRGa6iIDa7NpvvDkG8AtHaDjNJdKiCEKoddjMH8YHGi73yvKDCsp7lB6L3pLn9KGyDjfYhPIuwr37z8xI7sMmeEakMOgxwNDTH8CzDt9QQkDMMt", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "Shaban brace sees Uganda stun Zambia on opening day", "text": "Shaban brace sees Uganda stun Zambia on opening day Shaban brace sees Uganda stun Zambia on opening day The mail has been sent successfully 07 December 2017 08:45 Striker Muhammad Shaban scored a brace of goals as East African guest nation Uganda stunned holders and hosts Zambia with a 2-0 victory in their Group A opener at the 2017 Mopani Copper Mines COSAFA Under-20 Championships in Kitwe on Wednesday. Uganda were deserved winners over the African champions, who have a new-look side this year as they build towards the defence of their title in the 2019 African Youth Championships. The Young Chipolopolo certainly had their chances, but were undone by Shaban\u2019s double-strike in the second half at the Arthur Davies Stadium. Zambia came close to the opener when Captain Prince Mumba saw his shot cannon back off the woodwork, before Lameck Banda was denied by a fine stop from Uganda keeper Keni Saidi. The East Africans were ahead six minutes into the second period whenShaban netted from a tight angle after turning home Steven Mukyala\u2019s cross to stun the sizeable home crowd. And the Kampala City Council forward doubled his side\u2019s lead three minutes later with another neat finish. Zambia had goalkeeper Daniel Sikanyika to thank as he denied Stephen Mukwala as Uganda pushed for a third, while the visitors also had a goal disallowed in what was an accomplished performance from them that will elevate them to one of the tournament favourites. In the other fixture in Group A, Malawi edged Swaziland in a five-goal thriller with a 3-2 victory as Patrick Phiri bagged a brace of goals. Highly-rated Peter Banda put the Young Flames ahead as he drilled the ball into the back of the net, before he then blasted the ball over and saw another fine effort saved by Swaziland goalkeeper Mlamuli Lukhele. Swaziland were brighter at the start of the second period and equalised through Nuno Tsabedze. Phiri put Malawi ahead three minutes later, but Swaziland were level again before the hour-mark when Order Mamba converted a penalty. But the Young Flames had the last laugh as Phiri headed home after Banda\u2019s free-kick had come back off the crossbar. North African guests Egypt got their tournament off to a winning start in a hard-fought 1-0 success over Mozambique. Hussein Abdelkader grabbed the only goal of the game four minutes from time for what turned out to be a deserved victory for the Young Pharaohs. The second match in Group B will be played on Thursday when South Africa take on Mauritius at the Nkana Stadium (kick-off: 15h00 local; 13h00 GMT). More\u2026. South Africa are determined to regain the title they lost to Zambia on home soil last year and have a new batch of young stars working under coach Thabo Senong. The first match in Group C will be played before that as regional powerhouse Zimbabwe take on Lesotho at the same venue (kick-off 12h00 local; 10h00 GMT). Zimbabwe were desperately disappointed with their first round exit 12 months ago, and will be hopeful of adding to their six regional titles this year. The other two teams in that pool are Angola and Namibia, who meet on Friday. Only the top team in each pool and the best runner-up advance to the semifinals that will be played on December 14.

Holly Hughes, of Montague, that waives a limited liability company\u2019s (LLC) initial filing fees if a majority of the initial members are military veterans. \u201cOn top of encouraging veterans to be entrepreneurial and own businesses, my bill importantly corrects an oversight in current law for veteran business owners,\u201d Hughes said. Prior changes to the Michigan Limited Liability Company Act allowed the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) administrator to waive a LLC\u2019s filing fees if a majority of the membership interest of the company is held by honorably discharged veterans. However, the department\u2019s policy does not allow for a $50 fee waiver when the initial Articles of Organization are filed because membership interest does not yet exist when filing the initial Articles of Organization. \u201cMy measure amends the law to make clear that the $50 Articles of Organization fee is also waived if the majority of the LLC membership interest will be owned by honorably discharged veterans upon filing of the articles,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cI want to thank local attorney Adam Zuwerink, who works with veterans starting businesses, for bringing this issue to my attention. I also want to thank my colleagues who voted in favor of veteran business owners.\u201d To request a fee waiver, the person submitting for filing would need to show LARA proof that a majority of initial members are veterans by providing discharge paperwork such as a DD214 from. After certification, LARA would waive the $50 filing fee. House Bill 4701 now moves to the Senate for consideration.

You are right with your assumption that the children will not use the lights with batteries and won't even have access to the batteries. Issues I want to avoid is fumes and fire during charging or storage.\nI guess I will just go with the protected batteries you have recommended and keep an eye on the market for cells with higher safety as development is going forward.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:41.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08637887ce049420938016bea82fac4b0e3b8c6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpQ_lVIs8wowVZwxp5si9xVpAyvwh0wgQ8xANJbGpc3sT00YNHz9WwkaLKeFhVt3adIKocXqQLr8kyl7.QPSimRVgbB5.BWfMyyJlPgy_6c8Q--", "site_full": "biometrio.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://biometrio.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Biometrio", "title": "OFERTAS CIDADE CAN\u00c7\u00c3O V\u00c1LIDAS PARA O DIA 07/12/2017", "title_full": "OFERTAS CIDADE CAN\u00c7\u00c3O V\u00c1LIDAS PARA O DIA 07/12/2017", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/NQCRYHtMWlacF9SOrCGv78yL2fprdb2RanaBcz0cQ0t9qjR0VyF7qypvTnJPZjl-0sHkZofYCpW7_MF-Ar7eCe3P0pU=w1200-h630-n-k-no-nu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08637887ce049420938016bea82fac4b0e3b8c6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpQ_lVIs8wowVZwxp5si9xVpAyvwh0wgQ8xANJbGpc3sT00YNHz9WwkaLKeFhVt3adIKocXqQLr8kyl7.QPSimRVgbB5.BWfMyyJlPgy_6c8Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "noreply@blogger.com (Jorge Purgly)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "OFERTAS CIDADE CAN\u00c7\u00c3O V\u00c1LIDAS PARA O DIA 07/12/2017", "text": "Biometrio Biometria, Biometrio, Biometrico, Iris, Olho, Identifica\u00e7\u00e3o, Iridologia, Terapia, Alternativa, Complementar, Naturopatia, An\u00e1lise, Padr\u00f5es, Alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, Sa\u00fade, Diagnose, Bernard Jensen, Denny Johnson, Embriologia, Bi\u00f3tipos, Ray Id, Nutri\u00e7\u00e3o, Mapas, Sistema, Nervoso, Simp\u00e1tico, Parassimp\u00e1tico, Nutrientes, Extrovertido, Introvertido, Astrologia, Macrobiotica, Reiki, Yin-Yang, Vegetariana, Dieta, Vegetariano, Medicina Tradicional Chinesa, Cabelos, Beleza, Terapia, Vibracional, Conhecer o Corpo Google Tag Manager quinta-feira, 7 de dezembro de 2017 OFERTAS CIDADE CAN\u00c7\u00c3O V\u00c1LIDAS PARA O DIA 07/12/2017 Postado por Jorge Purgly \u00e0s 07:34 Conhe\u00e7a o meu livro Como Ler a M\u00e3o Clique sobre a pagina e se gostar de 5 estrelas Voc\u00ea gostou do artigo?

People on Medicaid are prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But a new survey says that\u2019... \nBy RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVARAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - People on Medicaid are more prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington.

Photo: Online 1 ISLAMABAD: Questions about the 'success' of the Pakistan Peoples Party's (PPP) Tuesday's rally aside, the one thing that has gone viral from the public gathering is the PPP supremo's moves on stage. After the rally, the PPP leader and former president Asif Ali Zardari couldn't help but sway to the beat of a popular Arif Lohar song. Pictures and videos have been doing the rounds on social media ever since. Answering a question after appearing before an anti-terrorism court on Thursday, Imran said: \u201cI don\u2019t know about the rally but the way Zardari danced, he should conduct these performances more often.\u201d Talking to the media separately, Awami Muslim League leader Sheikh Rasheed said \"obviously what Zardari did seems like a \u2018dhamaal\u2019 to [PPP leader] Khursheed Shah\". \"He [Zardari] was happy from the inside and doing a dhamaal from the inside,\" he claimed . \nIn reaction to the criticism, PPP spokesperson Chaudhry Manzoor said doing dhamaal [spiritual dance] is part of PPP\u2019s history. \nHe added that the party founder and former premier Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto performed a dhamaal at the shrine of Sufi saint Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. \nHe claimed that the Taliban and Imran have similar stances.

Newlyweds Jake and Alice are offered a mysterious wedding gift \u2013 membership of a club which promises its couples will never divorce. Signing The Pact seems the start to a perfect marriage. Until one of them breaks the rules. The marriage of their dreams is about to become their worst nightmare. Because The Pact is for life. And its members will do anything to make sure no one leaves\u2026 \nI received a digital copy of this book in exchange for an honest review from NetGalley. Thank you to the author, Michelle Richmond, and the publisher, Michael Joseph, for this opportunity. \nMichelle Richmond is the author of several other books including The Year of the Fog and Golden State . She has won the Hillsdale Award for Fiction and the Catherine Doctorow Innovative Fiction Prize. \nThis book was originally published on the 25th July 2017 but the edition I have reviewed will be published on the 14th December 2017 in the UK. \nI really enjoyed reading The Marriage Pact . I didn\u2019t know what to expect from the book but it delivered so many tantalising plot twists that I just couldn\u2019t stop reading it once I had started. \nI absolutely loved the concept. One their wedding day, Alice and Jake receive an odd gift from one of Alice\u2019s clients that she spontaneously invited to the wedding. This gift leads them into a sort of secret society or cult which is based solely around keeping married couples together. It\u2019s all based on a set of rules set out in The Manual and violations can lead to severe punishments. The Pact makes the two main characters increasingly paranoid and it even brainwashes them to a certain degree. I don\u2019t want to give away any spoilers but the book includes a lot of violence, including torture, and some very shady characters. There were so many plot twists too that I was just hooked on this book. The plot is fantastic and it kept me on the edge of my seat. \nI think the ending, which I will not spoil, was perfect. I was so glad that the author chose that ending because it fits the book so well and it provides a very satisfying ending to such an unnerving plot. \nThe writing in The Marriage Pact was fantastic. It was fluid and fast paced and every single word projected the plot forward. Nothing was unnecessary added into the book and it had the right balance of description and dialogue. I really loved the narrative voice and I was surprised when I discovered that the book is written in the first person perspective of a man. I don\u2019t know why it surprised me, it just did, but it was a fantastic choice in my opinion. You really get to experience the narrator\u2019s paranoia but you don\u2019t necessarily know all of his intimate thoughts until he admits them to himself. The book is almost like a diary or a memoir and that\u2019s clear from what the narrator omits from the story until he\u2019s willing to discuss it. \nThe characters were very well written. Jake and Alice, the main characters, were complex and interesting. They both had issues but they tried to be better for each other. The other members of the Pact were a mixture of normal people and suspicious characters. Jake and Alice couldn\u2019t trust anyone and neither could I when I was reading the book. \nThe only thing I disliked about this book was how short some of the chapters were. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love a good short chapter because it adds to the suspense of a book like this, but I just thought that there were too many in the book. I didn\u2019t really understand the purpose of it except that they seemed to mark the transitions between different days. \nOverall, I loved this book. It was a thrilling ride from beginning to end and I would recommend it wholeheartedly. I\u2019ll definitely be buying it once it\u2019s available. \nDisclaimer: None of the links in this post are affiliate links.

I cite the particular paragraph below because it lays out the fact that the recent (last 700,000 years ) of earth\u2019s history has been a continuous ice age interrupted by brief interglacials, such as the last 10,000 years. This is called the Quaternary ice age, and we are still in it . My inference from this fact is that humans have much less control over the planet\u2019s climate than the global warming catastrophists would have us believe. And as others have demonstrated, there has been a continuous leaching of CO2 out of the atmosphere for the last 33 million years. \nAtmosphere CO2 levels from 600 million years ago to present \nsource: http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/virtualmuseum/climatechange2/07_1.shtml \nCombine these two facts. The earth has experienced increasingly severe ice ages in the last 700,000 years. CO2 has been depleted from the atmosphere for a long time. Some have reasoned that this has accelerated from the time the Indian plate collided with the Asian tectonic plate between 50 and 25 million years ago and pushed up the Himalayas. The action of monsoon rains falling on exposed limestone has had the effect of leaching CO2 from atmosphere, and dissolving it in the oceans. [It is important to note that regardless of the cause of the CO2 depletion, it has been occurring over a vast stretch of time.] Quaternary CO2 levels reached a low of 180 parts per million (PPM) . Partly because of human activities, CO2 is back up to over 400 ppm, the highest in the last 800,000 years. This is not the catastrophe that some would have us believe, but a recovery from a low point associated with ice ages. \nAccordingly, if this association of depleted CO2 and ice ages is correct, then the threat to the planet is cold not heat. So far we are dealing with inferences from observed facts in the geological records. \nAnd now to the conjectures. \nSince humans are adding to the planet\u2019s atmospheric CO2, then perhaps humanity\u2019s function is to keep a recurrence of the next ice age from happening. Rubbish? Teleology? Maybe James Lovelock is right, and that our job as a species is to keep Gaia happy. In either case, we are heading into another ice age, unless the heat that humans are adding to the environment prevent one. And I rather doubt our power to prevent the next big advance of ice, but that is mere conjecture on my part. \nSo back to the global cooling scare of the 1970s (the one I think is better founded, because it rests on the demonstrable facts of glaciology). As Mr. Lewin writes: \nThe one great scientific advance that contributed to the 1970s cooling scare was a revolution in Quaternary geology. Until the late 1960s, it was generally agreed that there had been four recent glaciations, however their timing was largely unknown due to inadequate dating techniques. As the new dating technology was brought into play, it revealed that since the last geometric reversal, around 700,000 years ago, there had been no less than 8 cool/warm cycles. It also showed that cool was the norm. Indeed, the whole Quaternary period (i.e., the last 2.5 million years) is best described as an ice age punctuated by brief \u2018interglacial\u2019 warm \u2018epochs\u2019. These interglacials appeared like clockwork on a 100,000 cycle, and the record clearly showed that this cycle was about to switch phases. That is to say, the current epoch\u2014the \u2018Holocene\u2019, the 10,000 years of warm stable climatic upon which agriculture-based civilization had been built\u2014was about to end. Quaternary Geologists promote a cooling scare \nThe realization that we are at the end of a warm period was not itself alarming, as rapid climate change on a geological scale might be 1 o C per millennia. Such a gradual trend would hardly be recognizable with all the local and global fluctuations known to occur across centuries and decades. If the decline out of past warm periods were associated with wider fluctuations on these time scales then this would remain unknown because the proxies indicators for temperature did not have the necessary resolution to pick them up. However, soon some geologists were claiming resolution down to a century or two which revealed evidence of climatic instability as previous interglacial epochs \u2018broke down\u2019. According to the Danish geologist, Willi Dansgaard, if the deep past is anything to go by, then \u2018the conditions for a catastrophic event are present today\u2019. This quote comes from the conclusion of a paper presented to a conference at Brown University early in 1972 that was called in light of the new evidence to answer a question of singular pertinence: \nThe present interglacial, how and when will it end? \nThe article continues with a discussion of the politics and organization of world conferences on climate change, and concludes: \nThus it can be seen that the cooling scare\u2014linked as it was with the food and energy crisis\u2014provided the impetus behind the launch of the warming scare, and it also provided the institutional platforms upon which the launch of that scare would take place.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bernie lewin",

Bellino: Free credit freezes will offer more security for Michigan residents", "text": "Categories: Bellino News , News \nA bill proposed by state Rep. Joseph Bellino to better protect Michigan residents from fraud by providing free security freezes today was unanimously passed in a House Financial Services Committee vote. \nWhen a freeze is placed on a credit report through a consumer credit-reporting agency, those looking to engage in fraud are unable to open a credit card, mortgage or additional form of credit in the name of the individual they are trying to impersonate. \nFees can be charged by credit-reporting agencies for each action that a consumer takes, such as one charge for imposing a freeze, another to discontinue it and additional fees if a freeze is needed to be put back in place. \n\u201cThese fees make it tougher for the people of Michigan to have their personal information protected and we need to remove this unfair barrier,\u201d\u009d said Bellino, of Monroe. \u201cProtecting your information shouldn\u2019t be a budget decision, especially when you don\u2019t always have control over who your personal information is shared with.\u201d\u009d \nBellino cited the massive breach that impacted reporting agency Equifax from mid-May through July. Nearly 700,000 people had private information stolen. \nAffected customers were asked to provide a database with information to verify their identities when disputing credit reports, including their driver\u2019s license, Social Security number, address and bank information. That information was accessed in a cyberattack and available for fraudulent actions. \n\u201cBusinesses are always working to improve their security so we can limit these hacks, but a credit freeze would have protected a lot of people in the aftermath of the breach,\u201d\u009d Bellino said. \u201cSometimes people think the cost of something isn\u2019t worth the trouble. This opens them up to possible fraud \u2013 all so that an agency can collect a $10 or $20 fee. These services should be provided for free to protect residents.\u201d\u009d \nHouse Bill 5094, which has the support of the Michigan Credit Union League, advances to the full House for consideration. \nPHOTO INFORMATION : State Rep. Joseph Bellino, of Monroe, provides testimony for House Bill 5094 before the House Financial Services Committee on Oct. 25.

One of the most widely used sustainable alternatives to petrol world-wide is bioethanol, according to researchers at University of Bristol in the UK. By: PTI | London | Published: December 7, 2017 2:43 PM One of the most widely used sustainable alternatives to petrol world-wide is bioethanol, according to researchers at University of Bristol in the UK. (Reuters) Top News Manmohan Singh to Modi: Congress-led UPA dealt with the corrupt strictly, what BJP has done? \nScientists have made the first step towards creating sustainable petrol using beer as a key ingredient. One of the most widely used sustainable alternatives to petrol world-wide is bioethanol, according to researchers at University of Bristol in the UK. However, ethanol is not an ideal replacement for petrol as it has issues such as lower energy density, it mixes too easily with water and can be fairly corrosive to engines. A much better fuel alternative is butanol but this is difficult to make from sustainable sources. Scientists at Bristol\u2019s School of Chemistry have been working for several years to develop technology to convert widely-available ethanol into butanol. \u201cThe alcohol in alcoholic drinks is actually ethanol \u2013 exactly the same molecule that we want to convert into butanol as a petrol replacement,\u201d said Professor Duncan Wass, whose team led the study published in the journal Catalysis Science & Technology. \n\u201cSo alcoholic drinks are an ideal model for industrial ethanol fermentation broths \u2013 ethanol for fuel is essentially made using a brewing process,\u201d said Wass. \u201cIf our technology works with alcoholic drinks (especially beer which is the best model) then it shows it has the potential to be scaled up to make butanol as a petrol replacement on an industrial scale,\u201d he said. The technology used to convert ethanol into butanol is called a catalyst \u2013 these are chemicals which can speed up and control a chemical reaction and are already widely used in the petrochemical industry. The team\u2019s key finding is that their catalysts will convert beer (or specifically, the ethanol in beer) into butanol. In demonstrating that catalysts work with a \u2018real\u2019 ethanol mixture, the team has demonstrated a key step in scaling this technology up to industrial application. \u201cWe would not actually want to use beer on an industrial scale and compete with potential food crops,\u201d said Wass. \u201cBut there are ways to obtain ethanol for fuel from fermentation that produce something that chemically is very much like beer \u2013 so beer is an excellent readily available model to test our technology,\u201d he said. \nAnother advantage of this approach is that it is quite similar to many existing petrochemical processes, researchers said. The next step in terms of application is to build this larger scale process and, based on previous processes, this could take as long as five years even if everything went well, they said. \u201cTurning beer into petrol was a bit of fun, and something to do with the leftovers of the lab Christmas party, but it has a serious point,\u201d Wass said. \u201cBeer is actually an excellent model for the mixture of chemicals we would need to use in a real industrial process, so it shows this technology is one step closer to reality,\u201d he said.

A dangerous new wildfire erupted in the tony Bel Air area of Los Angeles early Wednesday as firefighters batt... \nVENTURA, Calif. (AP) - The Latest on Southern California wildfires (all times local): \n10:30 p.m. \nA surge from the biggest of the wildfires burning in Southern California has forced several thousand more people to evacuate in a community of artists and resorts. \nVentura County sheriff's Sgt. Eric Buschow says flames have been creeping closer and slowly surrounding the town of Ojai (OH'hi), and Wednesday night increasing winds brought them close enough to expand evacuation orders there. \nFlames, now about 4 miles away, were visible from the city's downtown for the first time on Tuesday night, and ash was raining down. \nParts of Ojai were already under evacuation orders, and the entire valley surrounding it had been under a voluntary evacuation advisory since the fire broke out on Monday. \nThe new evacuations meant most of the town of about 7,000 people was under mandatory orders. \nNearly 30,000 people are under evacuation orders for the fire. \n___ \nThis story corrects the day of the week. \n___ \n7:50 p.m. \nThe largest and most destructive wildfire in Southern California has grown to 140 square miles and fire officials say the worst may be yet to come. \nThe 90,000-acre fire burning in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles has swept through ridges and canyons to the sea and Santa Ana winds that drove it are expected to return with a vengeance overnight. \nState fire director Ken Pimlott says winds that eased in the afternoon could return with gusts up to 80 mph Thursday that would make it impossible to fight the fire. \nDozens of homes have burned since the blaze erupted Monday. Nearly 1,800 firefighters and a fleet of aircraft are fighting the flames but the blaze is only 5 percent contained and an estimated 12,000 buildings are in danger. \n___ \n6:20 p.m. \nA wildfire in a wealthy western area of Los Angeles has reached the estate and winery owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch. \nRoxanne Langer at Moraga Vineyards in Bel Air says a temperature-controlled wine storage shed burned after the fire erupted before dawn Wednesday but it's unclear how much wine was lost. \nShe says firefighters stepped in to douse the flames with the aid of helicopters and that other storage sheds, the winery itself and the estate's unoccupied house are not damaged. \nThe winery has been evacuated. \nMurdoch bought the property for about $30 million in 2013. \nLanger says it appears the 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines suffered only slight damage and the grapes already had been harvested. \nIn a Facebook statement, Murdoch says some neighbors suffered heavy losses and his thoughts and prayers are with them. \n___ \n3:45 p.m. \nFirefighters have stopped the spread of a wildfire that has destroyed homes near the world-famous Getty museum in Los Angeles. \nDeputy Fire Chief Charles Butler says firefighters and aircraft stopped the growth of the 475-acre (192-hectare) blaze in the Bel Air neighborhood. \nThere are currently few visible flames and crews are concentrating on the southwest corner of the fire. \nButler says four homes have been destroyed and 11 damaged since the blaze erupted before dawn Wednesday in an area that includes many hilltop mansions. \nAbout 700 homes, an apartment building and a school have been ordered evacuated. \nNortheast winds driving the flames eased by afternoon but are expected to return in full force Wednesday night. Firefighters are struggling to ring the blaze before that happens. \n___ \n3:15 p.m. \nCalifornia's top firefighter says the state is in for the worst Santa Ana wind conditions it's ever seen. \nKen Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, says the wind wildfire threat to Southern California for Thursday is purple. The has color has never been used before, means there is extreme danger and that fires that erupt will burn uncontrollably. \nBelow that is red, meaning high danger of fires that burn rapidly and intensely and are difficult to control. \nPimlott says the winds could hit 80 mph (129 kph) and make it impossible to fight Southern California wildfires that have destroyed at least 200 homes and buildings. \nFive wind-driven flames continue to threaten homes in Ventura and Los Angeles. Some 200,000 people are under evacuation orders. \n___ \n1:25 p.m. \nThe University of California, Los Angeles, has canceled classes for the rest of the day due to difficult traffic problems stemming from a wildfire. \nThe university's website says many students, faculty and staff have been unable to reach the campus Wednesday, so classes from noon onward are canceled. \nThe athletics department says a night men's basketball game and all other team workouts and practices are canceled. \nThe fire erupted before dawn in the Sepulveda Pass, just up Interstate 405 from UCLA. The fire has destroyed some homes as it spread into the Bel Air area. \n___ \n10 a.m. \nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti says at least four and possibly six homes have been destroyed by a wildfire in the city's Bel Air area. \nThe fire erupted before dawn Wednesday in Sepulveda Pass, a major commuter route between the west side of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to the north. \nThe fire burned up hillsides on the east side of the pass into expensive neighborhoods that are now under evacuation orders. \nThe mayor says the fire is now 150 acres with zero containment. \nSome 500 firefighters are battling the fire along with water-dropping helicopters and airplanes laying down streams of fire retardant. \nThe dangerous Santa Ana winds that have fanned fires across Southern California this week have diminished over the new LA fire but conditions are very dry, with just 9 percent relative humidity. \n___ \n9:15 a.m. \nPresident Donald Trump says his thoughts and prayers \"are with everyone\" in the path of California's latest wildfires. \nTrump in a tweet is also encouraging everyone \"to heed the advice and orders of local and state officials\" and thanking first responders for their \"incredible work!\" \nWind-driven fires have raced through California communities for the second time in two months, leaving hundreds of homes feared lost and uprooting tens of thousands of people. \nThe most damaging fire is in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, where more than 100 square miles (259 sq. kilometers) and numerous homes have burned. \nDeadly fires tore through Northern California earlier this year. \n___ \n8:03 a.m. \nThe biggest and most destructive of several wildfires burning in Southern California has scorched more than 101 square miles. \nState fire authorities say the fire burning in Ventura County about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles is also considered a threat to 12,000 structures Wednesday. \nDozens of homes have burned since the fire erupted Monday amid fierce Santa Ana winds. \nA new fire burning among ridges and canyons on the west side of Los Angeles has also burned several homes while snarling morning commuter traffic. \n___ \n7:35 a.m. \nTwo homes are burning in a wildfire that has erupted in an exclusive ridge-top neighborhood in Los Angeles, the latest to hit fire-plagued Southern California. \nThe fire broke out before dawn Wednesday on the east side of Interstate 405 in the Sepulveda Pass and raced up steep slopes into neighborhoods at the top. \nThe Los Angeles Fire Department has deployed hundreds of firefighters and called in helicopters and airplanes. \nEvacuations have been ordered and a wider area has been told to be ready for orders to leave. \nIt's the same region of Los Angeles where hundreds of homes burned in the famous 1961 Bel Air Fire. \n___ \n6:52 a.m. \nMandatory evacuations have been ordered in an exclusive ridge-top neighborhood in Los Angeles as a dangerous new wildfire burns in Southern California. \nThe fire erupted before dawn Wednesday on the east side of Sepulveda Pass, which carries heavily traveled Interstate 405 through the Santa Monica Mountains on the city's western side. \nHelicopters are making water drops and more than 200 firefighters are battling flames close to homes. \nIn addition to the mandatory evacuations, Los Angeles Fire Department spokeswoman Margaret Stewart says a wider area on the east side of the pass has been advised to get ready in case of evacuation orders. \n___ \n5:35 a.m. \nA brush fire has erupted on the west side of Los Angeles along Interstate 405 in Sepulveda Pass. \nFire Department spokesman Margaret Stewart says the fire was reported at 4:52 a.m. Wednesday and is burning uphill, driven by topography rather than winds. \nStewart says 47 firefighters are on the scene, setting up protection for homes at the top of the steep slopes. Two firefighting helicopters have been assigned. \nSepulveda Pass carries heavily traveled Interstate 405 through the Santa Monica Mountains between the western neighborhoods of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to the north. \n___ \n12:40 a.m. \nThe same vicious winds that made three Southern California wildfires so destructive are also making the firefight itself more difficult. \nThe water-dropping planes and helicopters essential to fighting massive fires have been mostly grounded because it's too dangerous to fly in the strong gusts. \nCommanders hoped to have them back in the air on Wednesday morning, but all indications are the winds will be whipping then too. \nThe blazes brought evacuation orders for nearly 200,000 people, destroyed nearly 200 homes and have remained mostly out control. \nThe largest and most destructive of the blazes, an 85-square-mile wildfire in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, had nearly reached the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday night after starting 30 miles inland a day earlier. \n___ \nThe 5:35 a.m. entry has been corrected to say west side. \n.

Technological advances in artificial intelligence are fuelling a new race between hackers and those toiling to protect cybersecurity networks.THE CANADIAN PRESS/Paul Chiasson \nWhereas past responses to cybercrimes often looked for known hacking methods long after they occurred, AI techniques using machine learning scan huge volumes of data to detect patterns of abnormal behaviour that are imperceptible to humans. \nExperts expect machines will become so sophisticated that they'll develop answers to questions that humans won't clearly understand. \nDavid Decary-Hetu, assistant professor of criminology at the University of Montreal, says defenders have an edge right now in using artificial intelligence. \n\"But who knows what's going to happen in a few years from now,\" he said in an interview. \n\"The main issue is that if you're defending a system you have to be good 100 per cent of the time, but when you're attacking the system you only have to be successful once to get in.\" \nDecary-Hetu said a growing list of corporate and government officials, including Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz, who say infiltrations are their top worry have a very good reason to fear. \nThe Bank of Canada warned in its semi-annual review released this month that the high degree of interconnectedness among Canadian financial institutions means any successful cyberattack could spread widely throughout the financial system. \nReports suggest cybercrime costs the Canadian economy between $3 billion and $5 billion a year, including ransom paid to foreign criminals. \nHacks of Sony Pictures, Uber, Ashley Madison, Yahoo and multinational retailers have sparked unsettling headlines about security of personal information. \nOne of the latest to face scrutiny is global credit-reporting firm Equifax. Hackers accessed the personal information, including names, social insurance and credit card numbers, as well as usernames, passwords and secret question/secret answer data of 19,000 Canadians and 145.5 million Americans. \nCurrent detection systems tend to only recognize improper activity based on past events, often long after the damage is done. \nAn example of this is Equifax, which discovered the breach in July, months after hackers first infiltrated the system. It only notified the public in early September. \nNiranjan Mayya, founder and CEO of Toronto-based Rank Software, said it takes on average 143 days for a breach to be detected. \nThe challenge is growing as the number of connected devices in the world continues to soar. \n\"Clearly the old style techniques of looking at cybersecurity threats and having people go through each threat aren't working anymore, so automated means of detecting threats has become more and more important,\" he said. \nDavid Masson, Canadian manager for U.K.-based Darktrace, said artificial intelligence will help to keep up with threats by quickly identifying and stopping attacks by picking up on subtle markers that identify bad behaviour. \nHe said his company's systems map a customer's entire network, including every user and device, to discern even the slightest deviations as they emerge. \nMasson said AI is needed to keep up with threats by automating defence responses to growing machine-on-machine attacks launched by sophisticated hackers. \n\"You're kind of looking at a cyber arms race,\" he said in an interview. \n\"If you want to keep up with this threat and put the advantage back in the hands of the defenders you're gonna have to use AI.\" \nOntario-based utilities company Energy+ Inc. said installed Darktrace technology alerted it to a user going to a malware site in Russia and uploading undisclosed sensitive data to a third-party cloud provider that its existing security was unable to catch. \nSome observers temper the current exuberance about AI, saying it's not a silver bullet and these are nascent days for the technology. \nReceptiviti CEO Jonathan Kreindler says the hype around artificial intelligence has accelerated and has almost become a branding exercise for some companies that aren't even offering truly leading edge technology. \n\"The term AI is now being applied to any sort of algorithmic reasoning unfortunately,\" said Kreindler. \nHis firm uses AI to scour writings for unconscious use of language to understand the psychological state of company insiders who are responsible for 80 per cent of cybersecurity issues. \nCanada's largest IT company, CGI Group, said artificial intelligence is a growing field of interest for customers, although the average client is in the fairly early stages of considering AI adoption in cybersecurity. \nCGI cybersecurity expert Andrew Rogoyski said that still puts them one step ahead of most hackers, who are typically interested in stealing data using the cheapest tools possible. \nRogoyski added that he expects a strengthening of defensive mechanisms might force hackers to also adopt innovative techniques such as AI. \n\"There's a race, it's been going on for 20 years plus and the race just keeps evolving. We keep leapfrogging each other,\" he said.
