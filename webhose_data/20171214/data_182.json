Maybe even renegotiate their contracts if they are willing to play for less money on a team with intentions to contend.\nFor the Clippers the intention was to get some good youngish players that are on affordable deals. Lue is gone next season since Clips cant resign him and the best they could get for him is a late 1st witch is basically a bench player. The market for DJ is not that great so getting a good young player with some upside will be very hard. The best Clips can hope for is getting TT and Bro 1st but i seriously doubt that the cavs would do it. I agree that Kuzma and Nance seem a little light for giving up DJ and eating Deng but i doubt either team could find a better deal. Clarkson for Lue seems like a similar value deal and Clippers will need a guard for the future.

I think it was also the first time we had two natural left-footers in the team, at left-back and left midfield. \n\"We pushed Jordan Donnelly up from midfield into attack, alongside Jordan Prescott and the pair were brilliant, they worked really hard and gave their defenders a terrible time, they were a real handful. \n\"We fell behind after we had missed an open goal and another good chance but the reaction by the lads was excellent, we equalised two minutes later. Then we shot out of the blocks in the second half and blew them away.\" \nAfter they fell behind at Church Lane a new-found resilience saw them hit back through Thomas Gardiner. And once they took the lead through the impressive Prescott there was no way back for New Mills, who fell further behind to Michael Gervin's brace. \nSubstitute Ulrich Ngamba put the gloss on their victory with a fifth goal a minute from time. \nAlthough it was a huge confidence boost, Roberts can go through the rest of the season safe in the knowledge they are safe from the threat of relegation, since the Hallmark Security League's reorganisation for next term means no one will take the drop this season. \nDespite this, Roberts is keen to climb the table and give all the players at the club a chance to prove they should remain at Daisy Hill next season. \n\"There's a nice buzz about the place,\" he added. \"We feel like the season's started for us now, I said to the lads after Saturday's win we will lose more games this season but we won't get hammered in any. \n\"We've got a 'no train, no play' policy now. Scott Derbyshire [first-team coach] takes the sessions and the attitude of the boys is really good, they are looking fit. \n\"Michael Gervin is a fit lad and he is really talented behind the front men too, he showed at New Mills just what he can do when he adds the work rate to his ability. \n\"I want all the lads to show me they should be here next season \u2013 we're not going up or down this season but I want to go into summer on a high, I want us to put a good run of results together and get towards the middle of the table by playing good football.

\nATHERTON Collieries may have lost their fixture at Scarborough Athletic but their 1-0 defeat shows just how far they have progressed in recent years. \nA huge club with big ambitions, Scarborough have an illustrious past, but on Saturday the two sides met as equals, and Colls provided the East Yorkshire outfit with what they declared had been their toughest test to date. \nWith over a week\u2019s rest behind them, Michael Clegg\u2019s side went into the game ready and refreshed. With Ryan Salmon the only injury concern, Jordan Cover led the attacking line with a midfield five behind him. \nIn truth, the game was a tight affair from the opening exchanges. \nScarborough registered the first effort on goal with just three minutes played but after a square pass found Nathan Curtis in the centre of the area he tapped well wide of the mark. \nThe pace and strength of Cover is central to any Colls attacking moves and, on nine minutes, a ball zipped across the Flamingo Land Stadium\u2019s artificial surface and was taken wide by the forward. He cut back inside before curling a smart effort at goal which the home players were relieved to see go narrowly the wrong side of the post. \nThe game\u2019s only goal came midway through the first half. A cross into the area was latched upon well by Scarborough\u2019s Michael Coulson and he used his height to head the ball across goal and towards the back of the net. Initially, it looked as if the Colls defence would claw it away but there was just enough pace on the finish for it to find its way over the line via a deflection. \nAtherton reacted well, playing with confidence but it was Scarborough who went closer to a second goal, Sam Hewitt\u2019s header from a corner bouncing back off the bar. \nThe last effort of the half fell to winger Ben Hardcastle, three minutes from time. From just inside the top right-hand corner of the area the winger turned and drove a fierce low effort, and Tom Taylor had to be alert to get down to prevent the equaliser. \nIf the first half had been a good, solid 45 minutes of football, then the second was a fantastic display from Clegg\u2019s men, for whom the only thing missing was a goal. \nDefender Danny Lambert opened the half by slicing a stray effort wide five minutes after the restart, a sign of things to come for the Colls faithful who, once again, had travelled in their numbers and made a huge amount of noise throughout the match. \nScarborough\u2019s sole chance of the second half came on the hour mark, when a ball into the box was not cleared until after a heart-stopping game of pinball around the area ended with a desperate hoof upfield. \nFor the last 20 minutes of the game Atherton dominated and Hardcastle curled one wide after making space for himself on the edge of the area. \nFour minutes later Gareth Peet came closest as, from a similar position, a sublime shot on goal rattled against the bar. \nSubstitute Brad Cooke had a huge impact, the midfielder acting as a target man as he won every ball and made the afternoon for Scarborough\u2019s defenders a nightmare. \nTwo headers in quick succession came and went, the first sent over the goal by Cooke and the second only kept out by a wonderful stop by the back-pedalling Taylor, who somehow tipped the ball over the bar. \nUltimately, it was not meant to be for Colls, who worked unbelievably hard throughout the second period of the game and pushed Scarborough all the way. \nThis Saturday, Colls will hope they can deliver the result their performances deserve as they return to the Kensite Stadium to welcome Droylsden.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scarborough", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ryan salmon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hardcastle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danny lambert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gareth peet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben hardcastle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atherton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nathan curtis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael clegg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael coulson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam hewitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad cooke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cooke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clegg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "atherton collieries", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "scarborough", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "scarborough athletic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan cover", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east yorkshire", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kensite stadium", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:15.084+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "02e4c95c1d67a80f0852242cbc42e174f8ff98ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYuT5qiMNUsbweeo7yghfVb1LhsZAnPbE5OR6xRdWX9dMRuIEWMACI4bOpolkKEheK4UqI3elqd_yXcbkdYdhNQX7Qej8xIx79_ggqIO9EABM3gsFuHHVeb6yHUJTaMk9Rw--", "site_full": "www.adverts.ie", "site": "adverts.ie", "site_section": "http://www.adverts.ie/for-sale/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Adverts.ie - Recent Ads All 826,988 listings", "title": "JJRC H36 2.4GHz 4CH 6 Axis Quadcopter Drone", "title_full": "JJRC H36 2.4GHz 4CH 6 Axis Quadcopter Drone", "published": "2017-12-07T11:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://a1.amlimg.com/YTY5MGM2YTBjMjFhY2FkNDhiZTUxNGJhYTkxMzU5OTj_G4Ka1YhapnPilcYxUCAzaHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmFkc2ltZy5jb20vMGIzMTU1MjYyYzQzMjcxYTA0MDQ4NmJmN2QzNDU3MTgwOThlMDNjY2I0ODkwNjQ3YjZkYTEyYjQ2N2MyMGVkMC5qcGd8fHx8fHwzOTN4Mjk0fGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuYWR2ZXJ0cy5pZS9zdGF0aWMvaS93YXRlcm1hcmsucG5nfHx8.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "02e4c95c1d67a80f0852242cbc42e174f8ff98ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYuT5qiMNUsbweeo7yghfVb1LhsZAnPbE5OR6xRdWX9dMRuIEWMACI4bOpolkKEheK4UqI3elqd_yXcbkdYdhNQX7Qej8xIx79_ggqIO9EABM3gsFuHHVeb6yHUJTaMk9Rw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "JJRC H36 2.4GHz 4CH 6 Axis Quadcopter Drone", "text": "JJRC H36 2.4GHz 4CH 6 Axis Quadcopter Drone Description \nCondition: New \nJust click below \u2018View All Ads\u2019 we have 3 drones on promotion this week and you can get an extra battery worth \u20ac10 for free!

Maybe she isn\u2019t the problem. \nI was bullied at school. I may have mentioned it. From my very first day, when I ran enthusiastically to the Wendy house and put on a skirt from the dressing up box, to my last, when I unpacked my things from my locker \u2013 covered in knife marks and homophobic graffiti \u2013 I was tortured. It took many forms over the years, from the regular, violent stuff or the name-calling, to the more covert exclusion from games, victimisation through rumour mills, mocking of my intellect or lack thereof. It was, to say the least, very wearing. I would lie in bed at night, not always crying or scared, but usually puzzled, dismantling my personality piece by piece and examining it, wondering what I could change or suppress to make it stop. I would sing songs to myself or make up stories about what it would be like to walk into school one day and be\u2026 not popular, because I was never that deluded, but just allowed to exist, be myself with no fear of reprisals, not to have every movement or word scrutinised at all times, to simply be. I never got to find out. Every single day was a heavy weight on my back, like an extra rucksack full of stones. My eyes were dead and my smile pained. I retreated into books, and Lego, and a determination to get out of there as soon as I could. I was driven by the idea that one day, somewhere, I would live my best life, with no apologies and no regrets. I\u2019m still working on it. \nIn 2008, years later, when the bullies\u2019 faces had melded into one and they became a distant echo, a fever dream rather than the constant nightmare of my youth, I saw something special about a contestant on The X Facto r. Step forward, Alexandra Burke. What could we possibly have in common? Very little on the face of it. I was a northern gay guy 12 years her senior. She grew up in Islington, and was a regular, if exceptionally talented, girl. And yet I saw a light in her eyes that made me think, \u201cShe just wants something better\u201d. Hunger, maybe, but born of starvation, not gluttony. All X Factor contestants tell you \u201cthey really want it\u201d and that it \u201cmeans the world\u201d but when I looked at Alexandra, I thought, \u201cYeah, she really does. In fact, she needs it.\u201d \nShe wasn\u2019t the favourite, by a long shot, either with the public or judges. But as one by one her competition dropped out, she began to shine \u2013 it was like watching a star being born before your eyes. She always seemed wary, however \u2013 worried about letting too much of herself show. She was young, but she wasn\u2019t stupid; she knew how it went, and who you had to be if you were a young black woman on Saturday night primetime TV. She\u2019d witnessed fellow Londoner Rachel Hylton being destroyed in the press for speaking her mind about the show, and for having a past. It must have been terrifying. There were contestants younger, blander, whiter and more\u2026 middle England than Alexandra, but none as talented and yet, TV contests voted by the public being what they are, it was still a surprise to find Alexandra in the show\u2019s first \u2013 and as far as I know only \u2013 all non-white final, when she faced boyband JLS in the very last showdown. Everyone reckons the show-stopping duet with Beyonc\u00e9 won her the show but, as epic as it was, I dismiss that. Her performance of the winner\u2019s single afterward is what clinched it. Note-perfect, every word of a song she had likely only heard for the first time three weeks before \u2013 with a controversial Westlife-esque arrangement that had Leonard Cohen fans frothing \u2013 sung like she\u2019d lived it, and meant it. Hallelujah indeed. \nBut from such a high there can be only a fall. Alexandra\u2019s came fast, before she\u2019d even left the studio. Excited by her win and pulled in every direction by presenter Dermot O\u2019Leary trying to get her to first speak and then sing, she fell to her knees, tried to take in what he was saying and, when shown it, grabbed her winner\u2019s CD single, dedicating it to everyone who voted for her. It was a gushing, emotional, starry reaction \u2013 truly a woman who could not believe she had won. Her debut album, released ten months later, was called Overcome. Boy, was she. But the reaction jarred with some. Only two years earlier, another female non-white winner, Leona Lewis, had stood kind of meekly embarrassed while talked through her win by then-presenter (and much better) Kate Thornton. She showed humility, disbelief, as did Alexandra, but Alex\u2019s reaction was more \u201cOMG YES\u201d \u2013 as anyone\u2019s would be, surely. Joyous, unrestrained. I sensed eyes narrowing across the country. \nA few years later she returned to The X Factor as a guest judge, standing in for a \u201creally sick\u201d Kelly Rowland. Alex was excited to be there. What a coup to be the first contestant to cross over to the judges\u2019 desk, to be the only one who truly knew how it felt to be on that stage putting everything you had into that performance. Alexandra was only too aware that chances like this didn\u2019t come along every day. So she was a little over the top, she was extra, boisterous. She stole the show, especially with her \u201cOK.com\u201d catchphrase \u2013 and the rest of the panel wasn\u2019t happy. Gary Barlow, a tax-shy, sentient oatmeal biscuit, rolled his eyes and mugged through all her (valid, helpful) feedback to the contestants, while Tulisa was very probable relieved not to be the newcomer for once and grimaced alongside, while Louis Walsh, whose last constructive comment on The X Factor sadly goes unrecorded, because it has never happened, also joined in. From then on, it was open season on Alexandra. \nAccusations of fakeness can be hard to quantify. It\u2019s a word bandied around about reality TV stars or presenters. Nobody seems to realise that if everyone in the public eye behaved like a \u201cnormal\u201d person, the entertainment world would be full of deathly dull cardboard cutouts with all the verve of a bank manager or a Sainsbury\u2019s self-checkout. With Alexandra, however, this supposed fakeness seems to inspire genuine, inexplicable, hatred \u2013 or at least the internet\u2019s closest version of it. This year she\u2019s performing on Strictly Come Dancing \u2013 go take a look on Twitter whenever she\u2019s on camera. Some of the things people say about her are absolutely wild. You\u2019d think all these people had been personally wronged by her, that she had said and done some monstrous things in the past, not simply been a bit\u2026 I don\u2019t know, what is it? Full-on? Confident? Talented? Grateful? She can\u2019t win. She clams up and says nothing \u2013 it means she\u2019s cold and distant; people say they can\u2019t \u201cwarm\u201d to her. She gushes with joy about being on the show, or getting a good score \u2013 she\u2019s a phoney, not being real, has an ulterior motive, or just wants to win. She stays straight-faced and listens to judges\u2019 feedback, promises to do better next week \u2013 she\u2019s too earnest, taking it too seriously. She sheds a tear over the death of her mother, who died days before the series started, or at the departure of a fellow contestant \u2013 she\u2019s playing for votes, is laying it on thick, playing the sympathy card. So, you see, there is nothing left for Alexandra to do except\u2026 well what? Drop dead live on air?I guess then she\u2019d be accused of martyrdom or spoiling everyone\u2019s Saturday night. It\u2019s that heavy, wearing sensation; it\u2019s the rucksack full of stones. It is a sleepless night of \u201cWhat do they want from me?\u201d She can\u2019t do anything right, so what should she do? Give up? Hell no. She\u2019s carrying on. Alexandra is appearing on the latest series of Strictly Come Dancing (BBC) \nAlexandra isn\u2019t the only contestant on the show to attract mystifying criticism. 59-year-old Debbie McGee, who was married to the late Paul Daniels, has also shown natural aptitude and has been in turns just as gushing and serious as Alexandra, and she too has been accused of being a \u201cringer\u201d \u2013 Alexandra has performed in the West End; Debbie had a ballet school \u2013 and playing on the public\u2019s sympathies. What do you think the public are so frightened of when it comes to these two women? But Debbie\u2019s treatment has been nothing compared with Alexandra\u2019s. Week after week, an onslaught of ridiculous tabloid tales: she doesn\u2019t get on with anyone; she\u2019s a diva backstage; she is furious her partner Gorka is romancing another contestant; she had a screaming meltdown after being in the dance-off. Relentless, malicious and damaging claims that especially stick when the subject is a young black woman. But why are the tabloids so keen to bring her down? You could argue it\u2019s a personal vendetta, but it\u2019s more likely they\u2019re merely tapping into the public\u2019s perception of her as an easy way to get clicks on links and eyes on pages, reinforcing their suspicions about her. \nIt\u2019s very difficult to have a conversation about Alexandra sometimes because as soon as you do, someone who doesn\u2019t like her will pop up unprompted and remind you they\u2019re definitely not racist. The deafening denials shut down any debate because, as we know, to be accused of being a racist is a much worse predicament than the actual existence of racism. It would perhaps be lazy and simplistic to state that the sole reason people can\u2019t \u201cwarm\u201d to Alexandra is that she\u2019s black \u2013 and people will queue up to tell you otherwise, and that it\u2019s something that \u201ccan\u2019t quite put their finger on\u201d. In our post-woke world, that something as basic as disliking someone based on their skin colour should still exist feels reductive. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that,\u201d they say, \u201cit must be something else\u201d, like racism was lasered out of existence just because Obama was president and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s still really popular. \nSo instead we go through the motions and take apart Alexandra\u2019s personality, her psychological makeup. She is beautiful, talented, confident, believes in herself, works hard, enthusiastic, grateful, eager to please \u2013 so far this is the best school report in the world, right? But she is also, according to some, gushing, over complimentary, talkative, excitable, dramatic, theatrical, over the top, grating, mildly annoying, calculating, overly humble and modest \u2013 some of these are direct quotes. But when you look at the other contestants on the show, are NONE of them also like this? Are none of US? Does blond, pale, pretty Mollie \u2013 who was in a girlband for years \u2013 not gush about how she loves being on the show, or celebrate when she\u2019s through, or crease up in gratitude, or try really hard? Is she not mildly irritating, as indeed we all are at some point? Same with Gemma (blond, white, actress). All the supposed negative character traits Alex (and to a certain extent Debbie) expresses are present and correct in her fellow female contestants. Male too, actually: Davood was effusive and practised like a demon, taking it very seriously. So why do they get a free pass when it comes to this behaviour? It is true that we must be careful when attributing low public votes to race \u2013 Strictly has always been about personalities as much as talent. Viewers like a journey, humility; they are tribal and, unlike the show\u2019s judges, look to past glories as well as current performance. Alexandra and dance partner Gorka M\u00e0rquez. (BBC) \nBut why are Alexandra and Debbie under such scrutiny, every action or word open to wilful misinterpretation? The only thing different from the others\u2019 behaviour is totally superficial \u2013 Debbie is an older woman, and Alexandra is a black one. And both of them are good, and neither of them are behaving as this bizarre hive mind that is the British public would expect someone \u201clike them\u201d to behave. Why can Debbie get her legs so high? How can she do those lifts at her age? And as for Alexandra, well\u2026 what is it? If it isn\u2019t her skin colour, what\u2019s the problem? She\u2019s too confident? Why don\u2019t you want her to be confident? Must we always slice the tall poppies in two? She annoys you \u2013 OK, why exactly? You can\u2019t put a finger on it? Try. She\u2019s too fake? What does that mean? What\u2019s lacking in authenticity for you? The way she expresses gratitude? You don\u2019t believe she means it? Why? She\u2019s not from a privileged background, or a stage school brat \u2013 so why wouldn\u2019t she be genuinely grateful to be where she is now? Why does it shock you a celebrity can still feel impostor syndrome? Are we so jaded we assume she\u2019s lying to get our sympathies? It\u2019s working a treat, isn\u2019t it? \nOr maybe the problem is in the delivery. The way she speaks, her movements, her lingo. What is it that bothers you? Be precise, show your working. She talks like a confident young black woman from London, who knows every part of her behaviour is scrutinised from all angles, because she is expected to be a certain way to avoid upsetting the nice folks at home \u2013 and yet still can\u2019t help herself sometimes showing actual emotion. She knows she has to work ten times harder, because there are instant expectations on someone of her background, who looks like her, who speaks like her. She grabs onto the positive, trying to make it work, stay focused, stay upbeat, not show emotion, get angry in case she seems aggressive, to speak plainly in case they think she\u2019s faking it, not use too much slang or webspeak in case she seems unapproachable, too \u201cstreet\u201d or too common. She tries not to sound too starry or articulate in case she comes off as having ideas above her station, forgetting who she is, or where she came from \u2013 like anyone would ever let her. Imagine what it\u2019s like being in Alexandra Burke\u2019s head for even five minutes and have this internal merry-go-round of self-doubt, anxiety, bewilderment at what you\u2019ve done wrong, and desperation to do your best and be the person you want to be. And then imagine how exhausting it must be. Would you even get out of bed in the morning? And this isn\u2019t unique to her Strictly experience \u2013 this ghost has chased her a long time, completely without foundation. \nYou say this isn\u2019t about race. OK. The people who don\u2019t like her may well not be racist, and there\u2019s more to disliking someone than sheer optics, but the immediate, unwritten expectations placed on this young woman on her behaviour, personality and looks are ALL about race \u2013 ask any black woman you know. \nShe probably won\u2019t win Strictly Come Dancing; her journey hasn\u2019t been as distinct as some other contestants\u2019 and she has been unapologetically excellent in almost every dance, which is a turn-off to viewers who like a trackable narrative and fairy-tale endings. She will probably take it on the chin \u2013 she can\u2019t win every Saturday night. But while there\u2019s no law that says you have to love her, or even like her, for putting up with the ceaseless, vicious, malevolent abuse week after week simply for being herself, she deserves nothing less than your total, unwavering respect. Bow down. \nAnd, Alexandra, remember what Beyonc\u00e9 told you in that famous duet, which I watch once a month without fail: \u201cSing it, girl\u201d. \nAnd don\u2019t you ever stop. \nA slightly different version of this piece was sent out to subscribers of The Truth About Everything*, my semi-regular mailout.

Pool Previous Next \nThe White House's chief lawyer told President Donald Trump in January he believed then-national security adviser Michael Flynn had misled the FBI and lied to Vice President Mike Pence and should be fired, a source familiar with the matter said Monday . \nThe description of the conversation raises new questions about what Trump knew about Flynn's situation when he urged then-FBI Director James Comey to drop the investigation into Flynn and whether anyone in the White House, including the President himself, attempted to obstruct justice. Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians, a probe led by Comey until Trump fired him. \nWhite House counsel Donald McGahn told Trump that based on his conversation with then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates, he believed Flynn had not told the truth in his interview with the FBI or to Pence, the source said. McGahn did not tell the President that Flynn had violated the law in his FBI interview or was under criminal investigation, the source said. \nThe Washington Post first reported that Trump knew Flynn had likely provided inaccurate information to the FBI and Pence. \n\"I believe the facts exonerate the President and I'm not going to debate these important issues between the White House and the special counsel in the press,\" White House special counsel Ty Cobb told CNN. \nPresident Donald Trump's personal attorney, John Dowd, said Monday the President cannot be guilty of obstructing justice, according to an interview with Axios. \n\"(The) President cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer under (the Constitution's Article II) and has every right to express his view of any case,\" Dowd told Axios. \nDowd declined to comment to CNN on this story. \nDowd had earlier said that he wrote a weekend tweet from Trump's account after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the US during the presidential transition. \n\"I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI,\" the Saturday tweet reads. \"He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\" \nYates did not share with McGahn \"any description of what (the) FBI had asked Flynn or specifically what he had said,\" the source told CNN. \n\"They didn't think they were in a position to decide whether he had committed a crime,\" according to the source. \nIt is not clear whether FBI investigators had conclusively determined Flynn was lying to them at the time McGahn approached Trump. \nYates testified to Congress in May that she told McGahn she was concerned Flynn was compromised because the Russians knew the true contents of Flynn's conversations about US sanctions with Russia's then-Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. \nAt the time McGahn approached Trump, the White House counsel had no information beyond what Yates told him, according to the source. \nA week later, McGahn was provided a transcript of what Flynn and Kislyak discussed and the conclusion was that it was inconsistent with what Pence said publicly he had been told by the national security adviser. \nDespite McGahn's recommendation that Trump fire Flynn, the retired lieutenant general was kept on. Flynn was forced out in mid-February after news outlets reported about Yates' warning to McGahn. Copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The front is fiberoptic which helps some. It has a windowed hood to let in light while protecting the fiberoptic bead.\nIt's too bad those Express M-70's had one contour for .458, .416 and .375. May have made sense to the bean counters. Of course, the .375 had the least metal removed with its smaller bore, leaving way too much steel in the 24\" barrel. The difference in handling from heavy 24\" factory to the configuration you see with mine, is remarkable.\nIf you could handle the before and after, you'd become an instant believer.\nDF\n#12441553 - 12/04/17 Re: Winchester Model 70 \"Classic Express\" .375 H&H [ Re: WagonMaster ] Joined: Jun 2003\nPosts: 31,212 jorgeI\nCampfire Oracle jorgeI\nCampfire Oracle\nJoined: Jun 2003\nPosts: 31,212\nOrange Park, Florida Out of the box and eleven African animals later...\nTeddy Roosevelt, John Wayne, Winston Churchill paid to hunt... #12441631 - 12/04/17 Re: Winchester Model 70 \"Classic Express\" .375 H&H [ Re: WagonMaster ] Joined: Nov 2010\nPosts: 20,601 Dirtfarmer\nCampfire Kahuna Dirtfarmer\nCampfire Kahuna\nJoined: Nov 2010\nPosts: 20,601\nCentral Louisiana Not bad...\nNut behind the trigger do make a difference...\nDF\nAlpha\n#12444258 - 12/05/17 Re: Winchester Model 70 \"Classic Express\" .375 H&H [ Re: jorgeI ] Joined: May 2004\nPosts: 1,113 ar15a292f\nCampfire Regular ar15a292f\nCampfire Regular\nJoined: May 2004\nPosts: 1,113\nIndiana Jorge, I've heard that H414 burns dirty and is very temperature sensitive but I see that the proof is in the group, outstanding shooting.

Some like Big Game and I see Nosler listing RL-19 as accuracy powder for 300 gr.\nSo, the H&H is pretty versatile regarding powders that will work. RL-16 and 17 may be worth trying. CFE-223 (Pw Pro 2000-LR) are in that general burn rate.
