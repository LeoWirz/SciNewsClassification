NiceHash, the largest Bitcoin mining marketplace, has been hacked, which resulted in the theft of more than 4,700 Bitcoins worth over $57 million (at the time of breach). And guess what? You'll be surprised to know that the stolen BTC now worth over $70 million\u2014in less than 24 hours. Founded in 2014, NiceHash is a cloud-based crypto-mining marketplace that connects people from all over the world to rent out their spare computing power to other in order to create new coins. On Wednesday, several NiceHash users reported that their BTC wallets had been emptied, which was later confirmed by NiceHash after its service went offline claiming to be undergoing maintenance. At the time of writing, the NiceHash service is still offline with a post on its website , confirming that \"there has been a security breach involving NiceHash website,\" and that hackers stole the contents of the NiceHash Bitcoin wallet. The company did not provide any further details about the security incident, but it did say that NiceHash has paused its operations for next 24 hours while it figures out exactly how many numbers of BTC were swiped from its website and how it was taken. Although NiceHash has not confirmed the number of bitcoins stolen from its virtual wallet, some of its customers have circulated a wallet address that suggests around 4,736 BTC\u2014worth more than $70 million based on today's price\u2014in total were drained from the company's wallet. NiceHash has initiated an investigation into the matter, and has reported the incident to the \"relevant authorities and law enforcement\" and has been \"co-operating with them as a matter of urgency.\" The company also assured its customers that it is \"fully committed to restoring the NiceHash service with the highest security measures at the earliest opportunity,\" but it's still unclear how the company will manage to settle everything if it is unable to compensate the total loss. \"We understand that you will have a lot of questions, and we ask for patience and understanding while we investigate the causes and find the appropriate solutions for the future of the service. We will endeavor to update you at regular intervals,\" the company says. Following the security incident, NiceHash is recommending its customers to change their passwords\u2014both on NiceHash and other services, if they are using the same credentials. NiceHash is the latest cryptocurrency company to suffer a significant blow in recent months. Another major hack took place last month due to a flaw in Parity's wallet that caused over $160 million in ETH (Ether) to be frozen, while nearly $32 million in ETH was stolen by hackers in July.

Here is the team I\u2019d like to see Arsene Wenger select\u2026. \nGoalkeeper: Ospina \nOspina is available again after recovering from a groin injury that hampered him last month so he should take his place in goal with Cech obviously rested. \nDefence: Chambers, Mertesacker, Holding \nChambers was forced to play in the right wing-back role against Cologne but it\u2019s safe to say it didn\u2019t work so I\u2019d like to see him return in the back three tomorrow night. \nMertesacker should marshall the side once again while Holding should be given another chance to impress with Koscielny and Monreal rested. Mustafi is nursing a thigh injury that forced him off against Man Utd at the weekend but he\u2019d have been left out anyway. \nMidfield: Nelson, Wilshere, Coquelin, Maitland-Niles \nDue to our options in attack, and the fact I prefer to see him in the middle, I hope Wenger gives Wilshere a chance in central midfield. Despite the boss deploying him further forward this season, I think it\u2019s still his best position and his only realistic hope of forcing his way in to the first team on a regular basis. \nI\u2019d go with Coquelin ahead of Elneny alongside Wilshere while we should see Maitland-Niles start in the left wing-back role once again with Ramsey, Xhaka and Kolasinac rested. \nObviously Bellerin will also be given a breather and I hope Nelson comes back in to the side. The 17-year-old was only fit enough to be a substitute against Cologne due to illness so let\u2019s hope Wenger gives him another run out from the start tomorrow. \nAttack: Welbeck, Walcott, Giroud \nWalcott is set to start after recovering from a virus and he badly needs a positive performance as it\u2019s been a poor campaign from Theo so far this season. \nWelbeck needs to get some match fitness under his belt having recently returned from injury so I\u2019d go with him in attack and have the likes of Iwobi on the bench. \nGiroud also needs to improve on his match sharpness as his lack of minutes are starting to show. He\u2019s looked rusty when he\u2019s come on in the league and hasn\u2019t been doing much in the cups lately so let\u2019s hope for a better performance from him tomorrow. \nLacazette, Sanchez and Ozil will all be rested but I hope we see Nketiah at some point in the second half. \nThis is the team I\u2019d like to see: Loading...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nelson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koscielny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nketiah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monreal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mustafi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walcott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giroud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ozil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilshere", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wenger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bate borisov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arsene wenger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xhaka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ospina  ospina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iwobi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bellerin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "man utd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolasinac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanchez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "welbeck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giroud  walcott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lacazette", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "europa league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "theo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coquelin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elneny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emirates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cologne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "midfield", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:51.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "20f04995056a16acb13bb3db4bcc36572b109d9a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxYLQsOVnS_H6ddbUeRjCtl7aHh11qST8zcmWvU2AtNfi", "site_full": "blog.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/blog?query=a&start=11&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "\ube44\ub178\uc778\ube4c\ub77c Vino in Villa", "title_full": "\ube44\ub178\uc778\ube4c\ub77c Vino in Villa : \ub124\uc774\ubc84 \ube14\ub85c\uadf8", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "KS", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://blogthumb2.naver.net/MjAxNzEyMDVfMTc4/MDAxNTEyNDcyMTgwNDA5.fKuv4350YvXIdTiP0hRNwgu8ObEAqv6yymKiHq2K1xUg.6MkutN11ApofB9jKMyqtIWXWzES-er1zjAl5dMkiM0cg.JPEG.ohyoukat/output_2401173426.jpg?type=w2", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "20f04995056a16acb13bb3db4bcc36572b109d9a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxYLQsOVnS_H6ddbUeRjCtl7aHh11qST8zcmWvU2AtNfi", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "\uc624\uc720", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\ube44\ub178\uc778\ube4c\ub77c Vino in Villa", "text": "restaurant \ube44\ub178\uc778\ube4c\ub77c Vino in Villa 1\uc2dc\uac04 \uc804 URL \ubcf5\uc0ac \ubcf8\ubb38 \uae30\ud0c0 \uae30\ub2a5 \uc9c0\ub3c4\ub85c \ubcf4\uae30 \uc804\uccb4\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc9c0\ub3c4\ub2eb\uae30 \ubc88\uc5ed\ubcf4\uae30 http://blog.naver.com/ohyoukat/221157809033 On Monday, we had tickets to go see an opera concert. We were looking to make reservations at a restaurant inside the Seoul Arts Center, but they were all booked. I found a nice Italian restaurant within walking distance, so we made reservations at Vino in Villa instead.\nThe bread was warm and toasty.\nChicken Caesar Salad (\u20a916,800)\nIt definitely looks different from the classic chicken caesar salad that I\u2019m used to seeing, but it was very tasty! The lettuce strips are long, so it\u2019s easier to transfer the salad onto individual plates and then cutting into bite sized pieces before eating..or you could just stuff the whole thing into your mouth.\nMushroom Risotto with Walnut and Truffle Oil (\u20a919,800)\nThis was my favorite dish. The truffle oil was fragrant, but not overpowering. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had walnuts in risotto before, but it added a nice crunch and nutty flavor.\nSeafood Risotto in Tomato Sauce (\u20a919,800)\nThey really didn\u2019t hold back on the seafood. It was tasty, but I definitely liked the mushroom risotto more.\nTagliatelle with Hanwoo Fillet and Mushroom (\u20a923,000)\nThis restaurant is know for using fresh pasta, and it definitely has a different texture from dry pasta. Hanwoo is premium beef in Korea, and while it was super tasty, it was a little over cooked for me. However, I usually like my beef medium-rare, so I guess it all depends on your preference.\nSpaghetti with Seafood, Nurungji, and Tomato Sauce (\u20a921,000)\nThis was more of a Italian-Korean fusion dish. Nurungji is a the crusty, over cooked rice at the bottom of a pan. Some people eat it hard as it is, some add sugar, and some people add barley tea and soften it up and eat it. Anyway, it was kind of like eating spaghetti and risotto in one dish. The menu said it was a little spicy, but I didn\u2019t really feel any kick.\n\ube44\ub178\uc778\ube4c\ub77c \uc11c\uc6b8\ud2b9\ubcc4\uc2dc \uc11c\ucd08\uad6c \ub0a8\ubd80\uc21c\ud658\ub85c319\uae38

2017-12-07 13:54:17.0 BdST The Rajshahi University administration has moved against two teachers for including \u2018racially discriminatory questions\u2019 in the Fine Arts I Unit entrance exams. \nDean of Fine Arts Prof Mostafizur Rahman and Painting, Oriental Art and Printmaking Division Assistant Prof Md Zillur Rahman have been banned from participating in exams for the next 10 years. \nIn addition, Zillur Rahman\u2019s promotion to associate professor will be delayed by five years. \nThe decision was taken at the university\u2019s 474th syndicate meeting on Wednesday night, syndicate member Md Mamun Abdul Quayyum told bdnews24.com. \n\u201cIt was also decided that Prof Mostafiz will be removed from the dean\u2019s post If there are no legal restrictions against it,\u201d he said. \nMultiple choice question number 76 of the Fine Arts I Unit Entrance Exam\u2019s second set stated: \n\u201cWhich is the world\u2019s greatest book? (a) The Holy Quran Sharif (b) The Holy Bible (c) The Holy Injil or (d) The Gita\u201d \nThe word \u2018holy\u2019 was not used before the Gita. \nQuestion number 41 on the same set said: \u201cOn what date did the Myanmar military and Buddhists conduct an armed attack on Muslim Rohingyas?\u201d \nCriticism of the questions poured in after the exam. \nFine Arts Department Dean Mostafizur Rahman himself said at the time that it was not right to include such questions. \nOn Oct 28 the administration formed a probe led by Deputy Vice Chancellor Prof Ananda Kumar Saha. The other members of the committee were English Department Prof Md Shahidullah, Applied Physics Department Prof Abu Bakar Md Ismail and Chemistry Department Prof M Nazrul Islam. \nThe syndicate took their decision after receiving the probe report. \nNahid Haider, an MBA student, has been permanently expelled for beating Prof Hasanat Ali, a teacher at the Institute of Business Administration. \nAli has also been warned to improve his behaviour with students, said syndicate member Mamun. \nNahid, who was doing an internship with Ali, attacked him on Sept 25 over a signature on an internship paper. He was detained by police immediately afterwards in a case over the incident. \nA probe led by IBA Prof Md Mohsin Ul Islam investigated the matter.

Bradley totalled 114.1 million dollars for the third quarter ended October 28, 2017 compared to 126.7 million dollars in the prior year third quarter ended October 29, 2016, while net income was 0.4 million dollars or 0.01 dollar per diluted share compared to 8.8 million dollars or 0.24 dollar per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, the company\u2019s net income totalled 8.3 million dollars or 0.23 dollar per diluted share against 7.6 million dollars or 0.21 dollar per diluted share. \nCommenting on the third quarter results, Robert Wallstrom, Vera Bradley\u2019s CEO said in a statement: \u201cOur ability to implement certain expense reductions in conjunction with the initial implementation of our Vision 20/20 plan more quickly than originally expected, along with diligent expense management, drove third quarter EPS meaningfully ahead of our guidance.\u201d Third quarter result highlights \nCurrent year third quarter direct segment revenues totalled 83.2 million dollars, a 3.4 percent and comparable sales including e-commerce decreased 7.4 percent for the quarter reflecting a 6.9 percent decline in comparable store sales and an 8.6 percent decrease in e-commerce sales, which the company said, was partially offset by new store growth. The company opened one full-line store and seven factory outlet stores during the past 12 months. \nThe company added that indirect segment revenues decreased 23.8 percent to 30.9 million dollars reflecting a reduction in the number of specialty accounts coupled with a reduction in orders from both specialty accounts and certain key accounts. \nGross profit for the quarter was 63.8 million dollars or 55.9 percent of net revenues, compared to 72.9 million dollars or 57.6 percent of net revenues, in the prior year third quarter. The year-over-year 80 basis point gross profit decline, the company said, was primarily related to increased promotional activity at the company\u2019s factory outlet stores and channel mix changes, partially offset by a reduction in product cost, all of which caused the gross profit percentage to fall below the low end of the guidance range of 57.1 percent to 57.6 percent. \nThe company\u2019s operating income totalled 0.5 million dollars or 0.4 percent of net revenues compared to 11.4 million dollars or 9 percent of net revenues, in the prior year third quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, the company\u2019s operating income totalled 13 million dollars or 11.4 percent of net revenues compared to 12 million dollars or 9.5 percent of net revenues, in the prior year. Review of the nine month results \nCurrent year net revenues for the nine months totalled 322.6 million dollars compared to 351.1 million dollars in the prior year. Direct segment revenues were 241.3 million dollars, a 2 percent decrease from 246.3 million dollars in the prior year. Comparable sales including e-commerce decreased 7.7 percent for the period reflecting a 6.1 percent decline in comparable store sales and an 11.4 percent decrease in e-commerce sales. \nIndirect segment revenues for the nine months decreased 22.4 percent to 81.3 million dollars from 104.8 million dollars. Gross profit totalled 179.8 million dollars or 55.7 percent of net revenues, compared to 201 million dollars or 57.2 percent of net revenues, in the prior year. The company\u2019s operating loss was 0.6 million dollars or 0.2 percent of net revenues, in the current year nine month period, compared to operating income of 23.6 million dollars or 6.7 percent of net revenues, in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, the company\u2019s operating income was 17.1 million dollars or 5.3 percent of net revenues, compared to 26.7 million dollars or 7.6 percent of net revenues, in the prior year. Vera Bradley predicts Q4 and FY18 expectations \nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company expects net revenues of 127 million dollars to 132 million dollars compared to prior year fourth quarter revenues of 134.8 million dollars, a gross profit percentage of 55.4 percent to 55.8 percent compared to 55.7 percent in the prior year fourth quarter and diluted earnings per share of 0.30 dollar to 0.33 dollars. Net income totalled 3.5 million dollars or 0.09 dollar per diluted share, in the prior year fourth quarter and excluding charges, net income totalled 10.1 million dollars or 0.28 dollar per diluted share. \nFor fiscal 2018, the company expects net revenues of 450 million dollars to 455 million dollars compared to 485.9 million dollars last year, a gross profit percentage of 55.8 percent to 55.9 percent compared to 56.8 percent last year and diluted earnings per share of 0.57 dollar to 0.60 dollars. Diluted earnings per share totalled 0.53 dollar last year and excluding charges, diluted earnings per share were 0.72 dollar last year. \n\u201cAs we discussed last quarter, we have launched Vision 20/20, an aggressive plan to turn around our business over the next three years. Vision 20/20 will restore brand and company health by moving to a less clearance-driven business model combined with a meaningful reduction in our SG&A expenses,\u201d added Wallstrom. \nThe majority of the product and pricing initiatives will be implemented beginning in fiscal 2019; management expects annualized revenues will be negatively impacted by these initiatives by 30 million dollars to 50 million dollars in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 levels. \nPicture:Facebook/Vera Bradley", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vera bradley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert wallstrom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallstrom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook/vera bradley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vera bradley", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:52.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a73819eff3b4b3789c62cda946c18c4f19a76a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQMLNdp7Nfay..45D24Hjs7grJO5ZeDLsMxluWfcNYrh7aEPMdhVjbO50HCfKAAFa3fDIDDXM0YGZ4qBpKCG1BmSiMiqRuyz_gvrxK3HK5xnSCHKzYT1l5Soxhh5WBdx9g-", "site_full": "rokucomlink866.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://rokucomlink866.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Are you tired of getting unique Roku activation code? \u2013 Site Title", "title": "Are you tired of getting unique Roku activation code?", "title_full": "Are you tired of getting unique Roku activation code?", "published": "2017-12-07T11:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7a73819eff3b4b3789c62cda946c18c4f19a76a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQMLNdp7Nfay..45D24Hjs7grJO5ZeDLsMxluWfcNYrh7aEPMdhVjbO50HCfKAAFa3fDIDDXM0YGZ4qBpKCG1BmSiMiqRuyz_gvrxK3HK5xnSCHKzYT1l5Soxhh5WBdx9g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "techverce", "published": "2017-12-07T11:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "Are you tired of getting unique Roku activation code?", "text": "Roku is an astonishing streaming device which allows users to stream more than 3500+ channels.

He served as the Director for Research, Strategic Studies Division, Hellenic Ministry of National Defence (1996-98) and as an Advisor on NATO issues to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1998-1999). He has taught at the Universities of Athens and Piraeus, the Hellenic National Defense College, the Diplomatic Academy and the Hellenic National Security School. His research interests include global trends, international security, Greek-Turkish relations & Mediterranean security and his recent publications include: \u201cGreek foreign policy under the Damocles sword of the economic crisis\u201d, Katoptron No. 2, Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, Athens, April 2015; \u201cGreek foreign policy towards the Middle East\u201d, Welt Trends, May 2015; \u2018Would GREXIT be a geopolitical disaster\u2019, Strategic Europe, Carnegie Europe, June 17, 2015; \u2018It\u2019s the War in Syria Stupid!\u2019, Europe\u2019s World, September 2015. Dr Thanos Dokos spoke with Greek News Agenda* about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's visit to Greece , Greek-Turkish relations today and their economic aspect, as well as EU-Turkey relations and Turkish foreign policy in the Middle East: How would you describe Greek-Turkish relations today? Greece has moved away from zero-sum game perceptions vis-\u00e0-vis Turkey and overall, the two countries are much better off today in terms of bilateral relations (including trade and people-to-people contacts) than they were a few years ago [before 1999 to be more precise]. Having said that, neither country has moved from their firm positions regarding \u2018high politics\u2019 issues and Greece and Turkey continue to perceive each other through a Hobbesian prism. Greek policy-makers are moving away from \u201czero-sum game\u201d perceptions regarding Greek-Turkish relations, but scepticism and distrust continue to linger as Turkey insists on its revisionist policies. During the last few years Turkey has been conducting frequent low level overflights of Greek islets and islands whose sovereignty Ankara started disputing rather recently. Turkey\u2019s political objective is to promote its claims regarding maritime zones in the Aegean. Challenging the sovereignty of inhabited islands is a highly escalatory and potentially destabilising policy of brinkmanship, however. It seems unlikely that there will be major progress in the near future in fully normalizing bilateral relations. It would be more productive if the two sides explored ideas for confidence-building measures and functional interim solutions regarding overflights, air-space violations and dogfights. Erdogan has already visited Greece in the past. This will be his first visit as President. In fact he will be the first Turkish president visiting Greece in 65 years. What do you think about the timing of the visit and which are the expected outcomes for both sides? The visit is taking place at a time of President Erdogan\u2019s choice. It is probably related to Turkey\u2019s difficult relations with the majority of EU countries, as well as the US and the resulting diplomatic isolation. A state visit to Greece would be a good photo opportunity and a successful public relations exercise for the Turkish president, who is eager to show that he is still welcomed in an EU member state, despite the bilateral problems and his authoritarian style of government. For the Greek government the expectation is that this visit and the resulting good will, in combination with Ankara\u2019s many foreign and domestic problems will lead to a period of lower tension between Greece and Turkey and perhaps better cooperation on the migration issue. Boosting economic cooperation is another expectation for the Greek side. Are we to expect further progress in the field of economic cooperation between Greece and Turkey? TheTurkish side has put on the table a few potentially interesting proposals for economic cooperation. Boosting economic ties would be important for both sides, as Turkey remains an export destination for Greece whose economy is still struggling with the economic crisis, whereas the Turkish economy has been slowing down after several years of impressive growth rates. Energy is another area of potential cooperation. Already there is a natural gas pipeline linking the two countries and another one, the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), that will carry gas from Azerbaijan to Italy, via Turkey, Greece and Albania, is under construction. The Russian proposal for an extension of the so-called Turkish Stream (another proposed pipeline) through Greece and then to other European destinations will have to overcome the obstacle of difficult political relations between Russia and the West. You believe that Turkey still wants to join the European Union or that it wishes to establish another kind of relation with the EU? President Erdogan has made every possible effort to cause tension with major EU countries and alienate Turkey\u2019s Western partners and allies. As a result of undemocratic practices inside Turkey, a number of European policymakers and a majority of the members of the European Parliament have been asking for a formal suspension of Turkey\u2019s accession negotiations. Greece is one of several EU member states believing that such a decision would be counterproductive as it would cause Turkey to drift further away from Western institutions. Turkey\u2019s key role in the management of refugee/migration flows would make such a development rather costly for the EU. It would also be tantamount to \u2018abandoning\u2019 those in Turkey (probably 50% of the population) who are against undemocratic practices and support a closer relationship with the EU. Of course, any expectation that Turkey could join the EU in the foreseeable future would be unrealistic. The best both sides could aim for is a better working relationship that would allow more efficient cooperation in areas of common interest (or concern). What is the Turkish foreign policy in the Middle East? After decades of very selective engagement with the Middle East, AKP\u2019s Turkey has been trying to increase its presence in the region, using mostly its soft power to increase its regional role and influence. A confrontational attitude towards Israel was intended to serve those objectives. The Arab revolts significantly disrupted Turkey\u2019s Middle Eastern policies. Ankara then tried to play the Sunni card by supporting the Muslim Brotherhood in various Arab countries. This policy failed spectacularly in Egypt. Turkish support for the opposition in Syria also didn\u2019t produce the expected results, as the Assad regime proved to be quite resilient. The situation became more complicated because of the emergence of ISIS and the support given to the Syrian Kurds by various powers. Turkey is currently struggling to prevent the emergence of autonomous Kurdish entities and is trying to re-define its relations with regional and global actors in the Middle East. *Interview by Sotiria Gotsi ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thanos dokos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sotiria gotsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "konrad adenauer stiftung", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hellenic foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diplomatic academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hellenic national defense college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hellenic ministry of national defence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim brotherhood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hellenic national security school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "welt trends", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of foreign affairs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greek news agenda", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aegean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "piraeus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mediterranean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "azerbaijan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carnegie europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:54.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "817350730c4e41d9856c6dbc428a63eafa7a03ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsoCyJTKvrnwB2x3OxZKIyQGNl5ghe889tVnh_hYygTebpkW_xzuVDWddODBuynRmvMXaQJSx6qJM3Pm.CQ_GUb", "site_full": "manninglive.com", "site": "manninglive.com", "site_section": "http://manninglive.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Page Array \u2013 Manning Live", "title": "Today in History: Thursday, Dec. 7", "title_full": "Today in History: Thursday, Dec. 7", "published": "2017-12-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://manninglive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/history-4.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "817350730c4e41d9856c6dbc428a63eafa7a03ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsoCyJTKvrnwB2x3OxZKIyQGNl5ghe889tVnh_hYygTebpkW_xzuVDWddODBuynRmvMXaQJSx6qJM3Pm.CQ_GUb", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Staff Reports", "published": "2017-12-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Today in History: Thursday, Dec. 7", "text": "by Staff Reports | December 7, 2017 12:00 am \nLast Updated: December 1, 2017 at 1:57 pm \n43 BC \u2013 Marcus Tullius Cicero is assassinated. 574 \u2013 Byzantine Emperor Justin II retires due to recurring seizures of insanity.

"Disclosure Policy December 8, 2017 You are here: Home / World News / USA / Florida Human Rights Commission state Disney park discriminated against children with autism Florida Human Rights Commission state Disney park discriminated against children with autism December 7, 2017 by ADN \nLake Buena Vista, Fla. \u2014 Walt Disney theme parks continue to be under fire as the Human Rights Commission in Florida released a statement saying that after conducting an investigation, it found that the popular amusement park has, in fact, discriminated against children with disabilities. \nDisney was slapped with multiple lawsuits after it changed its policies for its theme parks- \u2014 which used to provide \u2018guest assistance\u2019 cards for visitors with disabilities, allowing them to skip the long lines at the entrance of the Disney parks\u2014 a policy allegedly subjected to abuse by wealthy individuals who hire people with disabilities to get them into the park without having to line up. \nDisney replaced the old program with the \u2018 Disability Access Service \u2018, which, in essence, requires for guests with disabilities to make an appointment before they are allowed entrance to the park. But this policy backfired as parents accused Disney of discriminating against children with autism\u2014 who sensory challenges often mean they do not have the patience to wait. \nAnd the Human Rights Commission of Florida believed the parents are in the right. \nIn a statement published on the Orlando Sentinel, the commission wrote: \n\u201cThe accommodations offered would not allow (the child) to enjoy the park as it was intended to be enjoyed by all other patrons.\u201d \nA lawyer for one of the parents who filed charges against Disney said that the statement by the Florida Human Rights Commission is a confirmation of their position\u2014 that the entertainment giant has, in fact, discriminated against children with autism with their new \u201c blanket \u201d policies. He told: \n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a binding legal document, but it is a confirmation of our position. Folks have a certain predisposition about Disney, that they can\u2019t do anything wrong. If Disney people didn\u2019t take this seriously before, they have to now.\u201d \nJennifer O\u2019Toole from Asperkids posted this comment on their Facebook page earlier today: \n\u201cHave to say \u2013 I LOVE Disney\u2026..but I absolutely agree. Our experience with the \u201cnew\u201d system last April was awful. Even stopped by and offered my services as a consultant (pay me in a park pass and I\u2019d be great!) \u2014 but heard nothing. Really hope they think through this a little better (and yes, I\u2019m still willing).\u201d \nContributed by Althea Estrella Violeta", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "walt disney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "althea estrella violeta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer o\u2019toole", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "disney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida human rights comm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida human rights commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando sentinel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "human rights commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adn  lake buena vista", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fla.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asperkids", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:54.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d9ad619c58843977b58c3ef74021f53c1805911", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFrZJrLAWGpl0WlZnIk18ureVkP6IkYQclt4lfIZ.DYut4JoeYBqVv4AJ6xQBwN.wNU-", "site_full": "gizmomanay.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://gizmomanay.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "GIZMOmanay", "title": "mimi", "title_full": "mimi", "published": "2017-12-07T11:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "RU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3d9ad619c58843977b58c3ef74021f53c1805911", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFrZJrLAWGpl0WlZnIk18ureVkP6IkYQclt4lfIZ.DYut4JoeYBqVv4AJ6xQBwN.wNU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Patrik Dgein (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "mimi", "text": "\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:54.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5be8eabc94c0dd0060c7d2a27d58803ddd2f6e80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2HT48I_PlzDc", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp; Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "/swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics", "title_full": "/co/ - /swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics & Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T05:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 493, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd447bffd72df8b192b26322db78f5abcf80eb47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2O8Y28vcGd_1tPU0At.qItg-", "ord_in_thread": 427, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T10:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>97331526\nThe sixed legged one is probably what its referring to", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:54.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f413ffcf8843c3b59add57bd71bd32bb81080acd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOY2Vu62HdS2fx3k67ipt6upNUj_7ZtN6YJ.gs90DwCSfAfr0CHY0yz1kXE0ftKegD25fLirBN5nKu_yZS.vg.6E8DimPnchWM0msOPK.5YxUui99bri9XjrNH5FnEgWc-", "site_full": "article.wn.com", "site": "wn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.wn.com/English/keyword/science", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WN.com - Science News", "title": "A better mammogram?

Bringing together the high-quality portfolios of both companies and supports opportunities for long-term growth. \n\u201cThe acquisition creates a leading pan-European platform of desirable retail and leisure destinations which are better positioned to serve the needs of our retailers, excite our customers and support our partners and communities.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "merry hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david atkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david tyler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john strachan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "merry hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hammerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brent cross", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bicester village", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trafford centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:54.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5be8eabc94c0dd0060c7d2a27d58803ddd2f6e80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2HT48I_PlzDc", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp; Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "/swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics", "title_full": "/co/ - /swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics & Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T05:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 493, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1fd7c5aac29b6b12ff5d07c07bf64cd994d778f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2O8Y28vcGd_1nuYGD8T_lHo-", "ord_in_thread": 429, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T10:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>97331547\nNerd", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:54.031+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5be8eabc94c0dd0060c7d2a27d58803ddd2f6e80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2HT48I_PlzDc", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp; Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "/swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics", "title_full": "/co/ - /swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics & Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T05:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 493, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "622dbcd30add12129c647402abeedf8df58a7e6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2O8Y28vcGd_1wNN0z_7PX4I-", "ord_in_thread": 426, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T10:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>97331501\nwhen did Clones use it?

Great!\u201d How to Boost Your Brand Engagement and Why Bother: PR Edition \nThe PR version of thinking about brand engagement is a little bit more strategic and more all-encompassing. \nHere\u2019s my thoughts on \u201cbrand engagement\u201d versus focusing on your engagement on Instagram. \nEvery blogger wants to talk + pitch their Instagram engagement. \nAnd that\u2019s great. It\u2019s important to know that number and be comfortable with it. \nBut one level deeper? \nThink about the engagement that your overall brand receives from your readers. How many replies do you get on Twitter? How many retweets? How many DMs in response to your Insta Stories? How many readers respond when you send out your weekly newsletter? How many comments do you get on new blog posts? Do you see people recommending your blog + content on Facebook groups? \nAnd if you\u2019re in comment pods of any kind, don\u2019t count those obly. \nThat brand engagement is the kind of engagement that is much harder to fake. \n1. Focus on time on site \nTime on site is one of my favorite things to look at when looking at a blogger\u2019s stats. \nDon\u2019t know that word? It\u2019s literally just how long one reader spends on your site. \nTo me, it really separates the good from the great. \nFocus on building a path through your site, keeping your readers engaged, downloading, reading, signing up. \nTake this example. \nI am newly obsessed with Ashlyn Carter from Ashlyn Writes . Like her content and her tips is one of the reasons I\u201dm keeping my head above water balancing my blog, clients, brands, and life. \nSo, I found Ashlyn from my friend, Sheila from In Search of Sheila on Twitter. Sheila tweeted that she was obsessed with Ashlyn, and I was like \u201cWell, I have to at least check this out.\u201d I arrive on a blog post \nshe offers a sample of a welcome packet for clients \u2013 checkmate \u2013 I sign up for that \u2013> now I\u2019m on her email list \nshe interlinks to a blog post on \u201cday batching\u201d\u2013 I need to make my days more efficient, so I click I spy more content I like in her side bar \u2013 I click (duh) now she\u2019s offering me another free checklist \u2013 I sign up \n\nYou guys get the point. \nBy this time, I\u2019ve spent AT LEAST 5 minutes on her website, downloaded two freebies, and read 3-4 articles. \u2661 some tips? interlink, interlink \u2013 make sure you interlink your blog content \u2013 it\u2019s one of the easiest ways, especially on mobile, to bring your readers from post to post remember that the sidebar won\u2019t show on mobile \u2013 don\u2019t bet too heavily on including something critical in your sidebar. It won\u2019t show up on your readers\u2019 phones. make sure in your WordPress links, you\u2019re NOT clicking \u201copen link in new tab\u201d\u2013 when a new tab opens, your reader\u2019s time on site starts over \nRelated Reading: How to Use Google Analytics to Guide Your Content Strategy -> here 2. Growth hacking your platforms \nThis term is a little bit too \u201cInternet marketing-y\u201d for me but what can you do. \nKind of similar to increasing your time on site, growth hacking is using ALL your platforms to grow each other and bounce your readers between them. \nIt\u2019s like time on site but for your entire brand. \nLauryn Evarts from The Skinny Confidential is a FAB example of this. \nAgain, let\u2019s break it down. on her Insta Story, she sends you to her podcast \non her Insta Stories again, she sends you to her blog \non the blog, she drives you again to her podcast \n\u2661 benefits to growth hacking increase your followers \u2013 duh. By driving your readers from blog to Instagram to Twitter back to the blog, you\u2019re going to pick up some follow numbers along the way. increase overall engagement with your brand \u2013 again, you\u2019ve now driven a reader to look at your Instagram, read a blog post, find you on Twitter and maybe retweet you, read a blog post again, sign up for your email list. it\u2019s organic \u2013 it\u2019s not paying for a facebook ad to tell your readers where to go. You\u2019re using your own content and knowledge about your readers\u2019 interests to send them back and forth where they need/want to go. \nRelated Reading: 5 Do\u2019s + Don\u2019ts To Up Your Instagram Stories Game \u2013> here How to Boost Your Brand Engagement: Focusing on time on site and growth hacking \nSo, the 2 ways to boost your brand engagement? \nFocus on your time on site and growth hack on your own platforms. \nWhen you boost your overall brand engagement, it really helps you stand out in terms of legitimacy and authority to sponsored post opportunities. \nAnd most importantly, you\u2019re keeping your readers engaged and spending time on YOUR content.

I get too focused on school work, and usually meet new people if they are the first ones to come up and talk to me. \nI was also was self-conscious about people judging me for my English skills. Even though I was born in El Paso, I lived in Juarez, Mexico until fifth grade. And like a lot of others who live on the border, I sometimes felt like I was in an awkward limbo between cultures. Priscilla Judson Wallace, an African-American woman working at UTEP, originally from New York City, quotes the most offensive remark she has heard about her. \nDuring the spring 2017 semester I met Hajar Chaffag, an exchange student from Casablanca, Morocco. She is also studying journalism but we coincidentally met on a random group assignment for our performance activism class. After finishing part of the assignment, we talked about a variety of things, including how she went to high school in France, where it was against the law to publicly deny the Holocaust. I asked her how the French perceived how Americans view the Holocaust. This conversation led us to talk about our mother countries, history, politics, travel and the acts of prejudice we have seen inside and outside our countries. \nWhile most people think of prejudice being expressed by people judging others who are from a different culture, we often don\u2019t recognize the prejudice within groups of people of the same nationality or ethnicity. In Mexico, we tend to see Mexicans from the North make fun of \u201cChilangos\u201d in the South. Meanwhile Mexicans from the South make fun of \u201cNorte\u00f1os\u201d just because they are from the opposite side of the country. Hajar told me a similar thing happens in Morocco, Some say those in the North speak \u201caggressively,\u201d while those in the South speak \u201cfeminine.\u201d \nShe also shared the border culture experience where her home in Morocco is close to Spain, only divided by the Strait of Gibraltar. A lot of Moroccans admire the European culture over that of Northern Africa, she said. In a similar vein it is not uncommon for Mexicans and Mexican-Americans along the U.S., Mexico border to feel judged because they don\u2019t seem deeply rooted in either side. \nWe talked about how Eurocentrism/Western-centrism unconsciously affects some people\u2019s ideals for culture and beauty where they may value designer clothing and lighter skin. As we say in Mexico: Aqu\u00ed y en China (Here and in China), ignorance and judgement happens everywhere. Ariana Cortez, a Muslim Mexican-American student at UTEP, quotes one of the most ignorant remarks she has heard. \nThe conversations Hajar and I had were helpful in determining our final project, which consisted of bringing attention to a social issue in a public place. We decided to use our journalism skills and interview a diverse sampling of people around campus. We asked 20 people to write down their response to a question: \u201cWhat is the most ignorant remark or experience happened to you regarding your appearance/culture/background?\u201d We photographed them holding their written responses. \nI was struck by how everyone immediately thought of a rude comment or negative interaction over their ethnicity that had stayed with them. \nThe response that I identified with most was from Wansik Oum, a UTEP student from Seoul, South Korea. Oum wrote about how classmates laugh at him when he gives presentations in English. I perfectly understand this experience, which I believe almost everyone who has to learn English goes through at least once, even in our all-inclusive border city. I always thought it was only those of us from Juarez who were humiliated for our accent and word choices in English. When we go through that experience we tend to stay within our small groups because we feel safe and comfortable. \nIf it wasn\u2019t for Hajar, I would of have never understood better those outside my background. The activity taught us to feel equal to those who surround us and appreciative of the people that make UTEP and the border special. \nSince the Trump era, acts of intolerance towards minorities and immigrants are noticeable more than ever. Still, this is not an excuse for us who belong in a minority to forget to respect those of our ethnicity and other sub-groups. \nA recent study by the UACJ shows Ciudad Juarez as one of the most racists cities in Mexico . But why does this happen? As I learned from this experience, ignorance and indifference\u2014due to culture shock \u2014 can make us unconsciously accept discrimination directed at those outside our ethnic-group, even if these acts do not come directly from us. \nWe should start recognizing what is wrong in our society and put-out the example by publicly state what\u2019s right or wrong among us. As the former first lady Michelle Obama said, \u201c When they go low, we go high. \u201d \nNow I feel more open to be approachable to anyone. I used to be afraid, always thinking that there were people who know more English than me or have more years here and I haven\u2019t progressed as well. \nBut now I feel empowered realizing everyone feels like an outsider from time to time. I\u2019m more confident about expressing myself and not worrying about what people think. Most importantly, I feel I am more open to talking with other people and genuinely getting to know them for who they are, .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "juarez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ciudad juarez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wansik oum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hajar chaffag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "priscilla judson wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michelle obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ariana cortez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "voces&blogs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uacj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utep", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "northern africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el paso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "casablanca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hajar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juarez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morocco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "strait of gibraltar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:55.031+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d35ceaa52925af2cdf473376d099eaa02cb907da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWYNL9umvz_F0J8gvoqqcn9dHeknaekZLfv2fzGG3hNxJNP7Uqfz._ceZk5QjOCkTjAkOaw7qSb9leixjkaONvKJEMBpVOj5VCU-", "site_full": "helpforum.sky.com", "site": "sky.com", "site_section": "http://helpforum.sky.com/t5/Sky-Q/bd-p/skyq", "site_categories": ["science", "space_astronomy"], "section_title": "Sky Q - Sky Community", "title": "New software version overnight", "title_full": "New software version overnight - Sky Community", "published": "2017-12-07T16:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 849, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f1b59baffc292228e472e0f6be1c6d330910dc13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWYNL9umvz_F0J8gvoqqcn9dHeknaekZLfv2fzGG3hNxJNP7Uqfz._ceZk5QjOCkTjAkOaw7qSb9leixjkaONvKJo08FUvCmmybeHJifHoiUKw--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Gizmo247", "published": "2017-12-07T16:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Surely the re-orderable favourites mapped to channel numbers 1-99,unique to each device, is a major and very welcome new feature!\nLooks like Father Christmas came early", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:55.032+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ed8f14555d4badedf15b029cc43ec39b96683dd9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_NeqePiheQyZT7b1zotFlmVwR6oFOCl_bQZlz0kaAz5SCzQAVOuvpwMJbt0bKD2NhMXnivq5Cep6CNqJuQOqvK8ZNnD2YlCS4LqAuCK01H3JtRk_wxAEtl3y3xachS8Z78yBWI3R8XmCFveneIepF3", "site_full": "www.mcknightsseniorliving.com", "site": "mcknightsseniorliving.com", "site_section": "http://www.mcknightsseniorliving.com/", "site_categories": ["family_and_parenting", "eldercare"], "section_title": "McKnight's Senior Living", "title": "The 'three-bucket' approach to sustainability", "title_full": "The 'three-bucket' approach to sustainability", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ed8f14555d4badedf15b029cc43ec39b96683dd9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_NeqePiheQyZT7b1zotFlmVwR6oFOCl_bQZlz0kaAz5SCzQAVOuvpwMJbt0bKD2NhMXnivq5Cep6CNqJuQOqvK8ZNnD2YlCS4LqAuCK01H3JtRk_wxAEtl3y3xachS8Z78yBWI3R8XmCFveneIepF3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mcknightsseniorliving.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "The 'three-bucket' approach to sustainability", "text": "The healthcare industry \u2014 and I am including long-term care and senior living facilities in that definition \u2014 has been a bit slow to adopt sustainability initiatives. Its focus, of course, always is on resident and patient care, not necessarily on turning off the lights or looking for ways to limit paper use. But slowly, healthcare facilities have been coming around, and one of the main reasons for this is cost savings. According to a 2014 report from the American Hospital Association and the Health Research and Educational Trust, \u201cenvironmental sustainability is good business, as it helps lower operational costs and allows hospitals to direct more resources to patient care.\u201d\nThe study authors provided the following examples to justify their conclusion:\nMemorial Hermann Health System in southeast Texas saved $47 million through energy improvements over five years. Kaiser Permanente has been able to save $4 million annually in its locations by just buying energy-efficient computers. The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock has saved enough money from its sustainability initiatives that it was able to \u201ccreate 60 new beds, remodel five operating suites, build out a floor of a cancer institute and buy seven acres of land.\u201d Long-term care and senior living could experience similar savings. I hope this information is enough for administrators of long-term care facilities and executive directors of senior living communities to start thinking a bit more about embracing sustainability initiatives, especially if they have taken few if any steps so far.\nAlthough the study talked in generalities as to how these facilities accomplished these sustainability benefits, administrators need to know more precisely what steps they can take now and in the future. For that, we need three buckets.\nThe bucket approach\nYears ago when I was helping the professional cleaning industry and building managers around the country transfer to a \u201cgreen\u201d cleaning program, we found that the easiest way to accomplish our goals was to take it a step at a time. We did this by creating three imaginary buckets:\nWe placed all the items in this bucket that could be handled now at little or no cost. This bucket contained items that take a little time \u2014 up to six months \u2014 to accomplish and would cost a moderate amount of money These were long-term initiatives that would be costly. They typically involve actions such as replacing HVAC units, which eventually would need to be attended to anyway. Now that we have our imaginary buckets in place, let's start filling them up. Although we cannot cover everything here, we'll touch on some key items that should at least get the sustainability juices flowing.\nFor instance:\nIn Bucket #1\nInstall aerators on all faucets and shower heads. This is a very inexpensive project that not only reduces water consumption but also saves energy. The less hot water is used for showering, for instance, the less water heaters must heat water, resulting in savings in the bank.\nSwitch to green cleaning products. Green-certified products are made with renewable resources and often are shipped in five-gallon quantiles, reducing packaging, fuel and transport costs. Plus, they typically are sold at discounted prices.\nMaximize recycling. Although this does apply to all healthcare facilities and not long-term/senior care locations specifically, it is estimated that healthcare facilities generate 25 pounds of waste per day per patient. For a facility with 200 people, that's a staggering 150,000 pounds of waste every month sent to landfills, nearly 2 million pounds annually.\nIn Bucket #2\nTransfer to low energy lighting. I n the U.S., it is estimated that large medical facilities account for approximately 1% of all commercial buildings and 2% of all commercial space but consume about 6% of all the energy delivered in the commercial sector. Transferring to low energy lighting is a first step in reducing this energy use.\nTurn to local food suppliers. This may or may not be cost neutral, but by contracting with local food suppliers for fresh food, long-term/senior care administrators can help reduce energy consumption to deliver food as well as reduce greenhouse gasses. Along these lines, and to help reduce waste, these facilities can work with local composting companies to haul away food waste for use as fertilizer.\nMonitoring the thermostat. A large medical facility in Connecticut was able to save more than $300,000 annually in energy costs by investing in monitoring systems that, among other things, regulated air handling so that cooling and heating were delivered only when needed and where needed.\nIn Bucket #3\nThese are the big-ticket items, but even though they are costly, as mentioned, invariably they must be attended to. So the goal here is just to make sure that when equipment such as HVAC systems, kitchen equipment, hot water systems, restroom fixtures and similar items are selected, sustainability and efficiency are key considerations. Many times, an energy efficient system will cost more to select but will more than pay for itself in time. For instance, the return on the investment for the monitoring system in the Connecticut hospital just mentioned was only six months.\nCheck your progress\nGreat. Your facility now is taking steps to become more sustainable, but how do you know whether it is paying off? Before we even begin our journey into sustainability, it is wise for administrators to invest in what are referred to as \u201cdashboard systems.\u201d Typically, these are online programs that can be used on any computer device.\nData is imputed into the system \u2013 for instance, how much water and energy is currently being consumed along with its costs \u2013 and then re-evaluated every quarter. As the savings are realized, it will encourage administrators to look further, and find even more ways to reduce consumption and cut operating costs.\nStephen P.

The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act, sponsored by Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) and co-sponsored by Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT), would amend the ADEA to restore plaintiffs' burden of proof to where it had been before a ruling in a 2009 Supreme Court case (Gross vs. FBL Financial Services) established a more stringent standard. The ADEA prohibits employment discrimination against those aged 40 or more years.\nCasey discussed the newer legislation Wednesday in his opening remarks during a Senate Special Committee on Aging hearing at which the committee also issued a report on opportunities and challenges related to the aging workforce. He is the ranking member of the committee, and Collins is the chairman.\n\u201cAs baby boomers were turning 65, a U.S. Supreme Court decision weakened ADEA protections,\u201d Casey said. \u201cWe've got to fix that.\u201d\nThe bill's prospects are uncertain, however. Casey introduced it at the end of February and it was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, but the committee has not taken action on it.\nBut regardless of the fate of the legislation, the government and employers can take steps to try to meet the needs of an aging workforce, according to the Aging Committee.\n\u201cExemplary\u201d employers \u201care instituting policies and programs such as flexible schedules, family caregiving information and referral services, and retirement planning,\u201d Collins said. \u201cOthers are providing ergonomic office designs and changing cultures to welcome workers across the spectrum of age and disability levels.\u201d\nThe importance of doing so will become even more evident over the next decade, Collins said.\n\u201cWhile the labor force as a whole is projected to grow by an average of just 0.6 percent per year between 2016 and 2026, the number of workers ages 65 to 74 is projected to grow by more than four percent annually, and the number of workers ages 75 and above is projected to grow by nearly seven percent annually,\u201d she said.\nPolicies that can benefit workers, employers, their communities and the country, according to the committee's report, should:\nAllow for the flexibility of individuals to carve their own career paths and determine for themselves when and how they retire. Value and respect the decisions of older adults to continue working, to volunteer or to find another way to achieve their personal and professional goals. Help workers remain financially secure while confronting challenges that may arise with age, such as caregiving responsibilities or health conditions. Allow employers the flexibility to creatively meet the individual needs of their workers while ensuring that employees are provided ample opportunities to grow and thrive in the workplace. Health-related industries are among those that would benefit from a revised outlook, according to the report, which cited 2015 research by the Society for Human Resources Management.\n\u201cEven though the health and social service occupations (e.g., registered nurses, personal care aides) are projected to be among the fastest growing in the next decade, human resource professionals from these industries were not any more likely to formally consider the aging of the workforce than any other industry,\u201d the authors said of the study. \u201cThey also were less likely to offer apprenticeship programs to recruit and retain aging workers.\u201d\nWednesday's hearing is available for viewing online.

We express strong dissatisfaction and opposition,\" Zhang Shuili, a military official in China's western battle zone command, was quoted as saying in a ministry statement. \n\"China's border defence forces took a professional and responsible attitude in conducting an inspection of the device,\" Zhang said, adding that the military would \"resolutely defend\" China's sovereignty and security.

VE303 is the first known investigational drug consisting of rationally-defined bacterial consortium in powder form to enter the clinic. It is comprised of a group of bacteria selected based on their ability to shield against life-threatening infections, including recurrent C. difficile infection (rCDI). The Phase 1a/1b clinical trial is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018, and, pending those results, Vedanta plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial in 2018 for the treatment of rCDI. Vedanta also announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have granted VE303 orphan drug designation - a status given to drugs and biologics that are intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the US.

The same for SIM has been mandated to establish identify of mobile phone users. \n\u201cThe mandatory requirements of Aadhaar for PAN, bank accounts, welfare programs, and SIM cards have been challenged in the Supreme Court and no stay has been granted. Therefore, it is clear that the video is outdated because it does not reflect the latest legal position as on today (December 7, 2017),\u201d the statement said. \nUIDAI said the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 was passed by the Parliament on March 16, 2016 and notified in the Gazette of India on March 26, 2016. \n\u201cTherefore, subsequent notifications issued under section/s of Aadhaar Act for requiring Aadhaar as primary identifier by various ministries and departments of Government of India and States/UTs Governments for various services, benefits and subsidies hold the field today,\u201d it said. \nUIDAI asked people not to get misled by an outdated video doing rounds in the social media and Whatsapp and said \u201cpeople should instead verify their banks accounts, investment accounts, SIM cards, etc as per the current laws and deadlines as early as possible to avoid any inconvenience.\u201d \n\u201cUIDAI has clarified on a video circulated purportedly out of context of a lady lawyer on WhatsApp, Twitter and Social Media and said that the video refers to an order passed by the Supreme Court on August 11, 2015 when the court had restricted use of Aadhaar to only few programs,\u201d the statement said. \nThe video, it said, does not reflect \u201ctrue legal position\u201d as it stands today, because after the said Supreme Court order of 2015, Aadhaar Act was passed by Parliament in 2016. \nSubsequent to the Act, notifications have been issued making Aadhaar mandatory for availing various welfare benefits such as public distribution services (PDS), cooking gas LPG, MNREGS, scholarships and pensions. \nThe Income Tax Act was amended in March 2017 to make Aadhaar mandatory for PAN cards. On June 1, 2017, PML Rules have been amended to make Aadhaar mandatory for linking all bank accounts, insurance, pension, mutual funds and DMAT accounts. \n\u201cSupreme Court too in Lokniti Foundation case through an order passed in February 2017 has approved verification of all SIM cards with Aadhaar,\u201d UIDAI said. \nThe Apex Court has upheld the linkage of Aadhaar with PAN in the case of Binoy Viswam vs Union of India which mandates Aadhaar for income tax returns and PAN.

Peasant farmers have revolted against an industry that many see as damaging their land and livelihoods while denying them a fair share of the wealth. Peru is home to 167 social conflicts, most related to mining, according to the national ombudsman\u2019s office, whose mission includes defusing hostilities. \nNueva Fuerabamba was the centrepiece of one of the most generous mining settlements ever negotiated in Peru. But three years after moving in, many transplants are struggling amid their suburban-style conveniences, Reuters interviews with two dozen residents showed. Many miss their old lives growing potatoes and raising livestock. Some have squandered their cash settlements. Idleness and isolation have dulled the spirits of a people whose ancestors were feared cattle rustlers. \n\u201cIt is like we are trapped in a jail, in a cage where little animals are kept,\u201d said Cipriano Lima, 43, a former farmer. \nMeanwhile, the mine, known as Las Bambas, has remained a magnet for discontent. Clashes between demonstrators and authorities in 2015 and 2016 left four local men dead. \nNueva Fuerabamba residents have blocked copper transport roads to press for more financial help from MMG. \nThe company acknowledged the transition has been difficult for some villagers, but said most have benefited from improved housing, healthcare, and education. \n\u201cNueva Fuerabamba has experienced significant positive change,\u201d Troy Hey, MMG\u2019s executive general manager of stakeholder relations, said in an email to Reuters. MMG said it spent \u201chundreds of millions\u201d on the relocation effort. \nMining is the driver of Peru\u2019s economy, which has averaged 5.5% annual growth over the past decade. Still, pitched conflicts have derailed billions of dollars\u2019 worth of investment in recent years, including projects by Newmont Mining Corp and Southern Copper Corp. \nTo defuse opposition, President Pablo Kuczynski has vowed to boost social services in rural highland areas, where nearly half of residents live in poverty. \nBut moving from conflict to cooperation is not easy after centuries of mistrust. Relocations are particularly fraught, according to Camilo Leon, a mining resettlement specialist at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. \nSubsistence farmers have struggled to adapt to the loss of their traditions and the \u201cvery urban, very organized\u201d layout of planned towns, Leon said. \n\u201cIt is generally a shock for rural communities,\u201d Leon said. \nAt least six proposed mines have required relocations in Peru in the past decade, Leon said. Later this month, Peru will tender a $2-billion (RM8.2 billion) copper project, Michiquillay, which would require moving yet another village. \nMMG inherited the Nueva Fuerabamba project when it bought Las Bambas from Glencore plc in 2014 for $7 billion (RM28.6 billion). \nUnder terms of a deal struck in 2009 and reviewed by Reuters, villagers voted to trade their existing homes and farmland for houses in a new community. Heads of each household, about 500 in all, were promised mining jobs. University scholarships would be given to their children. Residents were to receive new land for farming and grazing, albeit in a parcel four hours away by car. \nCash was an added sweetener. Villagers say each household got 400,000 soles ($505,000), which amounts to a lifetime\u2019s earnings for a minimum-wage worker in Peru. \nMMG declined to confirm the payments, saying its agreements are confidential. \nBuilt into a hillside 15 miles (24 kilometres) from the Las Bambas mine, Nueva Fuerabamba was the product of extensive community input, MMG said. Amenities include a hospital, football pitches, and a cement bullring for festivals. \nBut some residents say the deal has not been the windfall they hoped. Their new two- andthree-story houses made of drywall, are drafty and appear flimsy compared to their old thatched-roof adobe cottages heated by wood-fired stoves, some said. \nMany no longer plant crops or tend livestock because their replacement plots are too far away. Jobs provided by MMG mostly involve maintaining the town because most residents lack the skills to work in a modern mine. \nMany villagers spent their settlements unwisely, said community president Alfonso Vargas. \u201cSome invested in businesses, but others did not. They went drinking,\u201d he said. \nNow basics like water, food, and fuel \u2013 once wrested from the land \u2013 must be paid for. \n\u201cEverything is money,\u201d Margot Portilla, 20, said as she cooked rice on a gas stove in her sister-in-law\u2019s bright-yellow home. \u201cBefore we could make a fire for cooking with cow dung. Now we have to buy gas.\u201d \nSome residents said they have benefited from the move. \nThe new town is cleaner than the old village, said Betsabe Mendoza, 25. She invested her settlement in a metalworking business in a bigger town. \nPortilla, a young mother, says her younger sisters are getting a better education than she did. \nStill, the streets of Nueva Fuerabamba were virtually deserted on a recent weekday. Vargas, the community leader, said many residents have returned to the countryside or sought work elsewhere. Alcoholism, fuelled by idle time and settlement money, is on the rise, he said. \nSome villagers have committed suicide. Over the 12 months through July, four residents killed themselves by taking farming chemicals, according to the provincial district attorney\u2019s office. It could not provide data on suicides in the old village of Fuerabamba. \nMMG, citing an \u201cindependent\u201d study done prior to the relocation, said the community previously suffered from high rates of domestic violence, alcoholism, illiteracy, and poverty. \nWhile the company considers the new town a success, it acknowledged the transition has not been easy for all. \n\u201cConnection to land, livelihood restoration and simple adaptation to new living conditions remain a challenge,\u201d MMG said. \nNueva Fuerabamba residents continue pressuring the company for additional assistance. Demands include more jobs and deeds to their houses, which have yet to be delivered because of bureaucratic delays, said Godofredo Huamani, the community\u2019s lawyer. \nMMG said it stays apace of community needs through town hall meetings and has representatives on hand to field complaints. \nWhile villagers fret about the future, many cling to the past. Flora Huamani, 39, a mother of four girls, recalled how women used to get together to weave wool from their own sheep into the embroidered black dresses they wear. \n\u201cThose were our traditions,\u201d said Huamani from a bench in her walled front yard. \u201cNow our tradition is meeting after meeting after meeting\u201d to discuss the community\u2019s problems.", "highlightText":

The question is about farmers\u2019 life and death and thus not worrying about what will happen to power, we supported his agitation,\u201d the party said in an editorial in its mouthpiece \u2018Saamana\u2019. \nThe Sena said that Sinha was never a mass leader but a \u201cbureaucrat-turned-politician\u201d. \n\u201cYet, if farmers supported his agitation, it should ring alarm bells for the BJP and the government. The government should fulfil the demands of farmers of Akola while it has the time,\u201d it opined. \nSeeking to know what issues of farmers were resolved by the BJP-led governments at the Centre and in Maharashtra, the Sena claimed that farm loan waiver was announced by the state government only when the Uddhav Thackeray-led party pressed for it. \n\u201cHowever, in reality the government spent crores of rupees on advertisements even before the actual loan waiver was implemented, to gain credit. Like the Ram temple in Ayodhya, the loan waiver is also stuck in announcements,\u201d it quipped. \nThe Sena asserted that it will continue to demand implementation of recommendations of the Swaminathan panel, a complete loan waiver and minimum support price for farmers, because these were the promises, it claimed, on the back of which the BJP came to power. \nSinha also didn\u2019t have any new demands but only wanted old promises to be fulfilled, the Sena said, adding that the farmers stood with him because the \u201cdisappointed and victimised\u201d cultivators do not know what to do. \nQuestioning those criticising Sinha, the editorial said if the former Union minister was going against his own party due to his personal grudges, how could he get such a stupendous response in Akola. \n\u201cWhy did the chief minister and (revenue minister) Chandrakant Patil plead Sinha to take back the agitation? That was because this agitation could turn ugly and affect the upcoming Winter session of the state Legislature,\u201d it said.
