As the industrial revolution took shape, people moved away from rural living into more urban areas, and over time, cities became the centre for innovation and development. \nNow some of the world\u2019s largest cities, like New York, Dubai and Tokyo, lead the way in terms of technology, and developments in living standards. \nWithin these cities, technological advancements are already changing the way we live our everyday lives. What will your smart city look like in the future? \nInternet of Things \nThe biggest game changer for city living is the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) - where everyday objects are connected together . But what is the point of this? \nIoT is designed to increase levels of automation in our lives - kettles that know when to boil, fridges that can order essentials when you\u2019re running low, and even clothing that charges your phone . \nWith such levels of automation available, IoT technology will have a major impact on our cities. While it all sounds like science-fiction, IoT devices are already on the market. By 2019, it is expected that 43% of consumers will have a remotely controlled thermostat in their homes and offices . \nAutomation across the city \nThis is just the start though, and automation will eventually be rolled out city-wide. By 2030, connected LED streetlights will be used to improve city life through the creation of a city-wide network. \nUsing this network, streetlights will be able to transfer data, delivering information between numerous devices, improving traffic, air quality, public safety and parking across smart cities. \nTen years after this development, by 2040, it is predicted that buildings will be run by AI personalities (like a giant building-wide Siri). This means that occupants will be able to communicate directly with the building to request heating and lighting changes. Amazing! \nBy 2050, this concept will be rolled out further, with smart buildings becoming automated \u2018living buildings\u2019 . Using AI, living buildings will respond automatically to variations in weather, and adjust to the needs of its inhabitants, even producing more resources than they consume. \nFlying cars (finally)! \nIt seems like we\u2019ve been promised flying cars and silver jumpsuits by Hollywood for decades, and so far the dream has yet to come to fruition. While the jumpsuits are not quite on the horizon, flying cars very much are. \nIn fact, Uber are already planning to trial flying on-demand taxis in 2020 in the cities of Dallas and Dubai, and by 2023, they hope to actually be transporting paying passengers . \nFast-forward to 2050, and in addition to flying cars, delivery drones will be used instead of motorbikes and cars to deliver your favourite takeaway to your doorstep . \nAll of this technology means that city living will look quite different both in the near and distant future. Experts suggest that by 2050, 75% of the world\u2019s population will live in cities, and smart technology will be at the centre of our lives.

BBy \u2013 Milk Sharing available now for iPhone, iPad and Android CUPERTINO, Calif. (PRWEB) December 06, 2017 BBy, the physician-created app that establishes a safe and reliable marketplace for breast milk, today announced its expansion into the San Francisco market. Available now, San Francisco will serve as the third market for BBy in addition to Chicago and New York. It is the first app to provide a regulated marketplace for breast milk. Available on iOS and Android, BBy\u2019s app will support both nursing mothers and new parents in the San Francisco metro area. Parents who are interested in feeding their child natural breast milk, but are unable to produce milk themselves, can access local, rigorously tested supply through the app. Nursing mothers with an excess supply can sign up on the app and, once approved by BBy\u2019s team, be matched with potential buyers. BBy is the only physician approved marketplace that ensures all sellers are prescreened and free of transmittable diseases, including: HIV, Hepatitis, TORChES and more. After successfully matching, each milk delivery is conducted by the donor, fostering a sense of community and inter-personal relationship. \u201cThe idea for BBy was forged in light of my experience as a doctor, reflecting my understanding of the health benefits breast milk provides to infants,\u201d said Dr. Vansh Langer, founder and CEO of BBy. \u201cEvery parent who wants to provide their child with the natural benefits of breast milk should be able to do so.\u201d Yet, finding a safe supply can be quite difficult. BBy\u2019s app provides parents access to safe and rigorously tested breast milk, while creating an opportunity for nursing mothers to provide nutrients to other children and generate extra income. BBy was created with one goal in mind: to help families access natural breast milk in a safe and affordable manner.\u201d The concept was born in Chicago, where Dr. Langer worked with adoptive parents to nurse their threeweek- old baby back to health. Dr. Langer asked another mother to give the baby her breast milk \u2013 which she previously had not had access to \u2013 and, the active immunities in the milk helped her make a full recovery.

My current bike is 13.38kg, a Specialized FSR XC Expert 2008, which is a great bike, but I feel stupid riding it around on the roads at lunchtime, plus I'm never going to get KOMs using a full suspension mountain bike against roadies!\nBasically, my budget is probably about \u00a3900, leaving me \u00a3100 to play with extras. Yes, I am going to use the cycle to work scheme to get the bike (hopefully). Whilst technically I won't be commuting on it, the bike will still be making regular journeys to work, just on the top of my car so I can go out and do a ride at lunch times to help me stay focused for the afternoon and get some vital exercise during the week. Having a young family doesn't really allow me to get out there at the weekends as I want to spend my time with them, and commuting on the roads to work is a no no given I see lots of idiot drivers out there that don't give the cyclists I see on the way to work, any room at all!\nI am looking for a more aggressive position on the bike, so not looking for an endurance/upright position (is that the right terminology?). I also want cable runs through the frame. I don't have any preference over the brakes, i.e. disc or calipers.\nAt the moment, my searches have thrown up a 2017 Wilier GTR using a shimano 105 groupset which happens to be heavily discounted, probably just because they want to shift it.\nAny thoughts?\nAlso, would it be a crime to put Shimano PD-M520 Pedals on a road bike just because I already have a pair of shoes with cleats that fit these... save that money and all!!!

They allow you create any custom visitor segments you want, and report on them, so you can understand which aspects of your user experience (UX) design most positively affect your conversions.\nThe list of dynamic personalization tools out there is pretty long and includes:\nEvergage Dynamic yield Optimizely BarillianceRich Relevance Google Optimize For a comprehensive list of 28 website personalization and recommendations software tools , Dr. Dave Chaffey gives a full breakdown covering; personalization integrated with web analytics, personalization Software as Service (SaaS) for Ecommerce, personalization features available as part of CMS or Commerce management systems and B2B, marketing automation and publisher website personalization tools.\nDon\u2019t be overwhelmed, just devote a few hours to evaluating the tools and choose the one that best fits your staff capabilities and budget. Regarding cost, based on my experience using Evergage, Optimizely and Google Optimize, for most sites, the cost is under $4K per month. As I\u2019ll show you later, this is a modest investment compared to the significant revenue gains you can expect to achieve within a few months of plugging in these tools.\n2. Tag all interactions you might care about As management guru Peter Drucker said, \u2018What gets measured gets done.\u2019 In the world of conversion rate and revenue optimization, this means that you can only report on and learn from the user interactions that you are actually tracking. So be sure to tag every event that you feel may be useful when you do your downstream analysis.\nFor an ecommerce site, this means going beyond product views, adds-to-cart and \u2018start checkout\u2019 clicks to include nearly all category, product and cart page \u2018micro conversion\u2019 interactions (interactions that lead to downstream macro conversions). For a lead generation site, it means including all fields, links, and buttons both in the form \u2018action\u2019 panel and the clicks that lead visitors to this form. Think of the full UX journey leading up to the final conversion click and you\u2019ll be on the right track for event tracking.\n3. Create a bunch of segments Once you have all key interactions tagged, you can start creating segments. If you\u2019re not familiar with segments, think of them simply as groups of visitor interactions, defined by a set of rules. One segment could be \u2018Visitors who used chat in any session.\u2019 Another could be more specific, such as, \u2018All visitors who used chat within the last 14 days, And who purchased one or more products\u2019. With this last segment, you\u2019ll later be able to compare these chat-engaged purchasers to your broader set of buyers.\nAs you can imagine, there are literally hundreds of segments you can think of. The key is to think of the combinations of visitor behaviors that you\u2019ll most want to compare after the tool has been installed and processed enough data. If you can\u2019t think of all possible segments at the onset, don\u2019t worry. Unlike with event tagging, you can always add more segments later.\nLastly, don\u2019t forget to create meaningful \u2018benchmark\u2019 segments. For the example I just mentioned, it\u2019s not meaningful (in fact, it\u2019s misleading) to compare chat purchasers to all visitors. To see the most relevant conversion and revenue numbers, you\u2019ll need to compare these chat purchasers to visitors for which the chat feature existed (the set of visitors who could have used chat).\n4. Find the correlations by running reports After you have tagged your key interactions and defined the segments you want to report on, you\u2019ll be in waiting mode for a couple weeks or so (depending on your site\u2019s traffic levels) for your personalization tool to collect enough interaction data. Then you can start running reports.\nAs an example, here are the reports I created for a seller of surveillance equipment:\nReport comparing average order value (AOV) and revenue per visitor (RPV) of visitors who used either the global (header) or product page chat feature to visitors who had been on the site for 60 seconds or more (were at least minimally engaged) and did Not use any chat. Report comparing AOV and RPV of visitors who had viewed one or more product videos to visitors who had been on the site for 60 seconds or more and were exposed to a video on either a category or product page but did Not click a video. Report comparing AOV and RPV of visitors who had started a \u2018product finder\u2019 to visitors who had been on the site for 60 seconds or more and were exposed to a category page that contained a product finder button but did Not use it. When I ran these reports I discovered these amazing ratios:\nFor Chat: The revenue per visitor (RPV) was 3.9 times higher for visitors who used the chat feature. For Videos: The RPV was 1.7 higher for visitors who viewed one or more videos. For Product Finders: The RPV was 2.2 times higher for visitors who started (but didn\u2019t necessarily complete) a product finder Now, here\u2019s how these insights turned into conversion gold. By knowing the superpower of chat, we made the chat element more visible on the product pages. To increase usage further, without annoying too many visitors, we pushed a chat invite after 20 seconds to less engaged visitors. After doing this we saw both usage and the associated revenues increase.\nWe made similar UX updates for the video and product finder experiences. Altogether, this resulted in $640K in annual revenue lift, which far exceeded the client\u2019s investment in marketing consulting and the personalization tool ($108K). That\u2019s a 490% ROI! And, of course, the revenue gain was recurring every year, while the investment was completed in six months.\n5. Run some split test campaigns While the above analyses were done on a manual basis, many personalization platforms allow you to run split (A/B) or multivariate tests in an automated way. You\u2019ll still need to do the tagging and set up the segments. You\u2019ll also have to create alternate versions of creative (e.g. the chat feature UX) so the tool can serve up the different versions to your visitors. Then you just need to wait a couple weeks for the results to roll in.\n\nIn the meantime, you can start envisioning other tests you can run. You can even run these other tests at the same time, as long as they don\u2019t interfere with each other (involve the same UX elements). In no time you\u2019ll have a collection of campaigns that you can learn from, even if they don\u2019t push the conversion, AOV and RPV needle upwards. Remember, negative learnings are just as valuable as positive ones on your conversion improvement roadmap because they confirm what you should not be wasting time on.\nSumming up Guys, if you could learn which of your gifts make your spouse the happiest, you\u2019d want to know, right? If those $50 flowers only made her happy for a week (until they wilted), but that $100 necklace kept her in the romantic mood for months, you\u2019d soon be buying her more bling than flowers.\nWhile this jewelry-affection correlation is subjective and may take the average guy months, even years, to discover, with an off-the-shelf dynamic optimization tool you can get quantified UX to conversion rate, AOV and RPV correlations in a matter of weeks or months. Yes, these tools will cost you a few thousand a month, but, if your website has significant traffic, you\u2019ll likely see a 300% or higher ROI within a few months. And this payback on your investment, along with the associated revenue lifts, will soon have your marketing leadership singing your praises.\n\n\nAccess premium resource \u2013 Web Personalisation guide \nThis guide explains how to create a strategy and implement personalisation by showing you the options for delivering more persuasive, relevant dynamic web content at relevant points in the onsite customer journey for B2B and B2C sites. \nAccess the Website and Ecommerce Personalization Guide \nSource: https://www.smartinsights.com/conversion-optimisation/conversion-optimisation-strategy/5-steps-discovering-conversion-hot-buttons-dynamic-personalization/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter drucker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave chaffey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google analytics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cms", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commerce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rpv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:22.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19de0d8099f7063ecba8cf165cd38f15b3613242", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_mtJ8LkPWru0PpzHwFN6bF38ZkDYuu.DjQl9yu34VMAGJ.m0UgNSQynyH32OZKeFoW1LcUF.d_yYszA.9Fq38TK56Oq7Vl9lY.JfK5vfJS4nNI9XKQ0IkA7hy6fAJL.B9QbMFHpGShlox7qHw5r7aVMjbqQDUvEtM-", "site_full": "www.biofuelsdigest.com", "site": "biofuelsdigest.com", "site_section": "http://www.tenergygroup.com/aggregator/rss", "site_categories": ["business", "green_solutions"], "section_title": "Triangle Energy Group aggregator", "title": "Biofuels Digest: Brazilian November ethanol imports fall on year for the first time in 2017", "title_full": "Biofuels Digest: Brazilian November ethanol imports fall on year for the first time in 2017", "published": "2017-12-06T20:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19de0d8099f7063ecba8cf165cd38f15b3613242", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_mtJ8LkPWru0PpzHwFN6bF38ZkDYuu.DjQl9yu34VMAGJ.m0UgNSQynyH32OZKeFoW1LcUF.d_yYszA.9Fq38TK56Oq7Vl9lY.JfK5vfJS4nNI9XKQ0IkA7hy6fAJL.B9QbMFHpGShlox7qHw5r7aVMjbqQDUvEtM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T20:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "Biofuels Digest: Brazilian November ethanol imports fall on year for the first time in 2017", "text": "December 6, 2017 | Meghan Sapp \nIn Brazil, for the first time this year, ethanol imports fell year-on-year in November to 50.3 million liters, down 64% from the year prior and 45% from October in response to the 20% import duty implemented in September.

This is one of the products from Estee Lauder\u2019s Crescent White Full Cycle range. The product comes in a tall, opaque, white bottle. It is easy to hold, and doesn\u2019t slip easily because it is triangular in shape. Though it is a luxury brand, the product was plastic and didn\u2019t feel like a luxury item; even drugstore brands have beautiful packaging these days. Though the packaging is not very important, if I am willing to pay 3000 rupees for a product, I expect it to look like a \u201cMona Lisa\u201d painting in my vanity. Sadly, it looks like a black and white print of it \ud83d\ude1b\n\nThe opening of the bottle is such that only a few drops get dispensed at one time, and it is easier if you are going to use a cotton pad with it. Though the product says moisture treatment lotion, it is a TONER!\n\nIt is supposed to be used immediately after cleansing, and so it is definitely a toner. We have seen toners as a second-step cleansing agent that strips away the oils with its astringent action. It differs in that sense by providing moisture, much like Korean toners. The lotion is watery, and a little orangish-yellow in colour. It has a smell which resembles a rose perfume my mother used to wear. The smell is not heavy, it\u2019s light and sweet. If your skin doesn\u2019t like stuff with fragrance in them, then stay away.\n\nAfter cleaning my skin, I apply this treatment lotion using my hands, but even after patting for a while, it doesn\u2019t sink in fully. It leaves a thin layer behind which makes you feel like you are having a big layer of mask on your face. In other words, it is heavy on the skin. But the heaviness doesn\u2019t interfere with the other products you might use after that.\nWhen I first applied this product, my skin was relatively dry and the product made my skin smooth and soft. When I used it when my skin was already soft and hydrated, it didn\u2019t do much actually.\n\nHaving used many Korean toners, I was forced to compare this product with them because they all fall into the \u201chydrating toner\u201d category. When comparing such products, I will say Korean toners worked better and they were cheaper compared to this Estee Lauder one.\nAlso, if one is using more layers of toner (like the Korean seven-skin method ), this product won\u2019t last long. I have been using it for more than a month now and I can say for sure that it has imparted a little brightening effect. This could be due to the moisture effect rather than the stripping effect like other regular toners.\nAlso, I used this toner with a cotton pad to test its potency to remove the residual dirt after cleansing, but it didn\u2019t do much in that department. It almost has no cleansing property. It is purely for giving a bit of moisture to your face.\nOverall, I did enjoy using this product, but it didn\u2019t meet my expectations; maybe this product was meant to be used along with the other products from the same range.\nPros of Estee Lauder Crescent White Full Cycle Brightening Moisture Treatment: A good moisturizing lotion. Good quantity of product and will last long. Pleasant smell. Cons of Estee Lauder Crescent White Full Cycle Brightening Moisture Treatment: Price is high for such an average product. It is scented and not suitable for all. Contains alcohol.

I like how you've set it up. Do you know how wide the deck on the back is, looks more than 6ft, maybe getting up to 8ft? Because the side boxes look like 20 inch depth, yet you've still got useful space between them.\nDid you find some drawers to fit in good?\nLooking for ideas myself, but our current service vehicle only 6ft wide.\nCheers View attachment 175899 Click to expand... John, Thanks, my truck is an Isuzu NQR, 4 cyl diesel, 6 spd manual. Wish I could get my hands on a 4WD model, or at least a limited slip. I narrowed the bed down to 7' wide and about 13' long. I didn't like the 8'6\" bed the previous owner had. The boxes are 16\"\" deep and didn't come with any drawers so I bought two 26\" Craftsman intermediate chests and put them inside the lower left box on top the bed. They're not super durable but they're holding up so far. They hold a lot of hand tools not kept in my red box (crowsfeet, hex drivers, large wrenches/sockets, punches, precision measuring tools, etc). The other boxes don't have drawers because I don't need that many. I do have a bunch of space between the boxes so I built the platform to hold the air compressor and another truck box(aluminum one in the pic) to hold welding gear. Under the platform I stow 2 large tubs (17-20 gal each) for oil/coolant draining, and clean oil pumping gear. Under the same platform I also have two portable tool boxes, one with 1\" gun, large truck sockets, and another box full of chain hoists, chains, etc. I always use that space for oil buckets, jack stands, etc. Between the vise and crane I have enough space for a full size pallet or large items like an engine or transmission. I still need to tweak my organization a bit, but I'm pretty happy with most of it. Snap-On makes a road box that can bolted down to a bed but I have no idea how much they are. Anyways, enough of me rambling, hopefully that helps.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:22.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f3bd0162575c9066a4cba8ba55a05df216d5d8a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Mel5Z6sLoWcr._i_Ozgzsb9rDdOxOTfMmRyBM8xuHRlUbgzR7MFx5l_LN3GcIXiAmxAE5mX0JPbTlzqZb62D.Ebli5ok.CTDmmo0zAFkyCOeQQ1jepbP1", "site_full": "www.originalfm.com", "site": "originalfm.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["food", "cuisine_specific"], "section_title": "", "title": "Liveblog on Storm Caroline: Met Office amber warning in force across NE Scotland -
