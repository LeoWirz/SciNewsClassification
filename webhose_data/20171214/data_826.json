We are currently investigating the nature of the incident and, as a result, we are stopping all operations for the next 24 hours.\nImportantly, our payment system was compromised and the contents of the NiceHash Bitcoin wallet have been stolen. We are working to verify the precise number of BTC taken.\nClearly, this is a matter of deep concern and we are working hard to rectify the matter in the coming days. In addition to undertaking our own investigation, the incident has been reported to the relevant authorities and law enforcement and we are co-operating with them as a matter of urgency.\nWe are fully committed to restoring the NiceHash service with the highest security measures at the earliest opportunity.\nWe would not exist without our devoted buyers and miners all around the globe. We understand that you will have a lot of questions, and we ask for patience and understanding while we investigate the causes and find the appropriate solutions for the future of the service. We will endeavour to update you at regular intervals.\nWhile the full scope of what happened is not yet known, we recommend, as a precaution, that you change your online passwords.\nWe are truly sorry for any inconvenience that this may have caused and are committing every resource towards solving this issue as soon as possible.\nHere is the hacker BTC address https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1EnJHhq8Jq8vDuZA5ahVh6H4t6jh1mB4rq\nAll funds from any internal wallets, which most small time people were using due to the huge fees NiceHash was charging, are gone.

So it\u2019s not something to be taken lightly.\nNeither is going on the record to assert you won't fulfill your duties in times of war. Presumably the editors of HuffPo/Slate are at least as smart as me, they\u2019ve also figured out that if \u201cGeneral Turgidson\u201d can be tricked into saying \u201cI refuse to launch on the president\u2019s orders\u201d, then the general will be removed from his command. That, perhaps, is the real endgame here. To bait trump into sowing disarray into his pentagon command staff, and milk THAT story for a few weeks?\nPerhaps someone can correct me if I\u2019m mistaken, but I don\u2019t recall the media \u201cfishing\u201d for pentagon staff who might object to Obama\u2019s incessant drone strikes in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and even Pakistan. Obama reportedly killed hundreds of civilians while seeking to neutralize as many terrorists as possible.\nI\u2019m in general agreement that allowing terrorists to embed themselves in civilian quarters which are automatically beyond the reach of military counterstrikes is a non-starter. Obama should have the freedom to decide on a case by case basis which targets warrant a drone strike, without having his pentagon staff goaded by reporters into acts of insubordination and treason.\nSo we have \u2013 yet again \u2013 a hypocritical double standard by the left. They raise not a finger in response to Obama\u2019s actual battle plans and casualties. But are fervently stirring the hypothetical pot regarding what would happen when North Korea demonstrates both the intent and ability to strike the USA with nuclear missiles.\nNorth Korea\u2019s mad boy-king would no doubt be cheered and emboldened if pentagon staff vowed to refuse to fight. Just as Putin took the west\u2019s lack of reaction in Crimea as permission to extend his invasion into Ukraine. Were we happy with that result?\nBy all means, we can discuss the circumstances which might warrant a military response to North Korea. And the tactics/strategy/weapons involved.

It's a two-shot series spanning six months. \nThe other changes include the addition of a meningitis booster for students ages 16 and up. Also, sixth-grade shots are now being called 11-year-old shots, requiring them at the age rather than the grade level. \nThe school districts want to make sure parents are 11 shots aware of the changes before it's too late. \n\"The fact is, this is impacting almost all students,\" Owensboro city schools district nurse Gay Lynn Lile told us. \"So you're looking at not being able to get appointments, possible vaccine shortages. So, it would be good planning to start now.\" \nEspecially since the Hepatitis A shot spans six months, it is imperative for parents to start making appointments as soon as possible. \nIf your child has already received the new required shots, just give the school permission to merge the old immunization record with the updated shots and they will be good to go. \nYou can find out more about immunization requirements here . \nCopyright 2017 WFIE .

and Ecumenical Meeting on 1 December 2017 in Dhaka: \u2018Let us continue to do good to them; let us continue to act so that their rights may be recognised. Let us not close our hearts, let us not look the other way. The presence of God today is also called \u201cRohingya\u201d. May each one of us give his own response\u2019; \n1.

Commends the efforts undertaken by the Government of Bangladesh and host communities to provide safety, shelter and humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya refugees; \n5. Calls on the Government of Myanmar to grant immediate, full, safe and unhindered access to UN agencies and their partners, as well as other domestic and international non-governmental organisations, to provide humanitarian assistance in Rakhine State, in particular for children; \n6.

At 56, I still miss her but I know she has definitely gone back to her father. \u201cOn her sick bed I always sang her favourite tunes, she would be imputing the melodious tunes and she died singing to her Lord.

Taxes on the initial value and taxes on the gains as you cash them out. Of course you get to deduct your expenses as well. States probably take a similar view. I certainly plan to report my cash outs from mining. It's not like you can hide the cash transfers.

Corporation (BMC) has announced that people staging demonstration in Bhubaneswar and holding wedding procession will have to pay taxes henceforth. \nThe BMC came up with new guidelines to impose tax for keeping the city clean as series of protests and wedding procession affecting the vehicular movements and unclean road. \nIn a press meet held today, BMC Mayor Anant Narayan Jena informed that the decision was made at a meeting chaired by the additional chief secretary of Home department on August 5 that protestors sitting on dharna here will have to pay a minimum of Rs 500 per day. \nThe municipal corporation has decided to collect fee for all types of protests, procession and meetings in the city, Jena added. \nA notification in this regard has been issued by the home department on Nov 17 and earlier, a resolution was passed by the BMC. \nAs per the notification, if the number of protestors is less than 500, tax of Rs 1000 per day will be levied by BMC, while if there are more than 500 persons, a minimum tax of Rs 500 plus Rs 5 for every person above 500 will be collected. \nSimilarly, for holding marriages or any other kind of procession, one has to pay Rs 5,000 to BMC as sanitation and administrative tax under new guidelines.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anant narayan

Acutally TVD pretty much copied BtVS, so IMO their are a lot of parallels and comparisons between these couples.\nThe difference is in these couples is mainly Buffy and Elena are wildly different. But, I personally see similarities between Stefan/Angel and Damon/Spike.\nI do however, find True Blood to be an entirely different ball game. Sooeric is nothing like Spuffy and Sookie/Bill are nothing like Bangel. Click to expand... I agree on the generalizations part. But I felt that most of the similarities in the couples came from being vampire love stories that included a vampire falling for a human; which is a very common story. TVD's books were written in 1991, well before BTVS, so I didn't see it as a copy of Buffy.

I am also sure this will serve as a deterrence to others, who have been or are engaging in the act of piracy.\" Popular filmmaker, Ralph Nwadike applauded the activities of the Nigeria Videos and Films Censors Board saying the arrest and prosecution of the suspected pirates is unprecedented. He said: \u201c Couple of years back, what we are witnessing here today never took place. These guys, I mean the pirates, were supposed to be demi-gods, ghosts and spirits, people that have some magical powers and people can not catch or see them despite their atrocities. Theirs is beyond piracy but the level of impunity, which they have exhibited in years back because they felt they are above the law. But we know there is a government but different government has different approach and for the first time, we have a gentleman in the name of Adedayo Thomas, the DG of the NFVCB, heard the cries of the film industry stakeholder by saying if indeed there are people pirating your jobs, let us see what we can do about them and he has not taken law into his hands but went through it legally. he hasn\u2019t taken matchetes or clubs like some of us have thought of doing because you can not keep me on a poverty level by taking my job and selling it without my consent despite all the finances I have had to gather, some borrow. And when I talk, you shut me up by threatening me. \u201d The raid, arrest and prosecution of movie pirates is coming under the leadership of the new NFVCB boss, Adedayo Thomas . |", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alaba", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "celestine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kehinde oluwole", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chukwudi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oluwole", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ndu celestine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adedayo thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hassan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukwuagwu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim hassan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenifa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin igboukwu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph nwadike", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chukwuka david", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "igboukwu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david chukwudi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national film and video censors board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfvcb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria videos and films censors board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "videos censors board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "police force headquarters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal high court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaba international", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abuja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lagos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ikoyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "igboukwu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamaica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ugochukwu ukwuagu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaba international market", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:28.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5384a525da17b6a7f279fe59fdecc99db5f502bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqKn23JXWh2QTqiGfWxuU2TltEwOrbyLfadEmzul6BlD79SHq_j_bLiO7Lr4gH8Xerl44Uc9IRmlA6Gh_EcYfe0fvBGpwoPKODFkxMhKpa8ReT.8kPHbpvqbfLHqlbEUeD_Tk7BrW4ZBgvq9OdBZvHXszKgaRkqHmYZlv0b2d2JN45Jms8myAmqW2mBIy1_ds7Tm32VD65Omtu3EbYOFPIZfcyhzptHVAI.3RMEZgaVkliusiM8DJGgYYOsODMZU4nTIiurzHzyU0mLixaLovXWr7xa5wHGx1c5tRivnX8gSPw--", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "http://www.marketwatch.com/rss/pf/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "MarketWatch.com -

And a downturn in landline sales has hurt business.\nBut he keeps at it, in no small part because he\u2019s an unabashed fan of the craftsmanship and history of his merchandise. \u201cHow many electromechanical objects that are 50 to 70 years old do exactly what they did when they were first made?\u201d Finder says. \u201cThe phones of the \u201930s and \u201940s outclass anything on the market today.\u201d\nA new calling For other entrepreneurs, like Woodbury, retro devices are their sole focus. The market for these phones would seem pretty small to build a business on. Two groups\u2014the Antique Telephone Collectors Association and Telephone Collectors International\u2014have only 1,125 members total.\nDon\u2019t miss: This is the vintage technology some companies are using to store your data \nYet buyers have been eager enough not only to keep Woodbury\u2019s operation afloat but allow it to thrive, even enough to support a four-person staff. Revenue, he says, can hit 50,000 Canadian dollars (roughly US$39,000) in a good month, and though he doesn\u2019t track long-term growth, he says that sales have shown a consistent year-to-year increase since the beginning.\nWhen original equipment is unavailable, the company uses reproduction parts\u2014such as cloth-covered cords\u2014manufactured in its own workshop. Additionally, Oldphoneworks.com has the capability to repair and refurbish models that aren\u2019t in its inventory, a service that accounts for about 10% of the company\u2019s revenue.\nWoodbury\u2019s customers are both \u201crepeat buyers; people who are going through their collection and want to upgrade, so they\u2019ll come to us to order the one part they need,\u201d he says, and \u201ca lot of one-offs, where someone Googles us because they need parts.\u201d\nTypically, Woodbury gets his inventory from individuals or estates looking to liquidate their collections. His average telephone sale is $250, a healthy return on his average investment of $50, not counting the cost of labor for refurbishing. Prices usually range from $100 to as much as $8,000 for a rare model, such as the 1905 Strowger Candlestick, the first commercially available dial telephone.\n(A Kansas City undertaker, Almon Strowger, believed that the only local operator was steering business calls to his competitor, who also happened to be her husband. So he invented dial service, bypassing operator intervention.)\nOldPhoneWorks.com Hello! This Strowger Candlestick dial phone goes for $7,999. \u201cA phone like that may sit there for five years, but eventually someone will buy it,\u201d Woodbury says. \u201cIf people really want something, they\u2019re willing to pay for it. You just have to be patient.\u201d\nTo build consumer trust, he offers a one-year, repair-or-replace warranty\u2014which gives him an edge over garage sales and flea markets, where the mantra is \u201cLet the buyer beware.\u201d He also says he can offer items in bulk, which is difficult for other dealers.\nA trunk line The company doesn\u2019t do much marketing. Mostly it involves making sure customers can find 20th-century technology using 21st-century methods. General manager Matt Jennings, 31, makes updating social media a top priority, trying to land the company at the top of Google rankings in their category.\nWhen he answered a help-wanted ad two years ago, he didn\u2019t know a spit-cup receiver from an F1 handset. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be repairing cellphones. I certainly didn\u2019t think this would be much of a market,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter my first day, I realized I was wrong.\u201d\nBeth Howe, like many buyers, found her way to Oldphoneworks by googling. She isn\u2019t a collector, but lusted after a Western Electric 500\u2014the phone of her childhood\u2014for her Topanga, Calif., home.\n\u201cI have fond memories of avocado-green kitchen appliances,\u201d Ms. Howe says. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just reaching adulthood that has made me nostalgic for the late \u201960s, early \u201970s design sensibility.\u201d\nAn online search brought her to the site, and she fell hard for a dark red Western Electric 302 instead. Last produced in 1954, the phone\u2019s sleek lines and distinctive chime made the model a staple of Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age.\n\u201cI thought, what fun to have a phone, not from my own childhood era, but from that classic period,\u201d says Ms. Howe, a visual-effects production supervisor, who worked on the recently released film \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d\n\u201cI was especially enamored of the matching textile cord\u2026and the clickety, clickety, clack of the dialing mechanism and the ringer, which is as good as a time machine to transport me back,\u201d she says.\nYou might like: How to value the stuff you inherited \nA starring role Other regular clients are the TV and movie industries, which account for 15% of the firm\u2019s revenue.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been building on its own,\u201d Woodbury says. Recently, he says, \u201cwe got calls from two different production companies on the same day asking us to rush phones that they need on the set.\u201d\nJess Royal, set decorator for the Netflix NFLX, +0.59% series \u201cStranger Things,\u201d calls the company her \u201cgo-to source.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s super hard to find a whole bunch of phones in working condition, such as ones that all light up for a police station scene,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve been great for us.\u201d\nAlso read: 5 strange things about \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 season 2 \nWhen a certain style Woodbury has supplied appears on the screen, his staff will see an immediate blip in sales.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t sell any red pay phones for ages, then, all of a sudden, we\u2019ll sell four in a day,\u201d he says.\nA big order came in recently from Ventana Big Sur, a luxury resort on California\u2019s Central Coast, which asked for 59 Western Electric phones dating back to the 1930s. The property\u2014which opened in October and is the first in North America for Asia-based Alila Hotels & Resorts\u2014needed its rooms to have a distinctive touch, says Kristina Jetton, general manager.\n\u201cIn this day and age,\u201d she says, \u201cwhen everyone has a cellphone, this is something unexpected, retro, quirky and fun.\u201d\nBonnie Miller Rubin is a writer in Chicago.
