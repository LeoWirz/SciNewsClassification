After the trailer launch, we had a freewheeling chat with Saif about why he was confident that it was time for him to venture into the digital space with Sacred Games on Netflix, the failure of Chef and his daughter Sara Ali Khan\u2019s film Kedarnath. \nAbout why he chose to get into the digital space with Sacred Games, Saif Ali Khan said, \u201cIt is the future of movies. We have all kind of films, the so-called mainstream films. I wouldn\u2019t call it niche, but the unpretentious films.\u201d On being the first \u2018star-actor\u2019 to do so, he said, \u201cI quite like the reputation of being an actor as well. What I mean by that is I am thinking more like an actor than a star these days. I just want to be creatively satisfied. I want to feel good doing it, and I don\u2019t want to follow rules. I don\u2019t want to be worried about anything as long as I have integrity and I am working hard. There was a time when I had gotten lazy, but today I am up at 7 am and on set, so I am enjoying that.\u201d \nTalking about Kaalakaandi, Saif Ali Khan said, \u201cKaalakaandi is a fun film. I think my acting has improved working with some of these guys.\u201d \nWatch Saif Ali Khan starrer Kaalakaandi fun: \nThe forty-seven-year-old actor then spoke about why he thinks his film Chef didn\u2019t do well in cinemas, even when he received some good reviews for his performance. \u201cI like Raj\u2019s attempt. A director is my first audience. I think it was a little European in flavour, and the drama could have been a little more. I think he generally avoids drama. I think the palette of this film was a little western. I have also got a few good reviews, but then some things are really not in your control. I wish it had done better. But I think people like different kind of movies in India. I think they would have wanted to see more food, working in the New York kitchen or the high pressure job. I still think it was a good movie, and I enjoyed working in it. I don\u2019t think it was even publicised correct. I didn\u2019t see enough buzz around the film. I think people want to see big hoardings of the film, and maybe they would have liked it if I had promoted the film on Bigg Boss or Comedy Nights or something.\u201d said Saif. \nSaif Ali Khan\u2019s daughter Sara Ali Khan is making her Bollywood debut with Kedarnath, directed by Abhishek Kapoor. On this, Saif expressed excitement and said, \u201cI am happy. I am excited for her. I think when we get close to that release, it will be like my film releasing.\u201d \n\nLast but not the least, when asked if he liked Sara\u2019s first look from Kedarnath, Saif said, \u201cI will wait. I want to see it properly. It is too early to get excited right now. I am very confident that she will be very good.\u201d For all the latest Entertainment News , download Indian Express App \u00a9 IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd More Related News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kal ho naa ho", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sara ali khan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shah rukh khan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "saif ali khan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kaalakaandi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kedarnath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abhishek kapoor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saif", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ie online media services pvt ltd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kaalakaandi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kedarnath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:44.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a4e845fea91c83b11e61e631a5464d72824f21f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKzDbKpciiQPReXJt42pKFoExYgW7UYyciUsOfp60A51XqZda7TG6namI_6hsZX9fqX3yAgtIaRnhGqnRaxwirfc-", "site_full": "community.ebay.com", "site": "ebay.com", "site_section": "https://community.ebay.com/t5/Selling/bd-p/selling-db/page/2", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Selling - Page 2 - The eBay Community", "title": "Dropshipping From Amazon", "title_full": "Dropshipping From Amazon - The eBay Community", "published": "2017-12-06T11:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3f46fff9fb1e0c2a122ecf3b47fd625a0b61d317", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKzDbKpciiQPReXJt42pKFoExYgW7UYyciUsOfp60A51XqZda7TG6namI_6hsZX9fqX3yAgtIaRnhA7OcPnCeIC_tqnO__68nVQ--", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "penguins_dont_f", "published": "2017-12-06T13:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: :\nQuote: :\nDo you think it is worthy of a neg?

I look forward to returning to the stage this weekend and performing for my fans.\" \nLionel is \"very supportive\", particularly of his daughter Sofia Richie and her new relationship with Scott Disick. \nSpeaking about her dad's reaction to her romance with the 'Keeping Up With The Kardashians' star, Sofia said: \"He's good. He's been very nice. He's been very cool. He's very supportive, whatever that means.\" \nHowever, he had previously admitted he was \"scared to death\" about the pair's new romance. \nHe said: \"Have I been in shock?! I'm the dad, come on. I'm scared to death, are you kidding me?\" \nWhilst a source added: \"He thinks Scott is the worst person she could ever see and that he raised her better than that. He thinks she should have more respect for herself as a young woman. Lionel knows Scott's playboy ways and he doesn't want to see his daughter get hurt.\" \nAnd Lionel - who has three kids - would love to expand his brood and have more children eventually. \nHe said: \"I'm willing to become a father again. I might have just let a secret slip there, but so be it - Lisa and I are cool with the idea of children. Marriage, on the other hand, is a very different issue, it's a bad idea for men. I've been there twice and it was very expensive for me. I've no idea to go there a third time - women have killed it for me. Kids aren't the problem - ex-wives are.

Seller must be a prime member and probably also has a good understanding of said Gorilla's \"Add-On Item\" program where they can add items to your order with free shipping if they are coming out of the same warehouse or something. The Seller found a way to make a profit in the spread between the Gorilla's price to him and the lowest competing price on eBay. Looking at the numbers, it could not have been more than about 50\u00a2 after taking out eBay fees.\nThere is NO WAY I would give this Seller a Red Donut for dropshipping.

Stunning Carter Cruise is already late for work, but boyfriend John Strong persuades her to play. He reams her rear; the model-quality beauty sucks dick ass-to-mouth and swallows semen. Gabriella Paltrova's black leather dress shows off her big, curvy rump. Mr. Pete manhandles her three holes, including a full-nelson buttfuck. Her bunghole gapes and she deep-throats, producing wads of gag spit. When Bill Bailey arrives to date cute starlet Holly Hendrix, he finds her masturbating with an anal toy. His prick stretches her sphincter to the limit in a passionate backdoor pounding. Luscious Latina lust buckets Vicki Chase and Abella Danger wear feline ears, and long, furry tails dangle from their butt plugs. They play with a double dong and lewdly lick each other's asshole. Xander Corvus' big boner fills their throats and drills their comely butts. Big-assed blonde nurses Jenna Ashley and Keisha Grey treat slender, sexy patient Dana DeArmond to strap-on dildo sodomy, lesbian three-way style!\r\n\r\nFormat: MP4\r\nQuality: DVDRiP\r\nVideo: H264,

From playing Simar in Sasural Simar Ka to dancing on the Nach Baliye stage, turning entrepreneur with her fashion brand to now trying comedy. After having a successful run on Nach Baliye, Dipika has made a comeback on stage with Entertainment Ki Raat, where she has already made her mark with her amazing performances. At the launch of the show, we asked Dipika why she took up back-to-back non-fiction shows. In an exclusive chat with indianexpress.com, the actor smilingly shared, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really planned and quite surprising for me also. I got a call from the team and trust me within five seconds, I agreed to do the show.\u201d \nAlthough Dipika\u2019s co-stars have already performed comedy on stage, this would be her first time. We asked Dipika if she ever felt out of place or nervous performing. \u201cTouch wood, I was really confident. The team is a wonderful one and with so many rehearsals, practice and technicals, it\u2019s quite easy to swim along. Also, the team has been really warm and I never felt left out. The captain of the ship, our director Nikul makes it a point that we all bond like family so that the chemistry comes alive on screen,\u201d she quipped. \nAs pe the show\u2019s format, the celebs pull each other\u2019s legs and make fun. On asked if she is comfortable getting roasted on national television, the actor quipped, \u201cSee it\u2019s an internal roast so we know that we will give back to each other\u2019s joke. It\u2019s absolutely fine and in good humour. Personally, I don\u2019t take things at heart. Also, after becoming jagat makhi, I can\u2019t really do that (laughs).\u201d \nTalking about her return to daily soaps, Dipika said, \u201cI am definitely looking forward to doing fiction soon. Let\u2019s see what lies ahead in life.\u201d \nWhen we asked if she would like to have her beau Shoaib Ibrahim as a guest on the show, she exclaimed, \u201cShoaib, oh God!

Fosun Tourism & Culture Group includes a Chinese joint venture with tour operator Thomas Cook Group and a luxury hotel in Hainan province as well as Club Med, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication. \nShanghai-based Fosun is considering spinning off the unit as early as next year and is likely to pick Hong Kong as the listing venue, according to the people. Two sources said the deal would raise at least $500 million, according to IFR. Fosun declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. \nFosun, co-founded by Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang, was in the vanguard of China\u2019s global dealmaking spree over the past few years, snapping up assets including a Portuguese insurer, and stakes in Greek jewellery retailer Folli Follie and Cirque du Soleil. It bought Club Med for $1 billion in 2015 after a protracted bid battle. \nThe float of Fosun\u2019s tourism unit is one of several expected from China\u2019s largest dealmakers as they rationalise portfolios and seek to boost their finances. Last week, fellow conglomerate HNA said it was considering listing Gategroup, the Swiss airline caterer, in Zurich next year and signalled it was looking at other asset sales. \nFosun itself announced plans last year to list Ironshore, its reinsurance unit, but was stalled by a U.S. review of its two-stage acquisition of the Bermuda-based group. It sold the company to U.S. insurer Liberty Mutual for $3 billion last December. \nIn September, it listed Israeli subsidiary Sisram Medical in Hong Kong through a HK$ 977 million ($125.06 million) IPO.

You will just complete the page.\nIn the new \"Gameplay Update\", there are now 5 different types of powders\nAir , Thunder , Water , Earth , and Fire\nEach powder has 6 tiers, over time, collecting powders takes up a ton of space.\nIf you're unlucky like me you tend to get a lot of different tiers which gets annoying.\nAt a maximum, these can take up 30+ spaces! That's over half the current bank space!\nWith this system, we could have a page with 30 or more spaces specifically for powders alone.\n(Don't have an example screenshot just yet but I need someone to make it!)\nTell me what you think!\nWhatever you think. good, bad, doesn't matter what it is. Let me know!\nI'm glad to take input from all of you and don't forget to share this with fellow\nWynncraftians if you support this change.\nI must also point out that in the discord my username is\nLegionaryLeader so if you have a question\nfeel free to message me!\n-Edits-\nSpoiler: The Edits 9/6/16\nSo far it seems like all of you really enjoy this idea.\nDon't forget to tell your friends if you did!\nI am reading every comment to see what people could think make this better\nand I am in fact taking note of such things.\nIf me and @Dirtobert agree on changes from you guys\nthen we will work on adding them and giving you screenshots!\nEverything can only get better from here!\nP.S.\nI am looking for someone to make me an image for peoples\nsignatures on here to spread the word of this more.\nIf you can provide then you will most definitely get credit for helping.\n9/8/16\nHey everyone! We've hit 100 supporters! Thank you all for supporting.\nThis is an amazing milestone, we can only grow bigger from here.\n9/16/16\nWe are over 150 supporters and over 50 likes!

Thank you all very much for supporting this and spreading\nmy idea! It's a big help. Don't forget to share this with your friends to help\nmake this thread even bigger. Thank you.\n11/16/16\nI have re-read the thread and changed a couple things to clear up something\nthat I saw people continuously misunderstand. I believe the whole thread\nshould be fully complete and understandable. We're slowly\ncreeping to 400 supporters and 200 likes!\n12/2/16\nAs we enter the month of December and get closer to a new year, this thread hit\n400 supporters and getting closer to 200 likes.\nThank you all very much for all the support, and feel free to bump this thread so I can get\nmore feedback! Don't forget I need someone who knows command blocks to make me\na screenshot! Have a great rest of the year.\n1/21/17\nHello Wynncraft community, it has been a while since I posted an update\nand would just like to mention we hit 500 supports and 200 likes!\nNow THAT is something truly amazing. There is however one problem\nPeople seem to continue getting confused about some features of the bank\nso if you aren't sure on something just feel free to ask and also\nlet me know so I can edit the thread to be more clear.\nThank you.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://i.imgur.com/tAw1O9c.png", "http://i.imgur.com/DtW5WGH.png", "http://i.imgur.com/ECjV4oQ.png", "http://i.imgur.com/fo6VSTP.png"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:45.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8fad0b187e60f02fbb0398da23aa85ef9bc4d3b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtpPigbbH.ak2NyOXDpz1ZsJTeH_HvJzNSa4ZvebP6NO_", "site_full": "floridastate.forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://floridastate.forums.rivals.com/forums/the-tribal-council.32/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "The Tribal Council | Warchant.com", "title": "JF on Francois", "title_full": "JF on Francois | Warchant.com", "published": "2017-12-06T09:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 40, "participants_count": 31, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.778, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3057, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f508211085c4752372b2a20ac497d266a0b80b97", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtpPigbbH.ak2NyOXDpz1ZsJTeH_HvJzNSdx9XqRZVfAZEkWQ167Zyjw-", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "bpicolo", "published": "2017-12-06T09:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:45.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15045a7a03af8d8d1679b9f6796ca6d72acc7448", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSBQA561yp_Mv0TmVC9I1X2K7wReyKK_0pPFRBXy5RI5Y3Yj49NFM2srj661huDcfQCpmyMNfXG1m6HqMD6yLI.E7KebxbQ05nKlWkJNwIDOj7yQSufvTstGD_xK8UOgquLZNxKJ15TGSYstZEwFPrM", "site_full": "marketforecastsite.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://marketforecastsite.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Cognitive Computing Market Size to Reach $49.36 Billion by 2025 \u2013 Market Forecast Site", "title": "Cognitive Computing Market Size to Reach $49.36 Billion by 2025", "title_full": "Cognitive Computing Market Size to Reach $49.36 Billion by 2025", "published": "2017-12-07T12:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "15045a7a03af8d8d1679b9f6796ca6d72acc7448", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSBQA561yp_Mv0TmVC9I1X2K7wReyKK_0pPFRBXy5RI5Y3Yj49NFM2srj661huDcfQCpmyMNfXG1m6HqMD6yLI.E7KebxbQ05nKlWkJNwIDOj7yQSufvTstGD_xK8UOgquLZNxKJ15TGSYstZEwFPrM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "marketforecastsite", "published": "2017-12-07T12:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "Cognitive Computing Market Size to Reach $49.36 Billion by 2025", "text": "The global cognitive computing market size is expected to reach USD 49.36 billion by 2025, according to a new study conducted by Grand View Research, Inc.

Mr. Conyers, in an interview Wednesday, tried to head off a possibly disqualifying scandal just a day after his father resigned from Congress amid multiplying allegations of sexual harassment. As issues of sexual harassment and abuse roil Washington, any violent altercation against a woman could doom his effort to take the seat that his father held since 1965.\nThe younger Mr. Conyers said that the couple began arguing around 3 a.m. the day after Valentine\u2019s Day and that after a physical fight, police arrested him on suspicion of domestic violence. The Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office later dropped the charges, but the girlfriend got a restraining order against Mr. Conyers, which remains in effect until March of next year, he said. \u201cShe says I stabbed her, which makes no sense,\u201d Mr. Conyers, 27, said. \u201cI didn\u2019t do this. She and I had a verbal altercation and that escalated. She pulled the knife on Mr. Conyers added that he had not spoken to the girlfriend in several months and that the two had agreed to go their separate ways after dating for two and half years. \u201cAt no point did I initiate contact with any objects,\u201d he said. \u201cAll criminal charges were dismissed and a restraining order was entered as a cooling off measure. The authorities did not see any need to proceed further.\u201d\nMr. Conyers, who describes himself as \u201ca partner at Detroit\u2019s first minority-run hedge fund,\u201d said he wanted to be honest and transparent about the incident and that he felt remorseful. \u201cI apologize, and I am regretful for any part I played in escalating the altercation,\u201d he said. Representative John Conyers Jr. announced Tuesday that he would leave Congress, and he endorsed his son to succeed him. By trying to keep his Detroit-area seat in the family, Mr. Conyers, 88, the longest-serving African-American representative in history, may have touched off a family feud. His great-nephew Ian Conyers, a state senator in Michigan, had already said he plans to run in a special House election. But John Conyers III said Wednesday that he isn\u2019t sure he wants to run because he does not want to deal with \u201cpublic life,\u201d which often comes with \u201cunnecessary grief.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t ask my dad to say that I was going to run because I don\u2019t know if I am going to run,\u201d Mr. Conyers said. \u201cI was extremely caught off guard by his endorsement. This is what he wants. Who am I to tell him what he wants?\u201d\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/us/politics/john-conyers-iii-stabbing-domestic-violence.html", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/us/politics/john-conyers-iii-stabbing-domestic-violence.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:45.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c80aa6624a3f048ae1a70d89e892ea3cef9c73bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2eOpN__abbg9iRwMQpTw4ZXv8YZtFJqX3VwKlvmaoZiBne7CV7QzWbF8JKdjaE0UjdrG3_EzPY6j4GU331edwY4SI0CkFJB.obX8oCcQXQYEkysZVdGUEFG9zyM01g1seHpTf2OA4s6a1bRRx8K5kp3w0aBVt08SK", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Gujarat Assembly elections 2017: BJP candidate Jayesh Radadiya declares assets | The Indian Express", "title_full": "Gujarat Assembly elections 2017: BJP candidate Jayesh Radadiya declares assets | The Indian Express", "published": "2017-12-07T13:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/12/jayesh-radadiya-759.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c80aa6624a3f048ae1a70d89e892ea3cef9c73bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2eOpN__abbg9iRwMQpTw4ZXv8YZtFJqX3VwKlvmaoZiBne7CV7QzWbF8JKdjaE0UjdrG3_EzPY6j4GU331edwY4SI0CkFJB.obX8oCcQXQYEkysZVdGUEFG9zyM01g1seHpTf2OA4s6a1bRRx8K5kp3w0aBVt08SK", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Express News Service", "published": "2017-12-07T13:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "Gujarat Assembly elections 2017: BJP candidate Jayesh Radadiya declares assets | The Indian Express", "text": "\n*Include cash, bank balance, insurance, vehicles and jewellery \nLIABILITIES (Including Rs 15.99 crore loans due to individuals/entities) \nCriminal Cases \n2 cases lodged in separate police stations in Vadodara, charges in both framed by a city court.

Saturday December 9 , the party's south-south stakeholders have endorsed Uche Secondus for the position of party chairman and this hasn't gone down well with the southwest members who insist they should get the position.\n\nA member of the Board of Trustees of the Peoples Democratic Party, Chief Ebenezer Babatope described the position of the south-south as provocative. Babatope, in a statement he personally signed said the South-South stakeholders were being unfair to the South-West, whose turn, according to him, it was to produce the next PDP national chairman.\n\nHe also accused caretaker chairman, Ahmed Makarfi of working for Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike out of greed and ambition. Babatope said, \u201cWe (the Yoruba) will never be servile to anyone at all. And most importantly, we will never compromise on the position of the National Chairman of our great party.\n\n\u201cIt is our turn! And this much must be respected. Anything less than this is outright unacceptable. This is why Makarfi must recuse himself from the composition of all committees of the convention.\n\n\u201cMakarfi is not honest. He is working for Wike. That is the absolute truth.\n\u201cThe crass insistence and the insulting protestation of Governor Nyesom Wike that the South-South is the zone providing succour to the PDP is rather crude and insensitive. And it is not true. Right from the formation of the party, the Yoruba people have been consistent in their devotion and loyalty to the party. And they have been very supportive in financial fillip to the party.\n\u201cBut Wike is not really the one to blame. The fault solely lies with Senator Ahmed Makarfi who is blinded by personal ambition and apparent greed that could not make him think clearly and selflessly about the issue at hand.\n\u201cIt is Makarfi who has deliberately mangled and distorted the micro-zoning tradition of our great party which has given the PDP well over 16 years of inclusive and all embracing accommodating nature.\n\n \u201cNow the very fundamental fabric and dominating principle of the party is torn asunder. We are no longer at ease.\n\u201cThe pronouncement of the South-South Stakeholders is not only provocative, it is divisive, skewed, untidy, and a blatant slide into tribal political arrangement. Do they think the good people of Oduduwa land will just sit down and take it? They are dead wrong.\u201d\n\nSource: Punch ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ebenezer babatope", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmed makarfi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wike", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babatope", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "makarfi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uche secondus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyesom wike", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pdp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "board of trustees of the peoples democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rivers state", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oduduwa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south-west", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:45.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42a55eeaa3fd1ad2bb1d212528258e5146b96029", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.e_7BDK97c0BjyOV9odwu6se8zrw85qbCvnafrbU1anm_TlIgpAqMUyNdtj.99tXjlVpSbnQ4E9j..4gEY.D3zE6IpBlyVzdkeiUcpJgmBz2SyprBA6SS3uHPFZVcGsdA-", "site_full": "www.donegaldaily.com", "site": "donegaldaily.com", "site_section": "http://www.donegaldaily.com/category/sport/feed/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Sport \u2013 Donegal Daily", "title": "Coll, Blaney become Finn Harps\u2019 first two signatories for 2018", "title_full": "Coll, Blaney become Finn Harps\u2019 first two signatories for 2018", "published": "2017-12-06T11:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.donegaldaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ciaran-Coll-Shane-Blaney-Dec-17.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "42a55eeaa3fd1ad2bb1d212528258e5146b96029", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.e_7BDK97c0BjyOV9odwu6se8zrw85qbCvnafrbU1anm_TlIgpAqMUyNdtj.99tXjlVpSbnQ4E9j..4gEY.D3zE6IpBlyVzdkeiUcpJgmBz2SyprBA6SS3uHPFZVcGsdA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Chris McNulty", "published": "2017-12-06T11:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "Coll, Blaney become Finn Harps\u2019 first two signatories for 2018", "text": "Coll, Blaney become Finn Harps\u2019 first two signatories for 2018   6, 2017 16 \nShares \nClub Captain Ciaran Coll and emerging youngster Shane Blaney have become the first two signings made by Finn Harps manager Ollie Horgan for the 2018 season. \nNews that Coll, who has played almost 250 times for Harps, has decided to stick around following the club\u2019s relegation to the First Division, will serve as a massive boost to the Finn Park faithful. \nLetterkenny teenager Blaney, who is not short of suitors across the water, will be hoping for a breakthrough season in 2018 having made a couple of cameo appearances at the end of this year. \n\u201cIt\u2019s good to get Ciaran and Shane re-signed,\u201d Horgan, who on Monday signed a new two-year deal at Harps, said. \n\u201cCiaran has been very loyal to Finn Harps over the past nine seasons and his experience will be vital to us in the First Division next year. \n\u201cShane has shown that he has the quality to play at senior level.

Because these fires are striking at a major nerve center, so to speak, they seem to be getting a lot more attention in the news. And because of this we're getting a flood of truly terrifying images, film and video. Terrifying and apocalyptic. Is 2017 working up to a Hollywood climax? I mean, if you're looking for straight-up, End of Days apocalyptic imagery, there it is. The fires are being fed by the Santa (In)Ana winds, named for the mother of the Virgin Mary. Their scope and intensity is said to be downright Biblical and firefighters are struggling to even begin to contain them. The City of Angels is ablaze: in the end, how could it be any other way? We have family that lost their home in the Santa Rosa fires, but they were luckier than the 44 people who lost their lives. That \"All-Important\" 44 again. It's like a bad penny-penny. And all too fitting for 2017, the flames are descending on Getty Center, the complex containing the artwork of the famous oil magnate and current focus of a new feature film featuring Braintree's own Mark Wahlberg. And until quite recently, Kevin \"Little\" Spacey. He is being replaced by veteran star Christopher Plummer, a gray eminence who will spare movie-goers of Spacey's spectacularly horrid makeup job. The film is directed by Ridley Scott, who brought us Alien:Covenant this year and is launching a series on Jack \"Antichrist\" Parsons called Strange Angel . Timely. We might be seeing plenty of strange angels in the days to come. Also quite timely is the Getty's new exhibit on Medieval manuscripts. Here we see David and his lyre, which brings us back to those strange angels from Vega in Lyra, aka \"King David's Harp.\" INVOCATION The Getty-Scott-Parsons connection is particularly interesting in that J. Paul Getty Jr. financed Invocation of My Demon Brother and Lucifer Rising , along with the CIA's Ford Foundation. Do also note that Jean Cocteau of Beauty and the Beast fame, who had just made the Lyra-resonant Orpheus film, became a friend and supporter of Anger's work as well. Also note the Vegas superimposed on that photo of Anger there. Gustave Dore does it every time. The influence Cocteau had on Anger's filmmaking is impossible to overstate. As is Cocteau and Anger's influence on music video and MTV. But there's been another Getty in the spotlight this year, hasn't there? And that's J.Paul Getty's great-grandson Balthazar, who played a very Dennis Hopper-like drug dealer in Twin Peaks: The Return . Which of course brings us back to Elizabeth Fraser --which everything eventually does-- and that's through Getty's starring role in the music video for \"Song of the Siren\" that David Lynch embedded within Lost Highway for no perceptible reason. And here's a little screencap from the sequence. Starting to get the picture now? Do you think I'd go so far out on a limb with this thing if it didn't keep coming up aces? Don't ask me to explain it. The world is a very strange place. Note also that Lost Highway featured the acting debut of Satanist Marilyn Manson, who's been in the news quite a bit lately. Why is anyone's guess. I suppose it has something to do with the apocalyptic mood that is being ratcheted up in the media. DEMONS OF THE AIR Speaking of which, I couldn't help but notice that Bel Air is in the line of fire, quite literally. The exclusive enclave is finding out that infernos don't really care how rich you are, only that you're inflammable. Something we see in the Book of Revelation, which seems inspired by a volcano eruption, quite possibly the eruption at Pompeii and Herculanum: Let's not forget earthquakes. There was one in Southern California earlier tonight, because they don't have enough problems already. Bel Air also seems to fit into the overarching narrative we're seeing: Bel means \"ruler,\" as in \"ruler of the kingdom of the air.\" How exactly it fits-- and why-- is still a very open question. LET'S ALL GO TO THE FIRE DANCES And speaking of fires, note that a different Bel is the patron god of the Beltane Fire Festival in Edinburgh, which is now expanding into the Samhuinn Fire Festival. But Beltane seems to making a major comeback all over Britain. Yeah, there's a comforting image for you. How long before they start putting people in those things? I'd reckon within the next decade. I love The Wicker Man as much as anyone but I'm not sure I'm ready for the real thing. FIRE FROM THE HEAVENS I guess Fireball Season came early to Tampa, because shit was falling from the sky all over the place. Of course, \"Fireball Season\" is a total lie created a few years back to cover for flaming crap falling at sub-meteorite speeds that no one can seem to explain. And then there's the star falling from Heaven, burning as if it were a lamp ( ASTEROID!!!! ). The asteroid Phaeton 3200- which they named it so because \"Lucifer Babylon \" was a bit louche-- is scheduled to give Earth a little trim on the 17th. I'm not liking the numbers here, but let's hope for the best. But let's not forget that Phaethon is also associated with Cygnus, the Swan, which our astronomers seem particularly fascinated by. As does Donald Trump, who's perched atop Cygnus like Draco, the Dragon. Or King Cepheus. Or both. \"King Dragon.\" Huh. Is he trying to tell us something here? \"FIRE WITH NO END IN SIGHT\" If so then what do you make of Trump announcing the relocation of the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. That seems a bit, I don't know, audacious ? And Muslims don't seem too overjoyed either, with the Palestinian Authority accusing Trump of playing with fire. Interesting day to say so. Keep an eye out for fire symbolism--and actual fire-- in the reaction to this move. Which may be the intended effect. I can't help but wonder if this is part of an upcoming season of the Apocalypse Reality Show, where the new US Embassy will be the de facto Third Temple. Keep an eye out for Babylonian influences in the design for the new building, something we've been seeing quite a lot of recently. I'd say that was a gimme at this point. LAKE OF FIRE AND BRIMSTONE You won't need to be an SJW to sniff out the prophetic implications here. The far-left New York Daily News seems presold on the Antichrist idea. But is the Pope-pot calling the kettle black here? Francis- the last in the line if you believe Saint Malachy-- isn't too happy over this latest move either. But I'm struck by the use of \"wisdom and prudence,\" in light of the Sophia symbolism out there. Is the Pope a 4-9er? Since Prudent is a given name that became an adjective is he inviting us to see \"wisdom\" the same way? The possibilities are tantalizing. But given the fact that so many people think Francis is the Antichrist, maybe it's a clever bit of deflection. A way to take the focus off his own diabolism. Or maybe Trump is the Antichrist and Francis is the False Prophet? There are too many choices these days. Note here that Franny is flashing the OK gesture, which Trump loves to do as well. Is it a secret 666 like you hear told so often these days, or is it just that the Pope is Italian and Trump is from Queens? I guess we'll find out soon enough. Speaking of lakes of fire. Read in your best Dr. Evil voice. BURNED AT THE STAKE Speaking of the Poor Knights of the Temple of Jerusalem, they're the stars of a new series debuting on History tonight . Will we see DeMolay et al burned at the stake? Probably. You really gotta love the timing. Meticulous. I should probably mention that the Archangels are the Knights of Heaven. And we saw an occultation of Aldebaran-- called the \"Torch\" and associated with Michel-- during the other night's Supermoon. And of course this story broke this week as well. According to The Intercept Trump is assembling his own intelligence agency, intended to override the CIA. At the head of this project are Lt Col Oliver North of Iran-Contra fame and Blackwater's Erik Prince. Prince being the best-known Templar of our times. If any of this is true, look for things to get very, very hairy, because these are not men famous for their reasoned moderation. Maybe it is the Apocalypse after all. And in a all-too-fitting bit of highly-charged symbology, we hear now that Da Vinci's Salvator Mundi is being moved to the Louvre's new franchise outlet in Abu Dhabi. From the Pyramid to the Dome. IGNITE THE LIGHT In the last post we looked at the horrific deaths at the gate of the Gate of Heaven cemetery in Valhalla (\"Hall of the Slain\"), and the sickening symbolic links it had to Katy Perry's Super Bowl appearance, where she literally entered the stadium as the Whore of Babylon, greeted by a sea of orange orbs. Some readers pointed out some trenchant details in the narrative, such as the fact that the train- its head car numbered 4333- hit the 49 year-old Ellen Brody as it was going 49 MPH. Another reader pointed out Brody's maiden name, Schaeffer. Schaeffer being the original name of the stadium in which Super Bowl 49 champions once played. Which began construction on September 23. I should also point out that Perry's final number at Super Bowl 49 was \"Firework\"-- as in \"Baby, you're a firework.\" The bit where she flew around as a binary star. Do you ever feel already buried deep Six feet under scream But no one seems to hear a thing Do you know that there's still a chance for you 'Cause there's a spark in you You just gotta ignite the light And let it shine Like the Fourth of July 'Cause baby you're a firework And the meaning of the name of the woman who was literally incinerated alive at \"the Gate of Heaven\" in the \"Hall of the Slain?\" A firework, alright. There was also a full moon the night of the collision. Brody worked at Bill and Hillary Clinton's favorite jewelry store, ICD. They created the charm bracelet that Hillary liked to show off on the campaign trail. Perry was also closely connected to the Clintons, having acted as a very prominent supporter and surrogate for Hillary's campaign. \"Roar\" and \"Firework\" were popular at campaign events. \"Roar\" being the big Whore song, where Perry played Mystery Babalon the Great (or April Bell, if you want to be slightly more current) at the Super Bowl. A song Hillary herself chose to be her theme song. And used for her closing advertising. The Antichrist and the Whore of Babylon. And you wonder why I didn't vote? Katy is doing a different take on the Scarlet Woman more recently. THE FORTY-NINE ANGELS So realizing all of this, let's look at the 49er a bit more closely. The moribund old media are crawling over one another to heap praise on him-- and certainly no one skeptical of state power (or who's watched those sickening compilations of unarmed citizens being gunned down with absolutely no provocation) can argue with his professed motivations-- but knowing the N-ph-L the way I do I can't help but wonder about it all . All the more in light of this manufactured controversy, when right-wing talk show host Tomi Lahren tore into the Queen of All Media Rituals BeyoncIsis for handing the 4-9er his sacred crystal phallus on behalf of Sports Illustrated. You see, that got me to thinking about Super Bowl 50, when BeyoncIsis appeared with Chris Martin (literally \"Martian\") of Coldplay and Bruno Mars, singing in front of this weird symbol... ...which The Sync Book's Alan Green likened to this symbol... ...of the Martian locust-gods who rise from the titular pit in Quatermass and the Pit. A bit of sacred geometry that Quatermass likens to a \"Kabbalist\" sign, somewhat erroneously. Or is it? THE EQUATION OF TIME The day the 4-9er began his protest is rather significant as well- it was the date of the rare \"Equation of Time\" phenomenon. There was also a New Moon and a Solar Eclipse. Now, I'm not going to quarrel with the ostensible reason for these protests but in light of everything we're seeing everywhere-- especially in the N-ph-L , I feel obliged to point something out. And that's that the kneeling protests.... ...are essentially identical to pre-and post-game prayers. Same exact poses- on one knee, arms joined. So you do have to wonder, has Kaepernick's original protest- where he stayed sitting on the bench-- been appropriated for some other agenda, something no one is actually talking about? I mean, the evidence is right there. Go look for yourself in case you think I'm cherry-picking. Are the N-ph-L'ers actually being manipulated into praying-- or at least appear to be praying-- for some entirely unspoken purpose? Or is that even a question? Oh, I know- I'm just flying off the handle with irresponsible speculation. But who is actually the author of the kneeling protest? Hint: it's not Colin Kaepernick. It's a former football player with an extensive background in military intelligence. And Hollywood . I mean, did you actually expect anything else? POSTSCRIPT: VULCAN'S RING The eclipse the night that the kneeling protest began saw a \"Ring of Fire\" eclipse, another one of these terms that astronomers seem to be pulling out of their asses recently. But it does turn our attention to the situation in Bali, which could still get rather apocalyptic. We also recently saw a story in which Eleven- aka Millie Bobbie Brown-- was trapped on the island, though that could be entirely ritual in nature.

Macron landed and immediately traveled to the vast al-Udeid Air Base, home to some 10,000 American troops and the forward headquarters of the US military\u2019s Central Command. France also has a contingent of soldiers at the base, which is crucial to the ongoing fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria and to the war in Afghanistan. \nMacron smiled and shook hands with the French and American soldiers who greeted him at the base before walking into a meeting with the base\u2019s top commanders. The French president later will hold talks with Qatar\u2019s ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. \nMacron\u2019s visit comes just after a planned two-day Gulf Cooperation Council meeting collapsed in just a few hours over the ongoing Qatar diplomatic crisis. \nBahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates began their boycott in June over allegations that Doha supports extremists and has too-close relations with Iran. \nQatar has long denied supporting extremists and shares a massive offshore natural gas field with Tehran. \nAlso likely to come up during his visit is President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that America recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim the city\u2019s eastern sector, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of a future independent state. These rival claims lie at the heart of the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \nBefore Macron\u2019s arrival, Sheikh Tamim held calls with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Trump.

A report on Variety said that the Life actor will be joining Justice Smith (Jurassic World fame) and Kathryn Newton (of Big Little Lies fame) in the new film which will be directed by Rob Letterman (Goosebumps fame). \nThe shooting for the film will start in mid-January in London. Pokemon used to be a popular cartoon show, which started airing on Cartoon Network 2003. In 2016, Pokemon became more popular as a gaming app. Pokemons are fictional creatures created by Nintendo who have special powers. Pikachu happens to be one of the most precious Pokemon. However, the character Detective Pikachu stands out as it has traits of being a self-styled investigator, who excels at his game. Ryan Reynolds will be essaying the role of the Detective Pikachu. \nA report on Hollywood Reporter suggested that the story will begin with Justice Smith\u2019s father being abducted. Circumstances will force him to team up with Pikachu. Katheryn will be playing a journalist, who will also assist him, to find his father. Legendary Entertainment has not revealed further details. The company believes the film will be a success since the video games witnessed high sales worldwide. The distribution of the film will be managed by Universal Pictures. \nOn the work front, Ryan Reynolds will be seen as the foul-mouthed Marvel superhero again in Deadpool 2, which will release in June, 2018.

You may think that there is not much to be learnt in a wilderness. Nevertheless it is so; it is the best place to learn heavenly things. It was so with Abraham; it was so in the case of Moses; it was true with Israel. The wilderness had also a definite place in the life of Paul. Whether we take it in a literal or a spiritual way, the fact is that God\u2019s people were, again and again, sent into the wilderness. Many of us know what such a \u2018wilderness\u2019 means.\nWhen God puts His hand upon a people, He always cuts them off from everything which is not of Himself; that is, He cuts them off from the whole realm of their natural life, and puts them, so to speak, outside of the world of nature. We see this in the case of the people of Israel. Pharaoh was allowing them to go into the desert; he wanted them to serve God in a half-hearted way: partly in Egypt and partly in the land. But that could never serve God. God\u2019s irreducible minimum was: not a hoof was to be left behind. God\u2019s people should be absolutely separated from Egypt. Therefore the Red Sea came between His people and the Egyptians. God saw to it that they remained in the wilderness until they had learnt their lesson. God had some great lessons to teach them there. Israel\u2019s sojourn in the wilderness had to serve coming generations as an example. The dispensation of the church \u2014 yet far away in the future \u2014 was to derive its instruction from them. In the wilderness God laid down eternal principles. The things which happened to Israel \u201cwere our examples\u201d. \nGod cuts His people off from the whole realm of nature. You know how little the natural man prevails in the wilderness. It doesn\u2019t matter how intellectual, how mighty the natural resources are. It is not of much use in a wilderness. You may be an excellent student, a splendid businessman or organizer, yet all this is not much good in a wilderness. For a man who is planted down alone in the middle of a wilderness, his own cleverness is not of much avail, his natural capacities will not bring him very far.\nSo you see what matters. When God gets us into His hand, He takes us right out of the realm of what we are by nature. That is the meaning of the wilderness. God\u2019s object is to make Christ everything. So long as we can do things, so long as we have resources in ourselves, we cannot know Jesus Christ. Christ will remain an unexplored realm for us.\nBook Ministry Website \nBook-Ministry eBay Store \nName (required) Email (required) Website Comment (required) \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abraham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus christ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dec", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:47.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8fad0b187e60f02fbb0398da23aa85ef9bc4d3b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtpPigbbH.ak2NyOXDpz1ZsJTeH_HvJzNSa4ZvebP6NO_", "site_full": "floridastate.forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://floridastate.forums.rivals.com/forums/the-tribal-council.32/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "The Tribal Council | Warchant.com", "title": "JF on Francois", "title_full": "JF on Francois | Warchant.com", "published": "2017-12-06T09:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 40, "participants_count": 31, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.778, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3057, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9a8bccbaf99ae698bb4870db61436e91d201d60a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtpPigbbH.ak2NyOXDpz1ZsJTeH_HvJzNSdx9XqRZVfAZaPYPw62SI_Y-", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "NebNoles", "published": "2017-12-06T09:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:47.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15ad60d64464054944c84bc648dfa07c93813059", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog669nc0y8UFH_Jf1oX8QNCaYzYY7xsapGd16coXeGNSUYbiOaeW4WQ2_9rRNRPx_nxp93IAVZO8ns9kq2LLD_n_cjEgMnSXiBzBYFHd1V2s3Ck26kWSBP7p7rZMoe7EmauQ--", "site_full": "community.myfitnesspal.com", "site": "myfitnesspal.com", "site_section": "http://community.myfitnesspal.com/en/categories/food-and-nutrition", "site_categories": ["health", "exercise"], "section_title": "Food and Nutrition \u2014 MyFitnessPal.com", "title": "New products that caught your eyes recently? - Page 486", "title_full": "New products that caught your eyes recently? - Page 486 \u2014 MyFitnessPal.com", "published": "2017-12-07T09:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://us.v-cdn.net/5021879/uploads/editor/4n/h5b54c99pdcn.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 638, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d07e15c4ced49ee31d3ac1a2234a898cd7391ad5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog669nc0y8UFH_Jf1oX8QNCaYzYY7xsapGd16coXeGNSUYbiOaeW4WQ2_9rRNRPx_nxp93IAVZO8ns9kq2LLD_n_cjEgMnSXiBzBYFHd1V2s3Ck26kWSBP7p53PXduDdCUlz7xzzR8u8AE", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "River314", "published": "2017-12-07T17:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I snagged the last Halo Top Candy Bar pint at Wal-Mart after worka little while ago!!

More than 12.2 million voters are eligible to exercise their voting rights in the second phase of the polls. \nThe voting is taking place for 128 constituencies of Parliament\u2019s House of Representatives and 256 seats of Provincial Assemblies in 45 districts. In total 4,482 candidates, including Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, will be trying their fate in the final phase. \nFor the House of Representatives, 1,663 candidates are contesting and 2,819 candidates are trying for the Provincial Assemblies. As many as 15,344 polling centres have been set out for the polling that started early today amid tight security and will continue till 5 pm. \nVote counting is expected to start later today. The first phase of the polls in the land-locked country was successfully held in 32 districts on November 26. \nAround 200,000 security personnel, including the Army, have been deployed for the polls in an attempt to step up security in the wake of explosions at various parts of the country ahead of the elections. \nThis is for the first time that elections for Parliament and Provincial Assemblies are being conducted under the new Constitution promulgated in September 2015. \nThe elections will elect 128 Members of Parliament and 256 Members of the Provincial Assemblies. \nThe House of Representatives consists of 275 members. Of them, 165 are elected directly under the First-Past-the-Post system while the remaining 110 come through Proportional Representation system. \nThe elections are being seen as the final step in Nepal\u2019s transition to a federal democracy following a decade-long civil war till 2006 that claimed more than 16,000 lives. \nWhile many hope Nepal\u2019s first state elections will hasten regional development, others fear they will spark a fresh wave of violence. \nIn 2015, when Nepal adopted a new Constitution that split it into seven states, dozens of people were killed in ethnic clashes over territory and rights. \nFollowing the adoption of the new Constitution in 2015, the ethnic Madhesi group, mostly of Indian-origin, protested for months, saying they were not getting enough territory in one of the states and were also facing discrimination. \nThe polls are a major step toward implementing the new Constitution.

The hero for the Kangaroos attack remained left-arm seamer Mitchell Starc who completed his 9th five-wicket haul in Test cricket. \nBut the 27-year old believes that there is still scope for improvement in the bowling department. \u201cI think the exciting thing is our bowling group can only get better.
