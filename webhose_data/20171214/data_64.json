The zero-drop design and lightweight feel should make it a great option for dropping the pace, while a hint of cushioning offers enough versatility to handle some daily miles. \nMidsole \nTo create a cushioned ride that gives the foot plenty of underfoot pop, the midsole is constructed using a durable EVA foam with Altra\u2019s Inner Flex design. Inner Flex consists of flex grooves that are cut into the midsole to allow the shoe to bend with the foot through the gait cycle. \nOutsole \nA thin layer of durable rubber covers the majority of the outsole and should prevent excessive wear and tear on the midsole during uptempo efforts, or even daily training on the roads. The foot-shaped pattern is primarily aesthetic. \nUpper \nTo minimize weight, Altra\u2019s designers constructed a fairly simple upper that will still provide a supportive hold for the foot. Engineered mesh provides a comfortable wrap that should allow for ample airflow through the toe box, while the internal heel counter is designed to prevent any sliding within the shoe. \n  18 mm heel, 18 mm forefoot, 0   6.0 oz (men\u2019s size 9), 4.7 oz (women\u2019s size 8) \n  Altra  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "desi", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "altra solstice", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "altra", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:43.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc4b97a6bbab3a8ba63c38663f4dc78c67c0d8be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqHG.7gyAaAvntWWzAKf9QrCJLZNbL9RjgxOs_HOl5fckLsLOa7fwlh33ey0We15T2349V4u_EMtKDr79ZSsbeH8j30hxVl0H8-", "site_full": "blog.runningwarehouse.com", "site": "runningwarehouse.com", "site_section": "http://blog.runningwarehouse.com/?feed=rss2", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Running Warehouse Blog", "title": "The North Face Flight RKT | First Look", "title_full": "The North Face Flight RKT | First Look", "published": "2017-12-05T18:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21125, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dc4b97a6bbab3a8ba63c38663f4dc78c67c0d8be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqHG.7gyAaAvntWWzAKf9QrCJLZNbL9RjgxOs_HOl5fckLsLOa7fwlh33ey0We15T2349V4u_EMtKDr79ZSsbeH8j30hxVl0H8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Will", "published": "2017-12-05T18:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "The North Face Flight RKT | First Look", "text": "Comments Off on The North Face Flight RKT | First Look The North Face Flight RKT Men\u2019s   January 2018 \u2013 MSRP $150.00 \nIf you\u2019re lucky enough, sometime in your life you might find a running shoe that is perfect for you \u2014 the perfect fit, the perfect ride, the perfect hold, the perfect everything. If you\u2019re a professional, you might be even luckier and achieve an honor that very few runners can claim: having the perfect shoe designed specifically for you. For ultrarunner Rob Krar, The North Face Flight RKT is that shoe. Designers worked closely with Rob to create an ultralight trail running shoe with enough cushioning and grip to handle long trail races over widely varied terrain, and the result looks promising. \nMidsole \nThe Flight RKT\u2019s FastFoam midsole is made of two separate types of lightweight EVA foam to create a comfortable and responsive ride for faster paces on the trail. Directly under the foot sits a soft yet springy layer of EVA that lies within a \u201cbathtub\u201d shaped external layer of more resilient EVA. This design should give the shoe a soft underfoot feel with plenty of spring, while the external EVA should limit compression and the extent of the foam packing outwards. \nOutsole \nA key design challenge with the Flight RKT is incorporating enough grip for varied trails while keeping weight at an absolute minimum. The solution for this shoe is the podular outsole design that includes multidirectional lugs only on targeted areas. The podular design also increases the underfoot flexibility of the shoe, which should allow it to better adapt to variations in trail surfaces. \nUpper \nIn an effort to create a wrap that will be comfortable for ultras, The North Face\u2019s designers incorporated a thin engineered mesh upper that should hold the foot snugly while delivering plenty of ventilation. The suede coating on the tongue is designed to give it that extra bit of comfort for longer runs. For added durability and support, TPU strips are welded around the midfoot in geometric patterns. \n  18 mm heel, 10 mm forefoot, 8   8.0 oz (men\u2019s size 9), 6.5 oz (women\u2019s size 8) \n  The

ALWAYS consult your doctor before traveling Southeast Asia with a peanut allergy. \nYou\u2019ve been dreaming about visiting Southeast Asia for a long time now. Its white-sand beaches, friendly people, tasty food and incredible wildlife have been calling out to you. But one thing is holding you back \u2013 an allergy to peanuts and these crunchy morsels happen to be included in a lot of Asian cuisine. \nAnd you\u2019re certainly not alone. According to FARE (Food Allergy Research and Education) allergies to peanuts/tree nuts more than tripled among U.S. children between 1997 and 2008. In the worst cases, sufferers can go into anaphylactic shock where the throat can swell, blocking the airways. \nIn Asia, to compare, peanut allergies are not much of an issue. Westerners are about twice as likely as East Asians to be allergic to peanuts, according to the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. \nIf you suffer from a peanut allergy and have decided to travel to Southeast Asia, we\u2019ve compiled a few tips to help keep you safe. 1. Consult your doctor first \nAlways seek medical advice from your GP or a travel doctor before traveling Southeast Asia with a peanut allergy. It\u2019s likely you won\u2019t be the first person to ask your doctor about traveling with this particular allergy in Asia, so your GP should be well-prepared with guidance and be able to advise the medication you\u2019ll need to bring with you on your travels. You should also ask your doctor to write you an official note explaining your peanut allergy and your required medication, so that you are prepared if you\u2019re asked any questions at airports or in the places you are traveling. 2. Be careful when eating street food Photo via Flickr user J Aaron Farr \nIf your peanut allergy is at the severe end of the spectrum, it may pay to avoid street food altogether, as you can\u2019t be sure of what\u2019s in it. However, experiencing street food is a large part of enjoying and getting the most out of your Asian travel experience and some bloggers allergic to nuts tend to prefer eating street food as you can see the chef and all the ingredients right before your eyes. But if you don\u2019t want to take the risk, often in cities like Bangkok (Thailand) or Hanoi (Vietnam) you can also find tasty street food dishes in restaurants. \nRestaurants might be a little pricier but if it\u2019s a tourist-geared restaurant the staff will be more likely to speak English and it should be easier for you to communicate your allergy and find out what does or doesn\u2019t contain nuts. However, even in a restaurant one should always be cautious and inspect food closely before eating it. \nSee some common dishes that contain peanuts below: Mi Quang (Vietnam) Grilled meat with sauce (Thailand, Indonesia) Spring rolls (Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia) Tom Yum (Thailand) Yum Salad (Laos) \u2013 credit: Padaek (Flickr) \nYou should also be particularly careful with dipping sauces. Often peanuts can be blended in and combined with another sauce (barbecue sauce in Hue, Central Vietnam, for example) which means the peanuts are far less detectable. 3. Carry a translated note \nBring a translated note with you (otherwise known as an allergy card) in the most common language of the country/countries you\u2019re visiting. The note should explain that you have a peanut allergy, include an image of a peanut for further transparency, describe what could happen to you if you ingest peanuts and instruct on what to do if you should suffer a reaction. \nFor example, if your allergy is severe and there\u2019s a chance you could go into anaphylactic shock and require a jab from an Epi Pen \u2013 make it clear that you carry a pen on you. If you have a number to call or a hospital address, include it on the back of the note, along with the phone number of your country\u2019s embassy. \nBrokerfish.com offers free, printable allergy cards in Chinese and Thai and Foodallergytranslate.com offers an app allowing you to store digital allergy cards on your phone, or create printable cards; and you can select from a range of Asian languages including: Chinese, Indonesian, Malaysian, Korean, Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese. 4. Find your closest hospital \nSpend some time researching hospitals in the locations you are visiting when traveling Southeast Asia with a peanut allergy. You could ask your travel insurance provider to recommend some safe hospitals with high-quality medical care. Keep a note with the address and telephone number of the closest hospital to you in your wallet or purse in case you should need it. 5. If your allergy is severe, consider traveling with someone \nHaving a travel companion is a good idea if you suffer from a peanut allergy. This way if anything should happen, you\u2019ll have someone to help you find treatment as soon as possible. The companion should be briefed on the warning signs for if you have a reaction and told what to do if one occurs. 6. Visit local markets and cook your own food, or try a cooking class \nAsia is a place full of bustling markets and visiting them is a great way to get a taste of culture. Why not head to the local market and pick up some fresh produce. There are Airbnb\u2019s all over Asia, many of which include their own kitchens for cooking. And many hostels also have kitchens and cooking appliances for guests to use. \nOtherwise, why not try a cooking class? You can easily find classes in destinations all over Asia, run by English-speaking chefs. This way you can be 100 percent sure what you\u2019re preparing doesn\u2019t contain nuts and learn some new cooking skills to take back home with you. 7. Notify your airline in advance \nWhen traveling to Southeast Asia with a peanut allergy, always notify your airline in advance about your allergy so when booking meals they can ensure you aren\u2019t served any food containing nuts. If you want to be extra safe, bring your own food with you to eat on-board and wipe down your seat and tray table before sitting down. Even if you\u2019ve notified your airline about your allergy in advance, remind them again when you get on the plane. And if you have an allergy card or doctor\u2019s note, present it to them. 8. Carry medication with you at all times \nThis might sound like an obvious pointer, but always make sure you carry any required medication at all times. Stay in the habit of putting it in the same place and always check you have it before leaving your room. You should also bring more medication than you need and store it in different places in case you happen to lose any. 9. Bring some food with you \nIt\u2019s a wise idea to have a back-up plan. So, bring some non-perishable food with you. This will be especially useful if you want to travel further out from the city where there are fewer hospitals and reliable medical treatment. \nIt may not be as tasty as Asian cuisine, but you can rest assured knowing you\u2019ll be safe while eating it and you won\u2019t go hungry. You can find non-perishables easily at supermarkets in the capital cities of Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Try to look for food with English labels so you can be sure there are no traces of nuts. 10. Follow travel bloggers with nut allergies \nOf course, one of the best ways to ensure safe travels with your allergy is to hear first-hand from someone in the same position as you. There are many bloggers online who have traveled Southeast Asia with a peanut allergy. We suggest the bloggers below: Earthtrekkers \nA blogger who travels the world with her family and has a son who suffers from a peanut allergy. Together they\u2019ve traveled through Thailand, Cambodia, China, Myanmar, Vietnam, Taiwan and India. Young Adventuress \nAn American blogger who travels the world despite suffering from a severe peanut allergy. Erin Morawetz \nMorawetz has written about her experience staying a month in Thailand with a peanut allergy and offers advice to fellow sufferers. \nWe hope our 10 tips have been helpful. But, once again, always seek medical advice from your doctor before traveling to Asia with a peanut allergy. \nHappy and safe travels everybody.

statement continued: \"Adkins, a Championship promotion-winner with Southampton in 2012, will be joined at the KCOM Stadium by his trusted assistant Andy Crosby on an 18-month contract. \n\"As well as his success with Southampton, where he took the south coast club from League One to the Premier League with back-to-back promotions, Adkins also guided Scunthorpe United to promotion in 2007 and 2009, and has spells in charge of Reading and Sheffield United on his CV. \n\"Adkins, 52, will oversee his first training session this morning and will take charge of the side for Saturday's home game against Brentford.\" \nAdkins has been out of work since being sacked by Sheffield United in May 2016 after just one season in charge. \nHe had been tasked with steering the Blades to promotion from Sky Bet League One but they finished eight points off the play-offs and he was replaced by Chris Wilder. \nAdkins has twice guided Scunthorpe to promotion from League One and steered Saints to the Premier League in 2012 but was dismissed halfway through the following season. \nSlutsky, the first Russian to manage an English club, was appointed by Hull last summer following the club's relegation from the top flight. \nBut the former CSKA Moscow and Russia national team coach won only four of his 20 Sky Bet Championship matches in charge and left the Tigers in 20th place, three points above the bottom three.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hull", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nigel adkins",

Is that cheering from people who hate singing Advent hymns? Shame, shame! I love Advent hymns so I\u2019ll use my three Thursdays in the season to write about some of them.\nI learned my first Advent song when I was 11 years old and singing in a children\u2019s choir. It was \u201cPeople, Look East\u201d (ELW # 248). Here\u2019s the first verse:\nPeople, look east. The time is near \nOf the crowning of the year. \nMake your house fair as you are able, \nTrim the hearth and set the table. \nPeople, look east and sing today, \nLove, the Guest, is on the way. \nThe text was written by Eleanor Farjeon for the Oxford Book of Carols in 1928. She\u2019s probably best known for the hymn \u201cMorning Has Broken.\u201d I think what grabbed me as a kid was the tune, a lively French carol probably from the sixteenth century.\nFarjeon starts with people preparing the house which most people were probably doing in preparation for Christmas. She uses this mundane activity to remind us \u201cLove, the Guest, is on the way.\u201d The song turns next to the earth itself preparing (furrows be glad), stars keeping watch and finally the angel\u2019s announcement. Each verse takes us closer to the wondrous birth and gives Love (Jesus) another name: the Rose, the Star, the Lord. It\u2019s a great song to sing while lighting the Advent wreath at home.\nMay Love be on its way to you this Advent.\nRead Psalm 80:1-3 and remember: God loves YOU unconditionally.\nWayne\n\u201cHear us, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock. You who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh. Awaken your might; come and save us. Restore us, O God; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved.\u201d Psalm 80:1-3 \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wayne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "farjeon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eleanor farjeon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ephraim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "manasseh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:44.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d7bb85fee69a8c99c3a27291bcc7eabbeadd840e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_yWQiuMVyJBSYMPv8CZ39pk", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ - Paranormal - 4chan", "title": "Star Child", "title_full": "/x/ - Star Child - Paranormal - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T11:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 28, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.719, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "05e821e969fff77bffeb3f55706611c43ca740b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_yWQiuMVyJBSZk3UBuONOYRIL1bBsRx6M8-", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>20000934\ni keep my eyes on the stars thats where i come from belt of orion son of the sun god", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:44.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e041b1afaa350016eb0e4b5197ca0f10a9cb3ca5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl.Zq0O9QZ4xcWyFFbJXXPhc3hJGWkmJT9234a869X2CjF_EZXHRrXDOIWAIl_DwMhVWFbHqzIGjlUtzy.vG1tSwvNmINoDIIELU8639APymrys4F4BAFEJPY8z7DzlRDMA--", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[FFBE] Our first \"real\" bard arrives Friday, with Roy!

My initial concern deals with necking up .220\" to .243.\"\nI have a 262 neck BR rifle that came with 50 prepped pieces of Lapua and 3 boxes of Lapua brown box 220 Russian brass, no I don't care to sell any. I now want to convert some of the 220 brass. I planned on necking up first and then neck turning to .009\" for a total of .261 OD with a bullet installed.\nI necked up the 25 pieces of the 220 with a Kenny Porter collet die and a tapered .241 pin gauge. The runout of the 220 brass before sizing it up was .0015\"-.002\". After necking the brass up the runout grew to .015\" which I consider $hit.\nIs there a neck up routine that will keep the runout to a much smaller number?\nMy plan is to then fireform the cases with a load of pistol powder and wax cap as I don't want to put more rounds through the barrel just to fire form.\nAny help is greatly appreciated. Click to expand... I think most would turn the brass to .0084-.0086.\n.001 of clearance is tight. Some shooters do load a 262 neck at 261 but 260 to .2605 is better. (IMO)\nMost of your custom bullets will measure .24325 !!!! Don't forget that..\nGood luck, have fun and shoot small.\nSG", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:45.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c521be662d9897e2a8967bbebfedaec6c19a0898", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gSlWgbYpTv8jfqZSEQYgkZ0-", "site_full": "us.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/1011638/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Story Forum - World of Warcraft Forums", "title": "[PTR Spoilers] Mailemental quest chain", "title_full": "[PTR Spoilers] Mailemental quest chain - World of Warcraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T20:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/wow.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e35153bee0df19380829dd67ab2eb71a57fa19f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gSlWgbYpTv8jQxvr7KrXv7V804cSFchn8A--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Yvenathilm", "published": "2017-12-07T09:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Anyone else agree that Johnny Awesome is indeed the main character of WoW?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:45.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d7bb85fee69a8c99c3a27291bcc7eabbeadd840e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_yWQiuMVyJBSYMPv8CZ39pk", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ - Paranormal - 4chan", "title": "Star Child", "title_full": "/x/ - Star Child - Paranormal - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T11:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 28, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.719, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d6f7821c6787f7a5e087eb8d7629f43801795311", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_yWQiuMVyJBSZk3UBuONOYRjqDqOEf1gXM-", "ord_in_thread": 28, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>20001240\nI feel a sense of urgency, most notably because I believe it's not until I comprehend more about this stuff that my life will ever change for the better.

View Full Text Detecting skeletal growth During development, bone is created by a process called endochondral ossification, which results in the production of a fragment of type X collagen. Endochondral ossification also occurs during long bone growth and fracture healing. Coghlan et al . discovered that the type X collagen fragment could be isolated from blood and its concentration correlated with skeletal growth velocity. Fragment concentration was inversely correlated with age and fluctuated during fracture healing in adults. The authors developed an assay to quantify the fragment that could be useful as a real-time marker of skeletal growth in children and for monitoring response to treatment for growth and bone disorders. Abstract Despite its importance as a key parameter of child health and development, growth velocity is difficult to determine in real time because skeletal growth is slow and clinical tools to accurately detect very small increments of growth do not exist. We report discovery of a marker for skeletal growth in infants and children. The intact trimeric noncollagenous 1 (NC1) domain of type X collagen, the marker we designated as CXM for Collagen X Marker, is a degradation by-product of endochondral ossification that is released into the circulation in proportion to overall growth plate activity. This marker corresponds to the rate of linear bone growth at time of measurement. Serum concentrations of CXM plotted against age show a pattern similar to well-established height growth velocity curves and correlate with height growth velocity calculated from incremental height measurements in this study. The CXM marker is stable once collected and can be accurately assayed in serum, plasma, and dried blood spots. CXM testing may be useful for monitoring growth in the pediatric population, especially responses of infants and children with genetic and acquired growth disorders to interventions that target the underlying growth disturbances. The utility of CXM may potentially extend to managing other conditions such as fracture healing, scoliosis, arthritis, or cancer.
