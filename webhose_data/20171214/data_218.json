They seem to be completely nocturnal up around him. His neighbor runs dogs on them in the winter so that might have made them go nocturnal because of the pressure. We usually see hogs at the feeders between 9pm-1am and have jumped a couple during the daytime along the mud holes and along the creek bed that runs through his property. This is usually during the hot summer days. During the colder times, they seem to move around from farm to farm around the neighborhood and make their rounds while feeding at night. Have you tried throwing out some Sow In Heat or setting off one of those aerosol scent bombs yet? If the areas that you are hunting have thick brush then most likely the hog is going to smell or hear you and move along or hide and you will never even see them. So getting them to come to you is probably your best bet in that situation, from what my buddy tells me about hogs. I was using an Ozonics in my 4x8 hunting blind that is on a 5\u0092 tower and 40 yards from my feeder and the hogs would come in and then run off like they could hear it running. They did this for 10 minutes. So my buddy told me to just shut it off and after that, the hogs came right in 15 minutes later. We had the wind at our face, using Scent Lok clothing and hoods and even had deer walk around 10 yards from the blind earlier that night. The hogs seem a lot more skittish than the deer on his property and there is a lot of pressure on the deer in his area. The guy at the counter at the shop that I trust where I bought it, told me that the Ozonics has worked for deer with him but he has had no luck with it while hog hunting. I was really amazed on how great the hogs sense of smell was compared to deer. Good luck and I hope you get yourself a pig.\nEdited by bowbuilder1971 ( Yesterday at 03:50 PM )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:16.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fb2117091bb43caf951f99591d5a9ab1864289f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpRAtK_phdacg7mI4d0YmpEieV7cPLO2Ke2murvaPUAL6T4apNe9oTv1HByb0RepUXemEQvtVMuHFQdbws6qJGlpVcZh0kF6OYfn5jbdIopB0m94SHWYig.g26g9chbD.fXVRXRqoKSqKUpfXyD8uEMmSXBe6s65lShUugm3QewpTg--", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual-new?page=2&ajax=true", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK -

The FAO Meat Price Index was broadly unchanged as bovine meat prices rose and pigmeat quotations declined. \nThe FAO Cereal Price Index registered a small rise in November, led by a 1.1 percent increase in international rice quotations. \nHigher cereal production and inventories \nFAO sharply raised its forecast for global cereal production to 2 627 million tonnes, some 13.4 million tonnes higher than its October projections, with the bulk of the increase mostly reflecting higher estimates for maize yields in the United States and a significant increase in maize plantings in Indonesia. \nGlobal wheat production is now forecast at 754.8 million tonnes, while rice output is projected at 500.8 million tonnes, both just a notch below their 2016 record levels. \nWorld cereal total utilization is now expected to increase by 1.2 percent in 2017/18 season, reaching 2 599 million tonnes, with more rice and wheat being destined for direct human consumption and more coarse grains used for feeding animals. \nWorld cereal inventories are set to rise to a record-high 726 million tonnes, according to the latest FAO projection. Global wheat and maize stocks are both expected to reach record levels. \nLarge stocks are seen to lift the global cereal stock-to-use ratio to 27.3 percent by the end of the 2017/18, its highest level in 16 years. \nFAO - Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:06:03 UTC . \nOriginal document http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/1071587/icode/ \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/A76F0F517D0B04C1D826A96D6E0F6AF12C699EA1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "fao food and agriculture organization", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fao - food and agriculture organization of the united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fao sugar price index", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fao food price index", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fao cereal price index", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:17.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6181fe7682d1eb7efc52386db4c95fee92114a6d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97wk9.LO8C9i88WcJY17Dam1lazF6IG1dIo-", "site_full": "groups.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=categories/docs/mac", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Google Docs Help Forum - Google Product Forums", "title": "Google Sheets Crashed for over an hour", "title_full": "Google Sheets Crashed for over an hour - Google Product Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "http://www.google.com/images/icons/product/groups-128.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "17d8e0cc675397aa0a7582563315f7b31bde7ad7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97wk9.LO8C9i88WcJY17Dam1wJN624q9bHmXAsx5ihXAFg--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Gregory Mostyn", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:17.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e889f82be092bbfe92705cb1e91472ec8ba445d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmAf2mzbZtRMwoxsz.6vhPutdKFtF5bIm2b62t_9LVAgiOpk5.KYC4lYsOkQ4_K4Y-", "site_full": "vanisland.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://vanisland.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Huron \u2013 Life on Van Island", "title": "Huron", "title_full": "Huron", "published": "2017-12-07T10:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e889f82be092bbfe92705cb1e91472ec8ba445d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmAf2mzbZtRMwoxsz.6vhPutdKFtF5bIm2b62t_9LVAgiOpk5.KYC4lYsOkQ4_K4Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "editorus", "published": "2017-12-07T10:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "Huron", "text": "The University of Southern California Thorton School of Music Chamber Singers is another favourite choir of mine.

The Chinese smartphone maker is hosting yet another launch event this year on December 7, where it'll be launching two new smartphones \u2013 Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus \u2013 to offer customers a wider range of choice.\nXiaomi's smartphones, especially the affordable ones, gain a lot of attention, and the new Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus are touted as budget-friendly devices. While the handsets have been leaked in full glory in the past days, the latest information leaked on an e-commerce site reveals the pricing of the new phones.\nAccording to the listing on popular AliExpress online shopping site, the Redmi 5 is going to cost $199.99 (roughly Rs. 12,900) for the base model with 2GB RAM and 16GB storage. The Redmi 5 Plus is also listed, and the price tag attached to the device is $249.99 (approximately Rs. 16,120) for the 3GB RAM and 32GB storage model.\n\u00a9 Screenshot AliExpress Xiaomi Redmi 5 on AliExpress A previous leak suggested that the Redmi 5 will come in two other configurations, sporting 3GB RAM + 32GB ROM and 4GB RAM + 64GB ROM. As for the Redmi 5 Plus, there will just be one more variant in addition to the aforementioned device, featuring 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. The pricing of these variants will naturally be higher.\n\u00a9 IBTimes The Redmi 5 is said to come with a 5.7-inch display with 18:9 aspect ratio and HD+ resolution with 1440x720 pixels. On the other hand, the Redmi 5 Plus will sport a larger 5.99-inch display with Full HD+ resolution and same 18:9 aspect ratio.\nBesides that, there isn't anything extraordinary about the Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus. A 1.8GHz octa-core processor and a 3,200mAh battery are likely to power the Redmi 5 and the Redmi 5 Plus will get a slightly upgraded 2GHz octa-core chipset with a 4,000mAh battery.\nTo recall, Xiaomi Redmi 4 offered a 4,100mAh battery.\nOn the camera front, the Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus are getting a 12MP rear-facing shooter and a 5MP front snapper, which again isn't a massive improvement over the 13MP rear snapper with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF and 5MP selfie snapper with f/2.2 aperture in the Redmi 4.\nConsidering Xiaomi Redmi 4 costs just Rs. 6,999, it may come as a disappointment for many to spend twice as much for a smartphone that only offers a tall FullView display.\n\u00a9 ITHome Xiaomi Redmi 5", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Pre-Sale-Original-Xiaomi-Redmi-5-Redmi5-18-9-Display-Snapdragon-Octa-Core/2178148_32845351429.html", "https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Pre-Sale-Original-Xiaomi-Redmi-5-plus-Redmi5-plus-18-9-Display-Snapdragon-Octa-Core/2178148_32844338473.html", "http://www.ibtimes.co.in/this-what-xiaomis-upcoming-redmi-5-redmi-5-plus-look-like-heres-what-they-have-offer-751845", "http://www.ibtimes.co.in/xiaomi-redmi-4-amazon-india-exclusive-all-you-need-know-726277"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xiaomi redmi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sami khan xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "international business times", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "redmi", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:17.065+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "924d61fa347f0369f55073928d0722153086057b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJjcBg6ZjRON7kqHemd4WumHJt3h1zaHi0qOCRv4Nz5eq4.M9EL9SM7OvgjAGrA_JpYJPXyD5oh77X1uDkWm9rXHujNeqdr_eqSWbz1UAW.7M47q_j7DD1fg--", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Appliances-Refrigerators-Side-by-Side-Refrigerators/N-5yc1vZc3q0/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "GE 25.4 GSS25GSHSS", "title_full": "GE 25.4 cu. ft.

We are working to verify the precise number of BTC taken,\u201d the outfit noted . \n\u201cClearly, this is a matter of deep concern and we are working hard to rectify the matter in the coming days. In addition to undertaking our own investigation, the incident has been reported to the relevant authorities and law enforcement and we are co-operating with them as a matter of urgency.\u201d \nThe announcement came a day after the marketplace first asked NiceHash users to be patient while the service undergoes maintenance, and then, a few hours later, said again that the maintenance would take longer than expected. \nThen, late last night, the bombshell: Here is our official PRESS RELEASE about the security breach! https://t.co/yhfdjXkJwc \n\u2014 NiceHash (@NiceHashMining) December 6, 2017 What\u2019s happening? \nWhile miners are waiting for official news from NiceHash, the stolen money was tracked to a single Bitcoin wallet . \nIt seems that whoever is behind this heist has gained Bitcoin worth currently a little less than $70 million. (The price of Bitcoin reached $14,000 on Wednesday.) \nNiceHash users took to Reddit to discuss the breach and speculate on whether this heist was an inside job. The speculation fuelled by the fact that the majority owner of NiceHash is a company named H-Bit, owned by Martin Skorjanc, the father of Matjaz Skorjanc, convicted author of the Mariposa bot . The younger Skorjanc is also the CTO and co-founder of NiceHash . \nMany users are bemoaning the fact that they lost money while waiting to reach the minimum payout: 0.01 BTC for external wallets and 0.001 BTC for NiceHash wallet.

Sowing of seed has really eaten deep into the minds of the religious extremist in Ghana. Most self-acclaimed \u2018men of God\u2019 have capitalized on some Bible verses to deceive their ignorant followers. \nThis is the sad story of a 46-year-old man whose wife withdrew their Ghc124,000 life savings and donated it to a church all in the name of seed sowing. The deranged man took to Facebook to lament over the bizarre incident. Below is what he posted; READ ALSO: Are You A Music Artist or Actor/Actress? We Can Help Promote You & Your Music\u2014CLICK HERE \nHe said: \u201cMy name is Jerry, a 46-year-old man. I have been married to Nma for 12 years and we have three lovely children together but at the moment, I am very angry with her over what she did. You can\u2019t imagine that my wife used our life savings, a total of N10 million to sow a seed in church without informing me. \nWe have slaved for many years, denied our family some basic things just so that we could put this money together so we could get a piece of land to build our house and in a moment of spiritual madness, Nma used the whole money to sow seed. \nI only got to realise this after I had finished negotiations with a real estate agent and at the point, I was supposed to pay for the land, I realised that the money had been withdrawn from our joint account by my wife. I was so shocked and embarrassed at the bank when the manager informed me that my wife had withdrawn the money over two months ago. \nWhen I got home and confronted her, Nma opened up and said she gave the money to our church for a building project. She even had the guts to tell me that she saw nothing wrong in giving our money to God as the blessings would come out of it would be more than the money. \nI have been so mad at her and I have told her never to set foot in the house unless she has the money intact. I have even contemplated going to the church to demand a refund of the money but some friends have been telling me it is not the right thing to do. What do I do\u201d?

However, none of the US presidents during the past decades challenged the consensus that the status of Jerusalem should be solved through the Israel-Palestinian peace talks under the supervision of international society. The US, like the rest of the world, had repeatedly refused to acknowledge Israel\u2019s unilateral annexation of East Jerusalem, until Trump\u2019s decision on Wednesday of \u201ccalling Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\u201d  \nTrump\u2019s Middle East plan was in stalemate. He hopes that in fulfilling his previous promises to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, the international society will also do the same. However, given the religious importance and political sensitivity of the Jerusalem issue, Trump\u2019s actions mean the US will deny the legal claims of the Arab world and Palestinian people over the ownership of Jerusalem. The US will now face challenges from the entire Muslim world, and US individuals and interests will surely be targeted by waves of terrorist attacks by Islamic extremists in the Middle East.  Trump\u2019s Jerusalem decision will surely damage the Israel-Palestine peace talks mediated by the US. On one hand, it will strongly encourage the right-wing political forces in Israel, and further political claims such as annexing the West Bank and continuing Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem. On the other hand, Trump\u2019s decision makes attempts by any political leaders from both Palestine and the Arab world with the intention of joining the peace talk with Israel impossible.  \nTo join the peace talks with Israel, given the current framework, means accepting the mediation by the US. But Trump\u2019s new decision is unacceptable for any political leader in the Arab world.  Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s decision might also provoke the anger of Palestinians and the Arab Muslims, who might believe that their legal claim of establishing an independent national state has been deserted by the US and international society. Waves of terrorist attacks might come in the near future, not only targeting Israel but also US and other western individuals.  In addition, Trump\u2019s decision makes the US no longer an appropriate actor to mediate the disputes between Israel and Palestine, and it also means a significant blow to the US political reputation in the Arab world. We should keep in mind that the Jerusalem issue for Israel and the Arab world is a zero-sum issue. As Trump chooses to stand with Israel, as this action seems to indicate, it will surely significantly deteriorate the US\u2019s relations with the Arab and Muslim world. As an important city with too much religious, political, cultural and identity values for both Jews and Arabs, there is little room for any leaders to maneuver to reach \u201cbalance.\u201d  \nUnfortunately, it seems that Trump is choosing conflict over peace; and injustice and occupation over justice, freedom and independence. The peaceful relation between Israel and Palestine might also collapse with Trump\u2019s new decision over the status of Jerusalem. \nThe author is a PhD candidate at the School of Political Science of University Haifa and a research fellow at Syria Research Center of Northwest University.

Using high-resolution manometry (HRM), this study aims to identify positional adaptations of pharyngeal physiology by evaluating swallowing pressure patterns in a series of inverted body positions. Ten healthy adults each underwent swallowing tasks with pharyngeal HRM at six body positions using an inversion table (0\u00b0[upright], 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0[supine], 110\u00b0, 135\u00b0, and 180\u00b0[fully inverted]). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess impact of position on pressure parameters, and pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients translate. Velopharyngeal pressures varied by position ( P < 0.001), with significantly higher pressures generated with inversion \u226590\u00b0, compared with upright and 45\u00b0. Change in position did not significantly affect common mesopharyngeal pressures or swallowing pressure durations. UES valving mechanisms were preserved during inversion, with subtle variations observed in integral pressures ( P = 0.011). Pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients changed with position ( P < 0.01), increasing with inversion > 90\u00b0 compared to upright and 45\u00b0. Mechanisms of deglutition may differ with position and relative direction of gravity, particularly when at > 45\u00b0 inclination. Increased palatal pressure is generated in the upside-down position to achieve nasopharyngeal closure and prevent regurgitation. While other classically measured pressures may not consistently differ with positioning, many individuals exhibit adaptations in pressure gradients when inverted, likely due to a combination of changes in pharyngeal driving force and UES opening mechanisms. Identification of these changes, relative to position, further builds on our understanding of the adaptability of the pharyngeal swallowing system.\n\n\nfrom #ENT via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2nzWiCa\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hrm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ues", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anova", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:21.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bd82862e44a8e2ca4df03d10b039dae19cc3e11a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCb3LzENt.DbjCDoihQ8x8jSiIe877uIVu26D3EXI5gc1.5Nydr6SX4UrtO4uyC6MyQWfGpu0GW1MfVXbEJAEHHvxbJtVfg_lQJq3yhA5_7A--", "site_full": "rollonfriday.com", "site": "rollonfriday.com", "site_section": "http://rollonfriday.com/Discussion/MainDiscussion/tabid/381/Default.aspx", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "legal_issues"], "section_title": "RollOnFriday &gt;

This is an effective and cheap way of detecting and correcting the flaws well in advance. View the upcoming structure using 3-D rendering. Earlier, architects used 2-D drawings for approval of design from the clients and used to create these drawings manually. These days, things have changed completely as 3-D visualisation makes it possible to give 360\u00b0 views related to the upcoming structures both its exterior and interior parts. For the client this signifies better perspective with improved understanding of design elements with the use of architectural visualisation .\nIt is possible to create completely new appearances and fantastic dimensions for the properties and for the builders and developers this means an increased chance of selling the project. Homeowners will also benefit immensely from such state of the art technology use in the following manner.\nUnderstand the design better: prospective customers always want to have a better understanding of the possible investment because after all it is their money on the line. For the architects, 3-D rendering is a chance to give their clients an idea regarding how the particular design is going to fare. If they require some changes, it will be possible to incorporate those as well, as architectural visualisation give a glimpse into what is going to happen.  \nSave both money and time: the project developers can save both money and time with this type of renderings on a virtual platform. It is possible to incorporate any type of design changes much before the beginning of the actual project. This means, they are not going to be any additional expenses or delays in the project just because something does not work out for the customers do not find a particular aspect of the development to their liking. Architectural visualisation has emerged as a significant tool in the hands of the developers and the prospective homeowners.  \nAddition of accessories: it is possible to incorporate new looks and dimensions to any building project through effective accessory additions. Property developers and architects will be able to use all types of accessories like textures, fixtures, colors, lighting, and furniture to show the clients what they are investing into and how things are going to look once they occupy the finished buildings. On all, it leads to realistic views of any upcoming structure that do not have any existence as of yet other than in the mind or probably on the blueprint. Two-dimensional drawings failed to give such clear idea regarding how things are going to turn out once finished. When you want to give your client will value for the money they are going to spend, architectural visualisation proves to be a crucial tool.
