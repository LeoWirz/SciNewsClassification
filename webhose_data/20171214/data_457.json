Received: 6 November 2017 / Revised: 29 November 2017 / Accepted: 30 November 2017 / Published: 7 December 2017 No Abstract The capillary morphogenesis gene 2 (CMG2), also known as the anthrax toxin receptor 2 (ANTXR2), is a transmembrane protein putatively involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion and tissue remodeling. CMG2 promotes endothelial cell proliferation and exhibits angiogenic properties. Its downregulation is associated with a worsened survival of breast carcinoma patients. Aim of this study was to analyze the CMG2 mRNA and protein expression in soft tissue sarcoma and their association with patient outcome. CMG2 mRNA was measured in 121 tumor samples of soft tissue sarcoma patients using quantitative real-time PCR. CMG2 protein was evaluated in 52 tumor samples by ELISA. CMG2 mRNA was significantly correlated with the corresponding CMG2 protein expression (r s = 0.31; p = 0.027). CMG2 mRNA expression was associated with the mRNA expressions of several ECM and tissue remodeling enzymes, among them CD26 and components of the uPA system. Low CMG2 mRNA expression was correlated with a worsened patients\u2019 disease-specific survival in Kaplan-Meier analyses (mean patient survival was 25 vs. 96 months; p = 0.013), especially in high-stage tumors. A decreased CMG2 expression is a negative prognostic factor for soft tissue sarcoma patients. CMG2 may be an interesting candidate gene for the further exploration of soft tissue sarcoma genesis and progression.

South Temple, but Angel Martinez said they often stay at the hospital to be closer to their son while he's recovering.\nThat's exactly why Primary Children's Hospital introduced a new Family Room in the intensive care unit, said hospital CEO Katy Welkie.\n\"There\u2019s a hurricane of emotions that run through a family during this time when they are staying in the intensive care unit,\" Welkie explained. \"The families want to stay close to their kids.\"\nThe new Ronald McDonald Family Room gives parents a space to recuperate while allowing them to stay in the hospital with their kids, Welkie said at the ribbon-cutting event Wednesday.\nThe Family Room includes a kitchenette, restroom, shower and laundry areas, all on the second level of the hospital. The space also has four small rooms for sleeping overnight or taking naps.\n\"Unlike a general waiting room, we wanted to create a homelike, soft landing spot,\" said Carrie Romano, CEO of Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Intermountain Area.\nThe designers paid attention to every detail, she added, right down to the types of knobs used on the kitchenette cabinets. The blue colors and electric fireplace help make the room feel more \"residential,\" Romano explained.\nThe 1,200-square-foot room is open 24/7 to parents with kids in the pediatric intensive care, cardiac intensive care and neuro trauma units.\n\"If this wasn\u2019t here,\" Angel Martinez said, glancing around the room, \"my wife and I would probably be struggling, and my son probably wouldn\u2019t be doing as well as he is.\"\nAngel Martinez said he and his wife have cried, prayed and celebrated in the Family Room, which has been open now for about a month.\nIt's the hospital staff who make the Family Room amazing, he said, \"not just the building and the walls.\"\n\"It\u2019s the people that take time out of their lives to help families,\" he said.\nComment on this story This is the second Ronald McDonald Family Room completed at the hospital. Nearly 25,000 patient families have visited the third-level Family Room , which also provides laundry services, meals, showers and resting rooms.\n\"It definitely makes a difference in the recovery of the kids to have their parents at their best,\" said Dr. Manuel Rodriguez, a transplant surgeon involved in Remmy's surgery. \"It\u2019s good to have a place where you can take a deep breath and find that peaceful moment to then go back and take care of your children.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "angel martinez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "remmy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonia martinez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carrie romano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manuel rodriguez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katy welkie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "welkie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ronald mcdonald house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronald mcdonald house charities of the intermountain area", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronald mcdonald family room", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "primary children's hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "primary children's hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lake city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "e. south temple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salt lake city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:55.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "539dda23e5ae576b3543454b106a37a913725ccc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZShuqU8OSon17NLifh3i_NDAoXRu27BlyXwoMRbiqASVBXU_bwgibuXEfBWy4V.eBDo.6m32pMyraXh8ItQmdvQq1a5bjTI8WLFTVIpvOad1PXMC51IDXHw4GWqrpSE_jttyoO4pLGmwdmO5d40_sDRWSmBQCvApyI-", "site_full": "www.broadwayworld.com", "site": "broadwayworld.com", "site_section": "http://www2.broadwayworld.com/feed_regional.cfm?id=93&ru", "site_categories": ["music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "BroadwayWorld.com Omaha Stories", "title": "25th Annual ROSIE ROCKS A NIGHT IN MONTE CARLO to Benefit The Rose Theater", "title_full": "25th Annual ROSIE ROCKS A NIGHT IN MONTE CARLO to Benefit The Rose Theater", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 14881, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "539dda23e5ae576b3543454b106a37a913725ccc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZShuqU8OSon17NLifh3i_NDAoXRu27BlyXwoMRbiqASVBXU_bwgibuXEfBWy4V.eBDo.6m32pMyraXh8ItQmdvQq1a5bjTI8WLFTVIpvOad1PXMC51IDXHw4GWqrpSE_jttyoO4pLGmwdmO5d40_sDRWSmBQCvApyI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "25th Annual ROSIE ROCKS A NIGHT IN MONTE CARLO to Benefit The Rose Theater", "text": "Share \nThe 25th annual Rockin Rosie benefit \"Rosie Rocks a Night in Monte Carlo ,\" presented by the Rose Theater Guild, is The Rose's largest fundraising event. \nThis exciting adult-only event will be held Saturday, January 27, 2018 at the Downtown Marriott in the Omaha Capitol District. \nThis year's Rockin' Rosie will feature a Monte Carlo theme where 400+ guests will travel to a glamorous and ritzy night of cocktails, dinner, dancing, raffle prizes and more!

Received: 7 November 2017 / Revised: 1 December 2017 / Accepted: 4 December 2017 / Published: 7 December 2017 No Abstract Poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid (\u03b3-PGA) is a biodegradable biopolymer produced by several bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis and other Bacillus species; it has good biocompatibility, is non-toxic, and has various potential biological applications in the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and other industries. In this review, we have described the mechanisms of \u03b3-PGA synthesis and gene regulation, its role in fermentation, and the phylogenetic relationships among various pgsBCAE , a biosynthesis gene cluster of \u03b3-PGA, and pgdS , a degradation gene of \u03b3-PGA. We also discuss potential applications of \u03b3-PGA and highlight the established genetic recombinant bacterial strains that produce high levels of \u03b3-PGA, which can be useful for large-scale \u03b3-PGA production.

It\u2019s not even a decent downpour, just a persistent drizzle, almost a mistiness. It\u2019s gone on all week. \nAll week we\u2019ve been going to wash our car, Paloma. She\u2019s going to be turned in for a new car later this week \u2013 this one is already provisionally called Clemmie, short for Clementine like Churchill\u2019s wife, as she is both classy, a BMW, and sunset orange in colour. However it hasn\u2019t seemed worth the effort to wash her when it\u2019s quite as wet as it is. We can\u2019t help thinking by the time we\u2019ve driven over to Lindale, about 23 miles away, Paloma will be as dirty as if we\u2019d never cleaned her in the first place. There will just be so much dirty spray from other vehicles on the road. She will inevitably be given a good valet before sale whatever cleaning we\u2019ve done. \nWe\u2019re looking forward to collecting Clemmie. In our test drive the model was a dream to drive. The Fox is even contemplating driving down to the south coast so we could take her over to France on the ferry for a holiday in Brittany next year. I\u2019m not entirely confident that that is such a wise move. Since his stroke, in 2011, he\u2019s found driving much more tiring. A trip down to Stoke to see family or over to Harrogate to see friends is the furthest he\u2019s driven. He thinks that easy driving Clemmie will resolve the driving issue as most of the time he feels fine now. However, there is no denying his loss of stamina. Before we commit to quite so long a drive, I think we should to have a weekend away somewhere a bit further than we have been of late but not as far as Poole, Portsmouth or Exeter, the ports on the south coast the ferries depart from. Only then, assuming all\u2019s gone well, will I consider a drive to France.

When we do not respect diversity, we tend to claim that \u2018ours\u2019 is superior to \u2018theirs\u2019. This stand fosters division among us and promotes bitterness. Each country, each culture, each family and even each individual is unique. \nWe can choose to view diversity in this way: \nMy country is better than yours \nMy culture is better than yours \nMy family is better than yours \nI am better than you. \nOr we can choose a view that respects human diversity: \nI am proud of my country and I respect your country \nI am proud of my culture and I respect your culture \nI am proud of my family and I respect your family \nI am proud of myself and I respect you. \nThe World Center for Humanist Studies, Mumbai Chapter, is organizing a National Talent Competition that is open to all schools. This year, the theme is Respecting Personal and Cultural Diversity. The objective is to sensitize young minds about the importance of respecting personal and cultural diversity for a more harmonious society. Each one is different in some way or other. When we do not respect diversity, we end up claiming that \u2018we\u2019 are superior then \u2018them\u2019. This creates walls and promotes bitterness. We need to reinforce the appreciation of diversity and respect for all human beings.\nThe National Talent Competition is open to all schools for students from STD VIII to STD X in India or students from STD XI to STD XII, irrespective of nationality. Students can create a group of 2 to 5 members, pick a subject and present their thoughts, insights, and point of view in a skit, painting, song, poem, essay, video, powerpoint presentation etc, harnessing their talents and creativity to express their reflections and thoughts on the theme. Participants can choose one of the following topics: Recognizing Diversity, Equality of Opportunity, Social Inclusion, Conflict Resolution, Non-Discrimination; and, can use any language.\nTo participate, simply register your school for the competition and upload entries on the competition website. There will be prizes for the top three national winners and special certificates for the top three from each school. Certificates for all entries with acceptable quality will also be given and selected entries with be published on the website for worldwide access. The last date for submission is 10th January 2018. To register and for more details, go to the website: http://www.respecting-diversity.org/ \nFor the last three years, The World Center for Humanist Studies, Mumbai chapter has been organizing such competitions to promote sensitivity towards the humanist attitude. A large number of schools had participated from all over India.\nIn 2015, it launched an Essay Competition on the theme Violence and Me. Highlights can be found at: https://violenceandme.org/ \n\nFor 2016, a Skit Competition was held on the theme The Human Being as a Central Value. Selected entries can be viewed at http://human-inhuman.org/about \n\nThe World Center for Humanist Studies is an organism of the Humanist Movement, which is based on the current of thought known as New Humanism or Universalist Humanism. This current can be found expressed in Silo\u00b4s works and in those of diverse authors who are inspired by it. This Movement, which also implies a sentiment and a way of life, takes shape in multiple fields of human endeavor, giving rise to diverse organisms and action fronts. All of them are applied to their specific fields of activity with a common aim: to Humanize the Earth, thereby contributing to freedom and happiness in human beings. These organisms have in common the methodology of Active Nonviolence and the proposal for personal change as a function of social transformation.\nThe organism, World Center for Humanist Studies, was founded in the First World Humanist Forum in Moscow in October 1993. The Indian chapter\u2019s mission is to promote studies of this humanist attitude, inspired by the Humanist Movement which is driven globally by millions of men and women, volunteers who are concerned with building a better and more humane world. A world where the human being is the central value (and not profit and power as it is now) with dignity and growth opportunities in life for everyone and not just a few.\nFor more details, feel free to contact Parimal Merchant at merchantpr@gmail.com.\nOr visit: http://www.respecting-diversity.org/ \nhttps://www.facebook.com/WCHSMumbai/ \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "karina lagdameo santillan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "std xii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world center for humanist studies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central value", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "humanist movement", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manila", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:55.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1df02c3bc13f3796a0def60d39add267ea955517", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTUb9TZgLpJyn8GM9zi6ew4HM_RdBVdEI1eCvZ6LXVKlQ2fpYFuZ0dCt4vhLDDhol0-", "site_full": "reineke-fox.deviantart.com", "site": "deviantart.com", "site_section": "http://backend.deviantart.com/rss.xml?q=meta%3Aall+sort%3Atime&type=deviation", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "DeviantArt: Newest", "title": "vulpec", "title_full": "vulpec", "published": "2017-12-07T11:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://pre00.deviantart.net/e81e/th/pre/i/2017/341/e/7/vulpec_by_reineke_fox-dbvzspv.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 264, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1df02c3bc13f3796a0def60d39add267ea955517", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTUb9TZgLpJyn8GM9zi6ew4HM_RdBVdEI1eCvZ6LXVKlQ2fpYFuZ0dCt4vhLDDhol0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "vulpec", "text": "Not currently featured in any groups.

Alan Green, D-Florissant, wants his Missouri legislative colleagues to take what he calls \u201cUnconscious Racial Bias Training\u201d. His call is in response to recent racially charged comments made by a visitor and a state lawmaker. Rep. Alan Green \n\u201cIt is important that we continue to foster a work environment where employees feel comfortable and free from hostile or offensive language. This type of behavior and prejudicial discourse should have no place in our state, let alone this institution and I am in full support of the Missouri House providing mandated diversity training. By implementing this training, it is my hope that we are able to work diligently to avoid racial bias in the workplace as well as more sufficiently ensure increased awareness among our employees,\u201d says Green. \nAn August Facebook post by State Rep. Warren Love, R-Osceola, said Confederate memorial vandals should be \u201chung from a tall tree with a long rope\u201d. A recent visitor to the Missouri Capitol was also asked to leave after saying something racially-offensive. State Rep. Bruce Franks Jr. speaks on the Missouri House floor on May 24, 2017 (photo courtesy of Tim Bommel at Missouri House Communications} \nState Rep. Bruce Franks, Jr., D-St. Louis, says training won\u2019t solve the racial problems. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t train somebody how not to be racist. You can give all the unbiased and implicit bias training in the world but that\u2019s not going to stop somebody from feeling the way they feel about me,\u201d says Franks. \u201cYou\u2019re not born racist.

Using panel data from 25 European countries for the period of 2000\u20132012, we aim to examine whether technological innovations affect unemployment. We used triadic patent families per million inhabitants as our main proxy for technological innovations, as well as other unemployment controls, in our model, which were estimated using System Generalized Method of Moments (SGMM). Finding no significant relationship between technological innovations and unemployment in our base estimation, we re-estimated it testing the impact with a time lag as well as using alternative proxies for technological innovations. Overall, the research estimations do not suggest that technological innovations have an effect on unemployment.

Nationwide, a different mortgage lender, has reported a weaker pace of house price growth recently and the Bank of England has said mortgage approvals have fallen to a more than 1-year low.\nThe figures come two weeks after finance minister Philip Hammond delivered a budget that included measures to help first-time buyers and spur more housebuilding.\n\u201cEven if successful, the chancellor\u2019s measures to boost house building in the budget will take time to have a significant effect so are unlikely to markedly influence house prices in the near term at least,\u201d Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club consultancy, said.\nHe added that house prices are likely to rise between 2 and 3 percent in 2018.

By Choltanutkun Tun-atiruj | Dec 04, 2017 Chulalongkorn University. Credit: www.wikimedia.org \nChulalongkorn University, one of the most prestigious universities in Thailand, has introduced electric mini cars for students to get around the campus, according to a Facebook post on PostToday (see below). \nThe Toyota Ha:mo project, which launched Dec 1, is a collaboration between Toyota and Chulalongkorn University to provide 10 mini cars with 20 more to arrive in mid-2018. \nThey have also installed 12 parking stations and 10 charging stations around the university. \nThe membership cost for using the cars is B100. Register online at www.cutoyotahamo.com or at the Toyota Ha:mo office located in the university. \nAs far as rates, the cars cost B30 for 20 minutes, after which the fare increases to B2 per minute. Rates can be debited directly from any major banks or charged to a credit or debit card. \nThe cars are not exclusive to Chulalongkorn students and professors, but available for use in the university by those who live nearby. \nPhoto credit: Pattaraphong Chatpattarasin", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "choltanutkun tun-atiruj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pattaraphong chatpattarasin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "toyota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chulalongkorn university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chulalongkorn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:58.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "25f74b6f73e39b288e3cee7bc1529f3b83edf83a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbfEGBoiYqCjEQf.3XRaqR4gC8hTdPFTjgTWymv66gBydkHthGngdqnb3oTyUNQeLNsszNP2qFffTuTbEOvw8CxOJHo5ypyHf4c2F5627Irk8UrrOf2uhEI4-", "site_full": "www.expedia.ca", "site": "expedia.ca", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.ca/Auckland-Hotels.d178233.Travel-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Top 10 Auckland Hotels: Cheap Hotel Deals from C$92 | Expedia.ca", "title": "Waldorf St Martins Apartments Hotel:", "title_full": "Waldorf St Martins Apartments Hotel: 2017 Pictures, Reviews, Prices & Deals | Expedia.ca", "published": "2017-11-20T04:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6618, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d2628972edd0227c0bf966938d5408d25b0af13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbfEGBoiYqCjEQf.3XRaqR4gC8hTdPFTjgTWymv66gBydkHthGngdqnb3oTyUNQeLNsszNP2qFffTuTbEOvw8CxOJHo5ypyHf4c2F5627Irk8Fd0tK_Bz1LAE7lMsDKy_57N4sYVsyweMS_CmNnJTUXs-", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-06T02:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The hotel was ok but the carpets , chairs and sofa all need a good shampoo .

In an interview with the Daily Mail , Gavin Williamson said: \"Quite simply, my view is a dead terrorist can't cause any harm to Britain.\" He said everything should be done \"to destroy and eliminate that threat\". At least 800 Britons have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight for IS and 130 of those have been killed in conflict. Mr Williamson, who took over as defence secretary last month, told the newspaper: \"I do not believe that any terrorist, whether they come from this country or any other, should ever be allowed back into this country.\" British IS fighters must be killed, minister says British jihadist Jones 'killed by drone' Who are Britain\u2019s jihadists? British fighters who had fled to other countries would also be found and stopped from returning to the UK, he said, adding that there would be no \"safe space\" abroad for them either. \"We have got to make sure that as (they) splinter and as they disperse across Iraq and Syria and other areas, we continue to hunt them down,\" he said. Mr Williamson's predecessor Sir Michael Fallon said in October that British IS fighters in Syria and Iraq had made themselves \"a legitimate target\" who could end up on \"the wrong end of an RAF or USAF missile\". His comments came after it was reported that British IS recruiter Sally-Anne Jones had been killed in a US drone strike in Syria in June. Which countries have fleeing IS fighters gone to? And Rory Stewart, the minister for international development, said the \"only way\" to deal with British IS fighters in Syria is \"in almost every case\" to kill them. He said they can expect to be killed because of the \"serious danger\" they pose to the UK's security. In contrast, Max Hill QC, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, has said Britons who joined IS through \"naivety\" should be spared prosecution and instead be reintegrated into society if they return home. Analysis: Can the UK legally kill jihadists? By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent Under British and international law, an aspiration to eliminate all known British IS recruits will take a little more consideration than simply launching a drone laden with fire-and-forget missiles. In war, soldiers are immune from prosecution for murder. But the UK is not at war with the IS network - so the same immunity is not automatically available for counter-terrorism purposes. There has to be some other legal basis for justifying the killing. Two years ago, the government sent a three- paragraph letter to the United Nations Security Council setting out the case for killing Cardiff extremist Reyaad Khan . That strike was legal under the \"inherent right of self-defence\", it said, because 21-year-old had been directing \"imminent armed attacks\". MPs have pushed for more information on the decision-making process, that some critics say could amount to an unreviewable secret power to launch \"extra-judicial executions.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gavin williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reyaad khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominic casciani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rory stewart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael fallon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sally-anne jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max hill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "daily mail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usaf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardiff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "independent reviewer of terrorism legislation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:59.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08624fe8aa39704bde6d1f09b5a3ba11e9a7789f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.WHbifSZD2Av.aSoiYQcGtLQLejKLZ.rxsbDX8xn9nUzrBIb7HWZkrN5i6v4z7Gp9.2gpXRI266a_HlLOhdYhfP4IETLVkuK4IveRQ8tbI8ROFdJhQg10kR", "site_full": "kids-woodworkingplans.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://kids-woodworkingplans.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "kids woodworking plans", "title": "adirondack chair plans from a pallet", "title_full": "adirondack chair plans from a pallet", "published": "2017-12-07T11:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/qKKDfKRnjO8DgNFQjuP32tNNBzl2RdLKvzLhGaUHlOSbWhIv-SmDHtjreOdTwOJFgGMuAZX5_2A0SJbdiARBrOKdMMLzkjJ9K7K5uNvRZ-dxD5M1A9PtasmuJi7GIUg87Nk=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08624fe8aa39704bde6d1f09b5a3ba11e9a7789f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.WHbifSZD2Av.aSoiYQcGtLQLejKLZ.rxsbDX8xn9nUzrBIb7HWZkrN5i6v4z7Gp9.2gpXRI266a_HlLOhdYhfP4IETLVkuK4IveRQ8tbI8ROFdJhQg10kR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "raja (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "adirondack chair plans from a pallet", "text": "Posted by raja on 1:41 AM with No comments so far adirondack chair plans from a pallet Pallet adirondack chair stephanie daft parker fairmount i hav a few plans but really liked the way yours came out. we love to build with pallet wood..

Michael J. Luosey will be formally made public at a ceremony to be held at the Naval Academy in Jinhae, South Gyeongsang Province, later in the day. \nLuosey served as the head of the Commander Task Group with the operational control of South Korea\u2019s Navy during the 1950-53 Korean War, while the Navy\u2019s combat operations were conducted at the order of Chief of Adm. Sohn Won-il, the nation\u2019s first chief of naval operations. \nLuosey also led an advisory group for the nascent Navy. \nHaving arrived in South Korea on July 9, 1950, two weeks after the outbreak of the war, he played a key role in many operations including the evacuation of South Korea\u2019s Third Division troops under siege by North Korea\u2019s military in Pohang, the Navy said. \nHe retired in 1960 and died in 1998. \nThe ceremony will be hosted by Rear Adm.
