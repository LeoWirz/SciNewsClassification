More The hotly anticipated sequel Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is bringing back one of the franchise's most-beloved characters. In a newly-released featurette \u2013 which drops quite a few tantalizing hints and exciting teases regarding the upcoming dino-fighting epic \u2013 fans get a sneak peek at the return of Jeff Goldblum's iconic scientist-turned-reluctant adventurer, Ian Malcolm. While the glimpse at Goldblum is brief, it's endlessly exciting for fans of the original Jurassic Park and its sequel, who have been dying to see the celebrated character come back to the franchise. The good doctor has clearly aged well and matured since we last saw him chasing a T-Rex through the streets of San Diego in the action-packed 1997 Jurassic Park sequel, The Lost World . He's traded in his black leather jacket for a crisp black suit, and he's grown out his salt-and-pepper beard, giving him the look of a distinguished professor. View photos Universal Pictures/YouTube More In the one scene in the featurette, Goldblum's character looks to be testifying in a court room or a government hearing, where he delivers the hilariously self-referential line, \"Here I am, talking about dinosaurs again.\" Dr. Malcolm's influence on Fallen Kingdom can be seen outside of just Goldblum's role in the film. The upcoming blockbuster's tagline, \"Life finds a way,\" is one of the character's most iconic lines of dialogue from the original film. And, while Dr. Malcolm may not have appeared in 2015's Jurassic World , his in-universe book did. The tome, God Creates Dinosaurs , appears as an Easter egg in multiple scenes throughout the film. Among the other glimpses of what's in store in Fallen Kingdom , fans get a brief look at Justice Smith \u2013 who serves as this installment's young, adventurous sidekick character \u2013 as well as B.D. Wong's villainous, turtleneck-clad Dr. Henry Wu. Fans also get a very quick look at series newcomer James Cromwell, who reportedly plays Benjamin Lockwood, business partner to the late John Hammond (originally played by Richard Attenborough). Lockwood also co-founded and pioneered the cloning technology used to create dinosaurs. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom -- directed by J. A. Bayona and penned by Colin Trevorrow, who co-wrote and directed the first Jurassic World , alongside returning co-writer Derek Connolly -- is set to stampede into theaters on June 22, 2018. Check out the video below to hear more from star Bryce Dallas Howard about her role in the exciting sequel.

The posts are actually both about her Cortina d'Ampezzo stay, and for Alta Via 2. So do not consider too much the parts regarding the Cortina area, and focus on the part regarding the Alta Via 2. I believe it could really be of help, since we discussed in detail various \"lateral possibilities\" along the main trail, and the timing of the various stages.\ntripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g3388222-i28682-k10\u2026\n- Even if camping outside is not legal, is well tolerated if you put your tent at sunset and remove it at the dawn, and if you find yourself above 2000/ 2500 meters and NOT close to a hut.\nAnd of course you must collect and take with you (until you find a basket to throw it, may be in a hut) all the trash you make. You must be aware of the dangerous thunderstorms that are quite frequent in the summer: a tent in these cases is not a pleasant experience (and I tell you this because it happenend to me more than once!), and actually is much much less safe than a hut or a bivaque!!!\nIf your motivation to have a tent is not to have the worry of finding a place to sleep, forget about it: there are many many huts and bivaques along Alta Via 2, and generally in the Dolomites, which are (except some wilder areas) very well organized and \"humanized\". The risk to find yourself without a repair in the night is almost zero I would say. Even if you should book the huts in advance, if for whatever reason or in case of emergency you can't respect your original plan, is not too difficult to cancel the reservation with a phone call.\nTo take a tent with you makes also the trail much harder, because you have more weight on your shoulders, and it could affect the choices of your possibilities, especially on the many amazing vie ferrate that you could make, that are much more difficult with a heavy backpack.\nBe also aware that if you join the Club Alpino Italiano and receive the CAI card (\"tessera\") a night in a hut very frequently costs much less. the \"Tessera CAI\" could be of value, depending on how many nights you plan to spend in the huts and on how much discount you get with it.\nMy suggestion, after having done in the past many trails of more days and Alte Vie in the Alps carrying a tent with me (mainly for budget reasons), is not to do it! Anyway you could consider to spend some of your nights in the free and always open bivaques, placed not actually on the Alta Via 2 trail, but quite close to it, reached with not too long lateral deviations. There are some bivaques that are placed in a wonderful environment, that very few huts can \"compete with\". Many are found in the Pale di San Martino group, one of the most interesting section of Alta Via 2. Here some names of these bivaques (look on the web to see where their wonderful location): bivacco Marco Dal Bianco, bivacco Brunner, bivacco Fiamme Gialle, the very comfortable bivacco Minazio etc.\nLast, of course even if you sleep in a tent or in a bivaque, you can have your meal in a hut paying just for it. This is possible I would say for sure for lunch (as many \"daytrippers\" do), may be also for breakfast, but not for dinner, also because it would not be good to put a tent after dinner in the night. I've never had dinner in a hut, to go out by night... So you need to take with yourself the necessary food and water, I used to take with me freeze-dried food (mainly rice and pasta) to cook them with a gas burner: it's, of course, more weight on your shoulders!\n- The sections I had considered (as you can see in the link I gave you above) were the Odle, the Sella group, the Marmolada and the Pale di San Martino, but the entire Dolomites region is amazing, so it's not really possible to say which part is better.\nHowever for sure the most beautiful part of any Alta Via (Alta Via 2 included) is... its lateral deviations! In fact it's very important to consider the various possibilities along the trail, especially the amazing vie ferrate (for example the ferrata Sass Rigais, or the famous ferrata Tridentina, or the first section of the ferrata to Punta Penia up to Forcella Marmolada, or the ferrata Bepi Zac etc.) and also some summits, for example the marvellous and not too difficult Cima Vezzana.\nFerrate of course are not for everybody, but I would really consider to do a couple of them, being ready to renounce in case of bad weather. Of course for the vie ferrate it's necessary to have with you the ferrata set and the harness, but it's much better to have them also for some sections of the Alta Via 2. For example the section south of Rifugio Volpi al Mulaz, the so called \"Sentiero delle Farangole\"; or the more difficult but more interesting direct crossing of the Marmolada through the Forcella Marmolada...\nEdited: 06 December 2017, 11:46", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:56.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45ae83b58a279fc00079e7958176a123b1327a92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYyoODA_sG6MMGxFh26nSAvGr8ydSCAZ1EBdL76Ched0VIETK0o5vfQG52fZ82HsSY6VnNJObQF6UExGp3emQZ7VcVRKk5c3NvKBnUXVjCgvmPoYdWPvWxLJFtBPAUYySi", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.co.za", "site": "tripadvisor.co.za", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/ShowForum-g187768-i20-o40-Italy.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Italy Forum, Travel Discussion for Italy - TripAdvisor", "title": "Dolomites Alta Via 2 questions - Trentino-Alto Adige", "title_full": "Dolomites Alta Via 2 questions - Trentino-Alto Adige Message Board - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-05T12:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.146, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10000, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae9bd741ca70c5bf78a07a9fe91d99321e4f448b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYyoODA_sG6MMGxFh26nSAvGr8ydSCAZ1EBdL76Ched0VIETK0o5vfQG52fZ82HsSY6VnNJObQF6UExGp3emQZ7VcVRKk5c3NvKBnUXVjCgvmPoYdWPvWxLH71iYYx5msEQwG8BcbwF78-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Daymoth", "published": "2017-12-07T01:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Thank you that is a lot of good information.\nNot near the huts?

Any older name brand hybrid should do the trick. Reason being theft. Anything too new or shiny might be a theft magnet. Look for a 10 to 20 year old old Trek 7xx or 7xxx, Specialized Sirrus, or similar bike from Giant, Cannondale, Bianchi, Raleigh, GT etc...Doesn't need to be pretty, but hopefully find something that fits that is mechanically sound. These are bikes that can go from $50 to $150 depending on condition. As much as I resist that line of thinking, and want to believe that there's too much joy in riding what you want to ride, I have to look at my own history of having bikes stolen while at one of the nation's top 10 largest universities.\nFirst, in '89, I had a tricked out GT Karakoram K2, which was about $650 off the showroom floor, but which I kitted out pretty good with a suspension fork, lightweight custom wheels, and some other goodies which effectively doubled the purchase price, was nipped from a rack at work.\nI replaced that in '90 with a custom built Fat City Yo Eddy Team Fat Chance, which I pimped with custom gold anodized rims, cranks, seatpost, bars, and bar ends, which I was into for $4k, but had that pinched later that year from inside work! They ran in, grabbed it (it was unlocked) and ran out! Crap!\nThat was replaced with a $800 Cannondale M800, which I actually didn't like, but spent a lot of money on trying to get it to feel right, so sweet forks (Rockshox SL?

His catchy song, \u2018Wha Me Eat\u2019 quickly became what is now known as an anthem for reggae-loving vegans everywhere, due to the many plant based foods he raps about. \nHis all-positive approach has seen attention from big-name celebrities. Naomi Campbell and Tracee Ellis Ross both shared Macka B\u2019s rap about cucumber, and Vogue has claimed that Macka makes plant based cool. \nTwice a week Macka B posts raps on his Instagram to show just how cool plant based foods are and encourage healthy eating.

The artist wakes up between 4-5am to work on his music as it\u2019s the time of day he finds he\u2019s at his personal optimum brain function. Macka said when he writes lyrics, it is a mystical process. \nThe reggae artist adds, \u201cyou gotta look after yourself.

\u2018blacklist\u2019 move Kerri Gooding Created : 6 December 2017 Barbados News \nDirector of International Business, Kevin Hunte and Minister of International Business Donville Inniss speak to the media after the EU named 17 countries in its 'blacklist' of tax havens. \nThe Minister of International Business in Barbados and the Director of International Business surprised to see the country amongst the 17 countries on the European Union (EU) \u2018blacklist\u2019 issued yesterday. \nFurthermore, the two authorities said that their counterparts in Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada and St. Lucia too were blindsided by the move by the EU to include them as well. \n\nHaving spoken to Trinidad yesterday, Minister Donville Inniss said that they were \u201cmost flabbergasted and utterly surprised\u201d, while he said that for Grenada according to public comments today, \u201cthey too are a bit surprised and disappointed\u201d. \nAdmitting that he had not been in contact with St. Lucia, Director Kevin Hunte added that following his conversation with St. Lucia the response is \u201csimilar\u201d. \nThe Minister shared that because other Caribbean countries are not listed, it does not mean that in those jurisdictions \u201call is well\u201d, but he shared that the EU had indicated that an additional year has been given to countries which suffered devastation due to natural disasters during the last hurricane season. \nHowever, speaking to Loop News after the press conference held at Baobab Towers this evening, Hunte also indicated that in his opinion the one-year 'grace period' before reviewing countries such as Dominica especially, which was truly ravaged, he questioned the fairness of only a year to rebuild. He even pointed out that records may be unavailable in those territories as much was destroyed during the passing of Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kerri gooding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin hunte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donville inniss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hunte", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loop news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baobab towers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international business", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international business donville inniss", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "loop barbados", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barbados", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trinidad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. lucia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trinidad and tobago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grenada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominica", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:58.044+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d30287fd38c9644d100677dcd0862094a2b976a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_Xnn7dSEzcXkUIwegllDOCHHTfrhQspQBRrvhEEgrer1stXHo2vSdv.MjnVmClmjkw--", "site_full": "forums.aws.amazon.com", "site": "amazon.com", "site_section": "https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=155", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "AWS Developer Forums: Amazon Redshift ", "title": "Feature Request: Unload to partitioned", "title_full": "AWS Developer Forums: Feature Request: Unload to partitioned ...", "published": "2017-12-07T01:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.149, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d30287fd38c9644d100677dcd0862094a2b976a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_Xnn7dSEzcXkUIwegllDOCHHTfrhQspQBRrvhEEgrer1stXHo2vSdv.MjnVmClmjkw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "afautsch", "published": "2017-12-07T01:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "Feature Request: Unload to partitioned", "text": "Yes, +1 million to this!

Apache Drill can nominally do it, but I found that it often produced Parquet files that Spectrum/Athena/Hive/Spark thought were corrupt.

Brenna\u2019s not dreaming of a white Christmas\u2026 As a professional skier she\u2019s already had too many to count! Brenna\u2019s more concerned about finally spending the season with the man she\u2019s loved as long as she can remember \u2013 her best friend Tyler. Single dad Tyler is determined to make sure his daughter, Jess, has the best Christmas ever. He can\u2019t afford to be distracted by Brenna moving into his family\u2019s snow-capped ski resort. Especially as that mistletoe magic has him looking at Brenna in a whole new light. Until a surprise kiss means the relationship Brenna\u2019s always dreamed of feels so close she could almost touch it. Could this be the Christmas her dreams of a happy-ever-after finally come true? The Snow Crystal Trilogy Book 1 - Sleigh Bells in the Snow\nBook 2 - Suddenly Last Summer\nBook 3 - Maybe This Christmas While the Snow Crystal novels can easily be read as standalone stories, you'll likely enjoy reading the earlier books in the series too. \n\n\n\n\n\nReview:  This is the final book in the Snow Crystal trilogy from Sarah Morgan. Each of the books centres on one of the 3 brothers in the O'Neil family who own the Snow Crystal resort in Vermont; hence the collection is also known as the O'Neil Brothers series. Having just finished books 1 and 2, I was looking forward to reading part 3 and finding out what will happen with the third O'Neil brother. As with the other 2 books, this was an easy read and had me hooked right from the start. The 3 books make a lovely, rounded trilogy, but each can perfectly well be read as a standalone.   \n\nThe story this time relates to Tyler O'Neil, one-time ski champion who has had to retire from competitive sport following a horrific injury on the slopes. He is now resident instructor and guide at the Snow Crystal resort where he and his brothers grew up. He lives in an idyllic house overlooking the lake with his teenage daughter, Jess. Unbeknown to Tyler, Brenna, who he has known all his life and is now also an instructor at the resort, has been in love with him since school days. When the resort is fully booked and Brenna has to move into Tyler's house because her lodge is required for paying guests, she hopes he may notice her as a woman rather than just as a best friend. With Christmas preparations all around them and the whole O'Neil clan rooting for the pair, the reader is left to wonder what is going to happen.   \nI really enjoyed this book and would recommend it highly, especially as a story for the festive season. As I've said earlier, it can be read as a standalone, but having read the books that preceded this one, I liked finding all the familiar characters popping up and getting involved in the Tyler-Brenna relationship. I loved that the author made Tyler a man of contrasts, gruff and noisy with everybody except his daughter; although claiming not to know how to bring up a teenage girl, he seemed to be doing OK. The will-they-won't-they aspect of the story was really tense and kept me guessing, and hoping, right to the end. All in all, another heartwarming festive romance from Sarah Morgan.   \nTo order your copy, or the whole trilogy, just click the link: UK or US \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sarah morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jess", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brenna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o'neil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyler o'neil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "o'neil brothers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vermont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyler-brenna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brenna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snow crystal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:59.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be9d78fad8b0165d474bc9a713d11d123bd2bbf3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRF4iBrSHovNwHkavj6nn3sbLsXUvYwi4d8uQ_YS3yqIJRDYHpLmKm8abV0.QVPJb56n7Uhm0d667BFDlI50xR39WEBJ8VY3xQhrXOy4_28wfpvDWZpPfJOZoUensO6ivw-", "site_full": "hammerandtonguesshoppingmall.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://hammerandtonguesshoppingmall.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Five interesting ways to consume wine \u2013 HammerandTongues Blog", "title": "Five interesting ways to consume wine", "title_full": "Five interesting ways to consume wine", "published": "2017-12-07T11:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be9d78fad8b0165d474bc9a713d11d123bd2bbf3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRF4iBrSHovNwHkavj6nn3sbLsXUvYwi4d8uQ_YS3yqIJRDYHpLmKm8abV0.QVPJb56n7Uhm0d667BFDlI50xR39WEBJ8VY3xQhrXOy4_28wfpvDWZpPfJOZoUensO6ivw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "HammerandTongues", "published": "2017-12-07T11:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "Five interesting ways to consume wine", "text": "\nMake sangria. Sangria is a wine punch that involves mixing seasonal fruits with wine, usually a red. You can make different flavors with different fruits, or even mix fruits \u2014 like a combination of apple and cranberry, or strawberry and peach. Some sangria recipes suggest mixing in some ginger ale to make it a little bubbly. Mix with juices. Sangria usually requires that the fruit \u201cmarinade\u201d in the wine for a couple of days, but you don\u2019t have to do that if you are just not that patient. The faster way is to mix your favorite wine with a fruit juice. Add some liquor. Let\u2019s face it, wine is not exactly a \u201cmanly\u201d drink \u2014 I get self-conscious just holding a wine glass in public view. So instead, grab a tumbler, pour in some semi-sweet wine, and add a splash or two of vodka. I can\u2019t really speak for any other liquors, but a little Absolut mixes well with a good red. Try mulling. Winter is the best time for mulling which is the process of combining wine, usually red, with spices like cinnamon or cloves and serving it warm for a delicious cider-like treat. In fact, you can buy mulling bags, which are basically oversized tea bags filled with spices that steep in warm wine. And the best part: They\u2019re reusable!\nMake a milkshake. Mix a semi-sweet wine with ice cream to make a milkshake. Or would it be a wine-shake? Wine mixes just like any other beverage. Get creative with it! There is a Spanish drink called calimocho that is equal parts cola and red wine so go ahead and be adventurous with your wine which Food Lovers Market stocks on a wide range!\nRemember to drink responsibly!\n#onlineshopping #wine #convenience #onestopshop", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "food lovers market", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:59.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fff5412d02c3224563213df108032c826f57441b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG2_qe99NKfQaNTjcBOmadOLjq_gOTtRcMOxUASbZDg1q5U5V._u909uaUH5xm0sZmS", "site_full": "www.mumsnet.com", "site": "mumsnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/conception", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Conception | Mumsnet Discussion ", "title": "December Bus 2", "title_full": "December Bus 2 | Mumsnet Discussion", "published": "2017-12-07T04:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.036, "main_image": "/images/logo/mn-logo-square.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6762, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ecbc724d1276b76a94b081518068b14004ac33ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG2_qe99NKfQaNTjcBOmadOLjq_gOTtRcMOxUASbZDg1q5U5V._u909uXHpA3xUknP8jD.mrjJ9bDA-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "LookingAtTheStars89", "published": "2017-12-07T17:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "@sophherts .

(Fibonacci Blue/FlickR) December 6, 2017 \nST. PAUL, Minn. \u2013 A federal district court already has ruled that a Minnesota filmmaker may not violate the state's human rights law by refusing to film gay weddings. Carl and Angel Larsen, who own Telescope Media in St. Cloud , have argued in court that a state law barring discrimination violates their constitutional right to free expression. \"Telescope Media Group exists to glorify God through top quality media production,\u201d Carl Larsen says in a video produced by Alliance Defending Freedom, or ADF. \u201cI want to tell marriage stories. I want to tell stories about the glory of God in marriage.\" Larsen and his wife Angel have appealed the ruling against their company, but Minnesota officials argue the case should wait to see what the U.S. Supreme Court decides. The high court heard arguments Tuesday in a case filed by a gay couple in Colorado who were refused service by a wedding cake baker. In Alliance Defending Freedom videos, attorney Jeremy Tedesco says both the Colorado baker and the Minnesota videographer have the right to express themselves in their work. \"The Minnesota Human Rights Department has said that state law requires them to create films celebrating same sex marriages if they create films celebrating marriage between a man and a woman,\u201d Tedesco points out. \u201cAnd that's something that violates Carl and Angel's beliefs.\u201d The U.S. Department of Justice has sided in the case with Alliance Defending Freedom, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated as a hate group. Minnesota is among 20 states that have filed friend-of-the-court briefs on the other side. Minnesota Human Rights Commissioner Kevin Lindsey says all those states ban discrimination based on sexual orientation. \"What would stop someone from saying on the basis of my religious beliefs, 'I don't wish to work with this woman' or 'I don't wish to sell to this man because he's of a different religious belief,'\u201d he points out. \u201cIt really could lead to an erosion of civil rights for everyone.\" Lindsey says he doesn't have any idea what the Supreme Court will do.

Indeed, the 3-4-2-1 system has somewhat rendered Walcott\u2019s position redundant in the starting line-up as Arsenal currently deploy tactics that don\u2019t play to his strengths. \nWith Alexis Sanchez seemingly on his way out of the club either in January or next summer, Walcott should be careful before making a rash decision on his future as he may yet find himself playing regularly in the team again. \nThe main word around Walcott\u2019s career over the years has been \u2018hype\u2019. From signing for Arsenal as a fresh-faced 16-year-old to being included in England\u2019s 2006 World Cup squad despite only playing sporadically for the senior side on two occasions previous to that, Walcott has had high expectations on his shoulders for over a decade. The barometer to measure him should surely be based on what he has delivered to this Arsenal team \u2013 goals, assists and match-winning contributions. Article continues below \nWalcott could find himself complementing Alexandre Lacazette if Chile star Sanchez does eventually leave in January. The two would almost certainly combine well and play off each other\u2019s unique qualities where movement, positioning and runs are concerned. As it stands however, there is no room for Walcott in the starting line-up unless Wenger opts to change Arsenal\u2019s formation to four at the back again. \nMany of Arsenal\u2019s most established performances in the Premier League and Europe have involved Walcott playing an integral part in attack. Whether it be the two assists against Manchester United two seasons ago or his contribution in last season\u2019s 3-0 win over Chelsea where he played on the right-hand side, Walcott has always managed to produce when it matters and even more so when people doubt his qualities. \nIt\u2019s clear for all to see that Walcott has a big decision to make over the coming weeks.

The California-based company said in the lawsuit that Trump's proclamation shrinking the monument by 85 per cent exceeds the president's authority and strips much-needed protections from sacred tribal lands.\nPatagonia also replaced its usual home page with a stark message, \"The President Stole Your Land.\"\nThe post drew a strong rebuke from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke who called it \"nefarious, false and a lie.\"\nThree lawsuits already had been filed involving Utah's monuments. And more are expected -- especially if Trump follows Zinke's recommendations to shrink two other monuments -- Gold Butte in Nevada and Cascade Siskiyou in Oregon.\nSupporters of Trump's move welcomed the fight, saying it will answer longstanding questions about presidential power involving the protection of land.\n\"Hopefully, we can have some closure on what the president can and cannot do,\" said Mike Noel, a Republican state representative in Utah who was on stage with the president during his proclamation signing in Salt Lake City.\nPast presidents have trimmed national monuments and redrawn their boundaries 18 times, according to the National Park Service.\nLegal experts disagree on whether the 1906 Antiquities Act -- allowing presidents to create a monument -- also lets them reduce one.\nThe question has never been settled in court, but conservation and paleontology groups and Native American tribes launching lawsuits are preparing to argue that Trump doesn't have that authority and his move jeopardizes a wealth of Native American artifacts, dinosaur fossils and rugged spaces.\n\"Gee whiz, it sounds like there are going to be a lot of attorneys making a whole lot of money,\" quipped Noel. \"For every organization, there's a lunch ticket for a group of attorneys to exist.\"\nNoel plans to intervene himself, filing a court brief to show support for the president's actions.\nDonald Kochan, a professor of natural resources, property and administrative law at Chapman University in Orange, California, believes Trump's action is likely legal and the separate lawsuits allow each group to show supporters they're speaking up.\nSquillace said the lawsuits will likely be merged into one case for each monument.\nHe thinks a court will try to focus on the overall question of whether Trump has the authority to reduce the monuments -- something Squillace doesn't think the president has the legal authority to do.\nWhile the legal battles play out, Utah Republican Rep. Rob Bishop, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, has introduced a bill that would prevent presidents from designating monuments larger than 85,000 acres and give states and local officials the power to veto a monument larger than 10,000 acres.\nBishop's bill is awaiting a vote on the House floor.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rob bishop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan zinke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark squillace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zinke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "squillace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike noel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald kochan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national park service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of colorado-boulder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interior", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cascade siskiyou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chapman university in orange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house natural resources committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "patagonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salt lake city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:59.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3c50b6453d532477be2f90c03035383de8b22d6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJ__5_PIrD_mDC_1aLtH5mgHZsNTnea4RJE6Mys_e1YB8ZgAUnTxm2N6SOFJeGNPIAA2PXsdg498i3kEwg0JY87B1NnOKpcGY8", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Decor-Furniture-Living-Room-Furniture/N-5yc1vZc7p3/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Classic Bonded Leather Club Chair in Gray-CNF456-LGY", "title_full": "Classic Bonded Leather Club Chair in Gray-CNF456-LGY -

Dick Roche gives a recipe for how the problem can be solved.\nDick Roche is a former Fianna F\u00e1il politician. He was the minister of state for European affairs when Ireland conducted the two referendums on the Treaty of Lisbon of the European Union, in 2008 and 2009. \nThere is something quintessentially Irish about the shambolic events of Monday that brought the Brexit talks to a grinding halt.\nThe offer that was on the table for Northern Ireland on Monday was a classic example of the linguistic dexterity the EU employs when faced with a knotty problem. It offered the people of Northern Ireland and their neighbours in the Republic a means of lessening the potentially ruinous impact of Brexit on their economies.\nNorthern Ireland would have a unique trading relationship with the EU not enjoyed by the other parts of the United Kingdom.\nWithin minutes of the details being released, parties as disparate as the First Ministers of Scotland and Wales, the Lord Mayor of London and even the good citizens of Grimsby were on the airwaves asking \u201cplease can we have some too\u201d.\nConversely, the reaction from the former Northern First Minister Arlene Foster and leader of the Democratic Unionist Party [DUP] was an outright rejection of the offer and a threat to pull the plug on Mrs May and her government.\nColleagues from her party would not see the advantages it offered Northern Ireland, rather, they portrayed it as a plan to drag Northern Ireland into a United Ireland. That response would have been funny, a sort of Blackadder episode, had its implications not been so profoundly depressing\nTo be fair to Mrs Foster and her colleagues, what happened on Monday \u2013 if their version of events is correct- should not have happened. It seems bizarre that on an issue of such sensitivity there was no real effort to \u2018tee up\u2019 political leaders in Northern Ireland as to what was coming down the line.\nIt is extraordinary if, as the DUP leadership says, it was only given details of the offer just as Prime Minister May and President Juncker were about to start their Brussels meeting.\nThe fact that the Northern Ireland executive, which collapsed following the resignation of Sinn Fein\u2019s Deputy First Minister the late Martin McGuinness, is not in place, was not helpful. It meant that no executive structure was in place through which communications could be channelled.\nThat is all now in the past. Rather than go through the blame process, the focus should now be on identifying what can be done to get out of the impasse.\nThe approach adopted when the Irish voted \u2018No\u2019 to the Lisbon Treaty might offer a way forward.\nIn 2008, more than 53% of Irish voters rejected the Treaty, posing a major problem for the EU. Without Irish agreement, Lisbon was \u2018dead\u2019. Detailed polling after the referendum identified a series of \u2018allergic issues\u2019, which, in addition to the impenetrable nature of the Treaty itself, lead a majority of voters to \u2018reject Lisbon\u2019.\nIn a statement by the Taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister] delivered to the European Council in December 2008, the key \u2018concerns of the Irish people\u2019 were identified as the loss of \u2018Ireland\u2019s Commissioner\u2019, concerns on taxation policy, on the Irish Constitutional position on \u201cthe right to life, education and the family\u201d and Ireland\u2019s military policy.\nThe issue of the \u201cIrish Commissioner\u201d was resolved by an agreement that \u201cprovided the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, a decision would be taken \u2013 to the effect that the Commission shall continue to include one national of each member state.\u201d\nThe problem with other issues was that none of them had anything to do with the Lisbon Treaty \u2013 they were concerns projected into the Lisbon debate. In the same way as concerns about Northern Ireland\u2019s future within the United Kingdom have been projected into the Brexit debate.\nThe Irish voters\u2019 concerns were addressed in a series of \u2018legal guarantees\u2019. These guarantees were included in a Protocol, in order to \u201cgive full Treaty status to the clarifications (agreed) to meet the concerns of the Irish people\u201d.\nThe point will be made that the circumstances faced by the European Council in addressing the concerns of the Irish people in 2008 are different than the problems posed by the DUP veto: that is a fair point.\nThere is, however, a parallel in that at the core of the case made by the DUP leadership are concerns about being propelled in some way into a united Ireland or separated from the United Kingdom.\nThose concerns have nothing to do with the arrangements on offer on last Monday to meet the unique problems that arise for the people of Ireland, North and South when Brexit happens, but they should not be simply brushed aside.\nRather what should be done now is to look for a way, as was done at the time of the Lisbon Treaty, to enshrine in the Brexit agreement a guarantee that any special arrangements to deal with the unique problems that arise on the island of Ireland are not a threat to the status of Northern Ireland.\nAs happened following the Lisbon 1 referendum, such a guarantee could be given a treaty status binding on Ireland and on the UK and \u2018underwritten\u2019 by the EU.\nThe Good Friday Agreement normalised relations between the diverse communities on the island of Ireland. The Agreement created the conditions that allowed peace to take root. It also brought about a unique trading relationship between industries operating in both parts of Ireland.\nIt is worth recalling that in 1998 the citizens of the Republic of Ireland supported the Good Friday Agreement when they voted by 94% in favour of Constitutional amendments necessitated to give effect to the agreement.\nIn a referendum held on the same day in Northern Ireland, a phenomenal 81% of voters turned out to vote in favour of the agreement by a 71% to 29% margin. The consensus that was demonstrated in the vote taken across the island of Ireland that day was unique in our long and often troubled history.\nIt would be a very poor day for all the people of Ireland if the political fumble of last Monday were allowed to undo in any way what has been so painstakingly constructed since the Agreement was put in place. Politicians of all stripes in London, Dublin and Belfast have a special responsibility to ensure that does not happen.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",
