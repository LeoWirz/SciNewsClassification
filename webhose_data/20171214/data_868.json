HIV/AIDS Activist Kecia Johnson Shares Story of How She Contracted the Virus Aged 22. by 11:08:00 in NEWS   Kecia Johnson is an HIV/AIDS Activist and she goes round the world speaking to and inspiring others living with the virus. She has been living with AIDS for 11 Years. Kecia was a 19-year-old sophomore at Sam Houston State and was living out her dreams while at school. As any young woman she then was looking for what she details as \u201cprince charming\u201d and thought she found him. According to XO Necole, Johnson said, \u201cHe was a well-known Houston area rapper. He was charming and well-connected and from the moment we met, we were inseparable.\u201d He even was able to get her a job as a promotions assistant where she became very successful in other positions. She said, \u201cOur life was filled with power, sex, drugs, and strip clubs.\u201d Her life was filled with designer clothes, the hottest parties and so many other things she can\u2019t imagine. The two broke up when she found out that he was cheating her on and even got another woman pregnant. Months later after leaving the relationship she was in the shower and passed out. After going in and out of hospital, one day the physician walked in the room and said, \u201cSo, about your AIDS virus.\u201d At that time Johnson had full-blown AIDS and things weren\u2019t looking good. After her discharge from the hospital she decided to become an advocate. She said, \u201cI vowed to share my story with the world and inspire others about the importance of self love.\u201d When she spoke to her ex about what happened, he brushed her off and even asked that they get together because, \u201cher arse got fatter\u201d. Now Johnson, travels around the country and speaks to people living with AIDS. She said, \u201cLooking back on this journey, I don\u2019t blame myself but I do take full responsibility for my part and for not loving myself enough to walk away from a man who was not worthy of me.\u201d Her virus is currently undetectable, which means that is is absolutely untransmittable.

That wasn't a \"gun nut\" thing, it was a practical law enforcement thing.\nThe current background check has only stood after being modified. The first time it was challenged in court, SCOTUS struck it down. Why? Because forcing the police to do the background check, which was how it was written into the law the first time, was considered to be a violation of states rights (Printz v. U.S.)\nAs yet the court is silent on the constitutionality of a universal background check system.

Employer contributions are mandatory for each year that the SIMPLE IRA plan is maintained. \nEmployee deferral contributions must be deposited to each employee's SIMPLE IRA by the 30th day following the month for which the deferral applies. For instance, employee deferral contributions for April 2018 must be deposited to the employee's SIMPLE IRAs by May 30, 2018. \nEmployers have until their tax-filing deadline (including extensions) to deposit matching or nonelective contributions to the employees' SIMPLE IRAs. Employee Contribution Limit \nEligible employees may defer 100% of compensation up to the annual dollar limit to their SIMPLE IRAs. Employees who are at least age 50 by the end of the applicable year may defer additional amounts. These additional amounts are referred to as \"catch-up\" contributions. \nThe dollar limit is 100% of compensation, up to $12,500 (for 2018). Participants who are at least age 50 by the end of the year may make an additional catch-up contribution of $3,000. Employer Contribution Limits \nAn employer is required to make one of two kinds of contributions: Dollar-for-dollar matching contributions (not to exceed 3% of the employee's compensation) on behalf of eligible employees who make elective-deferral contributions A 2% nonelective contribution to all eligible employees, regardless of whether they make deferral contributions \nOne important difference between a SIMPLE IRA and a 401(k): Employer contributions to the employee's account vest immediately. For 401(k)s, employees generally have to work for the employer for a specified period of time before becoming fully vested and receiving the employer's contributions to their account. \nAn employer who elects to make matching contributions to a SIMPLE IRA may reduce the 3% matching contribution to a minimum of 1% for two out of five years, or the employer may replace the 3% matching contribution with a 2% nonelective contribution. For any year the employer replaces the matching contribution with a 2% nonelective contribution, the employer's contribution is treated as if it were a 3% matching contribution for the purposes of the five-year period. For instance, an employer who chooses to make matching contributions but makes a 2% nonelective contribution for one year is, for that year, treated as if he made a 3% matching contribution. This means that the employer still has two years of the five to make a matching contribution that is less than 3%. \nExample: SIMPLE IRA Matching Contribution Rules \nABC Inc. maintains a SIMPLE IRA Plan for 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. ABC elects to make matching contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan, and contributions to the plan occur as follows: 2014 \u2013 3% matching contribution", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "abc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "employee contribution limit  eligible", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ira matching contribution rules  abc inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:25.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a35a35353f859f683382ef3860b3aa2b3056ed60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKzDbKpciiQPReXJt42pKFoECMxUZ2Y2LLIdnws5OlMZ64R9LnAioGKWi0oGKBmKRhktu3QisuDV0PV36OF7bXu3EBEuUpnNz_A--", "site_full": "community.ebay.com", "site": "ebay.com", "site_section": "https://community.ebay.com/t5/Selling/bd-p/selling-db/page/2", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Selling - Page 2 - The eBay Community", "title": "selling used electronic distributor", "title_full": "selling used electronic distributor - The eBay Community", "published": "2017-12-06T20:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1e0828d1aae106958caad39fa2a2451cb5f74510", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKzDbKpciiQPReXJt42pKFoECMxUZ2Y2LLIdnws5OlMZ64R9LnAioGKWi0oGKBmKRhktu3QisuDV0PV36OF7bXu0P7It1d08XlyKnzytbcc_l", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "slippinjimmy", "published": "2017-12-06T20:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Used An item that has been used previously.

You\u2019ve gone all Max Bygraves on me, Tec!\u201d \nI smiled and reached for the hand of my tall, droll Moll as the low sun sprinkled through Tec Towers in the early days of December. \n\"Almost 80 years ago my aunt, the definition of 1930s glamour had gone again to sea, yet this time was to be traumatic. \n\"She was on the Athenia, the first ship sunk in the opening hours of the Second World War.\" \nBlondie blinked. \n\u201cShe survived, returned to Glasgow and often spoke of the style of the great liners she played such a part in and yes, she returned to sea for many years.\u201d \n\u201cOh, Tec, that glamour, that luxury,\u201d said the Moll. \n\u201cYes, my dear, and today we are going to relive the style and the sensation of the great cuisine and attentive attention of the Atlantic liners, all in the heart of Glasgow.\u201d \nWe left the Buick at home and arrived by black cab in dandy fashion on the well-dusted St Vincent Place. \nWe\u2019ve both dressed up to the nines, she in sharp stilettos and a crimson town tailored dress that snug gently to her hips; me in French cuffs and my traditional suit. \nThe welcome at the foot of the stairs leading into the basement joy of the Atlantic bar and bistro was among the friendliest and relaxing in Glasgow. \n\u201cOh, Tec! We\u2019ve gone back in time!\u201d shivered the Moll. \n\u201cAnd you\u2019re welcome to sample our style,\u201d said the stylish young man guiding us in and towards our table. \nThis is one of Glasgow\u2019s heavenly stars. Beautiful people serving beautiful food in beautiful surroundings. What\u2019s not to like? \nThe doll took her seat and gave me a smile I returned with gusto. She has an air of the Taj Mahal in moonlight. \n\u201cI can see you are both settled and happy. Time to choose, sir,\u201d said the chap. \nIt is lunchtime in Glasgow. The Christmas lights are on in George Square and a happy band is parading by. \nWe are enveloped in the style and splendour of a bygone age \u2026 \n\u201cChips,\u201d said the delicately-framed hourglass figurine opposite me. \n\u201cChips, madam?\u201d said the only slightly hesitant chap. \nHe suggested they be accompanied by a splendid slab of Scottish fillet, only to be met by an overwhelming flutter of the doll\u2019s bri-nylon lashes. \n\u201cAnd for you, sir?\u201d \nIt had to be La Bouillabaisse, a classic fish stew packed with flavours of the sea, cooked in a tomato and saffron broth with a dash of Pernod, served with samphire, potato dumplings, garlic bread and aioli. \nIt awakened senses I had forgotten. Every mouthful was divine and had a fragrance that whizzed and whirred memories of days gone by. \n\u201cYou think you\u2019re at sea, don\u2019t you, Tec?!\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m very much there and with you, my dear, and also thinking of my aunt who would not be unaware of such excellent choices and d\u00e9cor. \n\u201cIt certainly makes a change from me dwelling on cases and sinister faces.\u201d \nHer Majesty\u2019s steak was simply divine. It cut splendidly and was caressed by the most succulent Caf\u00e9 de Paris sauce. \n\u201cJust like that day in France,\u201d she ventured. \u201cMais, oui,\u201d I ventured as I gazed around at the images around us recalling the Empire Exhibition in Glasgow in 1938. \nThe steak was divine and cooked perfectly to order. No utterance of chef\u2019s preference here. You get what you ask for. \nThis place has class, it has style and it is amazingly relaxed. \nOver yonder is a couple with shopping from Ted Baker. Another over there has shopping from Primark. I have tucked our Goldberg\u2019s carrier under the table. All life is here. \n\u201cDesert?\u201d said the increasingly beautiful doll. \n\u201cLet us savour the menu over our Chardonnay-Pinot fizz,\u201d I suggested. \nAfter lingering, we opted for a meringue nest with berries and a warm sticky date pudding. \n\u201cIf this place was a case, Tec, what would it be?\u201d \n\u201cA box of crackerjacks. \n\u201cAn explosion of great taste and a saloon of stylish folks that make you feel at home.\u201d \nTime to walk. \nWe climbed the stairs, took a left and sauntered towards George Square. \nYes, the Christmas lights are a spectacle. \n\u201cOh, Tec! What are they like?!\u201d \n\u201cWarm, welcoming, inviting.\" \n\u201cJust like you, my dear. \n\u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d \n\u201cOh, Tec,\u201d she said gliding closer to my vintage gabardine. \u201cLet\u2019s make it the best ever.\u201d \nAnd who could argue with that. \nFood: \nLe Filet 230g Prime Scottish Fillet \u00a330 \nLa Bouillabaisse de poisson \u00a320 \nLe vacherin sorbet cassis et compote de fruits rouges \u00a36.50 \nLe pudding Atlantic beurre caramel sale \u00a36.50 \nDrinks: \nGustave Lorentz, Cremant D\u2019Alsace, Brut NV \u00a36.95 x 2 \nTotal:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "max bygraves", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "blondie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moll", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ted baker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gustave lorentz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cremant d\u2019alsace", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "brut nv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "primark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la bouillabaisse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st vincent place", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caf\u00e9 de paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pernod", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:25.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a35a35353f859f683382ef3860b3aa2b3056ed60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKzDbKpciiQPReXJt42pKFoECMxUZ2Y2LLIdnws5OlMZ64R9LnAioGKWi0oGKBmKRhktu3QisuDV0PV36OF7bXu3EBEuUpnNz_A--", "site_full": "community.ebay.com", "site": "ebay.com", "site_section": "https://community.ebay.com/t5/Selling/bd-p/selling-db/page/2", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Selling - Page 2 - The eBay Community", "title": "selling used electronic distributor", "title_full": "selling used electronic distributor - The eBay Community", "published": "2017-12-06T20:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "69762d64af199b2e80abd34b04ec58bfe7565172", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKzDbKpciiQPReXJt42pKFoECMxUZ2Y2LLIdnws5OlMZ64R9LnAioGKWi0oGKBmKRhktu3QisuDV0PV36OF7bXu0P7It1d08Xlz9Y0PG5Opzg", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "chrysylys", "published": "2017-12-06T20:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I vote yes to a refund.

The International Conference on the History of Architecture (ICHA) in Delhi, focuses on these encounters and imaginations. Brought together by Delhi-based Greha and helmed by architect MN Ashish Ganju, the conference, from December 7 to 9 at Bikaner House, will have speakers from India and abroad presenting ideas on philosophy, interconnected histories, and the value of architecture against the gradient of time. In an interview, Ganju talks about the sense of social purpose, finding one\u2019s ancestry, and the museum of architecture: \nHow did the idea for the conference emerge? \nI had returned to India in the late \u201960s from England. But the places I was familiar with, didn\u2019t read right. I brought layers of understanding from my education, but it didn\u2019t fit; something was wrong. I realised one had to find a new grammar because what I was trained in, didn\u2019t fit. Then during one of our conversations, between architect Narendra Dengle and me, we felt we should research on where and why we don\u2019t match our skills with what the society needs. From this, came an essay on the \u2018Discovery of Architecture\u2019 in 2014. This became our history project, which we presented in various architecture schools across the country. We also roped in eight scholars in India, including academicians, anthropologists and conservationists. We felt we will never be able to build a theoretical matrix unless we look at history. Then ICCR asked us to host an international conference. The primary aim is to give the architectural profession a sense of social purpose, a platform, a sense of dignity of what the profession is capable of. Architecture precedes philosophy. In Greece, the first architect was making models of the cosmos. In our case, the vedi, the altar, is what gives rise to architecture. We are busy making glass buildings and putting in air cons, and then we say we can\u2019t assert ourselves in society. \nWhat are our references for an Indian history of architecture? \nArchitecture in India is often seen in the light of monuments, they are objects that people enshrine in their memory. Architecture is a lot about how people live. That is a point of view that most historians don\u2019t address. They catalogue buildings, like a book of butterflies, you give them nice names. An institutional or public building is like a mask, it represents the collective image of a company or a brand. So if you catalogue that, you won\u2019t see the real picture of life or architecture. In schools, the textbooks are all western. \nDoes that mean there is an Indian way to read a building? \nThe paper that I\u2019m presenting at the conference is about this. I\u2019ve selected examples of classical values, which are universally acceptable \u2014 Sanchi Stupa, Taj Mahal, High Court in Chandigarh and the Gandhi Museum in Ahmedabad \u2014 to get an understanding of the ancient, medieval and modern aesthetics. I then apply these attributes to three spaces in Mehrauli \u2014 Bhool Bhulaiya; the chowk in front of the police station, which is the public square; and the unorganised residential plots that overlook the park. You see, the classical examples find a place in history books, but Mehrauli, with its dynamic morphology, belongs to cinema. Can classical boundaries of history provide any scope for the marginalised, is what we want to understand. \nWhat can we expect from the other speakers? \nThere are different points of view. I think ultimately, it\u2019s an attempt to find your place or your ancestry in the scheme of things. In India, we also have regional history, so while Mumbai-based Aneerudha Paul talks about Majuli in Assam, Neelkanth Chayya from Ahmedabad presents architectural and settlement forms in Kutch. Each of these papers will be published later as a volume. Then, we have Nicholas Ray from the UK, who will talk about the loss of shared cultural references and the need for alternative philosophical standpoints. There\u2019s Giorgio Gianighian from Venice who will discuss the importance of why a building is not just design but also bricks, stones, beams, nails, and water, and why these components are important to the history of architecture. The conference is a medium to promote the museum of architecture. It is not a building, but a network of inspirational sites that are places of learning. \nYou are also presenting an exhibition. \nThrough projections, we present four aspects of what Greha has done in two decades, in the areas of health, learning, building and regeneration. There\u2019s also a film on the museum of architecture. Ultimately, it\u2019s about inspiring ourselves that we can do a lot to benefit our environment.

However, the cyclone lost its strength and turned into a \u2018deep depression\u2019 when it was around 240 km from Surat. \nAn early morning release by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) stated that the cyclonic storm first turned into a \u2018deep depression\u2019, then into a \u2018depression\u2019 and finally into a \u2018low pressure\u2019 area after midnight. \u201cThe depression over east-central and adjoining north-east Arabian Sea weakened into a well-marked low pressure area over east central Arabian sea and adjoining areas of north-east Arabian Sea, north coastal Maharashtra and south coastal Gujarat early Wednesday,\u201d the release said. \nThe cyclone dissipated over the sea before hitting the Gujarat coast, said IMD-Ahmedabad Regional Director Jyanata Sarkar. \u201cThe cyclone did not reach Surat at all. It dissipated into the sea before making a landfall on the southern coast. From deep depression, it became a depression, then became a well marked low pressure. Now, it is just low pressure. It may bring light to moderate rain in some parts of state today,\u201d said Sarkar, adding it is likely to result in moderate to light rainfall at few places in the south, north and coastal areas of Saurashtra on Thursday and Friday. The rest of the state \u2014 Saurashtra and Kutch \u2014 will remain dry. \nAs per the IMD release, the sea condition will be rough along and off south Gujarat and adjoining north Maharashtra coasts during the next 12 hours. \u201cFishermen along and off north Maharashtra and south Gujarat coasts are advised not to venture into sea during the next 12 hours,\u201d the IMD said. \nThis has, however, resulted in a huge drop in the daytime (maximum) temperature across the state. The lowest maximum temperature was recorded at Vallabhbhai Vidyanagar at 18.1 degree Celsius, followed by Surat at 18.4 and Idar at 18.8 degree Celsius respectively. \n(With inputs from PTI) For all the latest Ahmedabad News , download Indian Express App More Related News ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sarkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jyanata sarkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "imd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmedabad news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india meteorological department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saurashtra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vallabhbhai vidyanagar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kutch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arabian sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maharashtra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:26.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19699870b9aa7dae591015c81affa5a1ca8d6a92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.gRgt6bxSxA4uAh0k57z4RYEfT6OG0bdC2emXJbLI5jCL_.5dNwOUB4QlcEo6NjYI-", "site_full": "www.exvagos1.com", "site": "exvagos1.com", "site_section": "http://www.exvagos.net/external.php?type=RSS2", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "ExVagos", "title": "Me gusta.

In one of them, titled Memoirs of a Lost Warrior, there is a tool made of bronze and wood that might have been used by a warrior during the Stone Age. Another, Memoirs of a Cobbler, has tools used by a cobbler. And a long knife is the subject of From the Royal Kitchen. \nBorn in Wadwan, a remote village in Kashmir, Tiku, a Kashmiri pandit, dwells on the realities of the present times through these works. Recipient of the National Award for sculpture and a Padma Shri awardee, Tiku says, \u201cIt is as if I have picked things from a museum. The objects belong to the past but exist in the present. It is symbolically a representation of continuity of time.\u201d He adds, \u201cOver a period of time, as a community, especially our Kashmiri community, we have been moved from place to place. Everything of ours is kept in boxes because we are on the move. We have become nomads. It has happened to many other communities; look at Syria, Lebanon or South Africa. There are several people migrating from one place to another, always trying to find peace and a home where they can just relax. This phenomenon has taken over human existence.\u201d \nForced to leave his house in Kashmir years ago, when he was 30, Tiku\u2019s longing for his childhood abode is visible in CT Scan \u2014 Head/Diagnosis: Desire for a Home, a sculptural depiction of the insides of the head in 3D format, depicting a CT scan of the head. Moon washed Bridge and the Mystery Lake, made of marble, gold glided wood and mirror, showcases the mystique and mysteriousness of a lake as visible under a moonlit sky. It serves as a reminder of fairy tales or stories that were narrated to us when we were children. \u201cLater, one remembers those tales with a lot of passion and love. As a sculptor, I try to find an expression for those tales that take you back in time. For example, Arabian Nights are a whole bunch of stories coming out of another story,\u201d says Tiku, 60. \nAmong the 20 works, including sculptures and drawings, is the installation Iris Inside (2010), where one can see the petals of the Iris flower, commonly found on the graves in Kashmir, mushrooming beside a flat platform made of bronze. \u201cThey blossom in graveyards and erupt wherever there are cracks. In fact all of us have an Iris inside us. The moment there is a crack, they blossom. Symbolically, it indicates hope. The idea is that we have goodness inside all of us and it must find a way to come out,\u201d he says.

Almost two years after his retrospective at the Indira Gandhi National Center for the Arts in Delhi, Gujral is exhibiting a 8.5-ft tall sculpture on the lawns of Bikaner House in Delhi for three months. Cast in bronze, Trinity brings together the pantheon of Hindu gods, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. \nWith Trinity, you have once again turned to Indian mythology, which has been a recurring theme in your work. \nThis work brings together Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver and Shiva the destroyer. Good art does not begin with an idea, it is driven by a creative force. Every artist gives a new form to mythology. There is no need to intellectualise art. \nHow important is it to take art to the people through public works? \nI have always been an ardent proponent of public art. A painting can only reach an individual, it cannot reach the public at large. Earlier, we had art in temples and people had access to it but times have changed, art has become a gallery business. I played a role in persuading Jawaharlal Nehru to make a rule that two per cent of the cost incurred towards making a public building should be allotted for art. That rule is still there, but I don\u2019t know if it is followed. \nI believe it was public art being produced in Mexico that also influenced your decision to apply for a scholarship to study art in the country (in 1952). I was in Shimla when a friend told me that I should go to Mexico, where people were painting the misery of the revolution. Around that time, the Mexican embassy announced a scholarship. I did not even know where Mexico was then. When I told my brother Inder (IK Gujral) that I wanted to apply, he said \u2018I was living in a fool\u2019s paradise\u2019. He said everything that was required, I did not have \u2014 I could not hear, did not speak fluent English. But after a few days, he said there was no harm applying. During the interview, he asked me to talk only to the Mexican cultural attache and ignore the others, and that\u2019s what I did. In Mexico, I apprenticed with artists such as Diego Rivera and David Siqueiros, and was friends with Frida Kahlo. \nYou also fell in love on the ship to Mexico. \nTwo days before I was leaving for Mexico, Inder typed out four pages of dos and don\u2019ts. When I fell in love on the ship, I wrote a letter to Inder saying I wanted to marry the girl. He wrote back saying romances that develop on a ship don\u2019t last the voyage. He was correct. Trinity by Satish Gujral (Express Archive) \nYou have also designed buildings, including the Belgian embassy in Delhi and Goa University. Do you think architecture too is public art? \nWhen I felt I had said what I wanted to through one medium, I shifted to another. With architecture, I followed my own style. Many people thought I was foolish to drop a successful career in painting and go for architecture. Diplomats from Belgium had come to India and wanted me to design their embassy in a way that it represented Indian tradition but was also modern. I designed it in 1984. After that, I designed various other buildings, including the summer palace in Riyadh and the UNESCO building in Delhi. \nWhat do you think about the recent demolition of Hall of Nations, designed by architect Raj Rewal, who also designed your house in Delhi? \nPublic art is always in danger of getting destroyed with the change in geography. I had done my best mural for The Oberoi hotel, when it was built, but later the hotel changed and the mural was removed. I am very sorry for Raj. It was unfair to have done this to a building. \nYou are also interested in music and Urdu poetry. How has that influenced your art? \nAs a young boy, I remember accompanying my brother (Inder) for a poetry reading session where he asked Ali Sardar Jafri (Urdu writer and poet) to advise me on poetry. Listening to the first verse I had penned, he advised me not to write poems and I followed his advice. But poetry has not just influenced my art, it has been an integral part of my life. I lost my hearing when I was eight. I was bedridden and Urdu was the only language I had learnt to read till then, so my father got me every possibly Urdu book to read. At eight, I had read Ghalib, Iqbal, writings meant for 20 year olds. Poetry became for me what is music for you. \nWhat do you think about the current debate on nationalism? \nTo me nationalism means working on what I consider is best for the nation. It does not mean believing in any \u2018ism\u2019. Today\u2019s nationalism is not in the interest of the nation, but in the interest of different ideas.

The report also tells about product types and applications mentioned in Professional Service Mobile Robots Market in addition to a SWOT analysis of the manufacturers. \nAsk and Get PDF Sample of Professional Service Mobile Robots Market Report at: https://www.marketreportsworld.com/enquiry/request-sample/10440216 \nProfessional Service Mobile Robots Market Trends Gaining Momentum: The latest trend gaining momentum in the market is increasing potential of telepresence robots. Telemedicine is a division of medical practice, in which the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of a patient by doctors are performed remotely. Physicians who are located offsite instruct medical technicians to examine and treat patients in real-time, via telepresence solutions. \nDrivers of Professional Service Mobile Robots Market: According to the report, one of the major drivers for this market is changes in global labor force. Rapid industrialization in developed and emerging economies has led to the increased demand for labor, resulting in a hike in the average labor cost and less availability of skilled workers in sectors such as healthcare, logistics, agriculture, and mining. By 2050, the global working age population is expected to decrease significantly, especially in countries such as China and Japan. This fear has triggered increased adoption of automation and robotics, thereby requiring less manual labor to oversee the entire operation. \nFor more Details of Global Professional Service Mobile Robots Market Report visit: https://www.marketreportsworld.com/10440216 \nGrowth Restraints of Professional Service Mobile Robots Market: Further, the report states that one of the major factors hindering the growth of this market is high cost of deployment. As professional service mobile robots involve the use of sensors, software, and advanced technologies, their prices are considerably high and require a large initial one-time payment.

The 3D printing process, also known as additive manufacturing, involves synthesizing successive layers of materials with the support of computerized control technology or computer-aided design (CAD) to produce an object or component. This process permits producers to manufacture small and micro-components of almost any shape or size. It also allows manufacturers to reduce the overall weight of the components such as those of an aircraft engine. This advanced printing method allows cost-efficient and just-in-time production of parts and components while permitting quick design and rapid alteration of internal features of the components, which would not be possible with traditional manufacturing methods. \nDrivers of Commercial Aircraft Gas Turbine Engine Market: According to the report, one of the major drivers for this market is advances in existing gas turbine engine technology. The primary intent of aircraft operators/airlines is to ensure an operational engine that can reflect increased fuel efficiency while lowering the overall cost incurred during operation or maintenance. For the airlines, the maintenance and overhauling of aero-engine parts and components incur significant costs, and this will have a significant impact on the operational costs. Therefore, emphasis has been laid on choosing advanced materials that can help extend the durability and service life of an operational engine while ensuring efficient performance. \nFor more Details of Global Commercial Aircraft Gas Turbine Engine Market Report visit: https://www.marketreportsworld.com/10440218 \nGrowth Restraints of Commercial Aircraft Gas Turbine Engine Market: Further, the report states that one of the major factors hindering the growth of this market is high cost of material.

Putin is seeking a fourth term in office which would extend his tenure into 2024. \nOther contenders for the presidency will likely include familiar political figures from the pro-Kremlin Communist Party and the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party, as well as new faces such as the former reality TV star Ksenia Sobchak and the business-oriented Party of Growth leader Boris Titov. \nAnti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny, another contender, has headed a series of campaign events across Russian this year despite a fraud conviction which bars him from running \nIt appears they will now be challenged by Alisa\u2019s progressive promise to bring \"the political system of the future, built exclusively on rational decisions made on the basis of clear algorithms,\u201d the Lenta news website reported .

I would have to initially propose a counter question: Preferred by whom?\nA timing belt would NEVER be preferred by a gear head or an enthusiast. They are, however, extremely common on automobile engines. Why?\nThis is a typical engine timing belt (pic 1)\nCompare this to a timing chain (pic 2)\nOr a timing gear system (pic 3)\nThe timing belt has TWO advantages over the other systems. 1) IT IS CHEAPER\u2026A LOT CHEAPER, TO MANUFACTURE. 2) In operation it runs more quietly than either a chain drive system or especially a gear drive system. It is, after all, nothing more than a glorified toothed V-belt, not an assembled or machined part. Timing belts are really cheap to make.\nTheir cheapness is, of course, the primary reason why manufacturers choose to design timing belt systems into engines, especially those engines used in cars sold at the bottom low-priced end of the market. In that segment, price sells, and the usual customer in that market does not know, or care, what sort of an engine is located under the hood, and would not have any idea what you were talking about when you mentioned either timing belts or timing chains.\nMoreover, an unpaid for advantage of timing belts, that they run quietly, can enhance the perception of, and salability of, a timing belt equipped car,\nespecially to the customer who knows nothing about engines. Controlling NVH (Noise, Harshness, and Vibration) takes engineering skill and is expensive. Thus, we have come to associate quiet engines with high quality. If a manufacturer is able to obtain that sound of quality with a cheap part, he is able to trick the uninformed customer into thinking that the car is built to higher standards than is in fact the case. For the manufacturer, what is not to like?\nBut, as I said, no gear head or enthusiast likes timing belts? Why?\nLet me give you a bunch of reasons: Timing belts break. They are rubber and fiber parts that deteriorate, especially in the presence of oil and fuel and heat. And guess what you find in an engine compartment\u2026oil and fuel and heat. Moreover, when they do break, if you have an interference engine, something like this happens.\nThe engine can be damaged so catastrophically that repair is not financially reasonable. You will have to buy a new engine.\nTiming belts are cheap to make but expensive to own. Because all timing belts will eventually fail, and that failure can lead to catastrophic engine damage, they have to be periodically replaced. The recommended replacement schedule for timing belts is generally 60k to 100K miles and five to seven years. And the service needed to replace a timing belt is very expensive . That is not because the belt is expensive. It is a cheap part. However, the number of components the mechanic has to remove just to get at the timing belt requires a lot of expensive labor hours.\nThese are just SOME of the parts surrounding the timing belt. Many of them are hard to access because of the position of the engine in the car.\nBut timing chains and gears break too, right?\nIn all my years of of building high performance engines I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ONE TIMING CHAIN OR TIMING GEAR FAILURE. Although it is possible, if an owner has really abused a car and has driven it way beyond its expected lifespan, timing chain and gear failures are very uncommon. Every one of which I am aware was caused, not by a failure of the timing chain, but rather because of another cheap part installed on a low end engine by a manufacturer.\nSome manufactures chose to use fiber timing gears such as these.\nThis one is from a Ford T, but fiber timing gears were installed through the 1970\u2019s and probably later. They were chosen because they ran more quietly than machined metal gears. But they did deteriorate. And when they did they would chew off their own teeth.\nThe only other timing chain failures of which I am aware were caused by the use of plastic chain guides in an engine that when worn could cause problems. The design was changed and all of those engines had those guides replaced with machined metal parts.\nChains can stretch, and if the chain guides or tensioners are absent or worn there can be problems. But an advantage chains have over belts is that you will be forewarned of a possible chain failure before damage occurs. Belts can fail abruptly and without warning, long before the engine is anywhere near the end of its service life. And that belt failure can cause catastrophic damage. Every mechanic recognizes the distinctive sound made by a loose chain. If you have your car properly serviced, he will recognize that sound and warn you so that you can have the car serviced before damage occurs.\nThe best engines employ gear drives or gear and chain drives for the camshafts.\nAs for the greater noise made by chain and gear drives? For a gear head the sound made by the gear drives of a Ferrari is heavenly!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [],

But Mutko said that the interests of Russia\u2019s athletes were his top concern. \n\u201cI do not want to evaluate the decision of the IOC concerning me personally,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThis is not the time to be thinking about myself.\u201d shares", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mutko", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "yury nagornykh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergey fadeichev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vitaly mutko", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "international olympic committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ioc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:29.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d13d08bfa0ce626981b43d5ad3e07bcb311a6aac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pQETbuf.BAu.K8fgS5hBKZFEmF6laCjKS", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/ic/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/ic/ - Artwork/Critique - 4chan", "title": "Improvement thread", "title_full": "/ic/ - Improvement thread - Artwork/Critique - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T05:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d37c401e15f53c05a0e81bbbec845b11896914f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pQETbuf.BAu.K8fgS5hBKZAOQGt0yZW4JvhmRcueS8Xs-", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>3219269\n>I love how 4chan uses \"meme\" to avoid \"challenge\"\nIt's more about wanting to call everything a meme because it's the cool and hip word to use.
