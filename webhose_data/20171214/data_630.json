Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. That brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight. \nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" faces a chorus of calls to step aside, and Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign. \n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\" \nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed. \n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" \nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" \nLate in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. \nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. \nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" \nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\" \nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable. \nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\" \nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker. \nWhile Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe. \nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" - women who have come forward on sexual harassment. \nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations. \nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them. \nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. \nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003. \nFranken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations. \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Juliet Linderman in Washington and Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama, contributed to this report.

Initial studies should be completed by the end of the year, the San Diego-based company said. \nScientific understanding of the role that bile acids play as signaling molecules have resulted in a number of new drug targets in recent years for treating chronic liver disease. While Metacrine says MET409 targets a bile acid receptor known as FXR, the company describes its lead drug candidate as a non-bile acid FXR agonist. \nAccording to Metacrine, FXR is a key target in hepatobiliary diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). \nIn the company\u2019s statement, Metacrine CEO Ken Song said, \u201cWe believe FXR is a compelling NASH target and that our program addresses the gaps in delivering a best-in-class molecule.\u201d \nMetacrine said the Series B financing also will be used to fund efforts to discover new drugs that target liver inflammation and fibrosis. The company also has been developing a first-in-class insulin sensitizer in collaboration with Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO ). \nThe new round brings total funding for Metacrine to roughly $60 million, according to today\u2019s statement. Previous investors joining the round include Arch Venture Partners, Polaris Partners, venBio, and Alexandria Venture Investments, according to a statement from the company. \nAs part of the financing, Carol Gallagher, an NEA partner (and San Diego Xconomist), will join Metacrine\u2019s board of directors.

From June through September of 1692, nineteen men and women, all having been convicted of witchcraft, were carted to Gallows Hill, a barren slope near Salem Village, for hanging. Another man of over eighty years was pressed to death under heavy stones for refusing to submit to a trial on witchcraft charges. Hundreds of others faced accusations of witchcraft. Dozens languished in jail for months without trials. Then, almost as soon as it had begun, the hysteria that swept through Puritan Massachusetts ended. Why did this travesty of justice occur? Why did it occur in Salem? Nothing about this tragedy was inevitable. Only an unfortunate combination of an ongoing frontier war, economic conditions, congregational strife, teenage boredom, and personal jealousies can account for the spiraling accusations, trials, and executions that occurred in the spring and summer of 1692.

U.S. health of... \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

But I came back a completely different person.  \nI\u2019m wounded, scarred, and nothing more than an empty shell. I\u2019ve lost my ability to open up to those closest to me. Why? Because no one understands. No one knows the hell I\u2019ve been through. Every time I close my eyes the nightmares are there, waiting, lurking in the shadows, ready to torment me further. My only escape is the sting of alcohol, the burn that numbs my pain. Everyone sees it as a weakness, calls it a coping mechanism. I call it survival. I\u2019m a lost cause\u2026until I meet him\u2014a Boston cop with demons of his own, who knows what it\u2019s like to be haunted by his past. He understands my pain, knows all about the nightmares, and makes me feel less\u2026alone. But we are both broken, tainted by our pasts.

Her debut book Finding Love (October 2015) was published by Siren Publishing. Her following books Needing Your Love (November 2015), Found My Love (December 2015), and Fighting for Love (January 2016) were also published with Siren to finish the Learning to Love series. Her desire to see her books on shelves led to her next work Chasing Dreams (April 2015), now Club Thrive 1: Compulsion. She submitted it for publication with Limitless Publishing and was thrilled that it was quickly accepted. Excited to reach that goal, she moved on to the next series she had in mind and wrote Saved By a Soldier (June 2016), My Broken Soldier (July 2016), Forever My Soldier (August 2016), and A Soldier for Bella (September 2016). She continued writing adding the Once Broken series and she's added to the Club Thrive series.  \nAlison enjoyed reading as a child and found her passion for it again in 2011 when E.L. James\u2019 Fifty Shades of Grey was released. Her love of reading was re-ignited and she continued reading other books in the same genre. In the summer of 2015, she decided to give writing a try and two weeks later Finding Love was born. As soon as she finished the first book, she began writing the second book in the series. Her third book was finished by the time Finding Love had been accepted for publication. Alison discovered she has a passion for writing and has spent the last year meeting new readers and sharing the love she has for writing.  \nMarried to her own real life hero, Alison lives with her amazing family in Massachusetts where she was born and raised. She loves having her own personal inspiration right at home and when she\u2019s not writing she enjoys playing soccer, basketball, and football with her son. \nHOSTED BY: \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alison mello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alison mello title", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "e.l. james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bella", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "siren publishing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "star review", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "limitless publishing", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:01.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2137188b6369f4f15e8081794e8ff234a61bb29c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8IKYHmzr3ZBnrnaur4bf4mDIT2yJK4xfixxSau3JqhyniXjDsarZk3nPlSi7N8P2nJPHj1IXfQ49AvrjNcbYAUfL4m7n5eVxmLua6LsntScYiwsKVLG9e9ggV_SBubANqMIx9T4x0pVPORqBLLMZxQYEJgCgHYyY4-", "site_full": "www.nation.co.ke", "site": "nation.co.ke", "site_section": "http://www.nation.co.ke/-/1148/1148/-/view/asFeed/-/vtvnjq/-/index.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Daily Nation | Home", "title": "JUST BRENDA: Does watching transsexual porn make me gay?", "title_full": "JUST BRENDA: Does watching transsexual porn make me gay?", "published": "2017-12-07T10:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "KE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/4218296/medRes/1829907/-/mfwo5s/-/Gays+PIX.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1833, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 64, "comments": 0, "shares": 64}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2137188b6369f4f15e8081794e8ff234a61bb29c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8IKYHmzr3ZBnrnaur4bf4mDIT2yJK4xfixxSau3JqhyniXjDsarZk3nPlSi7N8P2nJPHj1IXfQ49AvrjNcbYAUfL4m7n5eVxmLua6LsntScYiwsKVLG9e9ggV_SBubANqMIx9T4x0pVPORqBLLMZxQYEJgCgHYyY4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "JUST BRENDA: Does watching transsexual porn make me gay?", "text": "JUST BRENDA: Does watching transsexual porn make me gay?

I'm not gay and the imagination of sex with another man actually disgusts me. \nHowever, I discovered transsexual pornography and the weird thing is, it turns me on and I jerk off to it. \nThis is why I feel conflicted because even though they have a male organ, am attracted to their femininity and in my mind, if I get a chance to have sex with a hot transsexual, I won't hesitate. \nThis brings me to my question, does that make me gay?

It is an enemy so profound and dangerous that he attacks it from the bully pulpit whenever he can. His Justice Department, headed by former Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, is trying to stop the merger that would undoubtedly benefit CNN in the long run. \nCertainly, massive mergers are no good, but Trump is not blocking the merger because of his antitrust, anti-vertical integration economic philosophy. Rather, he\u2019s blocking it because it\u2019s CNN, an extremely popular network with a fair amount of influence both at home and abroad, that is undeniably unfavorable to him. To be fair, though, the executives at CNN do try to overcompensate for this and have Trump cronies such as Corey Lewandowski and Jeffrey Lord defend him. \nTrump has never been a fan of the press, and he\u2019s been talking to \u201copen up libel laws\u201d ever since he descended down that escalator in 2016. Of course, the press has issues, and to deny that, or acknowledge it yet not call for meaningful reform, is cretinous. The press, historically, marches in step with the United States\u2019 war efforts. They tried, so desperately, to sell the Iraq war to us in the early 2000s, and they succeeded, much to the majority\u2019s chagrin. The press also demonizes people of color in its new stories. Think of the pictures even the most respectable journalists uses for their articles when a black man or woman is gunned down by the police. Think of The New York Times\u2019 profile of Michael Brown, who, though having died for no good reason and by no fault of his own, was \u201cno angel.\u201d It normalizes and humanizes white nationalists like Richard Spencer, or even outright Nazis themselves (I\u2019m talking, of course, about the glowing 1922 profile of Hitler titled \u201cHitler in Bavaria\u201d published by the Times). \nEven still, the free press is a bulwark against excessive power, against corruption and against tyranny. Not a single one of our presidents liked the press and rightfully so. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson cursed the papers. Taft could not stand the likes of the muckrakers at McClure\u2019s Magazine. Even Obama, according to his senior-most advisors, was weary of leaks getting out into the press. The point of journalism is to keep our leaders \u2014 of whatever sector \u2014 be it politics, business or media, on their toes is so that they\u2019re uncomfortable, so that they adjust their behavior because they know a ton of eyes are watching. They\u2019re supposed to hate it. The press is supposed to be an adversary \u2014 a pesky thorn in the side of the executive. \nTyranny flushes under the guise of a closed society, but topples when anyone and everyone can launch detailed inquiries into events, people, projects and things. Naturally, then, journalism brought down the oil trust in the 1910s. It exposed years of corruption and child abuse in the Catholic diocese of Boston. It forced Nixon out of office. It outed Harvey Weinstein, Louis C.K., Al Franken and Donald Trump as sexual predators. \nA free press is essential not only to the functioning of a viable and healthy democracy, but it is also a check on blatant and excessive power that is often wielded at the expense of regular people. Without it, we risk quite a dark and dangerous future \u2014 one where the president can do whatever and whenever with little to no scrutiny. \nFreedom of the press is enshrined as an amendment for a reason \u2014 it ought to be protected. And for a president who belongs to a party that bows to the Constitution, who points fingers at Second Amendment violations or freedom of religion violations, Trump should not and really cannot exclude one of the most fundamental American rights.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anna str", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nixon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louis c.k.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john adams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey lord", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas jefferson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corey lewandowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard spencer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hitler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taft", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time warner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcclure\u2019s magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "at&t", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bavaria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:02.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2851916907d25d9bc1efe01d0c704e55973f7ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrlz9UEyhRxDCpu0cWC1Vp8i0ibKTsER4qJO5AIJ7rIgS4FYsgO8v39USH4pl3nJ4qvtyLo2ocZpTFa5Li5gRW1", "site_full": "trulyregalmanners.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://trulyregalmanners.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Castles Made of Sand", "title": "Stop In The Name of Love!", "title_full": "Stop In The Name of Love!", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2851916907d25d9bc1efe01d0c704e55973f7ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrlz9UEyhRxDCpu0cWC1Vp8i0ibKTsER4qJO5AIJ7rIgS4FYsgO8v39USH4pl3nJ4qvtyLo2ocZpTFa5Li5gRW1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mark (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Stop In The Name of Love!", "text": "People are always using arcane laws to try to get a legal toehold in their crackpot cases.

This same man also claimed to have been married to Katie Couric and Celine Dion, so there's that. \n\nBut for real, there is a law that dates back to the days when women were considered property. A law known as \"alienation of affection\" allows a dumped husband in Hawaii, Illinois, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota and Utah to seek damages (namely, money) from a guy who wins the affections of his erstwhile wife. \n\nThe present case involves a man from North Carolina whose wife took off with a member of the Philadelphia Eagles football team. The man filed court papers that said that up until his wife met the athlete on a business trip, they had a perfect marriage and it all went to hell only because she met the ballplayer. \n\nSon, let me tell you something. If someone loves you completely and fully, they will love you no matter what.

You must experiment with lots of different methods, so that you can figure out what works for you. Here are a few ways to focus on weight loss.\n\nTo help you in your weight loss journey, discover how you got here. Why do you eat? When do you eat? Yes, you eat for nourishment, but why else? Before you can successfully learn new eating habits look into how you got overweight in the first place and address that.\nSneak in your much needed exercise. By sneaking in little exercises here and there, you will burn additional calories without the effort of an extra workout. For example, do calf raises or squats for two minutes while you brush your teeth or do crunches and push-ups during commercial breaks of your favorite TV show.\nTo chart your progress, take before and after pictures during the course of your diet. You can then see how much you\u2019ve lost, instead of relying on scale numbers. You can also show your progress by sharing your pictures with friends.\nA good way to help you lose weight is to try following a vegetarian diet. Highly recommended Reading and a lot of dairy products are high in fat and cholesterol. Following a vegetarian diet is a great way to live healthy and have a lot more energy for working out.\nIf you are working at weight loss but still want to enjoy the occasional treat, try this clever trade-off. Each time you decide you are going to allow yourself some higher-calorie goodies, make yourself do 30 pushups or sit-ups first. Or, go for a 15 minute walk. The added calories you burn will help to offset the extra food you are about to eat. If its too much work, just leave the junk food where it is!\nIf you work in front of a computer all day, get up regularly and walk around. Being sedentary all day is a sure way for anyone to gain extra weight. When you walk around, you are burning calories, and you might even lose that craving for a snack. All of this will add up to losing those pounds.\nLosing weight starts with a plan. Figuring out what como usar a chia para emagrecer need and want to make and sticking to it will help you stay on track. Determine what sort of foods you are going to eat and stock up. Find out where you are going to work out and how often you can fit it in your schedule. Making these and other plans related to your weight loss will be am important key to your success.\nPlan what you will eat based on your activity level for the day. If you will be participating in strenuous activities, it\u2019s OK to eat a larger meal with more calories. If your day involves sitting behind a desk, keep the meal small. This is the most effective way to ensure your body can burn off what it consumes.\nA diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats or other pure protein sources will help you feel satisfied while losing weight. By avoiding fad diets or costly, special diet foods, you can change your eating habits, become generally healthier, save money, reach your target weight, and maintain it easily.\nSpend some quality time with your friends doing something active. Not only will it encourage you to keep going if you feel tired or sweaty, but it boosts your mood and enables you to have a better time. Knock some calories out with a trip to kickboxing class instead of going to watch a movie.\nRemember that scales do lie\u201dwell, they\u2019re misleading\u201d when you\u2019re on a diet. If you\u2019re also exercising and are putting on muscle, this means you\u2019re also putting on weight, even if you are losing fat. So instead of standing on the scale, break the tape measure out of the dresser drawer.\nIf you would like to lose weight, stick to home cooked meals. Cook meals from scratch, to ensure that you\u2019re eating healthy. Fast food restaurants reuse cooking oil over and over again. Each time it is reheated, it is thickened with toxins. If you follow this one tip, you can easily see your success, within 15 days or less.\nAs the above tips suggest, losing weight is really not as difficult as many people make it out to be. All it takes to lose weight is some determination and willpower.

Because of the debate on North Korea and on states ending various types of cooperation with North Korea, we have decided to pre-publish a condensed chapter drawn from our Institute\u2019s forthcoming Peddling Peril Index (PPI). The PPI is an index that ranks 200 countries, territories, and entities according to their capabilities and demonstrated success in implementing strategic export controls, with a focus on efforts to prevent nuclear and other strategic commodity trafficking. This chapter summarizes alleged UN sanctions violations and discusses the export control and corruption challenges affecting these countries. \nOur findings indicate that in pursuing its banned or illegal activities North Korea often cooperates with or otherwise exploits countries with weak or nonexistent export and proliferation financing controls and those that suffer on average from more corruption than other countries. Although a range of remedies is needed (and recommended in this report) to fix the poor performance of many of the countries on this list and prevent other countries from doing banned business with North Korea, the creation of punitive measures is an effective means to accelerate more compliant behavior in the short term. For example, the effectiveness of international pressure can be seen in the case of Uganda, which in October expelled North Korean arms dealers after having received North Korean military cooperation for years. To that end, and in order to have an impact on North Korea\u2019s thinking regarding its destabilizing and threatening nuclear, missile, and military programs, we support Ambassador Haley\u2019s call for countries to end their non-humanitarian-essential trade with North Korea. Countries should be urged to expel North Korean military personnel and suspend any further military cooperation. Other countries should be pressed not to undertake military cooperation of any kind. Remittances from North Korean workers should be banned from going to North Korea, and countries should reduce the numbers of North Korean \u201cguest workers.\u201d The UN Security Council and major countries should accelerate the designation of individuals and entities, including banks that do business with North Korea, that violate UNSC resolutions on North Korea. Introduction \nIn its efforts to further its nuclear, missile, and conventional military programs, North Korea seeks to undermine international sanctions and the export control laws of other countries. It has long attempted to find sympathetic governments or countries with weak or nonexistent export controls that will supply these programs or be more conducive to military and commercial cooperation. North Korea also targets states that are otherwise strong enforcers of export controls and uses deceptive methods, such as front companies or actors to bypass these countries\u2019 export control laws. To better understand North Korea\u2019s strategies and methods to defeat sanctions, the Institute collected and analyzed North Korea\u2019s procurement activities as reported in United Nations Panel of Experts reports from March 2014 to September 2017. 2 A total of 49 countries were found to be complicit in various forms of violations of UNSC sanctions resolutions on North Korea. Using the Peddling Peril Index, we considered these 49 countries in terms of 1) their overall ranking in the index; and 2) the rigorousness of their export control legislation. Military-Related Sanctions Busting \nThirteen governments were found to be involved in military related cases of North Korean sanctions violations, including: Angola, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Iran, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Sri Lanka, Syria, Uganda, and the United Republic of Tanzania. Egypt is included because it reportedly received a shipment of arms from North Korea. 3 In some cases, these mostly undemocratic regimes received military training from North Korea; in others, they received or exported military related equipment to or from North Korea. This includes North Korea\u2019s alleged export of surface-to-air missiles or related equipment to at least two African countries. 4 \nThe overall scores of these 13 countries in the PPI are low. The mean for these countries is 254 points out of 1,300 total points. A sufficient strategic export control system in the PPI typically would require a score of at least 650 points. The highest scoring country received only 40 percent of all possible points (504 out of a possible 1,300). The PPI scores are shown in figure 1. \nEleven of these 13 countries have inadequate export control legislation according to the PPI\u2019s definitions (see below). Six of these countries have barely any export control legislation. This is shown in the pie chart in figure 2. \nLegislative Categories in the PPI \nIn the PPI, countries are categorized into five levels of apparent comprehensiveness of their control lists as summarized below. \nDark Green (legislation is comprehensive): Export control legislation or agreements includes controls or clauses relating to nuclear direct-use and nuclear dual-use goods, (nuclear and nuclear-dual use commodity controls such as implementation of NSG Parts 1 & 2 or their equivalent), in addition to conventional weapons. The most commonly used lists are the EU Control List and Wassenaar Arrangement list. \nLight Green (legislation is somewhat comprehensive): Export control legislation or agreements includes controls or clauses relating to nuclear direct-use goods (nuclear commodity controls such as implementation of Nuclear Suppliers Group Part 1 list or an equivalent), in addition to conventional weapons. \nYellow (legislation is deficient): These countries have comprehensive, overarching nuclear safety and security laws which place transfer controls on nuclear material and equipment. If the PPI team was unable to locate the relevant legislation, the 2016 Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) Nuclear Security Index was consulted, specifically its data on whether a country has or does not have a national legal framework for the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM). These countries are not viewed as having effective export control laws governing nuclear and nuclear-related commodities, but their existing legislation is viewed as better in a relevant export control sense than the legislation or lack of legislation in the red and orange categories. \nOrange (legislation has serious deficiencies): Export control legislation or agreements include only conventional weapons as laid out under the Arms Trade Treaty. These are not considered relevant export control legislation for the PPI. \nRed (legislation is non-existent or severely deficient): Export controls may include small arms and light weapons (SALW), and/or radioactive materials under environmental laws. These are not considered relevant export control legislation for the PPI. \nFigure 1. All 13 countries received less than 50 percent of the possible 1,300 points. Six received less than 25 percent. The mean is 254 points out of 1,300 points. \nFigure 2. Six out of the 13 countries in this category have barely any or no export control legislation (red color designation). The legislation color key described qualitatively and in brief is: Dark Green- legislation is comprehensive; Light Green- legislation is somewhat comprehensive; Yellow- legislation is deficient; Orange- legislation has serious deficiencies; and Red- legislation is non-existent or severely deficient. See text for legislative categories. \nHigh Corruption among these 13 Countries \nAlso noteworthy is that all of these 13 countries do poorly on the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) by Transparency International, which ranks 176 countries on a scale from 1 to 176, where a ranking of 176 is most corrupt. 5 The above 13 countries have an average rank of 127 in the CPI. None of them ranks above 50. All except two countries rank in the bottom half of the index, and eight out of the 13 countries rank in the bottom third. Other Alleged Sanctions Violations \nBased on the project\u2019s survey of recent UN Panel of Experts reports, a range of countries were reported as involved in other violations of North Korean UNSC sanctions, as outlined below. These alleged and proven violations were organized into three broad areas, namely non-military-related cases, imports of sanctioned goods and minerals from North Korea, and activities associated with the re-flagging of vessels and providing other assistance for shipments. In total, 44 countries, including all but five of the 13 countries with military-related violations above, were identified as involved in violations in these three other areas. Some countries had multiple violations, although the total number for each country was not tabulated. \nNineteen countries were involved in non-military related cases of sanctions violations that involved facilitating front companies, financial transactions, and other business activities. These countries include Angola, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Iran, Malaysia, Namibia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates. \nEighteen countries were involved in imports of sanctioned goods and minerals from North Korea, including: Barbados, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, El Salvador, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Syria, and Vietnam. \nTo transport these illicitly traded technologies, goods, and minerals to and from North Korea, North Korea often relies on receiving shipping assistance from other countries. Twenty countries associated with re-flagging of vessels and providing other assistance for shipments include: Brazil, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Fiji, Greece, Japan, Kiribati, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Palau, Panama, Peru, Russia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Tanzania, Thailand, and Togo. \nOf those countries, Cambodia, Marshall Islands, Mongolia, and Panama, are identified as Flags of Convenience (FOC) by the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation (ITF). ITF defines a Flag of Convenience as \u201cone that flies the flag of a country other than the country of ownership,\u201d leading to little oversight and much leeway to break laws and regulations. 6 Flags of Convenience have just recently been declared a national security risk by the Australian government, because \u201cthere are features of FOC registration, regulation and practice that organized crime syndicates or terrorist groups may seek to exploit.\u201d 7 \nThe UN reports surveyed by the project list other sanctions violations that are not included in this analysis because the participation of the countries appears entirely inadvertent. The following 13 countries and territories were targeted by North Korea to procure equipment with potential military applications: Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan, United States. Taking Stock \nIn total, 49 countries were identified as involved in sanctions violations in one of the four areas discussed above. Some countries had multiple violations, although the total number for each country was not tabulated. \nThese 49 countries have a mean score in the Peddling Peril Index of 458 out of 1,300 points, again a relatively low average. Figure 3 shows the PPI score distribution, where there is a maximum peak in the 300-499 point intervals. This peak reflects that many of the countries involved in sanctions violations in general lack sufficient strategic export controls. Thirty nine out of the 49 countries scored fewer than 50 percent of the overall points assigned in the PPI, a mark of less than sufficient export controls, and ten scored less than 25 percent. Moreover, it should be noted that there are many other countries that have received similar or lower PPI scores, making them potentially more vulnerable to North Korean exploitation. \nHalf of the 49 countries that were involved in violating UNSC resolutions on North Korea have poor export control legislation, and many of the countries that do have sufficient legislation have a high degree of corruption relative to their peers, as measured by the CPI. Figure 4 shows that out of 49 countries, 26 have inadequate export control legislation, categorized as red, orange, or yellow colors. \nIn total, 20 countries out of the 49 involved in violations of UNSC resolutions on North Korea have dark green color-coded export control legislation, which means their legislation is judged as comprehensive. However, many of the 20 countries listed show a higher degree of corruption on the CPI compared to other dark green countries. Their average CPI rank is 63 out of 176, with a median of 63. For all dark green countries in the PPI the average CPI rank is 54 and the median is 47. \nFigure 3. Distribution of PPI scores for the 49 countries that were involved in violating UNSC sanctions on North Korea. \nFigure 4. This pie chart shows the comprehensiveness of export control legislation of all 49 countries identified as involved in violations of UNSC sanctions resolutions on North Korea. Anything but green is considered inadequate legislation in the PPI. (This figure excludes 13 countries that were targeted by North Korea using illicit procurement schemes to procure equipment with potential military applications). Recommendations \nThe UN Security Council and major countries should accelerate the designation of individuals and entities that violate UNSC resolutions on North Korea. Countries that have engaged with North Korea in arms trade and military training should be urged to expel North Korean military personnel and suspend any further cooperation. Other countries should be discouraged from starting any such cooperation. The effectiveness of international pressure in achieving this goal can be seen in the case of Uganda, where military and police forces had received training from the North Korean army for years. Nonetheless, recently Uganda \u201cexpelled North Korean military experts and representatives of North Korean companies\u2026as African nations face growing pressure to comply with UN sanctions over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\u201d 8 The United States and Europe in particular should press every country engaged in military or sanctioned trade with North Korea to stop any such activities and deploy their own sanctions designations against those that fail to do so. \nThe UN Panel of Experts on North Korea has made a series of excellent recommendations in their reports on limiting North Korea\u2019s abuse of shipping, transshipping, and financial transactions, and better identifying entities for sanctioning. 9 One panel recommendation urges all members to implement catch-all clauses in national export controls. Given that more than 50 percent of UN member states are judged in the PPI as not having sufficient export legislation in general, and about 25 percent barely have or do not have export control laws, this recommendation needs supplementing. Especially for the countries identified in this report as having barely any or no relevant legislation, they should establish strategic export control laws that include bans on sanctioned trade with North Korea and other pariah states, as the panel also recommends. \nBased on our analysis, we offer several other targeted recommendations relevant to export control implementation: \nCountries that have violated the UNSC resolutions with respect to financing should turn to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), its regional bodies and guidelines, and specifically ask for assistance in implementing FATF recommendation 7 as laid out in its updated 2012 framework. This recommendation states: \u201cCountries should implement targeted financial sanctions to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions relating to the prevention, suppression and disruption of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and its financing. These resolutions require countries to freeze without delay the funds or other assets of, and to ensure that no funds and other assets are made available, directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of, any person or entity designated by, or under the authority of, the United Nations Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.\u201d 10 \nCountries that imported large quantities of minerals or ore or other controlled goods should increase physical inspections of incoming shipments, especially from ships under Flags of Convenience or other flags that have been used by North Korea before. \nCountries that have provided shipment assistance to North Korea should re-evaluate and, if violations exist, ban North Korea\u2019s access to their flags and registries. \nOverall, the results suggest that North Korea has often targeted countries with weak or nonexistent export and proliferation financing controls and those that suffer on average from more corruption than other countries. Although a range of remedies are needed to fix the poor performance of many of the countries identified in this report as involved in sanctions violations, the creation of punitive measures is an effective means to accelerate more compliant behavior in the short term not only in these countries but among all countries that may do business with North Korea. \n1.

\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) - One of China's biggest state-run conglomerates has sued a Venezuelan counterpart in a U.S. court in a dispute over unpaid bills, a sign of Beijing's growing impatience with its socialist South American ally as it slides into bankruptcy. \nIn the lawsuit filed Nov. 27 in a Houston federal court, a U.S. subsidiary of Sinopec sought more than $23 million in damages from Venezuela's state-run oil company, PDVSA. Sinopec alleges it never received full payment for 45,000 tons of steel rebar it agreed to sell PDVSA for $43 million and which was delivered in 2013. \nThe lawsuit, while small in size, says PDVSA through its U.S. subsidiary Bariven reneged on repeated promises to pay Sinopec, at one point costing the Chinese company $2 million in losses after it entered into arbitration with a supplier it agreed to purchase the steel from to carry out the deal. \n\"This is not simply a case of a broken promise to pay,\" Sinopec said in the court documents, accusing PDVSA of \"deceit\" and \"willful deception\" in its refusal to pay its bills. \"Rather, this case involves a complex commercial transaction specifically calculated to leave Sinopec without a remedy.\" \nThe Chinese \"usually take a more diplomatic tone\" and are clearly angry, Russ Dallen, head of local brokerage Caracas Capital, wrote in a report Wednesday in which he revealed the existence of the lawsuit. \nThe dispute comes as Venezuela is seeking fresh financing to restructure its huge foreign debt on which it is behind payment. \nChina has been one of Venezuela's biggest creditors, providing it loans, cash and investment totaling more than $65 billion between 2007 and 2016, according to a database maintained by Boston University and the Inter-American Dialogue. But it has so far failed to come to President Nicolas Maduro's rescue as he tries to shield the OPEC nation from triple-digit inflation, fast-declining oil production and financial sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. \nA spokesman for Beijing-based Sinopec Group confirmed that a U.S. subsidiary of a Sinopec trading company had launched a lawsuit against PDVSA about \"a dispute over payment owed.\" \n\"As a big company, it is normal for us to have such commercial dispute and it is normal to resort to law if there is a dispute,\" Sinopec spokesman Lu Dapeng said by phone. \nGeng Shuang, a spokesman of China's Foreign Ministry, said the issue was nothing more than a regular commercial dispute and that China remains willing to cooperate with Venezuela on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. \n\"I think this is a common commercial dispute and there is no need to make over-interpretations of it,\" Geng said. \"I want to stress that China attaches great importance to the development of China Venezuela relations.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press researchers Yu Bing and Shanshan Wang in Beijing contributed to this report.

How fast does it all go downhill though when we lose them or lock ourselves out!\n\nThe first \"keys\" can be traced back to the Egyptians, but not in the form that we would understand them. It will probably come as no great surprise that the terribly organised Romans are the ones behind the lock and key as we use them today. The first ones were a wooden pin system, but over time they evolved into the longer lasting metal form.\n\nBeyond the obvious representation of opening and closing there's quite a lot of folklore attached to this humble item. I've just picked out a few random ideas which caught my eye \n\nDon't leave your keys on the table otherwise arguments and chaos in your home will ensue [there seems to be a whole raft of things you mustn't leave on the table including shoes?!]\n\nKeys left in the bed were supposed to help women with childbirth....not great if you happen to lie on top of them though might I suggest!\n\nVery old keys were deemed to be good luck amulets...some wore them around their necks, especially the wives of sailors left behind on land.\n\nKeys in the shape of crosses cure boils and church keys cure whooping cough.\n\nIf you throw a bunch of inherited keys at a door with an eavesdropper the other side that person will become deaf for life.\n\nI meanwhile clank around like Marley's Ghost at times with keys to various properties which I clean. Each one has an identifying colour on it, but obviously no personal details! With that responsibility I keep them in a separate place from ours and am very mindful about making sure I return them there when I've finished with them.\n\nArilx\n\nThe photo was take in the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff.

Childlike and vulnerable. Rendered irrelevant by death. \nIt wasn\u2019t even the feelings\u2014the tsunami of feelings that would rush in later and blindside me. Given that I had barely seen him in years and had never been close to him to begin with, the feelings were surprisingly ferocious. \nThose things came later. They came and hit me\u2014less like the proverbial sledgehammer and more like a subtle self-combustion. Invisible to an observer. But damaging nonetheless. Suffocating me. Crushing me from the inside out. \nBut not then. Not at first. \nThe thing that struck me initially was that she had coolly snapped a picture. As though this was another moment in time to capture for posterity. More striking because what other mothers might have captured, she had never bothered with. \nFirst tooth. No snap. \nFirst step. No snap. \nFirst birthday. No snap.

I am not going to lie I still have the major travel blues and keep trying to find mini getaways to cure the travel bug... but, if anything it is only getting worse and I'm beginning to feel sorry for Andy's bank account!! \nWhilst in Sorrento one of the main things we wanted to do was a boat trip to the Island of Capri. This is basically the cutest island that has a very romantic setting and if you're lucky (and rich enough) has a never ending street of designer shops with quaint cafes and bars to quench your thirst after a major shopping trip. Despite pointing out many beautiful engagement rings, (I'm sure he'll get the hint eventually... if not it looks like I'll be marrying myself), there wasn't much in the way of designer that I actually liked nor could afford. Being a student really sucks sometimes! \nThe Boat Trip is a tour around the main sights with the option to visit the Blue Grotto for an additional fee. We didn't chose to visit the Blue Grotto as the water was extremely choppy and such a small entrance sent me into a bit of a panic! It did look rather beautiful, however being in such a small space and being bashed against the rocks wasn't particularly my idea of fun. You head under a love bridge that you have to wish for something that will come true and then kiss your partner... I don't think it works as my wish sure as fuck hasn't come true and is highly unlikely too. (Maybe wish for something achievable not impossible). \nThe journey on the way there was super choppy and I slid across the front of that boat too many times to count. It was a fun experience, but by the end I was so relieved to actually arrive at the island and warm up. The dock was a sort walk from the bus stop where you got a bus that took you to the main town. After a quick walk around the shops and some food, we headed to the beach for a swim. The beach at Capri is made up of pebbles and the water was so warm. We had a lovely swim and then headed back to the boat. The journey back was much smoother and scenic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe highly recommend  a trip just to go on the boat tour and spend time soaking up the sun on a new beach! Plus you don't have to pay to use this beach and can have an inexpensive trip out for the day.\n\nUntil Next Time Tori  xoxox ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sorrento", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tori  xoxox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "capri", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sorrento", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:04.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "75f98c2c0ecb69bcce9744c7b02d3298418b4e05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vCLDx9iTsV0Jc74gkRYWcn5bgTfImw69y6hUYc5RocIrV4Cp36ImmnLP7AeFLJQA5Y6REqAJYR7n643rHNn030Judizj9aMDADoP7vkH15zQTQsK92HSm", "site_full": "www.sfgate.com", "site": "sfgate.com", "site_section": "http://www.sfgate.com/food/", "site_categories": ["media", "social"], "section_title": "San Francisco Restaurant Reviews, Recipes, Wine &amp; Spirits - SFGate", "title": "Hall of Fame QB Warren Moon sued for sexual harassment", "title_full": "Hall of Fame QB Warren Moon sued for sexual harassment - SFGate", "published": "2017-12-07T07:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/56/45/65/12213572/7/rawImage.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 943, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "75f98c2c0ecb69bcce9744c7b02d3298418b4e05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vCLDx9iTsV0Jc74gkRYWcn5bgTfImw69y6hUYc5RocIrV4Cp36ImmnLP7AeFLJQA5Y6REqAJYR7n643rHNn030Judizj9aMDADoP7vkH15zQTQsK92HSm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sfgate.com", "published": "2017-12-07T07:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hall of Fame QB Warren Moon sued for sexual harassment", "text": "Photo: Jonathan Daniel, Staff Image 1 of / 42 42 Quarterback Warren Moon speaks during a press conference after being elected to the NFL Hall of Fame February 4, 2006 at the Renaissance Center in Detroit, Michigan.

Franklin, AP Hall of Fame quarterback Warren Moon sued for sex harassment 1 / 42 Back to Gallery Hall of Fame quarterback Warren Moon has been accused of sexual harassment in a lawsuit filed in California by a woman who worked as his assistant at his sports marketing firm.\nIn the lawsuit filed early this week in Orange County Superior Court, Wendy Haskell alleges that Moon made \"unwanted and unsolicited\" sexual advances while she worked for Sports 1 Marketing. Moon, who played parts of 17 seasons in the NFL with Houston, Minnesota, Seattle and Kansas City, is the co-founder and president of the company.\nMoon's attorney, Daniel F. Fears, issued a statement Thursday saying Moon has yet to be served with the lawsuit but is aware of the claims and denies them.\n\"Mr. Moon contends these claims are meritless, and he has every intention to vigorously defend himself in court,\" Fears said in the statement.\nThe statement also said the 61-year-old Moon had requested a leave of absence from his role as a radio commentator for the Seattle Seahawks, duties that \"will be impacted as he defends himself against these claims.\" The team said it had granted the request.\nNow Playing: Hall of Fame quarterback Warren Moon has been sued for sexual harassment from a woman who worked for his sports marketing firm, according to the Washington Post.\nMedia: Sports Illustrated According to the lawsuit, Haskell was hired as an executive assistant to Moon last summer. The lawsuit alleges that Haskell was forced to sleep in the same bed with Moon on business trips while wearing lingerie. Haskell says she complained about the arrangement, but Moon responded, \"this was the way it was.\"\nHaskell also contends she was drugged by Moon during a trip to Mexico in October. The lawsuit alleges that Moon acknowledged drugging Haskell because he thought she wasn't \"having fun.\" She also claims Moon pulled off her swimsuit during the Mexico trip.\nAdditionally, the lawsuit says Haskell was required to keep the bathroom door unlocked while she showered and Moon repeatedly entered the room.\nThe lawsuit claims that Haskell reported Moon's behavior to Sports 1 Marketing CEO David Meltzer but the company did not investigate her claims. Haskell says she was demoted after making the complaints.\nMoon threw for 49,325 yards and 291 touchdowns in the regular season and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2006. The former University of Washington star led the team to a 1978 Rose Bowl victory. He went undrafted by the NFL and led Edmonton to five Canadian Football League titles. He became one of the NFL's first successful black quarterbacks, starting his career with the Oilers in the 1984 season.\nHaskell's attorney, Diane L. Fitzgerald, told The Washington Post her client had decided to go public with the suit.\n\"She was expecting to further her career in the sports marketing industry,\" Fitzgerald told the newspaper. \"She had no idea that her job duties were going to involve that kind of perverse protocol.\"\n___\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "highlightText":

They seem to be friends, considering the legion has troops in homestead chilling. From the quest dialog, the supplies were originally intended for Homestead, but following the betrayal/attack on the fort the legion now wants to keep them. So you're choosing one over the other. And dialog around Homestead has already established that the Legion and the farmers don't see eye to eye on resource allocation.

A large faction of the legion wants Anasteria dead. They only made it a small reputation hit because you get that level of hit with the legion every time you do an Outcast faction quest, and you're allowed/encouraged to maintain both allies. Unlike the earlier exclusive choice between Necromancer/Zealot factions.

Germany's DAX gained 0.2 percent to 13,028.86. Futures augured flat opening on Wall Street. Dow futures remained unchanged while S&P futures added 0.1 percent. \nASIA'S DAY: Asia closed mixed. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5 percent to 22,498.03 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.5 percent to 5,977.70. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed earlier losses, adding 0.3 percent to 28,303.19. Most other regional benchmarks fell. The Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.7 percent to 3,272.05 and South Korea's Kospi lost 0.5 percent to 2,461.98. Stocks in Southeast Asia were mixed. \nANALYST'S VIEW: \"Asia equity investors found themselves standing in a sea of pain at yesterday's market close and are likely breathing a sigh of relief that both EU and U.S. equity investors appear a bit more level-headed for the time being,\" said Stephen Innes, head of trading at OANDA. \nTAX: The U.S. Senate voted to begin negotiation with the House to reconcile their two tax bills on Wednesday in a sign that they can iron out differences. Republican leaders are pushing to send a final blended package to President Donald Trump to sign before Christmas. \nGEOPOLITICAL ISSUES: Market reaction was muted to President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, ending decades of unwavering U.S. neutrality on the issue. In other global developments, the British and Irish prime ministers spoke, seeking to overcome a logjam in Brexit talks, but there was no sign of an imminent breakthrough. \nU.S. JOBS: A report from payroll processor ADP showed private employers added 190,000 jobs last month, slightly better than expected. The report comes two days before a government jobs report, among the last key economic indicators before the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. \nOIL: Benchmark U.S. crude recovered slightly. It added 7 cents to $56.13 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Wednesday, the contract sank $1.66 to settle at $55.96 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 29 cents to $61.51 per barrel. It lost $1.64 to $61.22 a barrel on Wednesday. \nCURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 112.66 Japanese yen from 112.27 yen while the euro weakened to $1.1790 from $1.1796.

A series of clinical photographs documents lesion progression over time. In the first case\u2014an unvaccinated young veterinary assistant\u2014a pustule was treated locally with cortisone. The lesion turned into a large ulcer accompanied by severe lymphadenitis. Based on her close contact to a sick stray cat, infection with cowpox virus was assumed and confirmed by virus isolation, PCR, and serology. The clinical course took up to eleven months until healing of the wound was complete. Transmission of cowpox virus from the cat was likely because a skin swab was PCR-positive and the cat had a high titer of anti-orthopoxvirus antibodies. In contrast, a rather mild clinical course of cowpox was confirmed in a 49-year-old male farmer vaccinated against smallpox. Only a small eschar developed, and wound closure was complete after 6 weeks.\n\nfrom #AlexandrosSfakianakis via Alexandros G.Sfakianakis on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2ksZjmP\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandros g.sfakianakis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ines eder patrick vollmar martin pfeffer philipp naether arne rodloff hermann meyer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:05.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "62efc1891be54a105f1205e22ec3fcc0bcf6659a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.kfpxMv1QnPXgRdKZVul71eXykVAG7tEqee8jgIkLZo0wA7bCvLROjwKHNtFjjs7JZ_CqTVo_rf2V4cOjTEVaFpj3z1N28U31oPnsxQFrnFalB.Xr9hL6D", "site_full": "www.wnem.com", "site": "wnem.com", "site_section": "http://wnem.com/category/162901/ap-news-center?clienttype=rss", "site_categories": ["media", "education", "entertainment"], "section_title": "WNEM Saginaw - U.S. & World - Top Story", "title": "Russian ex-minister gives final argument in corruption trial", "title_full": "Russian ex-minister gives final argument in corruption trial", "published": "2017-12-07T11:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.worldnow.com/AP/images/15576393_G.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 68251, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "62efc1891be54a105f1205e22ec3fcc0bcf6659a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.kfpxMv1QnPXgRdKZVul71eXykVAG7tEqee8jgIkLZo0wA7bCvLROjwKHNtFjjs7JZ_CqTVo_rf2V4cOjTEVaFpj3z1N28U31oPnsxQFrnFalB.Xr9hL6D", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "Russian ex-minister gives final argument in corruption trial", "text": "Russian ex-minister gives final argument in corruption trial - WNEM TV 5 Member Center: Russian ex-minister gives final argument in corruption trial Posted: Updated: (AP Photo/Ivan Sekretarev).

Durkan said at a news conference Wednesday that the deal with Los Angeles-based Oak View Group is the best path right now for Seattle to get an NHL team and bring back the SuperSonics. OVG CEO Tim Leiweke says his group will work diligently to get Seattle a team to join the WNBA's Seattle Storm at KeyArena. Under the memorandum of understanding signed Wednesday, OVG would privately finance a $600 million remodel of the aging arena. The deal includes $20 million in cash and in-kind contributions to nonprofit organizations and another $40 million for traffic improvements in the area. Durkan says the deal protects Seattle taxpayers and is a good one for the city. She added that it doesn't block the path for others possible arena projects. \n(Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

After the Israelites had rebuilt the temple and the wall, there was a great revival in the land.  As Ezra stood up and read the law of the Lord, the people wept openly and repented of their sins.  They also made a covenant with God and secured it in writing, determined they wouldn't be like their ancestors who had consistently turned away from God.\n\nThe covenant contained many elements, but to highlight a few, they swore to God that they would not intermarry with other lands that did not serve the one, true God.  They agreed that there would be no buying or selling on the Sabbath day because it was set aside to be holy.  They vowed to pay a tithe to the service of the house of God and to offer up the firstfruits.  And the Levites and those who were selected to serve in the house of God promised to do their part in bringing in the offering of corn, new wine, and oil. Their final words were \"We will not forsake the house of our God.\"\n\nAs you can imagine, Nehemiah was thrilled by this turn of events.  He couldn't have known when he gathered the people together to rebuild the wall that the construction project would turn into a revival of hearts and souls.  What a blessing, but I'm afraid the people weren't wholly as committed as they said.  That's the thing about revival.  True revival is real, and it changes us.  But what appears to be revival is sometimes nothing more than an emotional high that wears off once the reality of life kicks in and the warm, fuzzy feeling goes away.  Evidently, that's what happened here.\n\nIn chapter 13, Nehemiah returns to Jerusalem after being away for a while, and he is dismayed by what he finds.  The people had broken every promise they had made.  Verse 10 tells us that the tithes were not paid and the Levites had fled and forsaken the house of God.  Verses 15-16 speak of how the people were buying and selling on the Sabbath day.  Verses 23-24 talk of how the children of Israel had married with the children of Ammon and Moab, and their children couldn't even speak the Hebrew tongue.\n\nPromises are lovely but only if we keep them.  It aggravates me to the very core to hear someone make a vow they may not be able to keep, even in a movie.  \"We'll find your father.  I promise.\"  How can you promise that?  It's not within your power to make it happen.  \"I promise I'll be there for you.\"  What if you can't?  What if you're hindered in some way?  My philosophy is that we should never promise to do but to try.  \"I promise I'll try my best to...\"  And then, only if we really intend to do so.\n\nI'm not alone in this thinking.  The Bible says it's better not to make a vow at all than to make one and break it. When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? (Ecclesiastes 5:4-6)   The children of Israel would have been better off to keep their mouths shut, but instead, they made both an oral and written covenant to God that they would abide by all His laws, and then they refused to follow through on what they had promised.\n\nThe moral of the story?  Be careful with your words.  Don't promise something unless you're confident you can follow through on it.  If you're not certain, just keep quiet.  By all means, try to do good, but don't promise if it's not in your power to live up to that promise.  Otherwise, you'll end up eating those words later, and they have a nasty taste. . . just ask the children of Israel.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nehemiah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ezra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "levites", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ammon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:05.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0188ccece8577b445d26842f18fa969cbdd50fe7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qic34R6yQCoErBfpOczynFBNsBwdg6AKP2wjT7jg_jXjb0H9VY.esRVJ8_41fCNSMqxd27HYjBg--", "site_full": "www.wehrmacht-awards.com", "site": "wehrmacht-awards.com", "site_section": "http://www.wehrmacht-awards.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=42", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Living History Forum - Wehrmacht-Awards.com Militaria Forums", "title": "New ATF WSS smocks", "title_full": "New ATF WSS smocks - Wehrmacht-Awards.com Militaria Forums", "published": "2017-11-06T19:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.477, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1d26d97733f771ad8f04a1a74569d145a8aa3e86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qic34R6yQCoErBfpOczynFBNsBwdg6AKP2wjT7jg_jXjb0H9VY.esRVJ8_41fCNS_FNKtt4zzCCik147BYfqvQXgQlz0MJSs-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Nightwish", "published": "2017-11-30T23:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "A little late - but thanks a lot!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:05.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ef3d6bd455ea68f19c9430fa8530eac52b2cf4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvTrwrgDwWsQzCd.mpLdikttKS_m6yf.CxfwDAxqaufwW7ldhj1.HpBS15Xz42.hZ7dwkii4mR8uPVAN42oadpjyuU.WKOsayj3RUOC3fZ0QA--", "site_full": "medcancersfakianakis.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://medcancersfakianakis.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Cancer by Sfakianakis Alexandros", "title": "Current Practice in Cytoreductive Surgery and HIPEC for Metastatic Peritoneal Disease: Spanish Multicentric Survey", "title_full": "Current Practice in Cytoreductive Surgery and HIPEC for Metastatic Peritoneal Disease: Spanish Multicentric Survey", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0ef3d6bd455ea68f19c9430fa8530eac52b2cf4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvTrwrgDwWsQzCd.mpLdikttKS_m6yf.CxfwDAxqaufwW7ldhj1.HpBS15Xz42.hZ7dwkii4mR8uPVAN42oadpjyuU.WKOsayj3RUOC3fZ0QA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alexandros Sfakianakis (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Current Practice in Cytoreductive Surgery and HIPEC for Metastatic Peritoneal Disease: Spanish Multicentric Survey", "text": "Publication date: Available online 6 December 2017\nSource: European Journal of Surgical Oncology\nAuthor(s): Rafael Morales-Soriano, Neus Esteve-P\u00e9rez, Juan Jos\u00e9 Segura-Sampedro, Pedro Cascales-Campos, Pedro Barrios\nIntroductionRadical Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS) with Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC), has been proposed as the current standard of treatment for metastatic peritoneal disease by several tumors. Despite its widely utilization, there seems to be a great variability in their organization, clinical practice, and safety among centers.Aim of the studyTo obtain updated information on clinical practice in different perioperative areas of the CRS-HIPEC.Patients and MethodsAll 25 members of the Spanish Surface Peritoneal Malignancy (GECOP), were invited to answer an online survey, to describe their usual practice in different perioperative areas of the CRS-HIPEC.ResultsSurvey was responded by 100% of centers. This study represents more than 800 patients treated annually. Seventy per cent of respondents perform CRS-HIPEC for more than 5 years. The most frequent technique was Coliseum (88%). Routinely non-invasive monitoring of cardiac output is used by 92% of centers. More than 50% of centers administer oxaliplatin (74%), or mitomycin-C (65%) in colorectal cancer; cisplatin in gastric cancer (73%) and mesothelioma (74%). Ovarian cancer is treated with cisplatin and various combinations, in 64%. Spillage protocol was available in 100% centers.ConclusionsData showed an important variability in volume of patients per center, selection of cytostatic agents, professional training and safety measures applied. The standardization of CRS/HIPEC procedures based on the best available evidence, the individualization of patients and the consensus among professionals, constitute an important part of the basis that will allow us to improve results of this complex procedure.\n\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2zXYANl\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "neus esteve-p\u00e9rez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedro cascales-campos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafael morales-soriano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juan jos\u00e9 segura-sampedro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedro barrios", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "european journal of surgical oncology aut", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:05.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0188ccece8577b445d26842f18fa969cbdd50fe7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qic34R6yQCoErBfpOczynFBNsBwdg6AKP2wjT7jg_jXjb0H9VY.esRVJ8_41fCNSMqxd27HYjBg--", "site_full": "www.wehrmacht-awards.com", "site": "wehrmacht-awards.com", "site_section": "http://www.wehrmacht-awards.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=42", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Living History Forum - Wehrmacht-Awards.com Militaria Forums", "title": "New ATF WSS smocks", "title_full": "New ATF WSS smocks - Wehrmacht-Awards.com Militaria Forums", "published": "2017-11-06T19:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.477, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4c37917385222b5f286d8261773c5349ae50b6a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qic34R6yQCoErBfpOczynFBNsBwdg6AKP2wjT7jg_jXjb0H9VY.esRVJ8_41fCNS_FNKtt4zzCL5Z3zzvGX6kIMmID.jNLog-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Nightwish", "published": "2017-12-05T23:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I don't wan't to open a new thread, so I ask here...\nI am looking for a good reproduction of an oak-pattern smock with these \"pink\" color-effekt.\nAny hints!?\nThanks and best regards\nNightwish", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:05.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb1f8a7bc7177968128f12075c58444ef2042a8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED.CzgV4w9cxpAPu3bJnVKiwtNUhx3ZCC2h.1j157tVMcnUNVZw6L.lJhCqvxRsxseqNMGs.4PtowRQtQqrQASBFBYh1jh00oM0YWbZQw6ktbu.ac2s4APj2pkNLOoz8axmCg1u8dzzzjnqjbcPV7HB_o3Q_5kiaQF_T9fdWkXnfkpnPEPk1a_yb5FVhb_.s_hQnddspiHSc3w--", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Politics links", "title": "(9828814) You're not the only one who thinks it's odd that Donald Trump would be the one to help open a new Civil Rights museum in Mississippi.

TipTop Join Date: Apr 2017 Posts: 273 So I don't know what your build is using but if you are using vines and vitality/bleed I'd suggest the mythical wildblood crusher as the weapon of choice and the gear set of choice. In terms of vitality and bleed it depends on your base classes? Obviously shaman and something else? I would be going for a trickster personally because of anatomy of murder. Even though you aren't running pets if you are going heavier on the bleed you might consider primal bond for the bleed and physical damage. Depending on exactly what skills you want to use and your play style a combination of gallows, wendigo, huntress. You can decide if you want tier 3 constellations like mogdrogen and such depending on which damage type becomes your main focus. You could take twin fangs and have it attached to totem so when totem is proccing damage it will proc twin fangs. You could run briarthorn with twin fangs though I think the ADctH would then apply to the briarthorn rather than you. I have maxed vines on my phantasmal blade trickster and she clears trash like nobodies business. You bind the wendigo proc to that and for every tick of damage you have a chance to proc a separate instance of Wendigo's mark. If you could give us a better idea of what you want whether you want to go melee/caster/ranged etc then it might help us narrow down how to help you. Here is an example of what I am running up to level 68 where I will switch to two pieces of the wildblood set which I was lucky enough to have drop for me; http://www.grimtools.com/calc/0V0JzXaN Is it the best? Probably not and I switched out the silk swatch on the pants for ancient armour plate. I'm in a transition point between augments and things so the resists are a bit poor but I am also still only in elite with the character and grimtools only registers ultimate resists so keep that in mind.

Mit der Goldenen G\u00f6re werden Projekte ausgezeichnet, bei denen Kinder und Jugendliche beispielhaft an der Gestaltung ihrer Lebenswelt mitwirken. Die Goldene G\u00f6re ist mit insgesamt 12.000 Euro dotiert und der renommierteste Preis f\u00fcr Kinder- und Jugendbeteiligung in Deutschland. Die Vorhaben sollen bereits begonnen haben oder im letzten halben Jahr abgeschlossen worden sein. Die Bewerbungsfrist endet am 31. Januar 2018, die Preisverleihung findet am 11. Juni 2018 im Europa-Park in Rust statt. Mit der Goldenen G\u00f6re wirbt das Deutsche Kinderhilfswerk im Sinne der UN-Kinderrechtskonvention f\u00fcr eine st\u00e4rkere Beteiligung von Kindern und Jugendlichen an allen sie betreffenden Fragen und Belangen. Um ihre aktive Teilnahme zu sichern, stellt das Deutsche Kinderhilfswerk Kinder und Jugendliche in den Mittelpunkt des gesellschaftlichen Interesses. Nur so f\u00fchlen sie sich ernst genommen, lernen Demokratie, setzen sich f\u00fcr andere ein und werden auch als Erwachsene gemeinschaftsf\u00e4hig und engagiert sein. Priorit\u00e4t hat dabei auch, die Kinder und Jugendlichen im Rahmen der Preisverleihung f\u00fcr ihr Engagement zu w\u00fcrdigen und ihre Projekte einer breiten \u00d6ffentlichkeit vorzustellen. Die Gewinner des 1. Platzes erhalten ein Preisgeld in H\u00f6he von 5.000 Euro, der 2. Platz ist mit 3.000 Euro, der 3. Platz mit 1.500 Euro, die vierten Pl\u00e4tze mit jeweils 500 Euro dotiert. Zus\u00e4tzlich vergibt der Europa-Park den mit 1.000 Euro dotierten \"Europa-Park Junior Club Award\".\"Mit der Goldenen G\u00f6re zeichnen wir das Engagement von Kindern und Jugendlichen f\u00fcr ihre eigenen Rechte oder die Rechte anderer aus. Gleichzeitig weisen wir darauf hin, wie wichtig die Beteiligung von Kindern und Jugendlichen ist. Kinder und Jugendliche, die sich selbst als aktiv gestaltend erfahren, beteiligen sich auch als Erwachsene eher an der Gestaltung des Gemeinwesens. Mit der Beteiligung von Kindern und Jugendlichen wird somit ein wesentlicher Grundpfeiler unserer Demokratie gest\u00e4rkt\", sagt Holger Hofmann, Bundesgesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer des Deutschen Kinderhilfswerkes, zum Start der Bewerbungsphase. Die Bewerbung erfolgt online unter http://www.dkhw.de/goldenegoere. Dort sind weitere Informationen sowie Hinweise zum richtigen Ausf\u00fcllen der Bewerbung aufgef\u00fchrt. F\u00fcr die Endauswahl werden sechs Projekte durch eine Fachjury nominiert. Danach wird der Kinder- und Jugendbeirat des Deutschen Kinderhilfswerkes als Kinderjury die Preistr\u00e4ger ermitteln. Kinder und Jugendliche der nominierten Projekte f\u00fcr die Goldene G\u00f6re werden zur Preisverleihung in den Europa-Park in Rust eingeladen und erhalten w\u00e4hrend der Veranstaltung die M\u00f6glichkeit, ihr Projekt direkt auf der B\u00fchne vorzustellen. Au\u00dferdem wird von jedem Projekt ein Kurzfilm gedreht, der zur Vorstellung der Aktivit\u00e4ten dient.\u00b9", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

hatred Jed Gottlieb Thursday, December 07, 2017 Credit: AP photo England's singer Morrissey performs at the 53rd annual Vina del Mar International Song Festival in Vina del Mar, Chile, Friday Feb. 24, 2012. (AP Photo/Jorge Saenz) comments The King of the Trolls title is hard to win. Between professional Russian tweeters and amateur armies of online haters doing battle with everything from CNN to Starbucks, there is no shortage of competition. But even in this crowded field, Morrissey shines like a true champion.\nIf you haven\u2019t been following the exploits of the former Smiths\u2019 frontman, let\u2019s fill you in: Recently the singer played blame the victim while talking about the Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein scandals. Morrissey didn\u2019t side with abusers, but hinted victims encouraged them or didn\u2019t do enough to dissuade them.\n\u201cI hate rape. ... But in many cases, one looks at the circumstances and thinks that the person who is considered a victim is merely disappointed,\u201d he told Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel newspaper last month in just one of many ugly Quote: s he made during the interview.\nFor Morrissey, who canceled tonight\u2019s show at the Orpheum on little more than 24 hours notice, the comments walk him further down the road toward elitism, bigotry and the Troll King crown.\nSteven Patrick Morrissey rose to fame singing heartbreaking, thoughtful, gloriously twee songs about complex relationships. If you were an outsider in the \u201980s, he was your friend, your salvation.\nOn the quintessential Smiths single \u201cHow Soon is Now?\u201d over Johnny Marr\u2019s shimmering guitar, Morrissey crooned, \u201cI am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar/I am the son and heir of the nothing in particular.\u201d\nNo longer shy, he is now just criminally vulgar.\nIn a 2010 interview with the Guardian, he referred to the Chinese as a subspecies.\nIn 2014, he told fans there was no difference between eating animals and pedophilia.\nBefore and after these comments, Morrissey repeatedly, consistently made nasty remarks about immigrants. (Let\u2019s not forget he\u2019s disappointed his cult by canceling previous concerts or quitting mid-set scores of times.)\nOf course, Morrissey isn\u2019t all bad.\nHis contributions to pop music and work on behalf of animal rights won\u2019t soon be forgotten. But he seems to believe that his success and good deeds have earned him a lifetime pass from fans. He knows his diehards will continue to buy his records and sell out his shows, so he gleefully goes on \u2014 sorry, Morrissey has never done anything gleefully. He stodgily goes on, sowing discord and making deliberately inflammatory statements.\nC\u2019mon, nobody, not even Morrissey, really thinks the fast food industry is as evil as guy who murdered 77 people. (Yup, that\u2019s a comparison he made at a show in Warsaw in 2011.)\nNo one has to give up their copy of the Smiths\u2019 \u201cThe Queen is Dead,\u201d which is good because no true fan would. But we need to stop giving Morrissey a platform to be so awful. This means newspapers need to stop interviewing him and people need to stop going to his shows and buying his albums. Hey, the shows will probably be canceled, just like tonight\u2019s was, and anyway, his new album \u201cLow in High School\u201d and its flirting-with-fascism lyrics is no \u201cThe Queen is Dead.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jed gottlieb", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "morrissey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "harvey weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin spacey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven patrick morrissey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saenz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnny marr", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "der spiegel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "starbucks", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "warsaw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orpheum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:06.046+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4aaaf0e76d19def0d50b59d9d497e25395aa1518", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.kfpxMv1QnPXgRdKZVul71eXykVAG7tEoZPWyywfkMIMx1ZgYQ3hvkR_tBeXBU7kZWnpEOvCjqUx.6o3Zwgj49Kw3ZFE5phqI2icXd177HQNw.o4atVZHl", "site_full": "www.wnem.com", "site": "wnem.com", "site_section": "http://wnem.com/category/162901/ap-news-center?clienttype=rss", "site_categories": ["media", "education", "entertainment"], "section_title": "WNEM Saginaw - U.S. & World - Top Story", "title": "North Carolina county's ransomware recovery will take days", "title_full": "North Carolina county's ransomware recovery will take days", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.worldnow.com/AP/images/15576364_G.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 68251, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4aaaf0e76d19def0d50b59d9d497e25395aa1518", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.kfpxMv1QnPXgRdKZVul71eXykVAG7tEoZPWyywfkMIMx1ZgYQ3hvkR_tBeXBU7kZWnpEOvCjqUx.6o3Zwgj49Kw3ZFE5phqI2icXd177HQNw.o4atVZHl", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "North Carolina county's ransomware recovery will take days", "text": "North Carolina county's ransomware recovery will take days Posted: Updated: (Diedra Laird/The Charlotte Observer via AP).

Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

Your attention to detail and obvious bias does you credit. Try this, besides annoying tweets and a weird accent, what has Trump really done that was terrible? I mean truly awful? There is nothing he has done that other presidents haven't. Wall - Obama and Bush and many others put up border fencing. Travel ban - Obama and Bush put restrictions on travelers from other countries. DACA - Was never meant to be permanent, Obama even said so, democrats refused to compromise with him (like republicans refused to compromise with Obama). For all the hatred and animosity, he really has been sort of benign. Your day to day life hasn't changed one bit I imagine, you just are an angry person.

Waco Tribune Herald via AP Rod Aydelotte Baylor guard Alexis Morris reacts to a 3-point shot against Kentucky during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game, Thursday, Nov. 30, 2017, in Waco, Texas. Waco Tribune Herald via AP Rod Aydelotte No. 9 Baylor wins 90-63 over No. 20 Kentucky with 0-fer 3rd The Associated Press December 07, 2017 04:33 AM UPDATED 3 MINUTES AGO WACO, Texas \nWith the size and skill No. 9 Baylor has in the post, anything it gets from the outside is a bonus. \nWhen its guards are making nearly everything they put up from the outside, there isn't much opponents can do. \nKristy Wallace scored 15 of her 20 points in the first half and the Lady Bears held No. 20 Kentucky without a field goal in the third quarter on way to a 90-63 victory Thursday night in the Big 12/SEC Challenge. \nThe Lady Bears outscored the Wildcats 23-6 in that decisive quarter, with Kentucky (6-1) missing all 13 of its shots from the floor while losing for the first time.

SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"We haven't played quarters for but a few years, but that's pretty impressive to defend a whole quarter and hold them to zero field goals,\" Baylor coach Kim Mulkey said. \"That's impressive. We'll watch film, and those kids that were on the floor and contributed to that will be acknowledged.\" \nWallace led six players in double figures for Lady Bears (6-1), who shot 54 percent (35 for 65) from the floor and 53 percent (9 for 17) on 3-pointers. The senior guard had plenty of help in the backcourt, with Alexis Morris scoring 15 points and Juicy Landrum 14. Landrum made all four of her 3-point tries. \nMaci Morris had a game-high 22 points for Kentucky, which had four players in double figures and made 11 of 19 3-pointers (58 percent). But the Wildcats shot only 32 percent overall after making only 8 for 40 inside the arc. \n\"The snowball just got too big rolling down the hill. We couldn't stop it,\" Kentucky coach Matt Mitchell said. \"We're going to have a very good team. We weren't ready to beat Baylor tonight. But my spirits are buoyed because of the way the players show up every day and work and what they're capable of doing.\" \nBaylor was up only 25-21 in the second quarter when Maci Morris was called for a flagrant foul on Wallace's drive to the basket. Wallace made the two free throws, Alexis Morris added a layup to make it a four-point trip and start a 12-2 run. \n\"I thought when the girl went to swat (Wallace's shot), she gave one of those windmill swats and hit Kristy in the head,\" Mulkey said. \"I don't think she intentionally meant to do that, but when you have the intention or not, if you come across the head that hard, it can be upgraded. He did go, I'll give him credit for that.\" \nKentucky was back within seven before Landrum made two 3s and Wallace added one from long range in a 67-second span just before halftime for a 50-34 lead. \nJaida Roper added 12 points for Kentucky, while Taylor Murray and Makenzie Cann had 10 each. \n\"I think as the score started to separate, we - like a lot of teams do - panicked trying to get it all back quickly,\" Mitchell said. \"But, that's all the things you learn from that. We just defensively aren't sophisticated enough to try to take something away.\" \nBIG PICTURE \nKentucky: This was the Wildcats' first Top 25 test of the season, and they showed how far they have to go. The lane was closed off nearly the entire night by Baylor's height inside, so the offense all but dried up at times when they were missing shots and unable to get to the foul line. \nBaylor: With the way the Lady Bears shot from the outside, that meant Kentucky couldn't gang up on them inside. Baylor took advantage with a 46-12 advantage in the paint, with Kalani Brown, Lauren Cox and Dekeiya Cohen all scoring in double figures. Brown and Cox both had 13 points, while Cohen had 10 points with nine rebounds. \nPOLL IMPLICATION \nKentucky: Usually losing on the road against a top-10 team doesn't cause much of a fall, but the margin of the defeat is glaring. The Wildcats have plenty of meat on the nonconferce schedule, including home games against No. 4 Louisville, No. 24 California and No. 12 Tennessee. \nBaylor: A win Sunday against No. 16 Stanford would all but guarantee a move up, especially after No. 8 Ohio State's loss to No. 14 Duke on Thursday night. \nUP NEXT \nKentucky will return home for a two-game stretch, beginning with Tennessee Tech on Sunday. \nBaylor will play its second straight ranked opponent Sunday when it hosts No. 16 Stanford.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexis morris", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cohen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "makenzie cann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "landrum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kalani brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lauren cox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim mulkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaida roper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mulkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dekeiya cohen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristy wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taylor murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maci morris", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "3rd south park magazine baylor", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "baylor", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ncaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waco tribune herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap rod aydelotte baylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap rod aydelotte no.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wildcats", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee tech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cox", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:07.062+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb1f8a7bc7177968128f12075c58444ef2042a8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED.CzgV4w9cxpAPu3bJnVKiwtNUhx3ZCC2h.1j157tVMcnUNVZw6L.lJhCqvxRsxseqNMGs.4PtowRQtQqrQASBFBYh1jh00oM0YWbZQw6ktbu.ac2s4APj2pkNLOoz8axmCg1u8dzzzjnqjbcPV7HB_o3Q_5kiaQF_T9fdWkXnfkpnPEPk1a_yb5FVhb_.s_hQnddspiHSc3w--", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Politics links", "title": "(9828814) You're not the only one who thinks it's odd that Donald Trump would be the one to help open a new Civil Rights museum in Mississippi.
