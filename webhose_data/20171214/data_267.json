These measures have been envisaged in the National Health Policy, 2017 and need urgent and earnest implementation \nSteps to improving quality of care There must be an emphasis on the benefit and safety of tests and treatment It must be ensured that satisfaction levels of patients, families, care providers in the nature of institutional processes as well as human interactions are met This requires ensuring conformity to accepted scientific and ethical standards The Clinical Establishments Act is a good beginning, in moving health-care facilities towards registration, ensuring compliance with essential standards of equipment and performance, adopting standard management guidelines, grievance redress mechanisms, and respecting encoded patient rights \nManaging cost High out-of-pocket spending on health care leads to unacceptable levels of impoverishment Both private insurance and employer provided insurance can cover only small population segments Government-funded social insurance schemes do not provide financial protection as they cover only part of the hospitalisation cost and none of the expenses of prolonged outpatient care which forms a higher percentage of out-of-pocket spending The solution lies in doubling the level of public financing to at least 2.5% of GDP by 2019, rather than 2025, as proposed in the National Health Policy Also by pooling tax funding, all Central and State insurance schemes and employer-provided health insurance into a \u201csingle payer system\u201d It can be managed by an empowered autonomous authority which purchases services from a strengthened public sector and, as necessary, from empanelled private health-care providers \nUniversal Health Care is solution The UHC provides the framework in which all three elements can be integrated It is now also enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goals", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "universal health care", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:51.054+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d1044baae36f7eaff297878f42592b2457346b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_h8_u0E_dTBi_EyuROJGSDSp8NrEsrhb7VB3nYjY.ubF3nht5IsCnStt9023PwzVY-", "site_full": "www.golfmk7.com", "site": "golfmk7.com", "site_section": "http://www.golfmk7.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=28", "site_categories": ["vehicles", "auto_parts", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "GTI Engine / Drivetrain / Exhaust / Tunes - GOLFMK7 - VW GTI MKVII Forum / VW Golf R Forum / VW Golf MKVII Forum", "title": "Engine blowing from APR Stage 1?", "title_full": "Engine blowing from APR Stage 1? - GOLFMK7 - VW GTI MKVII Forum / VW Golf R Forum / VW Golf MKVII Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T02:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 84272, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f8ff433e3b9201df54b61754d46e82ebeb6715bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_h8_u0E_dTBi_EyuROJGSDSp8NrEsrhb7VB3nYjY.ubF3nht5IsCnSq4tVeT8LA41BIlIRFj6nfA--", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Twist", "published": "2017-12-07T04:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Unicorn 15 build date with 30k miles tuned.

Del Potro d. Thiem, US Open, Round of 16 - 4 September 2017 ( Match Stats ) \nJuan Martin del Potro appeared far closer to a plane ride back to Argentina than he did to a spot in the quarter-finals in Flushing Meadows when he faced the up-and-coming sixth seed, Dominic Thiem, on Grandstand in the fourth round at the US Open. \nThiem dominated the first two sets in just over an hour, and it seemed a lethargic Del Potro was wilting away \u2014 and quickly \u2014 due to a flu-like illness. There was no second wind in sight for the \u2018Tower of Tandil\u2019. \nA thrilling 1-6, 2-6, 6-1, 7-6(1), 6-4 victory to set up a rematch of the 2009 US Open final against third-seeded Roger Federer seemed completely unrealistic. But that is exactly what the New York crowd got. ( Read Match Report ) \nThiem played a sloppy second game in the third set out of nowhere to concede a break, allowing the raucous crowd into the match and shifting its momentum. \n\u201cI saw the crowd waiting for more tennis, waiting for my good forehands, good serves. I took all that energy to change in a good way and think about fighting and not retiring,\u201d Del Potro said. \u201cI started to enjoy little bit more about the fans. I think I did everything well after the third set. The crowd enjoyed with me all points. It was [an] unbelievable atmosphere.\u201d \nAll around him, the same cry rang through the air. \n\u201cOle! Ole Ole Ole! Delpo! Delpo!\u201d \nIt was as if the fans chanting acted as a resurrection song for the 2009 US Open champion. All of a sudden, the shotmaking Thiem was getting caught far behind the baseline as if he were playing on his favoured clay. On the other side of the net, Del Potro was tap-dancing around his backhand to instead push Thiem around with monstrous forehands. \n\u201cI knew that it's not going to go all the way like this because if he felt really bad, he would have retired for sure,\u201d Thiem said of his mindset after the easy start to the match. \u201cI knew that I have to maintain my level. Of course, the third set was bad. I mean, I played some really bad minutes. It was a great match I think, sets four and set five.\u201d \nThe fourth set was especially entertaining. Del Potro broke, but Thiem won four games in a row to surge to a 5-2 lead, and he would serve for the match at 5-3. But after failing to convert on a 30/0 advantage in the game, Thiem sailed a sitting forehand well long to hand the break back. And from there, the match only got crazier. \nThe Austrian somehow halted the momentum to earn two match points on Del Potro\u2019s serve at 6-5. But two aces quickly saw off the opportunity, and Thiem would never recover. \nAfter a one-sided tie-break for Del Potro, the first nine games in the fifth set went to the server. But facing his second match point, Thiem double-faulted to lose one of the matches of the year. \nIn the next round, Del Potro would shock Federer and advance to the semi-finals, denying the first Federer-Rafael Nadal match at the US Open and keeping the Swiss from having a shot at leaving New York with the No. 1 Emirates ATP Ranking. \n\u201cI played one of the epic matches of my career here in the US Open,\u201d Del Potro said. \u201cI'm so glad to go through.\u201d \n1. Federer d. Nadal, Australian Open, Final - 29 January 2017 ( Match Stats ) \nWhenever Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal meet on the tennis court, great things tend to happen. Make it a five-setter in a Grand Slam final and great is an understatement. \nBut it had been nearly six years since the longtime rivals met in a major final. And after both dealt with injuries toward the end of 2016, nobody believed they would face off in the final at Melbourne Park. \nSo when they battled their way to the championship match, that was a victory in itself. In fact, Federer, who before Melbourne had not played a tournament since 2016 Wimbledon, said after the match that he \u201cwould have been happy again to [just] be in the final\u201d. \nAnd it looked like that was as far as Federer would get when he sprayed a forehand wide to go down an immediate break in the fifth set. But he would storm back, winning the final five games to claim a 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 victory in the Grand Slam match of the year. ( Read & Watch Highlights ) \nIn the moment, it seemed highly improbable that even Federer could come back from 1-3 down in a decider against Nadal. But after Federer failed to convert on five break points in the left-hander\u2019s first three service games of the set, he finally found a way to even affairs at 3-3, Nadal barely missing an inside-out forehand wide to give the break back. \n\u201cI had the chance to keep holding serve,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cIf I hold that one, you never know. You are [then] two games, just two games away.\u201d \nBut Nadal would not win another game in the match. Federer swept the final five games to close out perhaps his unlikeliest victory ever, lifting an 18th Grand Slam trophy, which was his first win at a major against his greatest rival since the Wimbledon final in 2007. \n\u201cI told myself to play free,\u201d Federer said. \u201c I didn't want to go down just making shots, seeing forehands rain down on me from Rafa\u2026 I kept on fighting. I kept on believing, like I did all match long today, that there was a possibility I could win this match.\u201d \nAt one point between the fourth and fifth sets, Nadal won seven of nine games. And when the Spaniard gains momentum, it is usually like trying to stop a freight train that has no brakes. But Federer stepped into the court and played even more aggressively than normal, attacking with his one-handed backhand to keep Nadal from going on the offensive first. \nAnd although the victory took confirmation \u2014 Nadal challenged a Federer forehand approach shot on match point that clipped the line \u2014 the oldest Grand Slam champion (35 years, 174 days) since Ken Rosewall (1971) seemingly burst into tears of joy after claiming the win against all odds, becoming just the second player (Mats Wilander, 1982 Roland Garros) to defeat four Top 10 opponents en route to a major title. \n\u201cIt's a great draw because I'm in the draw,\u201d said Federer before the event. \nLittle did he know that a fortnight later, he would be raising the trophy after a classic match in one of tennis\u2019 most storied rivalries.

And I was getting a prescription medication that I probably shouldn't have been; I should have been more careful with and I should have communicated with the league a lot better about.\"Cushing says other players have approval from the league to take the drug he was suspended for and that he's working with the NFL to get an exemption, too.It's the second time Cushing has been suspended under the same policy after missing the first four games of 2010 after testing positive for HCG, a fertility drug that is on the league's banned substance list.After that suspension he denied taking any banned substances and said that after failing that test, he was told HCG can get in your body from injecting it or because of tumors. He then said this information led him to believe he had tumors.He was asked Monday if he hopes his explanation stops people from thinking that he was suspended for something steroid-related.\"I hope so. I hope they understand that I had an issue that I was trying to better myself with,\" he said. \"As I've gotten older there's been a lot of things that I've been worrisome about, especially with a lot of the other players that have played and retired and kind of the situations and conditions they're in. So it's one of those things that I've tried to better myself with, but should have been more careful and take full responsibility for it.\"  //abc13.com/video/embed/?pid=2413455\"   \nBrian Cushing facts Cushing won Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2009 after piling up 133 tackles and four sacks. The Associated Press' awards panel conducted a revote after his suspension and he retained the honor, but received less than half of the 39 votes he received in the initial vote.Cushing has had several major injuries in his career and played 12 games combined in 2012 and 2013 because of knee injuries and a broken leg. He missed three games last season because of a sprained knee ligament and sustained a concussion in Houston's season opener against the Jaguars this season.The Texans used a one-week roster exemption last week to assess where Cushing was at before putting him on the active roster. Coach Bill O'Brien said Wednesday he expects him to play on Sunday against San Francisco.The 30-year-old Cushing apologized for his mistake and fought back tears when asked how difficult it was for him to sit out for so long.\"(I'm) just very regretful and I felt terrible about it - just a terrible situation,\" he said. \"Any time I'm absent from here I feel like I let a lot of guys down, let a lot of fans down. And this is the No. 1 thing in the world I enjoy doing, and there's no question in my mind about that.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian cushing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cushing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill o'brien", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ktrk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston texans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaguars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:52.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f50c429d374c6cfa941d18f0a5a5a6d36194ea07", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kltitvMrFnH7H5dUHlkH4wQI53PSxl3.x0kecoJBYIg521csWALCl2yIkZDsi1KwL6G55RfiQWA00hKGS8Tq25ojNdmKHR.vaH9hieCGweLUDSyMayugT", "site_full": "www.seabreeze.com.au", "site": "seabreeze.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.seabreeze.com.au/forums/Surfing/Longboarding", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Longboarding - Surfing forums | Seabreeze, page 1", "title": "Where did you surf today? 394", "title_full": "Where did you surf today? | Surfing Forums, page 394", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 55346, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5781ef804c328d9c2e1a374030cecda12c1b78d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kltitvMrFnH7H5dUHlkH4wQI53PSxl3.x0kecoJBYIg521csWALCl2yIkZDsi1KwL6G55RfiQWA00hKGS8Tq25ojNdmKHR.vaH9hieCGweLFE7mP4kbjJjyd7yw.2cX8-", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "SP", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Select to expand Quote: smh said..

This opportunity was not available to the IOC prior to the Olympic Games Rio 2016. \nThe conclusions of the Schmid Report, on both factual and legal aspects, confirmed \u201cthe systemic manipulation of the anti-doping rules and system in Russia, through the Disappearing Positive Methodology and during the Olympic Winter Games Sochi 2014, as well as the various levels of administrative, legal and contractual responsibility, resulting from the failure to respect the respective obligations of the various entities involved\u201d. \nAs a consequence, the Schmid Commission recommended to the IOC EB: \n\"to take the appropriate measures that should be strong enough to effectively sanction the existence of a systemic manipulation of the anti-doping rules and system in Russia, as well as the legal responsibility of the various entities involved (i.e., including uniform, flag and anthem); while protecting the rights of the individual Russian clean athletes; and to take into consideration the multiple costs incurred by the two IOC DCs, in particular those linked to the investigations, the various expertise and the re-analysis of the samples of the Olympic Games.\" \nAfter discussing and approving the Schmid Report, the IOC EB took the following decision: \nTo suspend the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) with immediate effect. \nTo invite individual Russian athletes under strict conditions (see below) to the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018. These invited athletes will participate, be it in individual or team competitions, under the name \u201cOlympic Athlete from Russia (OAR)\u201d. They will compete with a uniform bearing this name and under the Olympic Flag. The Olympic Anthem will be played in any ceremony. \nNot to accredit any official from the Russian Ministry of Sport for the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018. \nTo exclude the then Minister of Sport, Mr Vitaly Mutko, and his then Deputy Minister, Mr. Yuri Nagornykh, from any participation in all future Olympic Games. \nTo withdraw Mr Dmitry Chernyshenko, the former CEO of the Organising Committee Sochi 2014, from the Coordination Commission Beijing 2022. \nTo suspend ROC President Alexander Zhukov as an IOC Member, given that his membership is linked to his position as ROC President. \nThe IOC reserves the right to take measures against and sanction other individuals implicated in the system. \nThe ROC to reimburse the costs incurred by the IOC on the investigations and to contribute to the establishment of the Independent Testing Authority (ITA) for the total sum of USD 15 million, to build the capacity and integrity of the global anti-doping system. \nThe IOC may partially or fully lift the suspension of the ROC from the commencement of the Closing Ceremony of the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018 provided these decisions are fully respected and implemented by the ROC and by the invited athletes and officials. \nThe IOC will issue operational guidelines for the implementation of these decisions. \nHow the athletes will be chosen: \nTo invite individual Russian athletes to the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018 according to the following guidelines: \nThe invitation list will be determined, at its absolute discretion, by a panel chaired by Valerie Fourneyron, Chair of the ITA. The panel will include members of the Pre-Games Testing Task Force: one appointed by WADA, one by the DFSU and one by the IOC, Dr Richard Budgett. \nThis panel will be guided in its decisions by the following principles: \nIt can only consider athletes who have qualified according to the qualification standards of their respective sport. \nAthletes must be considered clean to the satisfaction of this panel: \nAthletes must not have been disqualified or declared ineligible for any Anti-Doping Rule Violation. Athletes must have undergone all the pre-Games targeted tests recommended by the Pre-Games Testing Task Force. Athletes must have undergone any other testing requirements specified by the panel to ensure a level playing field. The IOC, at its absolute discretion, will ultimately determine the athletes to be invited from the list. \nThese invited athletes will participate, be it in individual or team competitions, in the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018 under the name \u201cOlympic Athlete from Russia (OAR)\u201d. They will compete with a uniform bearing this name and under the Olympic Flag. The Olympic Anthem will be played in any ceremony. \nThese invited athletes will enjoy the same technical and logistical support as any other Olympic athlete. \nThe panel, at its absolute discretion, will determine an invitation list for support staff and officials. \nThis panel will be guided in its decisions by the following principles: \nNo member of the leadership of the Russian Olympic Team at the Olympic Winter Games Sochi 2014 can be included on the invitation list. No coach or medical doctor whose athlete has been found to have committed an Anti-Doping Rule Violation can be included on the invitation list. All coaches and medical doctors included on the invitation list must sign a declaration to this effect. Any other requirement considered necessary to protect the integrity of the Olympic Games. \nThe IOC, at its absolute discretion, will ultimately determine the support staff and officials to be invited from the list. \nIOC President Thomas Bach said: \"This was an unprecedented attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and sport. The IOC EB, after following due process, has issued proportional sanctions for this systemic manipulation while protecting the clean athletes. This should draw a line under this damaging episode and serve as a catalyst for a more effective anti-doping system led by WADA.\" \nHe continued: \"As an athlete myself, I feel very sorry for all the clean athletes from all NOCs who are suffering from this manipulation. Working with the IOC Athletes\u2019 Commission, we will now look for opportunities to make up for the moments they have missed on the finish line or on the podium.\" Newer news items:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "richard budgett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samuel schmid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yuri nagornykh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmitry chernyshenko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander zhukov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas bach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vitaly mutko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valerie fourneyron", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ioc executive board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ioc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schmid commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "organising committee sochi 2014", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ioc athletes\u2019 commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coordination commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "independent testing authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ioc eb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dfsu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of sport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pre-games testing task force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wada", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "roc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sochi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:52.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5ee207390b320ddf0631159022879c7a392b4009", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSn_gk062VlfSAwgeMXyPBjB.iSdTANWuE85dUSPPVYudvr7sr1T2s1cHTQIqhJ6r5fXxp2QGkN3FOgbKHj_ufxIjfxbc2Bcj7MLcp_QjUwH.3ht7Ar04t5HZDKBvYdMhyjBGAWjPVGgQ--", "site_full": "www.cointalk.com", "site": "cointalk.com", "site_section": "https://www.cointalk.com/", "site_categories": ["stamps_and_coins", "hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Coin Talk", "title": "LordM December 2017 giveaway.

Never mind publishing them. \nBrady Gunson, a student at The University of Rhode Island, took that risk and gave it a shot. As a sophomore in college, Gunson\u2019s book \u201cIt\u2019s okay, we\u2019re existing\u201d was published on Nov. 14, 2017 and is currently available to be purchased through Amazon. \nGunson\u2019s book consists of personal excerpts mainly from his college experiences with snippets of his senior year of high school that are relatable to all stages of life. \n\u201cIt\u2019s about discovering yourself and other people and kind of how relationships work and kind of my experience with relationships,\u201d said Gunson. \nHe spent around a year and half writing his book and began the publishing process a little more than a month ago while keeping up with his academics and his job as a URI Tour Guide. \nGunson didn\u2019t find writing a book as a full time college student to be a hassle. Originally it all started with him writing down his thoughts without the intention of publishing them. He was basically writing in a journal. \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until a month ago I realized how much I had collected and decided to consider making it into a book,\u201d said Gunson. \nEven with having content sufficient enough to create a book, the fact that Gunson actually went ahead and did so took a large amount of courage. Gunson said that a lot of this courage came from support through his friends and family. He started out with posting some of the excerpts he had been writing, on his Instagram and Snapchat stories. As a result, he found that a lot of people responded saying that they related to Gunson and his writing. \n\u201cSeeing that other people had the same feelings, it kinda made me feel like I was little less crazy considering like what I talk about in it,\u201d said Gunson. \nGunson admitted that it was scary at first when he made a post that his book officially was published and on sale. \n\u201cIt\u2019s like a little part of me that I was showing everyone,\u201d said Gunson \u201cIt\u2019s really like my journal, my diary you know\u2026A lot of it was just being like okay, i\u2019m just going to do it.\u201d \nHis inspiration came from other works such as \u201cMilk and Honey\u201d by Rupi Kaur and poetry which his friend from home introduced him to. Reading other authors\u2019 published writing made Gunson consider that maybe he should take the leap. \n\u201cIt really started with seeing other authors who are more prominent and kinda being like, okay maybe I can try and express myself in a similar way,\u201d said Gunson. \nCurrently, Gunson is in the process of writing a second book, whether it\u2019s an expansion of his first or a new book on his own is yet to be determined. \nGunson definitely also recommends going through Amazon to anyone who has an interest of self-publishing and who wants to get their work out there for others to read. The publishing service is free and Gunson believes that if everything were to work out for a second book he would go through Amazon again.

Sally George , market development manager Singapore Airlines Johannesburg, said there were usually four Singapore Airlines and one SilkAir flight a day on the SIN-DPS route but that not all flights were operating at the moment. \u201cThe situation in Bali is changing all the time and people are not all aware of that, so loads are lighter than usual.\u201d SQ has cancelled one flight a day on December 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 14. Sally said as soon as the situation normalised the usual schedule would be reinstated. Schedule changes are posted via the GDS and affected passengers are being rerouted on to alternative flights. Agents are advised to call SQ reservations if necessary. Passengers holding tickets to DPS, issued on or before November 27 for travel up to December 11, can rebook at no cost or reroute their ticket at fare top up, if applicable. Travel must commence on or before January 31, 2018. Alternatively, passengers may be eligible for a full refund of their ticket. Refer to TI for details. SQ will continue monitoring the situation in Bali and updates will be posted on TI. This story has been updated since it was published.

The man and the office are indistinguishable. \nAs Russia\u2019s leader since New Year\u2019s Eve 1999 (he switched to prime minister from 2008-12 but was still seen as being in command) Putin clearly relishes the spotlight. Now 65, his displays of physical prowess such as bare-chested horseback riding have mostly faded away, but the hours-long annual news conferences and call-in shows testify to vigor and discipline. He still enjoys mixing it up in ice hockey games, though he once likened his skating to \u201ca cow on ice.\u201d \nFew, if any, politicians have stepped more quickly from the shadows into rapt attention at home and abroad. Before being named President Boris Yeltsin\u2019s prime minister in August 1999, he had been head of the Federal Security Service, one of the KGB\u2019s successor agencies, which inherently is not a high-visibility position. \nMany observers pegged him as a gray mediocrity, laughingly suggesting that his service with the KGB on the friendly turf of East Germany suggested he had not been very adroit as an intelligence agent. Yeltsin shuffled prime ministers at an alarming rate, and Putin might have been just the latest through the revolving door. \nBut the next month, he showed himself when commenting on the early days of the second war against Chechen rebels, saying \u201cif we capture them in the toilet then we will waste them in the outhouse.\u201d Adamant, macho, and a touch of crude language \u2014 the remark seemed to reveal the essence of Putin that was formed in his youth. \nWhen he became acting president upon Yeltsin\u2019s resignation, his language was more refined but his mien just as tough. \u201cI want to warn that any attempts to go beyond Russian law \u2026 will be decisively repressed,\u201d he said, one arm resting on a desk, resembling a loan officer dealing with a delinquent client. \nPutin was born Oct. 7, 1952, to factory-worker parents in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, a city pervaded by memories of the horrific suffering of the nearly 900-day Nazi siege in World War II. One of Putin\u2019s elder brothers died of diphtheria during the siege and the other died a few months after birth. According to \u201cFirst Person,\u201d interviews published after he became acting president, Putin and his parents lived in a dismal communal apartment with a wretched toilet down the hall. \nPutin said he responded to these rough circumstances by becoming a childhood \u201chooligan,\u201d one of the few in his school not allowed into the Communist Young Pioneers. In his early adolescence, Putin channeled his aggressive tendencies into the martial arts, a sport he practiced avidly into late middle-age. \nAs a teen, Putin aspired to join the KGB \u2014 apparently more for adventure than out of ideology \u2014 and succeeded after graduating from Leningrad University\u2019s law faculty in 1975. \nPutin worked in counterintelligence, monitored foreigners in Leningrad and in 1985 started his post in Dresden. He returned to Leningrad in 1990 and started work for the city\u2019s reformist mayor. Putin resigned from the KGB a year later, on the second day of the abortive coup attempt against Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, which was backed by the KGB. \nPutin married Lyudmila Skrebneva, an Aeroflot flight attendant who later became a university lecturer in German, in 1983. Thirty years later, the couple appeared on state TV in a faux-causal interview to announce their marriage was ending; Putin was reportedly too devoted to his job to be an attentive husband. \nDespite rumors of a dalliance with a comely female gymnastics star, Putin publicly presents himself as upright and abstemious. He is only rarely seen with a glass of vodka and almost never actually drinking. \nAlthough reports have suggested that Putin has accumulated vast wealth, he shows little taste for real ostentation outside the gilded halls of the Kremlin. His public face is an older, better-fed version of the tough teen from a bad part of town, determined to dominate.
