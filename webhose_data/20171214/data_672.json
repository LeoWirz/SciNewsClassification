He was one of the founding fathers, one of those who built this party and he is coming back home. His room was never occupied, so we have opened it for him. He will be part of this convention.

As the family attempted to notify family and friends, news of the situation was released by various media outlets. \nAerial and ground searches took place around the community of Wilber over the past week. Police presence near the location of Boswell's residence in Wilber was reported within three days of Sydney's disappearance. \nBoswell and Aubrey Trail, a 51-yr.-old male, both persons of interest in Sydney's disappearance, are in custody of the Saline County Sheriff's department on outstanding warrants.

If approved, it would represent one of the largest M&A deals this decade, and the largest in the healthcare industry. The combined entity will have revenue of more than $220 billion and an EBITDA of $18.5 billion. This vertical integration, if they can pull it off, could significantly accelerate the drive to consumer-centric care. \nWith so much at stake, Chilmark Research offers this analysis of how the CVS-Aetna merger would impact various touch-points of healthcare delivery and payment. Our key assessments: Near-term: direct combination of CVS Caremark\u2019s PBM service with Aetna will be attractive to self-insured employers as some \u201cservice\u201d costs will be eliminated. Express Scripts, the last national, independent PBM will likely benefit as payers previously aligned with CVS Caremark, see them now as a competitive threat. Longer-term: Aetna members will be incentivized to visit CVS Minute Clinics, which will disrupt traditional primary care practices. Aetna\u2019s aggressive development of high performance networks will be further accelerated with addition of CVS\u2019s Transform Care Program. Epic\u2019s Healthy Planet PHM platform will likely become the core IT nerve center for care processes and provider-payer-pharmacy convergence enablement. \nAs an IT analyst firm, we have little interest in what this deal may portend in the pharmaceutical benefits management (PBM) space (see here or here for that coverage). We are far more interested in its impact on the healthcare delivery chain (HCDC), what it means for the convergence trend we highlighted at our recent conference, as well as the supporting IT infrastructure that will enable the HCDC. \nHCDC Impact: Community Care Hubs \nWith more than 1,100 MinuteClinics, and a target of 1,500 locations, CVS is leading the move to consumer-centric, retail health in the U.S. The combined entity will have massive consumer reach and could pose a significant threat to basic primary care practices as incentives will likely be used to encourage Aetna members to use CVS Minute Clinic services. This has the potential to drive near-term disruption, and it\u2019s consistent with Aetna Chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini\u2019s desire to move care into the home and community, closer to the consumer. \nThrough the Transform Care program, CVS hopes to drive better outcomes through coordinated disease state management \u2014 an area where payers such as Aetna have clear incentives to get members to participate. The program started with diabetes and plans to address four more disease states in the next 24 months: Asthma, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and depression. \nThrough the Transform Care program, CVS hopes to drive better outcomes through coordinated disease state management\u2026However, transitioning CVS\u2019s retail stores into community health hubs is fraught with execution challenges and will require significant capital expenditure. \nBeyond its MinuteClinics, CVS has 9,600 pharmacies across the country. As most consumers interact with their pharmacists far more frequently then their doctor, having the ability to leverage pharmacists as part of an extended care team for Aetna\u2019s members could be quite powerful . In addition to assisting with chronic disease management, exposing such information as an Aetna member\u2019s care gaps to a pharmacist to encourage follow-up or even schedule an appointment can improve critical metrics under value-based care programs such as CMS\u2019s Medicare Shared Savings Program. \nIt is also important to note that Aetna has aggressively been building high-performance networks in partnership with providers. Currently, Aetna has established numerous Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) with providers across the country as well as five joint ventures , with notable providers Allina Health, Banner Health, Inova Health, Sutter Health, and Texas Health Resources. \nCritical to the success of these partnerships in value-based care models is minimizing leakage (patients going out-of-network to receive care). Often, these out-of-network visits are simply done out of convenience. Aetna now has the opportunity to leverage MinuteClinics as part of its high-performance value based networks (ACOs & JVs) incentivizing members \u2013 no co-pay if member goes to CVS MinuteClinic versus say a $50 co-pay if member goes to an out-of-network provider. This will be attractive to large self-insured employers and their employees. \nHowever, transitioning CVS\u2019s retail stores into community health hubs is fraught with execution challenges and will require significant capital expenditure. Leaders of CVS and Aetna said \u201cpilot\u201d and \u201ctest and learn\u201d throughout a joint conference call following the announcement. This may give Walgreens, Walmart, and other players an opportunity to pivot while a merged CVS-Aetna takes time to plan and execute. \nHealth IT Impact: Integrated Service Offerings \nCVS is actively deploying the Epic EHR across all MinuteClinic locations (including those in recently acquired Target pharmacy locations). This provides the IT infrastructure to broaden the scope of services provided to the consumer including facilitating hand-offs/referrals, with local IDNs (CVS has more than 40 clinical affiliations across the country). \nIn addition to using the Epic EHR across all MinuteClinics, CVS announced in October that it was also partnering with Epic to leverage the Epic population health platform, Healthy Planet. We expect that Healthy Planet will become the core platform bridging many of the core provider-payer activities that are associated with value based models of care across the HCDC. \nA combined CVS-Aetna would be well positioned to improve predictive analytics, given the addition of clinical, pharmacy, and consumer data to claims data\u2026 Here, the impact will be greatest in consumer engagement, potentially managed through the CVS Health Engagement Engine. \nA combined CVS-Aetna would be well positioned to improve predictive analytics, given the addition of clinical, pharmacy, and consumer data to claims data, and to recommend CVS\u2019s wellness or disease management programs to the most appropriate members. Here, the impact will be greatest in consumer engagement, potentially managed through the CVS Health Engagement Engine . (See Figure 1.) Figure 1. CVS Health Engagement Engine Overview. Source: CVS Health \n\nOver the years, Aetna has acquired and subsequently offered a wide breadth of software solutions and professional services focused on member engagement and provider enablement. These include ActiveHealth, Health Data Management Systems, Medicity, and iTriage. None of these have been a huge success for Aetna, and some will likely be spun off in due time. \nWhere many payers and providers struggle with engagement, CVS owns this touchpoint. About 30% of CVS customers use the retailer\u2019s text messaging platform for prescription pickup and refill; plus, customers who pick up prescriptions on a monthly basis visit CVS more often than they see their PCP. \nIn addition, CVS has partnered with three telehealth companies ( American Well , Doctor on Demand , and Teladoc ) to offer customers another venue for receiving low-acuity care. Aetna is also Teladoc\u2019s biggest client (along with a number of other insurers). This merger gives CVS an opportunity to create a new integrated services offering, since not a single health plan has a comprehensive virtual health strategy to manage care and customer engagement. \nThis integration of service offerings raises key questions, though. Who will manages these low-acuity and/or holistic interventions: CVS pharmacists, Aetna care managers, or newly hired health coaches in a reporting structure TBD? Will Aetna, in a sense, outsource member engagement to CVS? What will this mean for non-CVS customers who are covered by Aetna? How will PCPs and HCOs react to this? Will providers cut their ties with an insurer that is interested in driving utilization to a retail health or telehealth provider? \nLooking Ahead \nUnlike the failed Humana-Aetna proposed merger, the CVS-Aetna merger is expected to be granted conditional approval. A merged CVS/Aetna creates a healthcare services behemoth, with combined revenue of more than $220B and EBITDA of $18.5B, rivaled only by UnitedHealth. (See Figure 2). Figure 2. Projected Revenue Breakdowns by Operating Segment, CY2018. Source: Cowen and Company \nA challenge to UnitedHealth? The deal sets up CVS to capitalize on its longer-term vision for a UnitedHealth-like model that vertically aligns the insurer, PBM, and retail businesses, helping to drive down costs and attract consumers into its bricks-and-mortar presence. OptumRx is comparable in size to Caremark. CVS plans to ramp up its investments in retail clinics, which is similar to UnitedHealth\u2019s ramp up of its MedExpress business. \nExecution risk is high. We share CVS-Aetna management\u2019s views on the need for a more integrated and community-based healthcare approach and believe that CVS is a strategic asset with the ability to position itself as a unique player that can fill this void in the US healthcare system. \nThat said, the transformation that CVS\u2019s retail footprint will have to undergo, not to mention the capital and effort required to restructure its 9,700-plus store footprint, poses meaningful operational risk to the combined entity, as well as drag that a broad renovation project will likely bring to CVS\u2019s retail store performance over the next three years. \nCompetitors will wait and see. While UnitedHealth already operates an integrated health insurer/PBM model, the ability for CVS-Aetna to offer the direct consumer touchpoint via the retail pharmacy would be unique in the market. The only other play we may see of similar nature is a rumored Walmart acquisition of Humana, which would be similar in nature but targeted more toward Medicare Advantage members, where Humana has a strong presence. \nDisruption from Amazon is unlikely. The real game-changer would be Amazon accelerating its entrance into the market with the purchase of an existing player such as Rite Aid or Express Scripts. However, Amazon\u2019s potential entry into the pharmaceutical distribution and/or retail market has its own execution risks, thus near-term disruption unlikely. \nImpact to primary care in question. CVS\u2019s MinuteClinics offer a convenience and often a cost savings to the consumer that is unmatched by a primary care practice or local hospital ER. Yet the primary care practice often has the long-term, close, and personal relationship with a consumer/patient. It remains to be seen just how readily consumers will forgo relationships for convenience and whether or not incentives provided to Aetna members to use MinuteClinics will have a substantial impact on smaller primary care practices. The threat is certainly there \u2013 it\u2019s the magnitude that remains in question. \nThe CVS retail pharmacy front-end will change substantially, eliminating some of the retail risk by moving toward healthcare services offerings such as vision, hearing, and wellness. The PBM will be a tool to help grow the enterprise, with PBM margin being less important than when it was part of CVS alone. In the end, CVS Health will be the place for Aetna members to go to get healthy and stay healthy, with the idea that the new model will attract members into the network due to cost, convenience and better outcomes. This is what a healthcare service company is idealistically supposed to do. Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.

Instead, the sounds may have been a byproduct of something else that caused the damage, the AP reported. \nThe United States has never accused the Cuban government of perpetrating the attacks, but officials have said Cuba, as the host government, was responsible for ensuring the safety of its diplomats and their spouses. \nTillerson made clear that no matter who was behind the attacks, Cuba was to blame. \n\"What we've said to the Cubans is: small island. You've got a sophisticated security apparatus. You probably know who is doing it. You can stop it. It's as simple as that.\" \nAdding to the mystery, the Canadian Embassy has reported that some of its personnel were sickened. Canada and Cuba have long had friendlier relations than those between the United States and Cuba. \nThe U.S. government realized in January that something had happened, but months of testing were needed to identify all 24 people affected. \nIn the wake of the attacks, President Donald Trump expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from the United States, the most serious of a series of actions he has undertaken to unwind the detente between the countries undertaken by President Barack Obama. \nObama sought to end the hostility and mistrust that had characterized the countries' relationship for more than a half-century, and regarded the resumption in relations as one of his foreign policy legacies. \nThe State Department said the expulsion of the diplomats was intended to force Cuba to place its embassy in Washington, where the diplomats were stationed, on the same emergency status that the United States is now operating under in Havana after it decided to pare its staff there down to 27 people. \nForeign Minister Bruno Rodriguez of Cuba said in November that the expulsions were unwarranted and complained that the U.S. had not cooperated with the Cuban authorities in its investigation. \nIn his first response to Rodriguez, Tillerson said he would not allow officials to share private information with the Cubans or provide \"whoever is orchestrating these attacks with information that's useful to how effective they were.\" \n\"We understand the Cubans don't like the actions we've taken,\" Tillerson added. \"We don't like our diplomats being targeted.\" \nIn response to a question about plans by John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, to replace Tillerson with Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, Tillerson denied the accuracy of the reports. \n\"This is a narrative that keeps coming up every six weeks,\" Tillerson said. \"I would say that you all need to get new sources because your story keeps being wrong.\" \nMedical testing has revealed the embassy workers developed changes to the white matter tracts that let different parts of the brain communicate, several U.S. officials told the AP, describing a growing consensus held by university and government physicians researching the attacks. White matter acts like information highways between brain cells. \nDoctors still don't know how victims ended up with the white matter changes, nor how exactly those changes might relate to their symptoms. \nBut acoustic waves have never been shown to alter the brain's white matter tracts, said Elisa Konofagou, a biomedical engineering professor at Columbia University who is not involved in the government's investigation. \nInformation for this article was contributed by Gardiner Harris of The New York Times and by Josh Lederman and Lauran Neergaard of The Associated Press. \nA Section on 12/07/2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike pompeo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lauran neergaard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bruno rodriguez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gardiner harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh lederman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elisa konofagou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodriguez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democrat-gazette", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canadian embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cuba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "havana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap/virginia mayo u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:01.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "da68274b224178331a8fe34f4a31f0f3f94fb8be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeY4Qa_K8QLsHRlqg.vJiAdX6b0vNUOGTUft.MeQWgTfZE114UixWnlUJ91a5M6MKjhuu4owlAFyEczplBHd8pvwISL9X2dVcl7Wkb21DIdw--", "site_full": "www.gadgetspeak.com", "site": "gadgetspeak.com", "site_section": "https://www.gadgetspeak.com/rss.rhtm", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "GadgetSpeak - Member reviews, blogs and forums", "title": "Wileyfox\u2019s discounted Add-X phones", "title_full": "Wileyfox\u2019s discounted Add-X phones", "published": "2017-12-07T10:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "da68274b224178331a8fe34f4a31f0f3f94fb8be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeY4Qa_K8QLsHRlqg.vJiAdX6b0vNUOGTUft.MeQWgTfZE114UixWnlUJ91a5M6MKjhuu4owlAFyEczplBHd8pvwISL9X2dVcl7Wkb21DIdw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "Wileyfox\u2019s discounted Add-X phones", "text": "link to this review Wileyfox is now offering an appreciable discount on the price of smart phones in return for users accepting lockscreen advertising with its Add-X service.

The ruthless ex-military heartthrob has always avoided romantic entanglements. Women are sweet, but vengeance will be sweeter. Or so he thinks. Only one woman will do, but the vulnerable beauty is more than he bargained for\u2014sexier, wittier, and utterly irresistible. The queen of the deep freeze\u2026 \nAfter an abusive first marriage, Lyndie Scott has sworn off relationships. But still she longs for a child of her own. Turns out, the brawler who used to frighten her with only a glance is the answer to her problems. She agrees to his proposal, with a caveat: spend every night in bed with her, then walk away for good when it\u2019s time to divorce. Even if she\u2019s pregnant. A marriage of breathtaking inconvenience... \nAs the days pass too quickly and the nights heat up, Brock battles a sense of possession and obsession. Will the former commitment-phobe convince his wife they\u2019re better off together, or will she pack her bags and go? \n\nGet your copy of CAN\u2019T GET ENOUGH here!

So close to victory! \u201cI\u2019ll need to find the employees of the Hud and Son Group new jobs before I dismantle the company. There will be no collateral damage on my watch.\u201d The employees were innocent, and he wouldn\u2019t leave them in the lurch. \u201cIf I had to guess, I\u2019d say a month. Maybe two, but not likely.\u201d \nHer beautiful lips shaped the words, One month. \nHis father\u2019s will had two stipulations: Brock had to be married in order to run the business and, if he planned to continue running it, he had to remain married. \nDaddy Dearest had used the perfect bait. Miranda\u2019s downfall. He\u2019d known Brock would seethe as he imagined his mother rich, happy, and carefree. \nWhat Brock hadn\u2019t yet comprehended? Why his father cared about his relationship status at all. What made his father think a commitment would \u201cbring him out of the darkness and into the light?\u201d \nThankfully\u2014and shockingly\u2014there\u2019d been no requirements for Brock\u2019s wife. No \u201cproper\u201d pedigree. No reputation above reproach. No set family worth. The very requirements for the girls he\u2019d dated in high school. \nLittle wonder he\u2019d always gravitated toward wild, tattooed biker babes. \nLyndie was an anomaly, everything he\u2019d never wanted but now had to have. \nShe gulped. \u201cWould we live together?\u201d \n\u201cYes. For the sake of appearances, but also because your safety and peace of mind matter to me.\u201d He would be on his best behavior. Would sidestep any conversations about the terrible things he\u2019d done in the past. She would never know how much blood stained his hands. \u201cI will continue to protect you from Rick Lambert. From anyone who threatens you.\u201d \nHer shoulders rolled in. \u201cI\u2019m a magnet for crazies, aren\u2019t I?\u201d \n\u201cScottie, you\u2019re a magnet, period.\u201d \nShe drew in a deep breath, slowly released it. \u201cI\u2019m shocked to admit this, but I like the idea of having you here\u2026 which makes me not want to have you here. I can\u2019t learn to rely on you. I must rely on myself.\u201d \nCraved her independence? \u201cWhat if I promise not to ever cook your meals or clean the house or do anything gentlemanly?\u201d \nThe corners of her mouth twitched. \u201cThat would help, yes.\u201d \nCloser still! \n\u201cWe\u2019d have to sleep in separate bedrooms though. I\u2019m not going to get used to your warmth.\u201d Twin pink circles stained her cheeks. A flush of embarrassment\u2026 or pleasure? \u201cBut, uh, just to be clear,\u201d she said, and gulped, \u201cyou will want to have sex with me, yes?\u201d \nHis excitement deflated. Did she not want to have sex with him ? \u201cYes. I will. I do. I hope you\u2019ll want to have sex with me .\u201d Many times. Every night. \u201cIf you allow me into your bed, I will make your pleasure a top priority. But I will expect nothing, and I will never pressure you for something you aren\u2019t willing to give. The money will be yours whether we sleep together or not.\u201d \nHer breath hitched. Her pupils grew, black spilling over amber. Her nails dug into her knees, as if\u2026 no way. As if she had to stop herself from reaching for him. \nHe went still. She wanted him. Lyndie Scott wanted him. \nDo not pound your chest like a gorilla. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want your money, Brock.\u201d \nHeart thudding against his ribs, he opened his mouth to tell her that he\u2019d give her anything . If she wanted him to beg, he would beg. He had no pride. Not with her. \nShoulders squared, she added, \u201cI want your sperm.\u201d \nUh, what the what now? His brain short-circuited. \nGroaning, she hunched over to anchor her elbows on her knees and cover her face with her upraised hands. \n\u201cI think I misheard you,\u201d he rasped, but deep down realization had begun to click. Lyndie Scott had caught the baby fever. She might agree to marry him, but she expected a child in return. \n\n\n\n\na Rafflecopter giveaway \n\n\n\nAbout Gena Showalter: \n\n\nGena Showalter is the New York Times and USA TODAY bestselling author of the spellbinding Lords of the Underworld and Angels of the Dark series, two young adult series--Everlife and the White Rabbit Chronicles--and the highly addictive Original Heartbreakers series.

It was something Finn \u201cHandle\u201d Kaidion knew well after losing his wife. Pain was what kept him guarded against any further relationships.\n\nPain was also something Mardella \u201cDella\u201d Kent felt after losing her sister and from being dragged into the pits of hell by a madman.

Instead, having her parents turn their back on her was a new reason pain kept beating at her door.\n\nCan two people learn to trust and live free from their past sorrows?\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt\n\nHer eyes opened, and in them I saw\u2026 shit, determination for some reason. \u201cOne night.\u201d\n\nCould she mean what I thought she did?\n\nChrist, I wasn\u2019t sure I was strong enough to deny her what I thought she was asking.\n\n\u201cOne night for what?\u201d I asked, my whole body tense from those two words rolling in my head. \n\nShe straightened. I saw her hands at her sides fist, but not before I caught them trembling. \u201cI-I want control.\u201d\n\n\u201cDarlin\u2019?\u201d\n\nShe shook her head, at what I wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cWill you let me have control, of your body?\u201d \n\nAbout The Author \n\n\n\nWebsite | Facebook | Goodreads \n\nLila was born in Brisbane Australia, her step-dad was in the Army which caused them to move around a lot.

I wrote down\nCan a disabled person still have sex? Do they milk their disability? Can they take a joke when someone insults them about their disability? After I wrote these we were told to exchange our views with other people and I chose to exchange info with the person that had the disability. Some of the things that i wrote down were things that he had been asked and he agreed with the things I wrote down so this goes to show that these are serious issues and that people know of them but chose to ignore them.\nAfter we done that we were given an envelope corresponding to our labels and inside was a piece of paper which had a few sentences. On the paper was a brief bibliography of somebody with disability and what their life is like. On mine it said that a woman of 37 had spinal problem and she has to make improvements to her car so she can drive normally but she is still happy with her life.

I want to make it extra special for my new husband. I\u2019ve been really looking for gifts that he will love. Dave loves working in the yard and helping me with home projects so naturally I thought he might love some DIY and hardware items. Our local hardware store is Ace Hardware, so I was thrilled for the opportunity to share some of my (and Dave\u2019s) favorite tools and products \u2013 along with some great deals \u2013 that could make some great gifts this holiday season!\n\n \nWe love shopping at Ace because it\u2019s an amazing hardware store.

Visitors traveled from nearly 80 countries and regions including China, India, Japan, Malaysia, Russia, South Korea, the US, and Vietnam to the SNIEC fairgrounds to see latest innovations for this sector. The exhibition was jointly organized by Messe D\u00fcsseldorf (Shanghai) Co. (MDS) and Adsale Exhibition Services . \n\u201cWith the fast pace of urbanization and the rising consumption level of the middle class, the demand for modern processing and packaging in China is also on the rise,\u201d says Hans Werner Reinhard, managing director of Messe D\u00fcsseldorf. \u201cswop, with its four exhibitions and innovative themes, is the one-stop platform for the most advanced technologies and ideas.\u201d \n\u201cAs one of the new member trade fairs of the interpack alliance based on interpack, the world\u2019s leading trade fair for processing and packaging, swop has undoubtedly gained more exposure in the global market and attracted more top industry experts to China,\u201d says Bernd Jablonowski, Global Portfolio Director Processing and Packaging at Messe D\u00fcsseldorf. \nStanley Chu, chairman of Adsale Exhibition Services, adds, \u201cThis year, swop continues to feature the entire value chain of packaging\u2014from packaging materials production and processing, primary and secondary packaging, and logistics/e-commerce packaging to packaging materials and containers\u2014all in one event. In addition, swop serves eight industries: food, beverage, bakery, confectionery, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, non-food consumer goods, and industrial commodities. This makes swop the first one-stop sourcing platform covering the entire value chain.\u201d \nIn order to help the exhibitors find high quality potential buyers, buyers groups, consisting of nearly 100 industry associations and enterprises as well as a \u201cbusiness pairing\u201d program were organized. \nExhibitors at swop 2017 addressed trend topics such as Industry 4.0, intelligent packaging manufacturing/software, and sustainability. Many companies demonstrated their efforts to reduce thickness of packaging materials, lower resource consumption, and improved manufacturing processes. \nSix years after its introduction, the SAVE FOOD initiative by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and Messe D\u00fcsseldorf (organizer of the interpack trade fair), has grown into a broad-based international coalition with more than 850 international members covering relevant industries, associations, non-governmental organizations, and research institutions. SAVE FOOD premiered as a special theme at swop 2017, along with an international summit on the second day of the show. Vincent Martin, the China and North Korean representative from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, talked about \u201cReducing global food waste through innovation and partnership.\u201d Numerous exhibitors also picked up on this topic. \nThe FMCG Future Zone highlighted packaging materials and products presented by more than 200 overseas and domestic exhibitors on 107,600 sq ft of exhibit space.

About | Momentum \nT he Commission will look in to \"whether or not Momentum submitted a return that did not include all invoices for payments of more than \u00a3200\" and \"whether or not Momentum submitted a return that was not a complete statement of payments made in respect of controlled expenditure\". \nElectoral law imposes strict spending limits on non-party campaigners seeking to influence people to vote for one particular political party or any of its candidates. \nSpending is limited to \u00a331,980 in England, \u00a33,540 in Scotland, \u00a32,400 in Wales and \u00a31,080 in Northern Ireland for the regulated period, which in this year's case stretched for 12 months before the June 8 ballot. \nE lectoral Commission records show that Momentum reported total spending of \u00a338,742.54 across all four parts of the United Kingdom during the general election campaign, \u00a3257.46 below the \u00a339,000 limit. \nBob Posner, the Electoral Commission\u2019s Director of Political Finance and Regulation and Legal Counsel, said: \u201cMomentum are a high profile active campaigning body. Questions over their compliance with the campaign finance rules at June\u2019s general election risks causing harm to voters\u2019 confidence in elections. \n\"There is significant public interest in us investigating Momentum to establish the facts in this matter and whether there have been any offences. \n\u201cOnce complete, the Commission will decide whether any breaches have occurred and, if so, what further action may be appropriate, in line with its enforcement policy.\u201d Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn speaks in Parliament Square, where the Momentum campaign group are holding a \"Keep Corbyn\" demonstration Credit: Dominic Lipinski/PA \nA Momentum spokesman said: \"Much of the Electoral Commission investigation refers to a series of administrative errors that can be easily rectified. \n\"Momentum put a lot of effort and resources into detailed budgeting and financial procedures during the election to ensure full compliance. \n\"Our election campaign was delivered on a low budget because it tapped into the energy and enthusiasm of tens of thousands of volunteers across the country. \n\"We have a good working relationship with the Electoral Commission, and will fully comply with the investigation going forward.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeremy corbyn-backing momentu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jeremy corbyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "posner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corbyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jon lansman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "electoral commission", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:04.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8444b49f6a87c7fccbb976d282bfb0fa9bef1fb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8YiFTTQTxpE_OVMLddrwQLrahWYulepBoKUcATyrQS5VjIGA64SRcWuXxbzZK4yg0-", "site_full": "www.mamjo.com", "site": "mamjo.com", "site_section": "http://www.mamjo.com/forum/index.php?board=24.0", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Man zoekt man", "title": "lekkere sex", "title_full": "lekkere sex", "published": "2017-04-16T04:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.067, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2162e312593addbbfeb8c73af8af7a8d21495721", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8YiFTTQTxpE_OVMLddrwQLrahWYulepBoKUcATyrQS5VjIGA64SRcWpmqKImuQLH7SpLPPM1UpOw--", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-05T01:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: from: Shyguy on 02-12-2017, 23:19:20 -

The schemes, announced in the 2012 care and support white paper, were intended as \u2018trailblazers\u2019 for the introduction of residential care direct payments across England in 2016. But the plans have now been shelved until at least 2020. Unlike domiciliary care, where personal budgets have given people more ownership of the decision-making for the support they receive, direct payments in residential care were not underpinned by an \u201cestablished positive narrative\u201d, the report said. Direct payments also injected further uncertainty into care providers\u2019 finances, by reducing the sums of money they were guaranteed from councils. Uncertain benefits Stefanie Ettelt, associate professor in health policy at the LSHTM and one of the study\u2019s co-authors, said the study highlighted the difficulties in slotting direct payments within existing approaches to residential care. \u201cThe absence of a coherent narrative [to support widening direct payments] is indicative of a number of fundamental problems,\u201d she told Community Care. The research, which drew on interviews with people leading the trailblazer projects, council and care home staff, along with service users and their families, identified a series of barriers towards implementation. In many cases both council and care home staff, and service users and their families, were uncertain as to the benefits of direct payments. \u201cHigh levels of care need can limit residents [such as those with dementia or severe learning disabilities] benefiting from the types of choice and control that direct payments can offer,\u201d Ettelt said. Some local authority workers felt uneasy about promoting direct payments, because they didn\u2019t feel confident in answering detailed questions as to how they would work in practice. Councils found it tricky to decide how to implement the new system, which required them to pass whole care-cost sums over to service users, or negotiate with care providers as to how they could \u2018split out\u2019 elements of care. Where the latter was possible, some residents, particularly older people, were left with limited options in terms of exercising meaningful choice, the study found. \u201cSome homes had established relationships with volunteer groups and charities [that could facilitate daytime activities], often for younger adults with physical disabilities, while others had few or no support networks,\u201d it said. Financial risks Care providers also said both \u2018full\u2019 and \u2018part\u2019 direct payments increased the financial risk they were exposed to. In the case of full payments, they argued that service users and their families were more likely than local authorities to default on payments. \nBy accepting part-payments, meanwhile, they would be receiving a lower fee without necessarily making any savings. Many providers\u2019 business models, the study noted, relied on pooling resources across residents \u2013 as highlighted by a recent by a recent Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) report , which found local authority resident fees were already on average 10% below costs. Some care homes emerged as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d, the research found, with \u201cmany expressing concern about the potential impact of direct payments on finances if the scheme were to be rolled out\u201d. In some cases, family members were also reluctant to accept a direct payment because of the potential impact on overall standards of care if they began reducing the fee they paid to a home. \u2018Make system fit for purpose\u2019 Responding to the research findings, Margaret Willcox, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS), said it was important to bear in mind that direct payments were \u201cnever intended\u201d to supersede all other methods of paying for care. \u201cThey simply aim to support people who want greater choice and control over their financial planning,\u201d Willcox said. \u201cMaking direct payments more widely available will enable this control to be offered to more people.\u201d Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, echoed Willcox\u2019s endorsement of making direct payments more widely available and said that the government must work to make the system fit for purpose. \u201cIf people have limited capacity, this should not be used as an excuse to deny them direct payments; rather, they should be offered independent advocacy to enable them to make informed choices,\u201d Green added. Citing the CMA report, he blamed local authorities for trying to use direct payments to reduce \u201cmeagre funding levels\u201d still further. Meanwhile a Department of Health spokesperson said: \u201cThis research identifies poor take up of direct payments in residential care in the pilot areas and the barriers to implementation \u2013 but we know some people want this choice and control over their care and support. \u201cNext summer we will publish plans to reform social care \u2013 looking at the quality of care delivered, the funding of the system, and how it will be paid for \u2013 t o ensure that it is sustainable for the future \u2013 and we will consider the findings of the report in the context of the government\u2019s wider reform programme.\u201d More from Community Care ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "martin green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex turner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stefanie ettelt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margaret willcox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "willcox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ettelt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "association of directors of adult social services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "competition and markets authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london school of hygiene and tropical medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london school of economics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "community care", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:04.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fb400cb0b778cc2941e785ae932023ff3cfe5230", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRhj86QOlmcSY9f3kxUqt5So3bZBPEeS53MoL.ERjhjXA--", "site_full": "tieba.baidu.com", "site": "baidu.com", "site_section": "https://tieba.baidu.com/f?kw=%E9%93%83%E6%9D%91%E5%81%A5%E4%B8%80", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "\u94c3\u6751\u5065\u4e00\u5427-\u767e\u5ea6\u8d34\u5427--?\u6b22\u8fce\u6765\u5230S\u661f\u738b\u5b50\u7684\u534e\u4e3dS\u661f\u7403?

The younger Fisher wowed Wall Street in the mid-1980s when his book Super Stocks first popularized the idea of using the price/sales ratio ( PSR ) as a means of identifying attractive stocks. According to his alma mater, Humboldt State University, Fisher is also one of the world's foremost experts on 19th century logging.

The announcement comes as a U.S. investigation into alleged election meddling by Russia continues and follows concerns about Chinese money and influence in Australian politics. \n\"Foreign powers are making unprecedented and increasingly sophisticated attempts to influence the political process, both here and abroad,\" Turnbull said Tuesday. \nThe Chinese Embassy in Australia said in a statement Wednesday that \"China has no intention to interfere in Australia's internal affairs or exert influence on its political process through political donations.\" \n\"We urge the Australian side to look at China and China-Australia relations in an objective, fair and rational manner,\" the statement said. \nUnder legislation expected to be introduced in Parliament this week, it would become a crime for a person to engage in conduct on behalf of a foreign principal that will influence a political or governmental process, including opposition party policy, and is either covert or involves deception. \nAnother proposed bill seeks to ban foreign political donations. \nThe laws would criminalize acts such as opposition Sen. Sam Dastyari's soliciting of a donation from a Chinese businessman, Huang Xiangmo, to cover personal expenses; it got Dastyari demoted last week. Dastyari then misrepresented Australia's policy on China's sweeping territorial claims in the South China at a news conference held exclusively for Chinese reporters and attended by Huang. \nDastyari has been dubbed \"Shanghai Sam\" for his dealings with Huang, a wealthy Sydney-based donor to Australian political parties whomAustralian security services suspect is linked to the ruling Chinese Communist Party. The Australian government argues that Dastyari should quit Parliament for giving Huang countersurveillance advice last year when he told the Chinese citizen to leave his cellphone inside his Sydney mansion while they stepped outside to talk. \nThe government argues that by helping Huang avoid Australian security surveillance, Dastyari had not put Australia's interests first. Dastyari has not denied the accusation, but said he did not know Huang was the target of a surveillance operation. \nA Section on 12/07/2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rod mcguirk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huang xiangmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam dastyari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dastyari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinese communist party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinese embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shanghai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:05.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3fb98e88f5f32cf9d8843461f0852695728bad21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj16JfG7tME857oqwGjf4Ey_A7fDkeiRhyXjLLGzWclmi1NAFeuVKDYcU1bk357XoJQ--", "site_full": "forums.wynncraft.com", "site": "wynncraft.com", "site_section": "https://forums.wynncraft.com/forums/trade-market.71/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "Trade Market | Wynncraft Forums", "title": "Auction - 118lb Discoverer", "title_full": "Auction - 118lb Discoverer | Wynncraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T12:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forums.wynncraft.com/data/avatars/m/89/89548.jpg?1512640671", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "241771a9b0ce7218b192bad138127cd3ea56015f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj16JfG7tME857oqwGjf4Ey_A7fDkeiRhyXjLLGzWclmi1NAFeuVKDYfNP4JCxWDjZtpgf.EjO8Dg", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "dukioooo", "published": "2017-12-07T12:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "PatrickIsAdopted said: \u2191 Still not worth 15 Click to expand... well you know, he's overpricing the discoverer so why can't I overprice too? :/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:05.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3fb98e88f5f32cf9d8843461f0852695728bad21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj16JfG7tME857oqwGjf4Ey_A7fDkeiRhyXjLLGzWclmi1NAFeuVKDYcU1bk357XoJQ--", "site_full": "forums.wynncraft.com", "site": "wynncraft.com", "site_section": "https://forums.wynncraft.com/forums/trade-market.71/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "Trade Market | Wynncraft Forums", "title": "Auction - 118lb Discoverer", "title_full": "Auction - 118lb Discoverer | Wynncraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T12:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forums.wynncraft.com/data/avatars/m/89/89548.jpg?1512640671", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5bf829e666ffbd9da7fc8585e949e173d4d80f4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj16JfG7tME857oqwGjf4Ey_A7fDkeiRhyXjLLGzWclmi1NAFeuVKDYfNP4JCxWDjZjBJob_t_czL", "ord_in_thread": 15, "author": "Khaps", "published": "2017-12-07T12:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "_TheRealJesus said: \u2191 no thank you im not accepting mythics (besides gaia or fatal) @dukioooo Click to expand...

In the last two quarters, we alone have had 91 missed doctors\u2019 appointments and 165 missed nurse appointments. \n\u201cThe total doesn\u2019t surprise me because when you look at our figures, we are a small practice in Lincolnshire, and the small figures add up. \n\u201cPatients not attending means patients who need appointments cannot be offered appointments. \n\u201cThe NHS despite the pressures that it is facing is in good health but it is important that we work collectively with our patients to ensure that it is maintained and that it is sustained and that it is managed most effectively. \n\u201cThis includes, perhaps most importantly, time management.\u201d \nDr Sultan said that missed appointments are not just an issue for GP surgeries, with hospitals also reporting missed appointments. \nHe said: \u201cWe get letters from hospitals too informing us of patients missing hospital appointments at a time when hospital services are under significant pressure and that has a serious impact. \n\u201cThere can be long waiting times.\u201d The Lincolnite welcomes your views.

And if that\u2019s the kind of gift on your shopping list, there are several places right now where you can find what fits that description, whether jewelry, ceramics or glassware. Channing Gray Special to The Journal Channing_Gray \nThere is nothing like a gift with the personal touch, something unique, handcrafted with a sense of care. And if that\u2019s the kind of gift on your shopping list, there are several places right now where you can find what fits that description, whether jewelry, ceramics or glassware. \nThe popular Foundry Artists Association holiday show, now three decades old, enters its second weekend at the Pawtucket Armory, offering an array of crafts by more than 60 top regional artists. \nBut the big change in the holiday art show landscape involves the Rhode Island School of Design alumni show held for more than two decades at the Rhode Island Convention Center. RISD decided late last year to drop the show. But not to worry, it has been picked up by a plucky marketing specialist named Laura Burkett. \nBurkett and her ArtSmart Productions have put together a show that honors the RISD legacy, but branches out to include about 100 artists from throughout the Northeast who are \u201cmore along in their careers,\u201d she said. \nThe Art Providence Holiday Show, which fills two galleries at the Rhode Island Convention Center, will be about the same size, said Burkett, featuring some 200 artists, this time about half of whom are RISD alums. \nLook for paintings, photos, ceramics, furniture, glass, jewelry, leather and fiber, among other media, with price points that stretch from under $100 to more than $1,000. \n\"The RISD alumni show has been a strong show for me for 22 years,\u201d said Elise Moran, a RISD grad who hand forges delicate sliver necklaces, rings and bracelets. \u201cI\u2019m very happy the Art Providence Holiday Show is continuing the tradition of bringing in a strong core of RISD alumni while admitting an influx of new work. It has the potential of being an even bigger and better show,\u201d she said. \nMichelle Phaneuf, a popular Providence ceramicist, likened the revamped Art Providence show to the much touted CraftBoston, which makes it \u201cvery enticing.\u201d \nBurkett, who\u2019s not a RISD person but the niece of noted graphic designer Malcolm Greer, who taught at RISD, comes from a marketing background. Some years ago, she was based in London hawking Coors Light. \nThen in 2001 she took a year off to travel, went to Italy and fell in love with Italian leather. Now she produces her own line of leather bags that are \u201cinspired by Italy, but made in America.\u201d \nBurkett\u2019s involvement in the show was sort of unexpected, though. She was talking to a Warren jewelry maker about the demise of the RISD show and the person said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just do it?\u201d \nInterviewed the other days while making preparations for the show, Burkett said she\u2019s never worked so hard. She\u2019s rented 200 10-by-10 booths, but said she will \u201cneed more hands on deck\u201d for future shows. That might lead to a smaller show in the spring and evenings with speakers. \nBurkett believes her background in the corporate world is an asset. She hopes to help artists market their work, especially online. \nBut the logistics of overhauling the show and bringing in a new crop of craftsmen have been more than a little challenging. \n\u201cWe\u2019re at a point right now where every hour counts,\u201d she said a few weeks ago. \nArt Providence is also now two days instead of one: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. There's also a reception for sponsors and special ticket holders from 5:30 to 7 p.m. Friday. General admission for Saturday and Sunday is $8, or $10 for a two-day pass. Children 16 and under get in free. Tickets for Friday's VIP reception are available online for $100 and include a gift, beverage, light fare and a first look at the art. \nAs for the Foundry Show, which for many years was held in the old Brown & Sharpe complex along Route 95 but now calls the Pawtucket Armory home, it got underway last weekend, and continues through Sunday at 172 Exchange St. \nAnd there\u2019s not much in the way of crafts you can\u2019t find. There are the familiar and expected categories of ceramics, jewelry, fiber and glass, but also things like soap, paper and door knockers. Hours are noon-8 p.m. Friday and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. \nPawtucket\u2019s Mad Dog Artist Studios, a sprawling 8,000-square-foot coop on the Blackstone River, wraps up its sixth annual holiday art sale Sunday with work from more than 40 local artists and craftsmen. \nThe sale, which got under way Nov. 30, is just around the corner from the Pawtucket Armory, at 65 Blackstone Ave. That means you can catch the Foundry Show at the same time, and scope out the work for 100 artists in one city block. \nLocally made items include furniture, textiles, ceramics, glass, and even custom roasted coffee, along with artisan products from the Southampton Soap Co. And after getting into the art, you can take a break and visit the Mad Dog Caf\u00e9 for custom-roasted coffee, loose-leaf teas, bakery items, soups and sandwiches. Hours are 2-8 p.m. Friday and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. \nMore handcrafted gifts for the holidays are for sale Saturday at the Warwick Center for the Arts, 3259 Post Rd. Choose from prints, jewelry, home d\u00e9cor and much more, all created by local artists and artisans. The show is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. \nAnd don\u2019t forget, the Providence Art Club\u2019s hugely popular Little Pictures Show continues from noon to 5 p.m. daily through Dec. 23. That gives art lovers a chance to pick up one or more of 600 artworks, mostly paintings, no bigger than 16-by-16 inches and no more expensive than $300. It\u2019s a cash-and-carry show. You buy a painting at the club, at 11 Thomas St., and take it home right then, as the artist sticks a new piece in its place within minutes. At last month\u2019s member\u2019s opening, people were walking around with armfuls of paintings. \nAnd Warren\u2019s Imago Gallery opens its annual Small Works show Thursday, which is their version of the Art Club\u2019s show. The show does not have a price cap, but no one is going to have to take out a second mortgage. Linda Megathlin from the gallery said about 20 artists will be showing more than 100 works, mostly paintings and prints, but some three-dimension pieces, too. The gallery is at 36 Market St. Regular hours are 4-8 p.m. Thursday, noon-8 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 11 a.m.-3 p.m. Sunday. \nMore information:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "art providence", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "warren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharpe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burkett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linda megathlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laura burkett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michelle phaneuf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm greer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elise moran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas st.", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pawtucket armory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "art club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "artsmart productions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southampton soap co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "providence art club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coors light", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foundry artists association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craftboston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warwick center for the arts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blackstone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "risd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "providence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rhode island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pawtucket", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blackstone river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rhode island convention center", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:06.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a1b1c9a1b5de4a8fb7da53cc12c4631d35cf11e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUUC4XTyMkceqEoCK7FTxSiLvOig4FJB.dLIPgLsbO1cfkS1tBLFKR29Eh465XraJOe1VG3x3vB9PteOGp8PPuYntn9IVr1MCtj_hXpr4ZDu", "site_full": "www.expedia.com", "site": "expedia.com", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com/Urayasu-Hotels.d10172.Travel-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Top 10 Hotels in Urayasu $43 | Hotel Deals on Expedia.com", "title": "Hotel Dream Gate Maihama:", "title_full": "Hotel Dream Gate Maihama: 2017 Room Prices, Deals & Reviews | Expedia", "published": "2013-06-11T22:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 416, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3497bc1b365c85d6324893678a5ec8d9acd3853f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUUC4XTyMkceqEoCK7FTxSiLvOig4FJB.dLIPgLsbO1cfkS1tBLFKR29Eh465XraJOe1VG3x3vB9PteOGp8PPuYntn9IVr1MChdBN6yT0rXmNbsOOl.4J2SsdSza0xR3p.MnhQMdHaf6", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-06T23:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "This hotel is good if you want just the basics.
