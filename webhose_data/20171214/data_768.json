Scientists turn beer into fuel", "text": "London: Scientists have made the first step towards creating sustainable petrol using beer as a key ingredient. Scientists turn beer into petrol. \nOne of the most widely used sustainable alternatives to petrol world-wide is bioethanol, according to researchers at University of Bristol in the UK. \nHowever, ethanol is not an ideal replacement for petrol as it has issues such as lower energy density, it mixes too easily with water and can be fairly corrosive to engines. \nA much better fuel alternative is butanol but this is difficult to make from sustainable sources. \nScientists at Bristol\u2019s School of Chemistry have been working for several years to develop technology to convert widely-available ethanol into butanol. \n\u201cThe alcohol in alcoholic drinks is actually ethanol \u2013 exactly the same molecule that we want to convert into butanol as a petrol replacement,\u201d said Professor Duncan Wass, whose team led the study published in the journal Catalysis Science & Technology. \n\u201cSo alcoholic drinks are an ideal model for industrial ethanol fermentation broths \u2013 ethanol for fuel is essentially made using a brewing process,\u201d said Wass. \n\u201cIf our technology works with alcoholic drinks (especially beer which is the best model) then it shows it has the potential to be scaled up to make butanol as a petrol replacement on an industrial scale,\u201d he said. \nThe technology used to convert ethanol into butanol is called a catalyst \u2013 these are chemicals which can speed up and control a chemical reaction and are already widely used in the petrochemical industry. \nThe team\u2019s key finding is that their catalysts will convert beer (or specifically, the ethanol in beer) into butanol. \nIn demonstrating that catalysts work with a \u2018real\u2019 ethanol mixture, the team has demonstrated a key step in scaling this technology up to industrial application. \n\u201cWe would not actually want to use beer on an industrial scale and compete with potential food crops,\u201d said Wass. \n\u201cBut there are ways to obtain ethanol for fuel from fermentation that produce something that chemically is very much like beer \u2013 so beer is an excellent readily available model to test our technology,\u201d he said. \nAnother advantage of this approach is that it is quite similar to many existing petrochemical processes, researchers said. \nThe next step in terms of application is to build this larger scale process and, based on previous processes, this could take as long as five years even if everything went well, they said. \n\u201cTurning beer into petrol was a bit of fun, and something to do with the leftovers of the lab Christmas party, but it has a serious point,\u201d Wass said. \n\u201cBeer is actually an excellent model for the mixture of chemicals we would need to use in a real industrial process, so it shows this technology is one step closer to reality,\u201d he said.

People, who do not have the Aadhaar card, would not be denied the benefits of social welfare schemes till March 31. \nThe Supreme Court now will be setting up a five-judge Constitution Bench next week to hear several pleas seeking an interim stay on the Centre\u2019s decision of mandatory linking of Aadhaar. \nA bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra was informed by Attorney General K K Venugopal that the Centre was willing to extend the deadline of December 31 to March 31 next year for linking of Aadhaar with various services and schemes. \nThe Attorney General, however, made clear that February 6 next year would remain the deadline for linking Aadhaar for availing uninterrupted mobile services as it had been mandated by the apex court. \nSenior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for those who are opposed to Aadhaar scheme told the bench, also comprising Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, that the central government should give an undertaking that no coercive steps would be taken against those fail to link their Aadhaar with various services. \nThe apex court on October 30 had said that a Constitution Bench would commence hearing on the clutch of petitions against Aadhaar scheme from the last week of November. \nRecently, a nine-judge constitution bench of the apex court had held that Right to Privacy was a Fundamental Right under the Constitution. Several petitioners challenging the validity of Aadhaar had claimed it violated privacy rights. \nThe Centre had on October 25 told the top court that the deadline for mandatory linking of Aadhaar to receive benefits of government schemes has been extended till March 31, 2018 for those who do not have the 12-digit unique biometric identification number and were willing to enrol for it. \nThe Attorney General had told the court that no coercive action would be taken against those who do not have the Aadhaar card but are willing to enrol for. He had said such people would not be denied the benefits of social welfare schemes till March 31. \nSome petitioners in the top court have termed the linking of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) number with bank accounts and mobile numbers as \u201cillegal and unconstitutional\u201d. \nThey had also objected to the CBSE\u2019s alleged move to make Aadhaar card mandatory for students appearing for examinations, a contention denied by the Centre. \nOne of the counsel representing the petitioners had earlier said that final hearing in the main Aadhaar matter, which is pending before the apex court, was necessary as the government \u201ccannot compel\u201d citizens to link their Aadhaar with either bank accounts or cell phone numbers.

We believe \u2018Growing A Better World\u2019 means working to improve our planet, its people and the communities where we work and live.\u201d\nAmong its specific  goals , the report said that Kraft plans to transition to 100% cage-free eggs in all global operations by 2025, sourcing 100% RSPO-certified sustainable palm oil, delivering training and resources to more than 2,000 Honduran coffee farmers to help them increase their yields and incomes, ending the use of \u201cfish aggregating devices\u201d for all tuna-sourcing activities in Australia, and achieving 70% compliance with its stiffer internal nutrition guidelines by 2023.\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on addressing the most critical environmental and societal challenges affecting our industry and global communities, and finding ways to drive meaningful change,\u201d CEO Bernardo Hees said in a press release .\nKraft Heinz said it plans to focus in four areas where it can have the greatest impact:\nBetter Supply Chain:  Creating a sustainable, global supply chain by establishing responsible farm-to-market ingredient and material-sourcing policies. On its way to the 100% cage-free commitment, so far Kraft Heinz has transitioned one-third of its global egg supply to cage-free.\nBetter Environment:  Promoting environmental sustainability by managing and reducing the company\u2019s resource needs to minimize its impact on the planet and preserve natural resources. Among other things, Kraft Heinz plans to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by 5.1%.\nBetter Products:  Meeting the needs and demands of today\u2019s consumers by improving the nutritional and wellness profiles of Kraft Heinz products. The company has already reformulated Oscar Mayer hot dogs to remove nitrates and artificial and preservatives and has pulled artificial dyes and preservatives from its Kraft macaroni and cheese.\nBetter Communities:  Strengthening communities around the world by making a sustainable difference in the fight to end global hunger and malnutrition.

Advertisement By JALIARA NAMYALO \nKAMPALA. The Army Court has set January 8 next year to determine the fate of bail application by four suspects on remand over the alleged 2014 failed attack on Kabamba Army Barracks in Mubende District. \nThe four suspects; Capt Hillman Bosco Aleper, Ndugga Musaazi, Lumala Ssalongo and Marvin Ssemwogerere asked the General Court Martial at Makindye to temporarily release them pending trial. \nThrough their lawyers, the suspects contend that they have spent a long time on remand yet bail is mandatory and that they suffered torture during arrest. \nThe court presided over by Lt. Gen. Andrew Gutti set the ruling upon hearing of submissions from the suspects and the prosecution.However, at the hearing, prosecution led by Maj Raphael Mugisha objected to the application denying allegations of torture pleaded by the suspects. \nWhile referring to the affidavit sworn by the investigating officer, Maj Gaston Mugarura, the prosecutor argued that they are committed to handling the case expeditiously. \n\u201cMandatory bail is only granted when an accused is on remand and trial has not commenced whereas in the case before court, the trial commenced and is ongoing,\u201d said Maj Mugisha observing that the suspects have since appeared 66 times before the court. \nThe group is part of the fourteen people charged with offences relating to security which attracts a maximum punishment of death upon conviction. \nThey are jointly charged with ten others including Lt Col Philip Frank Eguma, Lt Ronald Waibi Mwavu, a junior officer formerly from the 4th Division, Pte Kenneth Sekajja, formerly of Air Defence in Nakasongola and Sgt Ndugga Musaazi Nama. \nOthers are;

The main threat is Christmas in April from Nicky Henderson\u2019s yard and if he doesn\u2019t turn up then Towering can take advantage and at 16-1 is worth an eachway shout.\nEachway Advised\n.\nMidnight Gem -Finished 2nd last time out at Huntingdon in a Class 4 Novice Chase over 2m 7f, races off same mark here and can get involved again in a similar type of affair.\nWin Advised\n.\nWell that\u2019s my thoughts on Thursday\u2019s selections good luck if following and please remember to keep stakes small so it doesn\u2019t hurt your pocket.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "charlie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicky henderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ffos las", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chase", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "huntingdon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wincanton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novice chase", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "newbury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uttoxeter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wolverhampton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carlisle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelmsford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lingfield", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:21.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0de788b1718378b51a59c9e99f676a66e5dcd6e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKzDbKpciiQPRVc8x.sRNbuJ9mL0HIWGLBqz_4UscwA3Z2M9BzdZUT.MOn0z.D6XjQWhpJh1TDtuvopbrzTCICVpwe7Dg6OXkF5DfNZHGA50eteNJo643_pwRavvZ7Y4tVhIUbR4nEuFe", "site_full": "community.ebay.com", "site": "ebay.com", "site_section": "https://community.ebay.com/t5/Payments/bd-p/payments-db?q=_change_me_", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Payments - The eBay Community", "title": "Paypal difficult to contact to cancel a transactio...", "title_full": "Paypal difficult to contact to cancel a transactio... - The eBay Community", "published": "2017-12-07T04:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0de788b1718378b51a59c9e99f676a66e5dcd6e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKzDbKpciiQPRVc8x.sRNbuJ9mL0HIWGLBqz_4UscwA3Z2M9BzdZUT.MOn0z.D6XjQWhpJh1TDtuvopbrzTCICVpwe7Dg6OXkF5DfNZHGA50eteNJo643_pwRavvZ7Y4tVhIUbR4nEuFe", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "tomterr3d", "published": "2017-12-07T04:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Paypal difficult to contact to cancel a transactio...", "text": "HI, I haven't had any trouble with buying on ebay until last week.

Reuters/KCNA North Korean state-run media said that war with the US has become inevitable amid the US's large scale aerial military drills. The comments came hours after the US flew bombers near North Korea, which inflames Pyongyang every time. North Korea continously refers to the bombers the US uses as being nuclear, even though they were denuclearized in the 1990s and Russia certifies that they are on a yearly basis. \nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 North Korea says a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula has become a matter of when, not if, as it continued to lash out at a massive joint military exercise between the United States and South Korea involving hundreds of advanced warplanes. \nIn comments attributed to an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman, North Korea also claimed high-ranked U.S. officials, including CIA Director Mike Pompeo, have further confirmed American intent for war with a series of \"bellicose remarks.\" \nPompeo said Saturday that U.S. intelligence agencies believe North Korean leader Kim Jong Un doesn't have a good idea about how tenuous his situation is domestically and internationally. The North's spokesman said Pompeo provoked the country by \"impudently criticizing our supreme leadership which is the heart of our people.\" \n\"We do not wish for a war but shall not hide from it, and should the U.S. miscalculate our patience and light the fuse for a nuclear war, we will surely make the U.S. dearly pay the consequences with our mighty nuclear force which we have consistently strengthened,\" the spokesman said. \nThe comments were carried by the official Korean Central News Agency late Wednesday, hours after the United States flew a B-1B supersonic bomber over South Korea as part of a massive combined aerial exercise involving hundreds of warplanes. North Korean propaganda is often filled with extreme claims and threats, and the spokesman's comments were consistent with the tone of previous statements condemning Washington and Seoul. \nA Lancer takes off from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam on Oct. 11, 2017. US Air Force \nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the Guam-based bomber simulated land strikes at a military field near South Korea's eastern coast during a drill with U.S. and South Korean fighter jets. \n\"Through the drill, the South Korean and U.S. air forces displayed the allies' strong intent and ability to punish North Korea when threatened by nuclear weapons and missiles,\" the South Korean military said in a statement. \nB-1Bs flyovers have become an increasingly familiar show of force to North Korea, which after three intercontinental ballistic missile tests has clearly moved closer toward building a nuclear arsenal that could viably target the U.S. mainland. \nThe five-day drills that began Monday involve more than 200 aircraft, including six U.S. F-22 and 18 F-35 stealth fighters. \nNorth Korea hates such displays of American military might at close range and typically uses strong language to condemn them as invasion rehearsals. It has been particularly sensitive about B-1B bombers, describing them as \"nuclear strategic\" although the planes were switched to conventional weaponry in the mid-1990s.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kim jong", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "mike pompeo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pompeo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us air force  south korea's joint chiefs of staff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foreign ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korean central news agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kpa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korean peninsula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyongyang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andersen air force base", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:21.042+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40147401106b791f2af9d0b650bf998d2cd562ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTAhPmCEK9Vxb7ZWzAZlCf1g--", "site_full": "forums.moneysavingexpert.com", "site": "moneysavingexpert.com", "site_section": "http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/forumdisplay.php?f=29", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Techie Stuff - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "title": "CCTV DVR upgrade", "title_full": "CCTV DVR upgrade - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T10:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2270, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "844fbb622f7b17cf4135e79067c576dce9cb956c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTAhPmCEK9VxYLYNLZWFfIGkNuDBmBi5fNlQE_i9Cho4k-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "forgotmyname", "published": "2017-12-07T10:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\u201c My dad has a CCTV system on his house and the DVR was playing up.

In contrast, this was a vote about a social change that wasn\u2019t on the political agenda 15 years ago, and which had been deemed too controversial to be passed by the last Labor government just four years ago.\u201d* Read more here: https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/16/australians-voted-in-massive-numbers-for-marriage-equality-and-a-fair-go Hosts: John Iadarola, An...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:22.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2dac2c24c41506477b2987b6ad4903a924ef227d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_WO9sE5JKwAWe060cPAOH2dGAb1f3bjPWN3kSZ3QzdTuAdGpm4vuBQtiRzDHafxI9WVLI7rGX8VoEsWYQD.cSAOCC4bawRM.a1JzIMD0brByT9PgRykuEmeUD9giDoI50JFgO8hU6X9puaWxFuGG8zXBUquv2az6Z9Bodn8zqXtw--", "site_full": "www.itsforhome.com", "site": "itsforhome.com", "site_section": "http://www.itsforhome.com/pub", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Technology Solutions for Home \u2013 Smart Grid \u2013 Demand Response", "title": "Tata Tigor Electric Vehicle Production Begins Commercial Launch Within 2 Years", "title_full": "Tata Tigor Electric Vehicle Production Begins Commercial Launch Within 2 Years", "published": "2017-12-07T05:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2dac2c24c41506477b2987b6ad4903a924ef227d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_WO9sE5JKwAWe060cPAOH2dGAb1f3bjPWN3kSZ3QzdTuAdGpm4vuBQtiRzDHafxI9WVLI7rGX8VoEsWYQD.cSAOCC4bawRM.a1JzIMD0brByT9PgRykuEmeUD9giDoI50JFgO8hU6X9puaWxFuGG8zXBUquv2az6Z9Bodn8zqXtw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tom Gardner", "published": "2017-12-07T05:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "Tata Tigor Electric Vehicle Production Begins Commercial Launch Within 2 Years", "text": "\nThe Facebook post in May contained a video including the voice-over: \"Having driven petrol-guzzling cars before, I realised that it is now time to switch to an electric car. \"With zero emissions, the i3 really is a clean car and helps to give back to the environment.\" Responding to a complaint that the claims \u2026\nLinks to article: Tata Tigor Electric Vehicle Production Begins Commercial Launch Within 2 Years ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "tata tigor electric vehicle production begins commercial launch within", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tata tigor electric", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:22.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c51aa44e45d2f6eff15bb16b77513d00071ae17c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSB7xnVOyxHFfJOOgU9SEtQ6qMixXnGbi5_VLW77ToBjl5ztclVTyXDVC2d_6sEixOqyS5TzP9Ml4IoTtyjI5sTU_UGpnTjZGcYcd3N.zYLnI-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Apple", "title": "Tim Cook demos iPhone X for Justin Trudeau", "title_full": "Tim Cook demos iPhone X for Justin Trudeau : apple", "published": "2017-12-07T04:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9ca6351fc737f1a80b901b6ac8380037c798b2a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSB7xnVOyxHFfJOOgU9SEtQ6qMixXnGbi5_VLW77ToBjl5ztclVTyXDVC2d_6sEixOqyS5TzP9Ml4IoTtyjI5sTU_UGpnTjZGci73M90dJmXa91Wi9k7gVQsRZmH8rOQmw", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "clevermistakes", "published": "2017-12-07T09:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Even Tim Cook loves Trudaddy!

Under-age football competitions are designed to aid player development. As such, Muhammad seems to have picked some valuable lessons after the national Under-17 team Cubs, were eliminated by Zambia at the 2015 Africa under-17 championship final qualification hurdle.The striker Muhammad Shaban felt he could have altered the result were he applying a more direct approach. \nThree years later, on the opening day of the Cosafa Under-20 championship against the same opponents, he was able to apply those instincts as the National Under-20 team Hippos got off to a flyer in Zambia. The striker scored both goals as the Hippos stunned their more fancied hosts with a 2-0 win to go top of the four team Group A in Kitwe on Wednesday evening.In a frantic first half, both sides created chances with Zambia captain Prince Mumba seeing his shot come off the woodwork. Lameck Banda was also denied by a fine stop from Uganda keeper Keni Saidi as the Hippos withstood early pressure. \nShaban who along with partner Steven Mukwala troubled the opponents\u2019 backline with their running all day then had a header hit the bar following a fancy flick and cross from Frank \u201cZaga\u201d Tumwesigye.He was not to be denied six minutes into the second half though. Mukwala latched onto a floated ball on the right with his pace taking him past a defender before his low cross was met by the onrushing Shaban at the near post.With the sizable home crowd still stunned by the goal, he pounced again three minutes later. Using his pace before holding off a defender, he pounced onto goalkeeper Keni\u2019s long ball before lifting the ball past goalkeeper Daniel Sikanyika, the lone Zambian survivor from their previous meeting three years ago.There were further chances for him to complete a hat-trick forcing a save from Sikanyika while he also had an effort ruled out for offside. \nThere could however be no complaints from the Hippos technical area with the result putting Uganda top of Group A on goal difference after Malawi edged Swaziland in a five-goal thriller 3-2.The Hippos who are one of two guest teams return to action on Sunday against Swaziland.The top team from each of the three groups and the best second place finisher will qualify for the semifinals at the 12-team tournament.

AFP PHOTO In Summary The area has been the scene of inter-ethnic violence for the past 20 years, as groups clash for control of mining and other resources. Truckers in North Kivu alone are shaken down at roadblocks to the tune of about a million euros annually. Advertisement \nRoadblocks in war-torn areas of Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of Congo provide armed groups with millions of euros (dollars) in annual income, a report said on Wednesday. \nA year-long study by the International Peace Information Service (IPIS), a Belgian research group, found 1,082 roadblocks in CAR and in the North and South Kivu provinces of eastern DRC alone. \nMoney extorted from road users nets armed groups around seven million euros ($8.2 million) annually, it estimated.Roadblocks are a \"key mechanism of conflict funding,\" IPIS said in a statement. \n\"Strangling development and livelihoods, attracting violent confrontations and generating millions in revenues, roadblocks are as crucial to continuing conflict in Central Africa as natural resources.\"According to the study, armed men were present at 73 percent of roadblocks. \nInvestigators mapped 284 roadblocks in CAR, where violence has raged since 2013 between factions of mostly Christian militias known as anti-Balaka and the Muslim-majority Seleka rebels. Seleka rebels control most of the roadblocks in CAR -- set up every 24 kilometres (15 miles) -- collecting about six million euros in taxes annually, IPIS found. \nThey make most of their money taxing cattle and Sudanese coffee traders, it said.Only 115 roadblocks where operated by government agents.In the eastern region of DR Congo, the inquiry found 798 roadblocks set up at average intervals of 18 km. Of these, 569 were operated by government agents. \nThe area has been the scene of inter-ethnic violence for the past 20 years, as groups clash for control of mining and other resources.Truckers in North Kivu alone are shaken down at roadblocks to the tune of about a million euros annually. \n\"Finding a Congolese road without a roadblock is a challenge \u2013- basically, everything that moves, is taxed,\" said Peer Schouten, IPIS research coordinator and the study's lead author. \n\"Women going to market, farmers accessing fields, traders taking to the road\u2026 We were surprised at the sheer density of roadblocks. They indicate the extent of structural extortion in Congo. And it\u2019s the people that suffer.\"\"It\u2019s time for the international community to broaden its scope beyond conflict minerals,\" Schouten said. advertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peer schouten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schouten", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "international peace information service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ipis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south kivu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dr congo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north kivu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central african republic and democratic republic of congo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:23.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c51aa44e45d2f6eff15bb16b77513d00071ae17c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSB7xnVOyxHFfJOOgU9SEtQ6qMixXnGbi5_VLW77ToBjl5ztclVTyXDVC2d_6sEixOqyS5TzP9Ml4IoTtyjI5sTU_UGpnTjZGcYcd3N.zYLnI-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Apple", "title": "Tim Cook demos iPhone X for Justin Trudeau", "title_full": "Tim Cook demos iPhone X for Justin Trudeau : apple", "published": "2017-12-07T04:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5e5d1c94c73ab4d0887d902acf65705f495599c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSB7xnVOyxHFfJOOgU9SEtQ6qMixXnGbi5_VLW77ToBjl5ztclVTyXDVC2d_6sEixOqyS5TzP9Ml4IoTtyjI5sTU_UGpnTjZGci73M90dJmXa91Wi9k7gVQiRjfQX2OEvD", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "NadiaKhuzina", "published": "2017-12-07T10:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Tim Cook reminds me of Justin Trudeau.

Among the 17 who then completed a questionnaire about health differences and had consumed cannabis for at least a month, a majority reported improvements in the following measures:\nOverall quality of life (76% of respondents, average score 4.24 out of 5)\nEpilepsy (70%, 4.12)\nMood (70%, 4.06)\nQuality of sleep (70%, 4.00)\nAppetite (70%, 3.94)\n\"The results of this study suggest that [medical cannabis] may be a promising candidate for the treatment of MRE and its associated comorbidities when used in conjunction with [anti-epileptic drugs],\" the authors wrote on a poster prepared for the meeting.\nLess than half of patients reported improvements in:\nStress (47%, 3.71)\nAnxiety (23%, 3.35)\nSedation (47%, 3.65)\nAggression (11%, 3.12)\nCannabis use was not without its problems. It was difficult to obtain, many patients reported, citing high costs and inconvenient access. Four patients dropped out of the study because they could no longer afford to purchase the cannabis, which is not covered by insurance in New York. Fifteen of the 17 patients said cannabis was more expensive than anti-epileptic drugs they had previously used, while 10 said it was less convenient to obtain.\n\"The high out-of-pocket costs and lack of insurance coverage of [cannabis] treatment has been a major concern and deterring factor in this study,\" the authors wrote.\nPatients took medical cannabis with a 20:1 ratio of cannabidiol to tetrahydrocannabinol.\nThey had tried an average of 5.43 anti-epileptic medications on average before turning to cannabis. \"The patients come to us because other medications fail,\" said co-author Juliann Paolicchi, MD, the group's co-director of pediatric epilepsy research, who spoke to MedPage Today at the meeting.\nEpileptic patients will continue to try medical cannabis, Paolicchi said, encouraging researchers to thus study the plant's impact on them -- despite major research barriers. \"We have to be open to gathering information as best we can. We can't do all these randomized control trials\" she said, citing prohibitive laws. \"That shouldn't preclude us from getting valuable information in a clinical setting\" via other methodologies.\nPatients in this study expressed their desire to continue using medical cannabis, said Paolicchi, also a professor of pediatrics and neurology at Rutgers and Seton Hall universities, and the results suggest they benefit from it. \"That's what's really exciting about this,\" she added.\nPaolicchi's team is now working on a larger follow-up study examining how cannabis affects medically refractory epilepsy, quality of life and epilepsy comorbidities.\nOf the 27 patients who enrolled in the study, 19 were male. Ages ranged from 3 to 48 years old.\nThey were asked to rate health changes on a 1-5 scale, with 5 representing a \"significant positive impact,\" 1 a \"significant negative impact\" and 3 \"no impact.\"\nThe study lacked controls and relied on patients' self-reports, the authors noted.\n Epilepsy Patients Failing Regular Meds Improved with Medical Cannabis | Medpage Today\nAuthor: Ryan Basen\nContact: About \u2013 Information Center\nPhoto Credit: Getty Images\nWebsite: Medical News and Free Online CME | MedPage Today CareStaker liked this post", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.medpagetoday.com/", "https://www.medpagetoday.com/meetingcoverage/aes/69664", "https://support.medpagetoday.com/hc/en-us/sections/201266833-about"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:24.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7f25b3b3172509027ba913370604709bc47111b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_ZBpETMqzpaZNUU7MktRsgkH0Wia1VEUHY5hEU8rAci1MPgIKfzSHvgogfSBeCWZigS_Ed_A1B9x", "site_full": "forums.att.com", "site": "att.com", "site_section": "https://forums.att.com/t5/TV-Forum/ct-p/att_tv", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "TV Forum - AT&amp;T Community", "title": "CBS Reception", "title_full": "CBS Reception - AT&T Community", "published": "2017-12-06T19:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forums.att.com/html/assets/att_globe_rgb_pos2.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 335, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13c2016d398acbdbc9eb11531ba95122f267d29e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_ZBpETMqzpaZNUU7MktRsgkH0Wia1VEUHY5hEU8rAci1MPgIKfzSHvgogfSBeCWZimTzrZ0B7o1lG_lPfgjhZh9fFIhUjglkywK_IKTqHzF2", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "ACE Achiever", "published": "2017-12-06T23:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "If it is only the one channel then most likely there is a problem with the feed from CBS to DTV contact both.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:24.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22ae6234fce3251bab018e0fdec8777612a7d742", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_.1wcXEplJRNdhhfVe9RhlsPgQN5E7XJmZzsD10HI5xplLH0uh.4ApkWdMmaLIT9ac1avFWbGKW.6xU6cweuJtcak_74xOaz4-", "site_full": "www.monitor.co.ug", "site": "monitor.co.ug", "site_section": "http://www.monitor.co.ug//-/691150/691150/-/view/asFeed/-/11emxavz/-/index.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Daily MonitorHome", "title": "Who English teams can face in champions league knockout", "title_full": "Who English teams can face in champions league knockout", "published": "2017-12-07T09:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "UG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.monitor.co.ug/image/view/-/4218170/medRes/1829835/-/xj4abwz/-/soccer05.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 17943, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "22ae6234fce3251bab018e0fdec8777612a7d742", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_.1wcXEplJRNdhhfVe9RhlsPgQN5E7XJmZzsD10HI5xplLH0uh.4ApkWdMmaLIT9ac1avFWbGKW.6xU6cweuJtcak_74xOaz4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "Who English teams can face in champions league knockout", "text": "Who English teams can face in champions league knockout Jurgen Klopp celebrates as Liverpool qualify for the knockout stages.

Mimecast reported impersonation attacks, which rely on duping recipients into wiring the attacker money or highly monetisable data, rose almost 50% quarter over quarter. Emails with malware attachments or dangerous files types, combined, only increased about 15%. Missed impersonation attacks were seen to occur more than seven times as often as missed email-borne malware. \nThese findings follow a recent PhishMe study that found approximately two thirds of IT executives surveyed had dealt with a security incident originating from a deceptive email. \n\u201cImpersonation attacks are an easy and effective way to dupe unsuspecting victims by gaining trust through a combination of social engineering and technical means,\u201d says Ed Jennings, chief operating officer at Mimecast. \u201cThis latest ESRA report reveals that many email security providers are leaving organizations very vulnerable to these often hard to detect impersonation attacks. Cybercriminals know that many traditional email security services are improving their ability to stop email-borne malware, but remain ineffective against impersonation attacks.\u201d \nThe latest ESRA reflects findings by inspecting the actual inbound email of almost 100 000 users over a cumulative 631 days received. These organisations used a variety of common email security systems.

HyunA previewed her new single \u201cLip & Hip\u201d at the awards Saturday, prior to the official release of the song. (Naver V app) The behind-the-scenes clip showed HyunA ill at ease from anxiety about her upcoming performance. \u201cI was so nervous that I couldn\u2019t sleep a wink last night. I am staging my new song for the first time even before the official release, at this huge awards stage of Gocheok Dome arena,\u201d she said. (Naver V app) However, the singer soon shook off the anxiety as she looked over her wardrobe selection for the upcoming performance. The starlet showed off a bright green coat adorned with photos of her, saying, \u201cLook my photos are all over this coat! I\u2019d say this coat is priceless.\u201d She then went to practice her dance in front of a mirror as she waited. The pop star pulled off an impeccable performance on stage, topped off by a prize from the Melon Music Awards.

Part of the confusion stems from the historic evolution of its consumer-facing store brand: from Walmart (1962) to Wal-Mart (1964-1992) to Wal*Mart (1992) to Walmart (2008 to present).\nWhile its corporate brand stayed behind in the Wal-Mart era, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Walmart\u00e2\u20ac\u009d has been used since 2008 in its stores, website, signage and marketing, as its Wikipedia entry  shows visually.\nCEO Doug McMillon says the chain is legally changing its corporate name to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Walmart Inc.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d on February 1, 2018, so it matches the name that consumers know it by. The move essentially creates a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One Walmart\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and a seamless brand, as investors, analysts, lawyers and its corporate partners can now bid Wal-Mart farewell and welcome Walmart.\n\nNot only does this clean up any usage clunkiness between its corporate and consumer branding, a press release  notes that the name change and removal of hyphen and awkward punctuation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chiefly demonstrates the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing emphasis on serving customers seamlessly however they want to shop: in stores, online, on their mobile device, or through pickup and delivery.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our customers know us as Walmart and today they shop with us not only in our stores but online and with our app as well,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d McMillon said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While our legal name is used in a limited number of places, we felt it was best to have a name that was consistent with the idea that you can shop us however you like as a customer.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nWalmart adopted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wal-Mart, Inc.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as its corporate name when it incorporated in 1969 and changed it to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wal-Mart Stores Inc.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d a year ater. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been using the current Walmart logo in its stores and website since 2008.\n\nThe post So Long, Wal-Mart: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a One-Walmart Era in Corporate Rebrand appeared first on brandchannel: .\nfrom Blogger http://randalljmanley.blogspot.com/2017/12/so-long-wal-mart-its-one-walmart-era-in.html \nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "doug mcmillon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcmillon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wal-mart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wal-mart stores inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u0153wal-mart stores inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wikipedia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wal*mart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u0153walmart inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:25.011+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15085560, "moreResultsAvailable": 15085460, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512641605011&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 168}
