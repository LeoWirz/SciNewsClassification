It is still a mystery the cause of diabetes although genetically and environmentally influence such as not enough exercise and obesity play a role. To understand diabetes, it is good to learn something about pancreas, the long and thin situated behind our stomach. Pancreas is responsible for regulating the body\u2019s use of glucose. It has two main functions: firstly to produce pancreatic endocrine hormones which assist in regulating our metabolism and secondly to produce pancreatic digestive enzymes. When the blood glucose levels begin to rise, it is insulin\u2019s job to push muscle and fat cells to absorb whatever glucose they need for future activities whereas any surplus will store by the liver. There are some individuals either do not produce enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or their body resists whatever insulin is produced (Type 2 diabetes), thus an outside source production is necessary. Either way, the result is the same. Type 1 or also know as juvenile-onset diabetes, typically affects children and young adults and is genetically-linked. Type 2 which also known as adult-onset diabetes occurs in adults and is linked to obesity. Symptoms of both types include blurred vision, fatigue, frequent, bladder infections, increased appetite, increased thirst, increased urination, nausea, skin infections, vaginitis and vomiting. If not treated, diabetes type 1 and 2, can cause blood vessel damage, gangrene, heart attack, kidney damage, nerve damage, stork and vision problems. How Glucosium Can Help: Glucosium is a popular diabetes treatment of natural ingredients which can help control blood sugar, stimulate your body\u2019s insulin production, limit nerve damage and much more. This revolutionary supplement has shown amazing benefits for people with diabetes, as well as preventative properties for those who are exposed to a higher risk for diabetes. Last advice: do exercise, eat right and supplement your body with the proper nutrients that help your body to produce the insulin it was supposed to have.

I dunno, a bit early for Christmas busy-ness maybe. School's in until the 22nd this year, which is quite late. I would think that Canada Customs this Saturday will take you about an hour to clear. That should be in good enough time to walk out to the curb, find the Connector and board. I don't know what their procedure is if you miss it. They may very well pop you on to the next bus, 2 hours later. I like Craigdarroch Castle . It was built by Robert Dunsmuir, coal baron, industrialist and the premier of our province, for his wife. His son James built Hatley Castle, over by Rodd Hill, for his wife. If you visit both houses, you can see the difference in wealth between Father and Son. There is a good set of story boards positioned in a room which explains the house and the times. Oh, they have a few audio hand sets, I think for a fee. You can get a sense of the kind of man and the impact he had in Victoria and on the Island all the way up to Cumberland, near Courtenay. biographi.ca/en/bio/dunsmuir_robert_11E.html James Dunsmuir, his son, was an industrialist, politician and then Lieutenant Gov of BC. biographi.ca/en/bio/dunsmuir_james_14E.html He designed Ladysmith as a company town for his miners. Butchart Gardens will be magical at sunset and later. Their Christmas light display consists of thousands of lights along the pathways comingling with all the characters of the \"12 Days of Christmas.\" Look for the partridge in the pear tree, the 8 Lords a Leaping and the Seven Swans a Swimming (which will be in the lake on the far edge of the property.) I'd pull out at the Malahat Lookout on the way up Island giving you an overview of Saanich Inlet. Map: https://goo.gl/maps/CVLedt5zQX52 You can look at the Kinsol Trestle near Shawnigan Lake to see if that would fit in. Quite remarkable. https://www.cvrd.bc.ca/1379/Kinsol-Trestle Map: https://goo.gl/maps/NbTTdcaj9xM2 Ladysmith is quite interesting. Named by Dunsmuir after Ladysmith, South Africa in remembrance of the end of the Boer War. It's on the 49th parallel, which is the border with the US that extends across to Toronto .

(YuYao Gao) Recently, a child star has attracted attention in China, and she published a very interesting rap song: \u201cFreestyle In the Girl\u2019s Dorm\u201d. Thousands of reposts were received on weibo just one day. The song is sung by a girl named Yuyao Gao, who is only 12 years old. She is a talented child star since childhood, and she has lots of perform experiences on CCTV, local TV and other important events. There are countless art awards she has got. Apart from a great singer, she also has the talent on acting. She got a role in the TV Situation Sitcom \u201cfamily with children\u201d, and also directed and acted in many children\u2019s micro-films by herself. \n(YuYao Gao) Today, Yuyao Gao has been influenced by the hip-hop, and learning rap with the China hip-hop leader group \u2013 XinJieKou Band.It\u2019s amazing that under the guidance of her teacher she finished the whole song independently as the generation after 00\u2019s. \n(Xinjiekou) Her performance means that the first post-00 rapper enters the Chinese music industry and is now the youngest female rapper to officially release her single rap song. More and more children are fond of hip-hop with the support of their parents. In the past the choices were folk music and main stream music. (Group) \nThe new era is quite unexpected. \nWe are expecting hip-hop will be flourishing in China and perhaps make a bigger surprise for the world. \nMedia Contact Company Name: FINANCE NEWS CO., LTD.

I have no idea how old this one is beyond that. It is rough, the frame is tweaked a bit in the front. One hand grip is missing. One pedal is missing. Bearings are sloppy in the rear wheel and 3 spokes are broken. I am unsure but would guess the wheels are not original but the speedometer is original to the wheels. However, it is missing the face and does not work. One of the rear fender supports has been replaced and somewhat poorly. It does have its unmolested front badge. I am not in desperate need to sell this bike as it does not take up much storage space, but i figured I'd see if there is much interest in it. Make a reasonable offer.

Collective responsibility needs to be exercised through \u2018consensus building,\u201d said Pakistan\u2019s ambassador and Permanent Representative to UN Office in Geneva Farukh Amil while speaking at the South-South Human Rights Forum held at People\u2019s Great Hall in Beijing. \nThe Forum \u2013 Building a Community of Shared Future of Human Beings: New Opportunity for South-South Human Rights Development was jointly organized by the State Council Information Office of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People Republic of China. \nFarukh Amil said that human dignity also means sharing prosperity and helping others in need, adding, \u201cLet me state that 86 percent of refugees are hosted in the developing countries, including Pakistan.\u201d \nThe ambassador said only a year old, Pakistan gave shelter to refugees from Poland in 1948 and continued through the decades to give refuge from those escaping conflict and persecution from the Middle East, Africa, Asia and against Europe. \nSince 1980, Pakistan has hosted more than twice the number of refugees than the entire Europe in the last five years. \n\u201cWe all must support each other and help the people in crises and need, since the human rights are universal and everyone has the right to live with human dignity,\u201d he added. READ Muslims across Pakistan to celebrate Eid Milad-un-Nabi (PBUH) on Sunday \nHe said the UN charter and uniform application of international law is also essential to address new emerging concerns and non-conventional security threats including extremism, terrorism, major communicable diseases, climate change, armed conflicts etc. \nIn the wake of thee unprecedented challenges, peace and development through mutual cooperation is the only solution, he added. \nAmbassador Farukh Amil said the climate change and consequential disasters are deeply affecting the socio-economic rights of the citizens of this planet and poses serious threat to the very existence of human kind, adding. \u201cWe need to find a way to co-exist with nature in harmony. \nHe said the development aspiration must be pursued in a way that does not further marginalize and starve billions of those vulnerable to climate change caused by a handful few. \nHe highlighted that climate change is undermining human rights of small island developing states and the people from mountainous region, who are facing imminent threats of rising sea levels and melting glaciers respectively. \nAmbassador Farukh Amil said that Pakistan, China and the East Asian countries fed by the Indus, the Yangtze and the Mekong Rivers stand to suffer more than others. \nClimate change is violating rights to lives and livelihoods. The impact of climate change must, therefore, be mainstreamed in the global human rights agenda, he added. \nHe said with industrial robots increasing by 18 percent per year another important discussion we must have in the context of poverty alleviation is the rise of robots and artificial intelligence. \nHe said as more people gain freedom from poverty, secure their human dignity the robots will not just be at the cutting edge of innovation but also undertaking dangerous and dirty jobs, freeing up humanity.

That must be addressed through innovative solutions, such as universal basic income. \n\u201cAs a way forward in our quest to build a community of shared future and ensuring human rights and human dignity through prosperity, he offered four avenues for concerted action,\u201d he added. \nHe said technology is a great equalizer and it overcomes barriers of geography and race and offers economic opportunities that promote equality. \n\u201cWe must allow improved trading opportunities and regional connectivity to promote shared economic development,\u201d he added. \nHe said, the existing trading regime must be made more open, transparent, inclusive and non-discriminatory. Regional connectivity must be promoted to offer legal economic opportunity. \nIn this context, China\u2019s One Belt and One Road Initiative, supported by over 100 countries and international organizations is a landmark initiative. \nChina Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship project under this initiative, is shining example of cooperation for the realization of the right to development and enhancing connectivity in the region and great civilizations, he added. \nHe said that it has transformative impact by focusing on local employment generation, boosting economic growth through investment in energy and industrial zones and building infrastructure. \nThis project is providing great opportunity for the whole region to prosper is truly building a community of shared future.

Deadline recently announced that Tarantino is working on a Star Trek movie and added that they could collaborate with Paramount Pictures. Star Trek's director previously pointed to the possibility of this project. \nTarantino is working closely with J.J. Abrams for a new Star Trek movie. Abrams enjoyed Tarantino's ideas about the film and took these ideas to people at Paramount. It is rumoured that Abrams is currently looking for people to write the screenplay. If everything goes smoothly Tarantino and Abrams might create an exceptional Star Trek movie together. \nThis means that, we will get a chance to see Star Trek through Tarantino's exceptional vision. Without doubt, this movie will be a new path for both Star Trek and Tarantino. Tarantino is known for working on original stories and this project will be his first movie in sci-fi genre. \nQuentin Tarantino is currently working on a project about Charles Manson and his murders. This project is expected to reach out the audience in August 9, 2019. If Tarantino directs this Star Trek project, this movie will be his 10th film. Tarantino formerly stated that he will stop working as a director after 10 movies. Nothing is certain at the moment, yet it would be really interesting to see a Star Trek movie as a farewell to cinema.

takeover by Foxy Bingo owner GVC (PA) 0 comments \nGambling giant Ladbrokes is in \u201cdetailed\u201d talks over a takeover by online rival and Foxy Bingo owner GVC in a deal worth up to \u00a33.9 billion. \nGVC \u2013 which also owns Sportingbet and PartyCasino \u2013 has tabled a cash-and-shares approach valuing Ladbrokes at 160.9p a share, with loan notes on top worth an extra 42.8p a share. \nThe tie-up would create an online-led gambling giant with operations worldwide. \nIt would see Ladbrokes Coral shareholders own around 46.5% of the combined group and GVC around 53.5%. \nGVC chief executive Kenneth Alexander is expected to lead the combined group, although the firms said plans for the final management line-up would be worked out over the coming weeks. \nThe firms said: \u201cThe enlarged group would be an online-led globally positioned betting and gaming business that would benefit from a multi-brand, multi-channel strategy applied across some of the strongest brands in the sector. \n\u201cThe enlarged group would be geographically diversified with a large portfolio of businesses across both regulated and developing markets, with the scale and resources to address the dynamics of a rapidly changing global industry.\u201d \nThe talks come after two previous attempts at a deal between the pair, but the latest discussions broke down in the summer over price and ahead of the Government\u2019s gambling review. \nThe final price that GVC is prepared to pay for Ladbrokes depends on the outcome of the review of fixed-odds betting terminals (FOTBs), which could see the maximum stake slashed to as little as \u00a32 from \u00a3100. \nIt comes amid a wave of consolidation in the sector, which has been under pressure pending the review, which is expected to significantly cut earnings from the lucrative betting machines \u2013 dubbed the crack cocaine of gambling. \nLadbrokes completed its \u00a32.3 billion merger with Coral in November last year, but it is understood GVC first approached Ladbrokes over a tie-up when it was finalising the deal. \nGVC said it expects \u201cmaterial synergies\u201d from a merger with Ladbrokes, which it would lay out in any forthcoming firm offer. \nThe combined group would have beefed up operations across some of the world\u2019s biggest regulated online gaming markets, including the UK, Italy and Australia. \n\u201cThe enlarged group would have strong growth prospects with momentum in its online businesses, potential for material synergies including the use of leading proprietary technology, and the opportunity to select the best of both people and operations,\u201d the firms added. \nLadbrokes has nearly 3,700 bookies on the high street, while Isle of Man-based GVC has a raft of brands

He said his decision marked the start of a \u201cnew approach\u201d to solving the thorny conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Trump\u2019s predecessors \u2014 from Bill Clinton to George Bush \u2014 made similar promises on the campaign trail, but quickly reneged upon taking office, and the burden of war and peace. This most unlikely of presidents, who came to office with no foreign policy experience and denouncing experts, was determined to show his arrival in Washington spells the end of business as usual. \u201cMany presidents have said they want to do something and they didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Trump said in the hours leading up to his historic address. \u201cWhether it\u2019s courage or they changed their mind, I can\u2019t tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s long overdue.\u201d OUTRAGE The announcement leaves many angry US allies and leaders across the Middle East trying to find a measured response and hoping that the tinderbox region is not destined for yet another round of bloodletting. Pope Francis joined a list of leaders warning of an historic misstep that could trigger a surge of violence. \u201cI cannot silence my deep concern over the situation that has emerged in recent days,\u201d the pontiff said Wednesday, one day after speaking by phone with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas. The pontiff added that maintaining Jerusalem\u2019s status quo was important \u201cin order to avoid adding new elements of tension to an already volatile world that is wracked by so many cruel conflicts.\u201d In a frantic series of calls, the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the European Union, France, Germany and Turkey also warned Trump against the move.

submitted by Brexit Secretary \u2018don\u2019t include impact assessment\u2019 Opposition MPs have called for David Davis to be sacked (Dominic Lipinski/PA) 1 comment \nThe documents handed over to Parliament by Brexit Secretary David Davis last month are \u201cunderwhelming\u201d and do not amount to an assessment of the likely impact on the UK economy of withdrawal from the EU, a senior peer has said. \nLord Jay of Ewelme, the acting chair of the House of Lords EU Committee and former senior civil servant, said that he would have expected a \u201cproper\u201d impact assessment to be conducted to inform the Government of the likely effect of Brexit on different sectors of industry. \nThere were calls from opposition MPs for Mr Davis to be sacked after he admitted to the Commons Exiting the EU Committee on Wednesday that his department had carried out no formal impact assessments for the Government\u2019s Brexit plans. \nDavid Davis has misled parliament. He MUST resign. If you agree, add your name now and back our call >> https://t.co/GvgvjzCGST pic.twitter.com/XKMCnBhQSU \n\u2014 Liberal Democrats (@LibDems) December 6, 2017 \nBut Mr Davis appeared to have dodged threats of an investigation for alleged contempt of Parliament, after the committee ruled that he had adequately fulfilled the terms of a Commons motion requiring him to hand over 58 sectoral impact assessments believed to have been drawn up by the Department for Exiting the EU. \nThe committee split on party lines, with 10 Conservatives and one Democratic Unionist agreeing that Mr Davis had complied with Parliament\u2019s requirements by handing over 850 pages of analysis of sectors of the UK economy, given that no impact assessments of the kind described in the motion existed. \nEight opposition MPs voted that the Brexit Secretary had not complied with the motion. David Davis gives evidence to the Commons Exiting the EU Committee (PA) \nThe 850-page cache of documents, handed to cross-party committees in the Commons and Lords but not yet published, are understood to describe existing conditions in various sectors of the economy, but not to forecast how they will be affected by Brexit. \nLord Jay told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that his committee was \u201cgoing through them pretty systematically now\u201d. \n\u201cThey are quite interesting but they are pretty underwhelming,\u201d said Lord Jay. \n\u201cThey don\u2019t really include an impact assessment, as far as I can tell. \n\u201cI would have thought there would have been a proper impact assessment, a proper assessment of what the impact of leaving the EU is going to be on different sectors of the economy. \n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got is interesting, and there\u2019s a lot of good information there, but I can\u2019t really say it\u2019s a real impact assessment. It\u2019s a fairly underwhelming report.\u201d \nUpdate: Earlier this afternoon I wrote to the Speaker of the House of Commons calling on him to initiate contempt of Parliament proceedings and bring forward a debate on a resolution of contempt of Parliament after @DavidDavisMP was shown to have misled and lied to Parliament. https://t.co/J63TewJzFU \n\u2014 David Lammy (@DavidLammy) December 6, 2017 \nTransport Secretary Chris Grayling said there had been a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d about the nature of the work being done within Government. \n\u201cWe have done extensive work on the impact of European law on different sectors of the UK economy,\u201d Mr Grayling told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \n\u201cWe have done it in my department on the different areas of transport, other departments have done the same, and there are 800 pages of analysis that have been prepared and supplied to the Brexit Committee. \n\u201cWhat we haven\u2019t done is rework all the arguments from the referendum campaign all over again. \n\u201cThere are people who believe we are doing the wrong thing\u2026 who want us to produce detailed analyses saying \u2018in this scenario, this situation will occur to this business\u2019. \n\u201cThe truth is that we have to approach the negotiations right now in the best possible way for Britain and the work we are doing is to prepare the UK for these negotiations, to understand all the areas affected by EU law.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jay of ewelme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominic lipinski/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grayling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris grayling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david lammy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of commons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc radio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc radio 4\u2019s today", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic unionist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of lords eu committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:51.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8d10ef241894a2cf72e81b0244c1958781bb78e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU45jcDN7YFxvsu032JfOD._PVqFZ5Db.ypbc5HvTyw8pYO1iSuJ4w32rBI01Bv9AoSWxddY4xlo70QuDmiekvlofZFwIUfOS8buqm.GADVmuuw--", "site_full": "lufkindailynews.com", "site": "lufkindailynews.com", "site_section": "http://lufkindailynews.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=sports*&f=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Lufkin News - sports", "title": "Lady Panthers hold off Hudson", "title_full": "Lady Panthers hold off Hudson", "published": "2017-12-06T08:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/lufkindailynews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/9d/29d253b4-28fb-5941-9fd3-e7e2d37c8fa1/5a278383446b7.image.jpg?resize=630%2C630", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8d10ef241894a2cf72e81b0244c1958781bb78e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU45jcDN7YFxvsu032JfOD._PVqFZ5Db.ypbc5HvTyw8pYO1iSuJ4w32rBI01Bv9AoSWxddY4xlo70QuDmiekvlofZFwIUfOS8buqm.GADVmuuw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gary Stallard For The Lufkin News", "published": "2017-12-06T08:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Lady Panthers hold off Hudson", "text": "GARY STALLARD/For The Lufkin News Hudson-Lufkin basketball \nHudson\u2019s Makiley Rhodes (22) finds room in the paint during Tuesday\u2019s game against Lufkin.

The legislation passed with a majority that wasn't challenged, although five lawmakers registered their opposition to the bill. Michael Masters | Getty Images News | Getty Images Members of Parliament voting on the marriage equlity bill at Parliament House on December 7, 2017 in Canberra, Australia \nThe Senate passed the same legislation last week 43 votes to 12. After royal assent and other formalities, the law will likely take effect in about a month, with the first weddings expected about a month later. \nAmendments meant to safeguard freedoms of speech and religion for gay-marriage opponents were all rejected, though those issues may be considered later. The government has appointed a panel to examine how to safeguard religious freedoms once gay marriage is a reality in Australia. \nLawmakers advocating marriage equality had argued that the national postal survey in November mandated a change of the marriage definition alone, so changing the law should not be delayed by other considerations. \n\"It is now our job as members of Parliament to pass a fair bill that does not extend or create any new discriminations,\" an emotional government lawmaker Warren Entsch, who helped draft the bill, told Parliament. \"It is a strong bill that already strikes the right balance between equality and freedom of religion.\" \n\"It's an historic day for Australia today and I think the celebrations around the country when we finally ... achieve marriage equality are going to be immense,\" Janet Rice said before the vote. Rice is a minor Greens party senator who was only able to remain married to her transgender wife of 31 years, Penny, because Penny remained listed as male on her birth certificate. \nPenny Wong, an opposition Labor Party senator who has two children with her lesbian partner, said: \"I am feeling happy.\" \nGay marriage was endorsed by 62 percent of Australian voters who responded to the government-commissioned postal ballot. Total Votes: \nNot a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding. \nMost gay rights advocates believed the government should have allowed marriages years ago and saw various ideas for a public survey as a delaying tactic. The U.N. Human Rights Committee had called the ballot survey \"an unnecessary and divisive public opinion poll.\" \nThe current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws. \nOne of the rejected amendments would have ensured Australians could speak freely about their traditional views of marriage without fear of legal action. It was proposed by Attorney-General George Brandis and supported by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, both gay marriage supporters. \nFormer Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a high-profile advocate for traditional marriage, told Parliament that Turnbull and opposition leader Bill Shorten had failed to deliver detailed protections for freedoms of speech, conscience and religion in the bill. \n\"A promise was made by the leaders of this Parliament and the promise has not adequately been delivered on,\" Abbott said. \nAbbott pointed to an Australian teenager who lost her job for advocating against gay marriage on social media and an Australian Catholic bishop who was taken before a state anti-discrimination tribunal over a pamphlet he published extolling traditional marriage. The complaint against the bishop was dropped. \n\"The last thing we should want to do is to subject Australians to new forms of discrimination in place of old ones that are rightly gone,\" he said. SAEED KHAN | AFP | Getty Images Supporters hold placards as they attend a same-sex marriage rally in Sydney on September 10, 2017. \nGovernment lawmaker Trevor Evans ruled out an Australian equivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court case in which a baker who refused to provide a wedding cake for a gay couple argued he was exercising artistic freedom and was exempt from Colorado anti-discrimination laws. \n\"Let's be honest here, for a case like that to arise in Australia, it would require a gay couple who care more about activism than about the success of their own wedding, to find a business operator who cares more about religious doctrine than the commercial success of their own small business, and for both of them to commit to having a fight,\" Evans told Parliament. \n\"Typical Australians would genuinely question the bona fides of the players in a case like that and the slim prospects of that occurring doesn't warrant the pages and pages of commentary and debate that have been dedicated to it,\" he added. \nSeveral gay marriage opponents in Turnbull's conservative coalition have regarded marriage equality as inevitable and have welcomed an end to an issue that has long divided the government ranks. \nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann, a same-sex marriage opponent who oversaw the postal ballot, said he felt \"great satisfaction\" that the issue was resolved. \n\"It was a polarizing issue on which good Australians had strongly and sincerely held views on both sides of the argument,\" Cormann said. \n\"I and my colleagues on the coalition side always took the view that the best way to resolve a disagreement in the community like this is by giving the Australian people which we did, we kept faith with it, the Australian people embraced the process and the result was emphatic,\" he said. \nThe result is a political win for Turnbull, who became prime minister after deposing Abbott in 2015 in an internal government leadership ballot. \nAbbott was head-butted by a gay rights advocate during the postal survey campaign in September. Kevin Rudd, a center-left Labor Party prime minister whom Abbott defeated in elections in 2013, blamed the postal ballot for an assault on his godson Sean Foster, 19, as he campaigned for marriage equality a week earlier. \nVeteran gay rights campaigner Rodney Croome said he expected the first same-sex weddings in Australia would not take place until February. \nThe law will likely take effect after a month. State laws then require couples to give 28 days' notice of their intention to marry, Croome said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "george brandis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean foster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penny wong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill shorten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janet rice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "croome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trevor evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodney croome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mathias cormann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren entsch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin rudd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cormann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "australian parliament", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labor party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.n. human rights committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:51.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "975e1d2b5def1a5d7a7094e258d3fc204d1c7364", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3I6qNc_5bn9uYFVHTaduhElyR2XaeUR4AtDN4MYorR50v.OFTiu_.KurQ6afir0U3JHabHbJz9_vQ--", "site_full": "ericstgcaptions.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://ericstgcaptions.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Eric's Transgender Captions", "title": "It's Time", "title_full": "It's Time", "published": "2017-09-07T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d82290dd9011c877b21424eb2be4b1fbf20964ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3I6qNc_5bn9uYFVHTaduhElyR2XaeUR4AtDN4MYorR50v.OFTiu_.KurQ6afir0U3Jg0T_lle8C92ZfMfvy3Hb3", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "none malik", "published": "2017-12-07T11:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "viagra asli \nobat viagra \nviagra original ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:51.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6f69547f4c2ab8a6a4ce2518dbcb006f4afcdd16", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTcNYA7VvCdojEn5gk_f1V9xPalOADWocY9VrI.i8RBs6b4fPY3GXMWbHPQpfpezOdmtL35B_7iAYTSj_KiJ9zdoKopjZ0tEDPR4XxbR_fb1g--", "site_full": "baltimore.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://baltimore.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist baltimore | for sale search", "title": "THE ANTHEM TICKETS -

The furfural derivatives market is not fully commercialized. Increased demand for products from renewable and biodegradable sources, as well as growing consumption from the food industry have led to increased demand for furfural derivatives. Asia Pacific and Europe are expected to dominate the global furfural derivatives market. Asia Pacific is the chief producer and consumer of furfuryl alcohol, because China and India contribute the highest consumption. Europe follows Asia Pacific in consumption due to increases in the number of application areas for furfural alcohol and the products of furfural derivatives. The use of furfural derivatives integration in biorefineries is expected to increase across Europe due to their various environmental benefits. Governments in Europe also support bio-based products, since they hold a high potential to provide the foundation for the future environment-friendly economy.

The bad news is, we are all doomed. So, get ready and as Morty once said,\"Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, everybody's gonna die. Come watch TV.\". \nFor the season trailer, more footage is shown of the upcoming six episodes, all combined in a fashion that will make you even more worried about the dark future ahead. Ironically, Louis Armstrong's \"What A Wonderful World\" plays as we have look at the gloomy dystopian worlds they created for us. Once again, the episodes deal with humanity's deepest darkest fears and criticize the wrong use of technology to remind us there are many dark sides we should all be concerned about, leaving us with a massive existential crisis that is creeping down upon us. \n\"It's hard to imagine a bright future.\" the trailer says. Indeed it is. To sum it up: \"A sunnier future\" might not ever come. In a time where nothing is private anymore, having faith in a system that doesn't benefit anyone won't bring us the \"happily after\" that we all long for anyhow, but everything happens for a reason. \nYou can watch all the previous sneak peaks for the season below. \nCrocodile: People's memories are considered to be \"biased\" and they are no longer private thanks to a new device. \nArkangel: Helicopter parenting on a whole new level. A concerned mother takes her daughter to a clinic where they install a surveillance tool on her temple. \nHang the DJ: Giving \"Lobster\" vibes, the episode deals with online dating. People are paired using an advanced dating system, which also decides how long the relationship will last. \nUSS Callister: The episode looks like a hilarious Star-Trek rip off TV show in which a new member of a spaceship tries to adapt to her new life. \nMetalhead: This black and white episode is set in a bleak, post-apocalyptic world where technology threatens human life. \nBlack Museum: Story within a story. A woman visits a crime museum where she is to experience the horrific details of those displayed.

Pakistan\u2019s energy crisis. A middle-class household with five to six members on average uses a refrigerator, washing machine, television, laptop, two air-conditioners and kitchen-specific home appliances. The circular debt in the energy sector can be attributed to not only ballooning population and increasingly tech-savvy households but also wasteful practices. \nInefficient home appliances result in a shocking 25% electricity wastage. For example, 20-years-old refrigerators use 50% more power than updated ones. Additionally, over-stuffing the refrigerator, neglecting its maintenance, putting hot items in it and keeping the door open for a long time overburdens it. Invest in latest energy saving fridge, place it in a warm and well-ventilated area, clean the condenser coils regularly and keep the temperature between 35 and 38 degrees Celsius. Artificial heating and cooling systems add unnecessary pressure on electric supply PHOTO:Conservation Magazine \nAccording to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, phantom power alone accounts for 10% of the monthly bill. This is the power consumed by appliances like iron, television and air-conditioner when they are off but still plugged in. A power-strip in each room can save valuable time and money. \nReplacing incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) is the most effective way to slow down the meter. CFLs have a longer life and are 10% more efficient than regular bulbs which waste 99% electricity. This means that old bulbs give out 1% as light energy and the rest is wasted in the form of heat energy. Old, orange bulbs may be burning a hole in your pocket \nAir-conditioners with their perpetual presence in Pakistan\u2019s scorching summers account for 60% of the bill. One can recuperate the initial high price of an inverter in just three months since it lowers electricity bill by 35%. Furthermore, regular maintenance of the air-conditioner ensures that it does not have to over-work as there is a steady out-flow of air. \nAccording to Home Energy , 13% of the electricity is used by a washing machine to heat the water, 81% to dry clothes and only 6% to wash them. Hence, one should ideally wash clothes in cold water or use natural hot water from 12pm to 4pm and air-dry them afterwards Use front-load washers to conserve electricity. PHOTO: Reuters \nForbes warned that hefty desktop computers guzzle up 80% more electricity than laptops and gaming PCs need three times the energy taken up by a refrigerator. It went on to advise households and workplaces to slash 30% of the monthly bill by substituting CRT monitors with LCD, adjusting its brightness and limiting the use of gaming consoles. Bulky monitors guzzle up electricity very quickly PHOTO:Reuters. \nGovernment driven supply-side initiatives are primarily long term which is why consumers need to look for intermediate solutions like conservation. This does not necessarily mean imposing a black-out in the house or sweating out in the heat. Smart use of household appliances can lower Pakistan\u2019s energy needs by 17%, resulting in two less hours of daily load-shedding.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. environmental protection agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters  forbes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "home energy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:54.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2273709a502be6528f9c8e6b16e2a757ed4ee3f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.U.xw7cYFV71ingPDuIohhpLOMoxZJAr3qvsZ2.uA7HPVtbI3YrqDtj8Zmmnvg3N__feJ0TGsb3fLUDd520LSf3qGZJrQ4tsFMbO3jJOC6pg--", "site_full": "www.usmessageboard.com", "site": "usmessageboard.com", "site_section": "http://www.usmessageboard.com/forums/congress.89/", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "Congress | US Message Board - Political Discussion Forum", "title": "How many jews in our Congress | Page 2", "title_full": "How many jews in our Congress | Page 2 | US Message Board - Political Discussion Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T10:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.usmessageboard.com/data/avatars/m/50/50023.jpg?1482684888", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e19900b56a0e2722817b51295d3f6fca3ab9dde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.U.xw7cYFV71ingPDuIohhpLOMoxZJAr3qvsZ2.uA7HPVtbI3YrqDtj8Zmmnvg3N__feJ0TGsb3fLUDd520LSf3qGZJrQ4tsHVSWRC8NeM6vuMa_b_PQ.T", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "DOTR", "published": "2017-12-06T13:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "MisterBeale said: \u2191 The US has as many Native Americans as it has Jews.\nHow many Native Americans are in Congress Penelope?

I was like, 'How does this...?' \"I mean, it was very reminiscent of the era, obviously. I felt very young wearing braces again. I had braces at that age; I remember how painfully self-conscious I was at that age about everything. When I was little, my mum cut my hair short in a bowl cut, too.
