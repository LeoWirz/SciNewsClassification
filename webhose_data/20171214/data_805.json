Image: iStock \n4 Arlene Foster (right) has put a spanner in the works for Theresa May. \nA hard border would be a nightmare scenario. Currently, you can drive back and forth across the border, often unaware that you've changed jurisdictions. Often there is no sign of any indication that you have left or entered the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland. \nThis is not just true along this one stretch of road either. Those who live in border areas often crossing the invisible line several times a day. Businesses operate seamlessly on either side of the border. Companies routinely have some aspect of production on one side of the border and ship half finished products back and forth. \nFor example, Ireland's renowned cream liqueur, Baileys, is composed of milk and whiskey that comes from both sides of the border and mixed in one production facility. All of that might have to be unwound in the event of a hard border being implemented. 4 Will we see hard borders put in place between the Republic and the six counties? \nWith Phase One Brexit talks again stalled due to the Irish border issue, May now has to convince either the Irish government (which has the backing of the rest of the European Union) to accept a hard border or persuade the die-hard Brexiteers to give up on the idea of leaving the common market, and accept \"regulatory alignment\u201d with the EU through the whole of Britain and Northern Ireland. \nWhat do you think is the best solution?

A musical concert was going on right behind the Hungarian Parliament house. The music was nice and peppy but the language being Hungarian was incomprehensible. I lost interest soon and wandered away to a nearby Cafe. The quaint cafe overlooking the Danube had a great view of the illuminated Parliament.\n \nI asked the owner if they had tea and Wi-Fi. He chuckled and replied \u2018Yes, we have tea and free wi-fea\u2019. We both laughed at the deliberate rhymed words. He took my order and came back with the food in a short time. After serving he pulled a chair and sat next to me. He was almost my age, not very tall, quite thin and had a chiseled face. His English was not very good but that did not deter our conversation. He said he had visited India couple of times and even been to Mumbai. He seemed quite excited talking about India. Within no time we were discussing our respective countries.\nMy Hungarian Dinner This is what I love about travelling. Travelling exposes you to new people, new culture, new food and new things. Each time I travel I come back with memories of the people I met, the food I ate, and new things that I learnt.\nDeserted Street Pest side at night Chain Bridge Unlike, Mumbai shops shut down quite early in Budapest. I left the cafe and started walking towards the deserted bank of Danube. The riverside that was brimming with tourists in the afternoon was now empty and forlorn. It was getting cold. I pulled my jacket and wrapped my arms around. I stopped near the Shoes on the Danube and tried to imagine the pain of all those who had to jump into the Danube on that fateful night when the Nazis attacked. It must have been devastating.\nI was alone and engrossed in my thoughts when I saw an elderly homeless man approaching towards me. Budapest is a city where in every corner you get to see a homeless person scavenging for food and clothes. The man came near me. He was wearing dirty and torn clothes and had dishevelled hair. He was carrying a big jhola . There was not a single soul around, other than myself and this man. He came too close to me and started muttering something in Hungarian. I was unable to understand a single word other than \u2018cigarette\u2019. I was damn scared however what I understood was that he needed cigarettes. I fumbled but somehow managed to utter that I didn\u2019t have a cigarette and almost ran away from the place. I had been warned of muggers in Europe and this man closely resembled the description. Maybe he was not a mugger and probably just wanted a cigarette but these are perils of solo travel where you cannot take risk. I didn\u2019t waste any more time wandering on the lonely streets of Budapest and headed towards my apartment.

The better you can articulate why you need creativity today, the more naturally you\u2019ll find it. 2 Rebel Against the Greatest Tyrannies I was born here and I\u2019ll die here\u2026 against my will. \u2013Bob Dylan Dylan captures the ultimate rebellion, that we\u2019re all here against our will. But there is a spectrum of rebellion, and we get the choice to choose what we\u2019ll stand against. It\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of rebelling by mindlessly rejecting everything. This type of rebelling produces clickbait, digital lynch mobs, or plotless stories. The alternative would be rebelling against specific, well-defined evils. This aspirational rebellion produces a powerful brand of creativity. Test how much you\u2019re able to boost your creativity by rebelling against evil that others blindly accept. Reformation is driven by those who confront evil, and reap the massive gain in creativity. 3 Be an Idiot to the Insane As dreams that were momentous by night may seem simply silly in the light of day, so the poet and the prophet can discover themselves playing the idiot before a jury of sober eyes. \u2013Joseph Campbell Perhaps Campbell is too kind when he says, \u201cjury of sober eyes.\u201d One of the largest challenges about being creative is how harshly you\u2019ll be judged. Don\u2019t worry, because the jury or populace isn\u2019t sober. They might just be insane. Our brief human history is studded with examples of ad hoc juries, both tribal and religious, who have killed, sacrificed, isolated, or ostracized our most creative. If you\u2019re going to practice becoming more creative, get ready to be viewed as an idiot by the insane. Think of it as a badge of honor. Plus, the recognition that we are despised by others often gives us the greatest creative gains. 4 Stop Explaining Yourself, and Flip the Script So now I am back\u200a\u2014\u200ain my next iteration, you might say.\u200a\u2014\u200aIan Malcolm One of Michael Crichton\u2019s most famous characters and ciphers is Ian Malcolm, however be dies in Jurassic Park . Crichton soon realizes he needs a cipher for the sequel, The Lost World , so he brings Ian Malcolm back with a few sentences: \u201c\u2026but it turned out I was only slightly dead. The surgeons have done wonders, as they will be the first to tell you. So now I am back\u200a\u2014\u200ain my next iteration, you might say.\u201d Stop explaining yourself or trying to justify your actions to a jury of sober eyes. Flip the script when you need to, and bring back characters from the dead. Make bold, one hundred and eighty degree moves when your intuition, logic, and evidence warrant it. There is nothing more anti-evolutionary than trying to cling to choices that no longer serve us. Creativity will find a way. 5 Build a Mental Dam that Channels a Controlled Stream of Ideas The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination. \u2013Albert Einstein There is an endless river of ideas running through our minds. This river of constantly flowing ideas might be fun or beautiful to behold, but the real magic doesn\u2019t happen until we do the hard work of building a dam (habits, routines, creative outlets, etc\u2026) and generating power. Only by taking the time to build a dam for ideas so we can channel them will we ever be able to get anything out of that endless river. Start building the dam today. 6 Stop Telling Stories About Your Past The only thing that\u2019s keeping you from getting what you want is the story you keep telling yourself. \u2013Tony Robbins I used to think I couldn\u2019t tell stories. Then I realized this was because all my mental bandwidth was consumed in personal storytelling about my past. I was telling myself an endless narrative of my life and past events. When we stop telling ourselves stories about our past, we free ourselves from stale narratives, and instead use those storytelling energies towards speaking a better future into existence. 7 Scrub off Self-Censorship Self-censorship is a lie to yourself; if you are going to be trying to seriously create art, to create literary art, and you decide to hold back, to censor yourself, then you are a fool to yourself and it would be better that you kept your mouth shut and did not speak. \u2013Salman Rushdie Society and culture directly and indirectly teach self-censorship. With digital media, those methods of teaching censorship are becoming increasingly sophisticated. In order to get to a place where your creativity and ideas can emerge easily, you\u2019ll have to scrub off years of self-censorship. 8 Take Care of Your Body (and upgrade it!) Take care of your body. It\u2019s the only place you have to live. \u2013Jim Rohn If we think of ourselves as technology, we can better care for all the components. Our bodies are hardware, and our minds produce the operating system and software we use to interact with the world. So why do some people take better care of their smartphones than their bodies and minds? In order to be creative, we have to value the most valuable technology in the world: our bodies and brains. We get this hardware free at birth, and nobody demos it for us like a Steve Jobs\u2019 keynote. When we upgrade our bodies and minds with better inputs and challenges, creativity becomes a natural byproduct. 9 Take Care of Your Mind (and upgrade it too!) True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. \u2013Wilhelm von Humboldt Awhile ago, I noticed I had put off updating the OS on my phone. It\u2019s the same with our minds. It\u2019s easy to forget to periodically upgrade our OS. If we want everything to run more smoothly, we have to: read, do, conversate, or seek out direct experience. 10 Direct Experience > Filtered Experience I eventually realized that direct experience is the most valuable experience I can have. Western man is so surrounded by ideas, so bombarded with opinions, concepts, and information structures of all sorts, that it becomes difficult to experience anything without the intervening filter of these structures. \u2013Michael Crichton Direct experiences are where we interact with something (nature, another person, ourselves) without a digital or cultural filter. When we face these experiences without the lens of others, institutions, or media that tells us what we think, better ideas emerge. 11 Learn to Use Technology or it Will Use You Technology is a useful servant but a dangerous master. \u2013Christian Lous Lange Sometimes when my wife is driving, I\u2019ll look at the drivers around us. It\u2019s terrifying how many of them have their eyes glued to their phones. You\u2019ve probably noticed them on the interstate, with kids in the car, or as they speed through crosswalks. They\u2019re all risking the lives of others, or themselves, for one more tiny hit of dopamine. We all will either use or be used by technology. 12 Consume the Best Information, But Don\u2019t Forget to Create The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. \u2013Steven Spielberg When we eat to eat, we can get sick. When we eat strategically, we can gain nourishment. As creatives, anytime we consume information, we have to ask what are we consuming and why? When we forget we\u2019re consuming information from the never ending firehouse of the internet, we tend to get sick, burned out, depressed, or anxious. When we consume information strategically, we can use our consumption to create. 13 Spin the Karmic Flywheel of Creativity Do to others what you want them to do to you. \u2013The Golden Rule My own creativity is sparked when I find out that something I\u2019ve done has helped someone else. This type of karmic proof spins the flywheel of creativity. There is no better way to spin this virtuous flywheel of creativity than by doing a random act of kindness for someone today. It\u2019s easy to only devote our creativity to work that takes a long time to provide us karmic results. When you put your creativity towards the service of others in a way where you can quickly see the results\u2026 the karmic flywheel spins, and you\u2019ll be reminded of how much good can come from a single creative insight. 14 The Source is Unlimited There is no scarcity of opportunity to make a living at what you love; there\u2019s only scarcity of resolve to make it happen. \u2013Wayne Dyer When we view the source of our imagination as unlimited, ideating becomes easier. The more you can view and act as if the source of our creativity is unlimited, the more we\u2019ll find that is the case. When we lose the mindset of the hoarder, we gain new ideas in abundance. 15 The Sea of the Imagination is Deep The sea gets deeper the further you walk into it.\u200a\u2014\u200a Nassim Nicholas Taleb Exploring the imagination can be treacherous. Don\u2019t let this stop you from leaving on the hero\u2019s journey to find new ideas, but be aware of the dangers. The sea is deep and vast, but when you respect it\u2019s power, you can navigate it effectively. 16 Your Mind is More Powerful Than AI [A] great misunderstanding accounts for public confusion about thinking machines, a misunderstanding perpetrated by the unrealistic claims researchers in AI have been making, claims that thinking machines are already here, or at any rate, just around the corner. -Hubert Dreyfus We have the most complicated piece of technology in the known universe\u2026 our brains. We each get access to this priceless technology, that all the venture capital in the world can\u2019t recreate. While everyone worries about AI, each of us already possess evolution\u2019s biologically strong AI with plenty of safety\u2019s built in. We each already possess the most expensive, valued, prized, and powerful piece of artificial intelligence in the known universe. If you make a move to take better care of it, you\u2019ll get better outputs. 17 Good Art Fuels Creativity If you actually succeed in creating a utopia, you\u2019ve created a world without conflict, in which everything is perfect. And if there\u2019s no conflict, there are no stories worth telling\u200a\u2014\u200aor reading! \u2013Veronica Roth When we take in good art, we prime ourselves to create. Just like food, the better we eat, the better our bodies function, the less mental fog we face. Art is the same way. View, read, or listen to better art today and better ideas will come your way. 18 Reality Is Only One Piece Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one. \u2013Albert Einstein If we view reality as meaningless, we\u2019ll drift into ennui. But if we view it as one part of a bigger masterpiece, we can find purpose. When we find and chose purpose, it always brings insights. 19 Stay Quiet, and if You Speak Up, Prepare for the Backlash Don\u2019t solicit feedback on your product, idea or your business just for validation purposes. You want to tell the people who can help move your idea forward, but if you\u2019re just looking to your friend, co-worker, husband or wife for validation, be careful. It can stop a lot of multimillion-dollar ideas in their tracks in the beginning. \u2013Sara Blakely When we seek to create, we meet a backlash of contempt. It can come from anywhere. We\u2019ve all encountered the person who reacts violently to new ideas. Creation is alien and scary to those who have become experts at self-censorship. The prospect of you creating will prompt terror in them. Expect a backlash or people going out of the way to try and censor you when you let your best ideas breathe. It\u2019s usually a sign that you\u2019re onto something. 20 Find Healthy Addictions Understanding the difference between healthy striving and perfectionism is critical to laying down the shield and picking up your life. Research shows that perfectionism hampers success. In fact, it\u2019s often the path to depression, anxiety, addiction, and life paralysis. \u2013Bren\u00e9 Brown Beware\u2026 creativity once sparked is a fire that must burn. Creating is an addiction, but fortunately it is much healthier than most others. If we don\u2019t allow creativity to flow through us, we risk going through withdrawals. This is also known as being blocked. All of us have had the experience of being around an artist who is going through withdrawals. It\u2019s not pleasant. Embrace the healthy addiction of creating daily, and don\u2019t be afraid to get your fix. 21 Your Mind Will Recharge By Generating New Ideas Our idea of relaxing is all too often to plop down in front of the television set and let its pandering idiocy liquefy our brains. Shutting off the thought process is not rejuvenating; the mind is like a car battery-it recharges by running. \u2013Bill Watterson The best way to recharge our minds is by using them. Our minds are far more powerful than we realize, and instead of zoning out when we\u2019re exhausted, we can move directly to creative pursuit. 22 Make a Small Move, Today The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. \u2013Lao Tzu You can make a small move towards more creativity today. Write down that idea, send those emails, draw that picture. Fight to be more creative today. We need your creativity, for all of our sakes.

Racecar fans will have an opportunity to pilot their own cars around the Sonoma Raceway as the Sonoma chapter of Speedway Children\u2019s Charities hosts the 5th annual Laps for Charity event Jan. 20. \nThe once-a-year-opportunity allows participants to take their vehicle for a few laps around the 12-turn road course. For $150, the unique experience includes a pre-lap classroom safety briefing with professional drivers, three lead-follow laps around the 2.52-mile circuit, a picture of your car on track, plus a \u201chot lap\u201d in the instructor\u2019s car. \nAll proceeds benefit kids in need through Sonoma County youth organizations. SCC, the charitable arm of Sonoma Raceway, has distributed more than $6 million to Sonoma County youth groups since 2001. \nA limited number of spots are now available between 11:30 a.m.-4 p.m. on Jan. 20. Participants must be at least 18 years old; passengers are not permitted. All cars must have shoulder strap seat belt restraints, mufflers and pass a basic technical inspection.

The council voted in favor of the contract after city attorney James Hill III said the deal with Nexcheck is a standard contract that he has review several times and had no problems with. Chris Bishop, who spearheaded the efforts to find a company to provide the utilities payment service, said he interview four companies. He said the service can expand to the city\u2019s municipal court system.

In fact, there was only one witness who was prepared, initially, to testify that Thomas behaved inappropriately. That was Angela Wright.But Wright was not a credible witness. During her interview with Senate Judiciary Committee staff, she refused to answer questions about her previous allegations against a former boss who, like Thomas, had fired her. The former boss\u2019s supervisor told the Judiciary Committee: Parallels - Mrs - Surbordinate - Vengeance - Supervisor I am struck by the startling parallels between what Mrs. Wright did [to my surbordinate] and what she is doing now. She vowed vengeance on a former supervisor for dismissal on the basis of incompetence. . . The entire process suggested a last-ditch attempt to stop the advancement of someone she resented.Had Wright testified before the Committee, she could not declined to answer questions about this without shattering her credibility. Thus, she would either have had to lie under oath or admit to a pattern of seeking revenge for firings by accusing former bosses of misconduct. Accordingly, she elected...

T-Girls bounce back in Piner Tournament (1 of ) SUMNER FOWLER/FOR THE ARGUS-COURIER A determined Jaden Krist helped Petaluma take consolation honors in the Piner Gold Rush Girls Basketball Tournament. GEORGE HAIRE FOR THE ARGUS-COURIER | December 5, 2017, 11:23AM | Updated 14 hours ago. Petaluma jumped to a double-figure lead and held it for the entire contest as the T-Girls captured the consolation bracket of the Piner Gold Rush Girls Basketball Tournament by easily getting by El Molino, 52-25, on Saturday afternoon in Santa Rosa. \nThe win was the second for Petaluma in the tourney after the T-Girls suffered a lopsided defeat at the hands of the eventual champion Colfax in the opening round. Colfax was forced to come from behind in the second half to overhaul Novato, 56-38, for the tournament title later on Saturday. \nFour starters scored early, and coach Jon Ratshin substituted liberally in the lopsided T-Girl victory over El Molino. It was the strongest overall effort by the Lady Trojans in the three-day tourney as they raised their early season record to 3-1. \nWith guard Kaleigh Pate looking more like the top prospect from last season leading the way, the T-Girls moved the ball quickly around the Lady Lion perimeter defense and Petaluma players wound up with good looks at the basket. Pate knocked in seven points, but her sharp passing, along with another complete-game performance by veteran Nicole Costa, helped locate open players behind Lady Lion defenders throughout the game. \nCosta scored 10 points and pulled down seven rebounds while playing only half the game. Reserves Sheriene Arikat and Angelia Scaccalosi each added 10 points in the balanced Petaluma offense. Scaccalosi drove hard to the basket every time she touched the ball in limited minutes, and it paid off with good passes by Pate and Costa. \nLate substitution Kassidy Bacon scored six points for the T-Girls in the fourth period. \nRatshin changed up the T-Girl defenses and occasionally mixed in a full-court zone defense, and it forced seven Lady Lion turnovers in the third period. It was the most focused defensive effort of the season by Petaluma. \nEl Molino came into the game with a record of 1-4 after defeating Sonoma County opponent Elsie Allen in the second round. Almost every shot opportunity by the Lady Lions was contested, and often the balls were off line. The defense of the T-Girls, paced by Costa, Pate and Arikat, was that intense. Petaluma 50, Summerfield 28 \nThe T-Girls shook their tournament scoring doldrums when they got past Summerfield Waldorf in the consolation round. After falling behind, 12-6, in the first quarter, Petaluma rallied to take a narrow three-point halftime lead, and coasted to victory over the Division 4 entry from Santa Rosa. \n\u201cIt was another cold start for us,\u201d admitted Ratschin. Petaluma finally overhauled Summerfield at the end of the second period, and was never headed the rest of the way. \nThe Lady Mustangs fell to 1-5 for the early season. \nSteady forward Costa scored 12 points for the T-Girls as they found the range in the second half. Costa was also the team leader in rebounds, averaging six per contest. \nSophomore Arikat topped the Trojans in scoring for the second consecutive game with a season-high 15 points. Jaden Krist gave balance to the T-Girl scoring with six points, with most of her scoring coming underneath. \nHigh scoring Isabelle Dean counted 18 for the Lady Mustangs. Dean averages 19.3 points per game. Colfax 52, Petaluma 17 \nColfax blew open the first-round game in the third period and went on to post an overwhelming win over the T-Girls in the Piner Tournament on Thursday evening. The defending tourney champions from the Sacramento area exploded for a 24-2 advantage following intermission to make a rout of it.

Always have been a shy guy, never had the guts to approach and show interest, let alone sexual interest. Was getting very pissed seeing other guys courting girls, i considered it disrespectful...\nMy sex life was porn and then some more porn, starting at 12 and continuing for a long time.\nIn fact, at 19, the first time i got close to a girl (actually she came close to me, she initiated dates etc), when at some point we were sitting on a bench and she was obviously expecting a kiss i started crying. Probably nerves/shame. She tried again the next time and I still couldn't do it and it eventually and rightfully fizzled out.\nThen, the fact that I was a virgin at 20 was weighing on me hard so i decided to see an escort. Bad first experience, didn't feel pleasure at all. Then I went to over 60 more escorts over the span of 4 years. I met some nice women, experienced, pleasant. As backwards as it might sound, i was focused on pleasing them and I felt no pleasure myself, and didn't even think that something is off. The good thing was that seeing all that porn and those women made me very good at sex. The bad thing is i was faking/acting it, it was just a character. Ladies were content because I was rocking them (luckily i am also well endowed) but as for myself, it was just a chore and a stressful one, because all it was doing was feeding or threatening my ego.\nThen comes my gf, i stop seeing escorts, start having sex with her. We get along well at first, then sex gets less and less. When I first had bareback sex with gf, i went into depersonalization. Actually, most of my sex was sort of a depersonalization. I was not interested mainly because I was masturbating. Even when going to escorts i was masturbating prior, to last longer. Gf eventually dumped me because of this, and it was a correct choice on her behalf, my porn consumption destroyed or intimacy/sex life.\nThe point is i was using porn as an outlet to my actual sex urges, so that when i was with a woman, i was sort of numb. I didn't feel anything during sex, no pleasure and orgasm was actually rather painful. I have not noticed all this and probably would not have noticed this at all had i not decided to cut out masturbation, fantasizing and watching porn from my life completely, still one of the best decisions i have made up to date (thx nofap, 3 months so far).\nNow the thing is that all those urges and impulses i was solving with porn, since there's no outlet, are showing up in my mind. I do my best to not give in and derive pleasure (i was able to get some pleasure with my imagination all the time, not with my senses). And now all those things I want to do during sex are surfacing and it's actually quite scary. Some of those things I was doing before also, but passively (rougher sex, dirty talking), because of my depersonalization I could escape the guilt/shame etc of doing them because in my mind they were sort of happening, but they were not my own impulses but what i had to do/ what's done to make sex good, basically what i learned to act.\n[NSFW]\nNow I can feel very strong impulses, like I'll literally and figuratively going to sexually own the next woman I am going to be with (hopefully i get back with gf), and own her in a very primal, animalistic way. Not really about rough sex but about making her mine, using her for my own pleasure, creamping her again and again (i never creampied anyone), then making her taste and swallow some of it, giving her facials and have her walk around the house with it dried up and then creamping her again. Or cumming on her tits in the morning and have her put her bra on and go to work like that. Or plug her up to keep cum inside. Or teaching and then having her deepthroat me and throatpie her whenever I want to. Spit on her face while i fuck her/creampie her and so on. Basically pumping every bit of cum I have in her or on her (if it ends up on her, making sure that ultimately it ends up in her/swallowing), marking her as mine again and again, using her and breaking her, making her my personal and exclusive whore (i'm not interested in sharing her or being with other women, i just want one).\nThis is very different from my former self, where the thought of me cumming in a woman was terrifying, and them her swallowing was something I wanted and done but at the same time something that felt very wrong and also made me sort of depersonalize. Same for facials.\nI feel these radical animalistic impulses very strongly and I sort of understand that sooner or later I will have to accept them and put them in practice but i'm kind of disoriented here, especially because my personality was built around me being a nice guy. And I will continue to be nice in all of the other aspects of live, it's just that in sex i now feel like owning and using the woman, making her the exclusive depository of my cum .\n[/NSFW]\nAny other people have had this sort of switch?

JOHN JACKSON ARGUS-COURIER SPORTS EDITOR | December 5, 2017, 1:57PM A St. Vincent de Paul student receiving an academic scholarship is not unusual. It is practically a rite of passage for students at one of the most prestigious academic schools in the North Bay. \nReceiving an athletic scholarship is not as common, and winning a scholarship in for acrobatics and tumbling is rare. \nAnd \u201cearn\u201d is exactly what led gymnast Jenna Mankowski to receive a scholarship to compete for the acrobatic and tumbling team at West Liberty University in West Virginia. \nAcrobatics and tumbling is a relative new college sport, and colleges are beginning to recruit more high school gymnasts for their teams. \nWest Liberty is a public university that was established in 1837, 26 years before West Virginia became a state, making it the oldest institution of higher education in West Virginia. \n\u201cI had offers from a lot of different schools and I visited them all,\u201d Mankowski said. \u201cI loved the West Liberty coaches and the school. I also liked that, although it is a D2 school, I would compete against some D1 schools.\u201d \nShe said she was especially impressed with the school\u2019s state-of-the-art training facilities and athlete-support staff. \nGymnastics has been practically a life-long avocation for Mankowski. She started working on her gymnastic career before her first birthday, and she began formal training at age 3 at Redwood Empire Gymnastics. \n\u201cWhen I was little, I loved flipping over. It was really fun,\u201d she said. \nNow a senior at St. Vincent de Paul High School, Mankowski has never changed her mind. If anything, 14 years of hard work and training has only strengthened her dedication. \n\u201cI practice all the time. It takes a lot of dedication and hard work, but I love it,\u201d she said. \nHer college decision was helped by West Liberty\u2019s reputation for being a quality business school, which fits right in with her plans to be a marketing major. \nThe St. Vincent senior is the daughter of Steve and Kathleen Mankowski. She has a 9-year-old younger sister, Elena.

Sylacauga (7-1) landed at No. 4, while Talladega (6-1) claimed No. 8 in the rankings. The teams will face each other Friday night at Sylacauga. \u201cIt\u2019s great for the kids to see that and to get recognized for all their hard work,\u201d Aggies head coach Will Copeland said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of it for the kids, the school and our basketball program. \u201cWe just try to keep working. We know that if you don\u2019t play, you\u2019re going to be out of the rankings. It probably means a lot to the kids, but to me, I know that it\u2019s what you do at the end of the year that counts. That\u2019s what we\u2019re working toward is being a good basketball team at the end of the year, too.\u201d Copeland, whose squad is a season removed from a run to the Final Four, said his team has worked hard to overcome a bad summer. \u201cWe\u2019re just working to get better, but like I\u2019ve said, summers are great because they identify where you\u2019re at and what you\u2019ve got to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to do that everyday with practice, film or playing a tough opponent. We\u2019re just trying to figure out what we can do to get better, and that\u2019s something you have to study and work on.\u201d Sylacauga\u2019s lone loss of the season came during the Med-Center Capstone Classic in Tuscaloosa against 7A No. 7 Huffman. The Aggies fell to the the Vikings 78-73, but the loss marked a speed bump in an otherwise hot start for Copeland\u2019s crew. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely had a tough early part of our schedule, especially in Tuscaloosa at that tournament and being on the road playing against Childersburg, which is always a tough place to play,\u201d Copeland said. \u201cWe just try to be better every day when we come to practice and go to games \u2026 \u201cI told the guys the other day. I said, \u2018Look, there\u2019s a lot of teams out there struggling and the record\u2019s not so good, but they\u2019re working still.\u2019 No matter what your record is, you\u2019ve still got to work. We have some momentum, but you\u2019ve got to keep going. We want to steadily rise throughout the season, not get up really high, then go down ...\u201d Talladega lost 71-58 to 6A Albertville at the North Shelby Tip-Off in Chelsea, but the Tigers have reeled off four straight wins against Benjamin Russell, Anniston, Talladega County Central and Handley. \u201cIt\u2019s alway nice to be ranked. It means people are looking at you around the state,\u201d Talladega head coach Chucky Miller said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of games to play, but I\u2019m happy about it.\u201d Miller said he feels like his team is still in preseason form after getting off to a late start to the season. \u201cI only had one week of practice with the full team, and we\u2019ve been playing about three games a week, so our practice time has been limited,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it is this year. The season is kind of condensed. We\u2019ve just got to get better each game, and I still think we\u2019re going to get better as the season progresses.\u201d Talladega\u2019s girls also earned a Top 10 ranking.

It is the brain inability to control sleep-wake cycles. Sleep attack can occur during any activity such as driving, during the conversation, while eating or playing. People with narcolepsy have strong urge to sleep and possess a lack of energy. Cataplexy is the impulsive loss of muscles function with weakness in muscles; it may last for few seconds or minutes. It is triggered by emotions such as fear, laughter or surprise; it frequently occurs during the stress of fatigue. Sleep paralysis is characterized by temporarily unable to move any part of the body. It is triggered by fear, but it does not cause any harm. Sleep paralysis may occur in 15% of the population. People with narcolepsy may also experience hallucinations that are characterized by realistic and often frightening dreams. \nView Report Preview @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/narcolepsy-treatment-market.asp Narcolepsy caused due to any mental illness, lack of brain chemical known as hypocretin or it may also be due to any inherited conditions, infections, trauma, hormonal changes, stress or immune-system dysfunction, etc. About 10% of patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy have a genetic predisposition. Narcolepsy can occur in both men and women and can begin any age, typically occurs in the early twenties and lasts all through life. People with narcolepsy experience normal life span, it is believed that in every 2000 people, one suffers from narcolepsy in the United States. Hypocretins, a neurotransmitter is involved in regulating sleep/wake cycle along with other metabolic functions. Researchers discovered that in the hypothalamus, located in the brain, hypocretin-producing cells are destroyed in patients with narcolepsy and cataplexy. The cause of the destruction of hypocretin cells is not known yet, though it is an auto-immune disorder. \nNarcolepsy is the third most common sleep disorder diagnosed and affects a large segment of the population. The prevalence rate of narcolepsy compared to the U.S. population, is substantially lower in Israel, about one in 500,000 people and considerably higher in Japan i.e. about one per 600. Narcolepsy is not curable, but it can be treated with drugs such as dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate, and others to reduce the incidence of sleep attack. \nRequest to View Sample of Research Report @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/13774 \nGlobal narcolepsy treatment market is segmented by type and therapeutic treatment. Based on the type, global narcolepsy treatment market is segmented into primary narcolepsy with cataplexy, primary narcolepsy without cataplexy, narcolepsy due to medical conditions and unspecified narcolepsy.

I noticed the panel where the elevator button is was extremely filthy. It appears to have not been cleaned for a very long time. When the elevator arrived and I stepped in, once again I hated to touch the button to take me upstairs because it was so very dirty. The button panels and the entire elevator car was terribly filthy, including the door. It appeared it had never been cleaned or at least not in a very long time. The bathroom itself was not bad. It appeared that someone had cleaned it fairly recently. The floor appeared to have been vaguely washed with a string mop as bits of the mop were torn off on stall edges and there was a lot of dirt where the big mop couldn't reach.\nI was happy to take the stairs back down so I didn't have to touch the dirty button panel upstairs or in the elevator again.\nThe problem here is customer impression as well as health concerns. If a store that mostly sells food leaves this area so dirty, one has to wonder what effort is made in the rest of the store, especially where customers can't see. I know at times in the past I have gagged when opening the doors to the dairy where milk is kept, from the terrible smell of bad dairy products. I have also complained in the summer for the disgusting condition of the parking and cart areas outside, with dirty diapers squashed into the ground in front of the carts. At that time a man called a manager told me that the part time guy that does that works part time and had already finished for the day so there was nothing he could do. The next day I went back and nothing had changed.\nThe desirable resolution is to have this store pay some attention to the unsightly, unhealthy, and neglectful condition of the Superstore property at this location. I hope this is within your ability to see to it asap.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:53.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f9be8780b65fadcdf8cf986197d723f997e69dbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9QCjJMm01ny0hSGaU8FgAEjOotfg_dAVJkIfjvw7aoaywbocx.FU4VvLviMG4IUfDDlTccocLdtmHrmApUijBEQa1ZC8KB_eI-", "site_full": "www.politicaljack.com", "site": "politicaljack.com", "site_section": "http://www.politicaljack.com/forums/latest-political-news-and-current-events.2/", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "Latest Political News and Current Events | PoliticalJack.com", "title": "Harvard's: Dershowitz, Flynn & Mueller", "title_full": "Harvard's: Dershowitz, Flynn & Mueller | PoliticalJack.com", "published": "2017-12-06T15:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.politicaljack.com/data/avatars/m/8/8379.jpg?1370187596", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f16ba0ece57ca0a18b87313697ad801aac5965e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9QCjJMm01ny0hSGaU8FgAEjOotfg_dAVJkIfjvw7aoaywbocx.FU4VvLviMG4IUfDDlTccocLdtmHrmApUijBE4Rmf.MTN.pDj4RhTnJonaw--", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Boca", "published": "2017-12-06T16:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "georgephillip said: \u2191 \"How Alan Dershowitz Went From Hillary Donor to Trump\u2019s Attack Dog on Russia\nMonths after backing Clinton, the liberal law professor has become a fixture on Fox News, ripping the Russia probe.

As part of that effort, said Silverglate, they met with Mueller at the Justice Department headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C.\n\"This meeting came in the early \u201990s\u2014Silverglate didn\u2019t recall the exact year\u2014when Mueller headed the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\n\"They wanted him to ask the judge who convicted MacDonald to vacate that conviction because of problems with evidence.
