Racer Is \u2018Weak\u2019 But \u2018Still Fighting\u2019 Rumors suggest that the German driver might receive a breakthrough treatment in America. Nica Virtudazo \nAvid followers of Michael Schumacher are wondering if he is still alive, four years since his life-threatening skiing accident in French Alps. The family of the Formula 1 legend has vowed to keep details about his current health state as private as possible since they believe that this is what Michael would ask them to do if he was conscious. Reports suggest that the German racing driver could be transferred to the United States for fresh hope. \nMirror reported that Michael Schumacher is still weak after suffering serious head injuries in 2013. Previous reports have it that the Formula 1 legend has been receiving medications and therapies in his home near Lake Geneva, which is located on the north side of the French Alps, since he got out of the Grenoble hospital in 2014. However, Bravo claimed in September that the family of the 48-year-old racer is considering transferring him to his cattle ranch in Dallas, Texas. \nThe publication quoted a certain Dr. Mark Meeks who claimed that his team could offer a brand new kind of treatment for the German racer. The brain specialist also said that their experience in handling trauma patients could help in Michael Schumacher\u2019s journey to full recovery. Reports suggest that Dr. Meeks is based in a hospital near the Formula 1\u2019s property in the U.S. \n\u201cWe have extensive experience with trauma patients. There is probably no clinic in Europe that handles as many cases as we do.\u201d \nHowever, it was later learned that Michael Schumacher would not be traveling to America. In fact, the Formula 1 legend is staying in his Swiss mansion to continue his treatments and therapies. Therefore, avid fans of the seven-time Formula One champion should quit believing on these bogus claims. \nMeanwhile, Independent shares that FIA President Jean Todt has an update about the latest medical condition of Michael Schumacher. Speaking at the FIA Hall of Fame awards ceremony on Monday, the former Ferrari team principal said that the Formula 1 legend is still fighting for his life. Jean even said that he misses Michael and he is special to him. Michael Schumacher 'still fighting' four years after skiing accident https://t.co/hPX4vgBhIg \nGood luck Michael #F1 \n\u2014 TheSportFeed.Com (@TSF_Com) December 7, 2017 \n\u201cHe\u2019s there, still fighting. A fight is going on. Michael is someone very special, someone special for motorsport.\u201d \nHe added that Michael Schumacher should be at the said event. Jean Todt also stated that the Formula 1 legend\u2019s love for the sport is one of the main reasons behind his success. For starters, Jean and Michael have worked together throughout the racer\u2019s five world title wins with Ferrari. Four years since the tragic skiing accident in France, Formula One legend Michael Schumacher is \u201cstill fighting\u201d for his life according to his former Ferrari boss Jean Todt https://t.co/Uf43TewhoB \n\u2014 News18 (@CNNnews18) December 6, 2017 \n\u201cHe always had the utmost respect for everyone in this round, he would be very honoured. What made Michael so special, what made him so successful, that was the love of the sport. And that connects him with everyone here.\u201d \nSabine Kehm attended this year\u2019s FIA Hall of Fame awards as Michael\u2019s representative. However, she did not give an update on the Formula 1 legend\u2019s health state.

All seven bids were submitted jointly by subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips and Anadarko. Advertisement \nEnvironmental groups oppose expanded drilling in the reserve, located west of Prudhoe Bay, or any drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska's northeast corner. \nTrump in June, announcing a new American energy policy, said he was focusing no just on energy independence but also \"energy dominance.\" \nThe petroleum reserve bids Wednesday pulled in $14.99 per acre, an amount that shows \"fuzzy math\" by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans who hope to collect $1 billion from Arctic refuge lease sales to help pay for Trump's proposed tax cut, said Kristen Miller, conservation director of the Alaska Wilderness League. \n\"At that price, leasing the entirety of the Arctic Refuge coastal plain's 1.5 million acres would raise slightly more than $11 million in revenue for the federal government, a far cry from the billion dollar lie that Trump and Republicans are feeding the American public,\" she said in a statement. \nKara Moriarty, director of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, said there likely were a variety of factors for just seven bids. A state lease sale drew 143 bids Wednesday. Alaska's tax policies, changed seven times in 12 years, may have discouraged bidding. \nBut drawing conclusions about bidding in the Arctic refuge based on Wednesday's results is not a fair comparison, Moriarty said. Potential on the refuge's coastal plain is thought to be tenfold to what's in the NPR-A, she said. \n\"It's two different basins. It's two different potential areas,\" Moriarty said. \"They may both be in Alaska, but the reserve estimates are night and day.\" \nThe petroleum reserve was created in 1923 by President Warren Harding as the Naval Petroleum Reserve and set aside as an emergency oil supply for the Navy. It covers 35,625 square miles (92,269 sq. kilometers), about the size of Indiana. \nCongress in 1976 renamed the reserve and transferred administration to the Interior Department. \nThe reserve contains important habitat for migratory waterfowl, polar bears and two caribou herds. \nFormer Interior Secretary Ken Salazar in 2013 announced a management plan that split the reserve's acreage roughly in half between conservation areas and land available for petroleum development. He said oil companies would have access to nearly three-fourths of the estimated economically recoverable oil in the reserve. \nThe 2013 plan increased special conservation areas in the reserve from 12,968 square miles (33,587 sq. kilometers) to 20,860 square miles (54,027 sq. kilometers). \nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke in May signed an order to review the Obama administration management plan. \nThere are 189 authorized leases in the NPR-A.

The farming union said it was \"shocked\" by the steep price cut of 1.5p per litre that Muller will be imposing on it supplying farmers come January 2018 and is looking for an explanation from the processor.The decline in price to its 700 Muller Direct suppliers comes amid a drop in the value of cream and butter in the UK over the last three months.And now the NFU will meet with Muller next week in an urgent face-to-face meeting to ask why farmers are now \"left to pay the price\".It has also wrote to Grocery Code Adjudicator Christine Tacon and Defra Secretary Michael Gove asking them to do what is necessary to bring some \"badly needed\" price transparency to the market.NFU Scotland Vice President Gary Mitchell said that such a large drop in price from Britain\u2019s largest producer of branded and private label fresh milk, butter, yogurt, desserts and dairy ingredients needs to be properly explained.\u201cWhy have Muller been the first to cut and cut so savagely when they have lucrative contracts that should provide milk price certainty to their dairy farmers?\u201d Mr Mitchell asked.\u201cWhat makes the whole situation even worse is that this drop in price is out of line with our European neighbours and has, once again, left the UK market out of sync with the rest of Europe.\u201cThe size of the UK retail market, and the percentage of milk that continues to be sold daily as fresh, should provide stability to prices, but it just hasn\u2019t happened. Are we again seeing processors chasing retail contracts on price to the detriment of their dairy farmers? \u201cDairy farmers need answers and Muller needs to explain their action when we meet next week.\u201d Transparency Mr Mitchell said it is impossible for the milk market to function properly while price transparency between farmers, processors and retailers \"does not exist\".He said it is imperative that all sections of the industry are open and honest with each other for the industry to move on from the \"hard times of a few years ago\". \u201cThe reality is that, when commodity prices surged, farmgate prices were slow to respond and now that markets have softened, Muller has chosen to drop prices like a stone,\u201d Mr Mitchell explained.\u201cThat has huge impact on confidence at a time when bank accounts have still to recover from the milk price crash in 2015 and 2016.\u201d Knowing little At AgriScot, dairy expert Chris Walkland stated that analysis of all UK milk price indices showed that the average Scottish dairy farmer had missed out on between \u00a340,000 and \u00a345,000 of income.This is based on what they could have reasonably expected to have received as a milk price in 2017 and what their milk buyers have actually delivered.Mr Mitchell added: \u201cAs an example of the lack of transparency, it is now common knowledge that in aligned supermarket milk contracts there is a cream price tracker and rebate system - yet the industry knows little about how that operates. \u201cHowever, it is hugely important in setting the milk price, as cream income to a liquid processor is currently worth 12.75p per litre - the 5th highest on record\u2013 when three years ago it was worth 5.5p.\u201d\u201cThat is value in the chain that should be getting shared with producers and isn\u2019t.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris walkland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gary mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael gove", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine tacon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nfu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfu nfu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:33.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "75592b67d32dd014813d9ecb46345a3694984bb8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9OkMgiM8Cuf8Io0f0PREr1sZAmYYrA4fQC92_DAGl0yhG4a5hFbMv8Nv9CtM7ZOqj0_0jNn1Ihvog2lbrpKmQ2ugJKW7W86zkjyzlSjKWWUiON5K97S144", "site_full": "www.civicx.com", "site": "civicx.com", "site_section": "http://www.civicx.com/forums/engine-exhaust-transmission-tuning.5/", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Engine / Exhaust / Transmission / Tuning | 2016+ Honda Civic Forum (10th Gen) - Type R Forum, Si Forum - CivicX.com", "title": "1.5T - Guide to DIY Flex Fuel Kit for Hondata or KTuner | Page 2", "title_full": "1.5T - Guide to DIY Flex Fuel Kit for Hondata or KTuner | Page 2 | 2016+ Honda Civic Forum (10th Gen) - Type R Forum, Si Forum - CivicX.com", "published": "2017-12-06T19:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.civicx.com/styles/brivium/stylium/potassium/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 95455, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "98f932019a48d369f5a1c53cef3b77934d2bf06f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9OkMgiM8Cuf8Io0f0PREr1sZAmYYrA4fQC92_DAGl0yhG4a5hFbMv8Nv9CtM7ZOqj0_0jNn1Ihvog2lbrpKmQ2ugJKW7W86zkjyzlSjKWWUpRoBUvrWiUHK2G0PAQr3l0-", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "VitViper", "published": "2017-12-07T09:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "maddmatt02 said: \u2191 The one I got was 4o bucks on amazon, is continental branded and as long as these numbers are close to actual (I am going to test them eventually) my sensor is accurate.\narco premium - 11%\nshell e85 - 83%\nUSA gasoline premium 6%\nNot to say a continental sensor is bad or good or even if the name on it would make it genuine though...

I've only had one OEM one out of something like 100 sensors be bad. hz went to 200 to note an error but the fuel temp (pulsewidth) reading was still accurate (as the sensors do fuel temp AND ethanol content).\nI couldn't get an OEM GM one for 40 bucks at wholesale from the dealer if I tried. And I also buy them in bulk as we use them on a bunch of cars. IE, if you want the OEM GM one I buy, I have to sell it to you for $90 plus shipping. If someone is DIY I highly recommend just going to a local dealer and getting one in person.

Like me, you were late in coming...Yet you came and were not turned away. You too found room before the manger. Jesus is the patron of all latecomers; let these ones not be forgotten before the throne of God. Outsiders and latecomers, Jesus has room for all. Ox and donkey, shepherds and magi. \nThe incarnation means that in Christ God has become more accessible to us. In Christ God loves us with a human heart, and God\u2019s power to save and heal is in human form. This is the meaning of Christmas: God bonded with us forever, love laid in the crib and later upon the Cross. \nThe birth of God as man means that man is not his own master, and that he cannot construct his own destiny; he must continually come to grips with his own creaturliness, continually experience his own weakness, continually rising above challenges, entrusting oneself God. \nLet Christmas push you back into the human race. \nFor through the incarnation, God embraced not only what is agreeable in the world, but also whatever is weak and imperfect in our lives. He has taken upon himself everything that is marked by sin, but there is no sin in him. \nJesus came into a world ruled by the military might of the Roman Empire; he was born to a people who had been conquered and were being oppressed by their conquerors. Yet, at the time of Caesar Augustus, the empire enjoyed a facade of peace. \nHowever, the Peace announced by the angels by the birth of Jesus was a new and lasting true peace that was now available to all who seek it, \u201cGlory to God in the highest and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.\" \nThe continual need to allow Jesus to save us by his intervention into our lives. \nWill God come and save us from our materialism, from our grief, from our brokenness? From my loneliness? From our stress? From my addiction? My burden? \nJesus shares our ups and downs of human existence, and he gives us a share in his divine life, brings brightness and hope into our hearts, and gives us confidence of our future. \nShe gave birth to her firstborn. The word firstborn indicates that Mary had no children prior to Jesus; it does not imply that she had children after him. For example, there are ancient grave markers for Jewish women in that area who died during child birth which read, \u201cIn the pains of giving birth to a firstborn child, fate brought me to the end of my life.\u201d So, firstborn is a religious legal title which simply means that the child has privileges as specified in Deut. 21:5 and the child must be consecrated to the Lord in Exodus 13:2 and Numbers 18:15 . The fact that Mary had no other children after Jesus stems from her being a perpetual Virgin. \nHowever, we are called to be firstborn too. The Bible distinguishes between those who enter Heaven straightaway, calling them \"the church of the firstborn\" (Heb. 12:23), and those who enter after having undergone a purgation, calling them \"the spirits of the just made perfect.\" (Heb. 12:23).

Mostly take-out, you can eat-in as well but it only has a few tables and counters on the walls. Prices are really, really affordable, definitely below the average for Madrid. There were 4 different vegan choices properly labelled for the main course and a couple more suitable for vegetarians. They also had two vegan desserts: apple pie and oat milk custard (see uploaded pics).

It had to be like that.\u201d Only it didn\u2019t. It could conceivably have been any group or individual, yet it was shepherds that God chose for the message to be delivered to. Why? \n- Shepherds were definitely not the most respected members of society. They were not at the top of the social pecking order. In fact, they are generally thought to have been almost at the bottom of the rungs of success. \n- How might we recast the story to bring it to the present day and get the point out of it? A couple attempts: \na. \u201cAnd behold, there were garbage men showing up for their 5 a.m. shift. As they stood around preparing to go out, an angel of the Lord appeared to them and the glory of the Lord shone around them.\u201d \nb. \u201cAnd it was 3 a.m. when the fast food workers went out back to take a smoke break. No customers were around. As they sat there, an angel of the Lord appeared to them and declared, \u2018I bring you good news.\u2019\u201d \n- All of this raises an interesting question: why were the shepherds the ones who got the visit from the angels? Why not: \na. The town mayor? \nc. The wealthiest man in town? \n- The answer lies in the second point for this morning . . . \nWHY THEM? It points to type of people Jesus was seeking and the type of Kingdom He was bringing. \n- Matthew 5:1-12 ; Luke 4:18-19 ; Luke 7:22 . \n- We can get a sense of the type of people Jesus was seeking by looking at Luke 4:18-19 and Luke 7:22 . \n- We can get a sense of the type of Kingdom He was bringing by looking at Matthew 5:1-12 . \n- Unpack the four passages above: the Beatitudes, the criteria for separating the sheep and the goats, Jesus\u2019 mission statement at Nazareth, Jesus\u2019 proofs to John\u2019s followers. \n- Once we understand those crucial passages, the choice of the shepherds begins to make more sense. As some of the weaker and less powerful members of society, they were emblematic of the direction that Jesus was going to take when it started. The shepherds represent a foreshadowing of what is to come. \n- Ponder for a moment how poorly orchestrated this event is by modern P.R. standards. It\u2019s the wrong time, the wrong place, and the wrong people. To have it happen in the middle of the night when no one is around? What a wasted opportunity! To have it happen in Podunk little Bethlehem, in a stable no less? What a wasted opportunity! To have a gaggle of shepherd nobodies be the recipients of the news? What a wasted opportunity! \nHOW CAN I INCORPORATE THIS INTO MY LIFE? \n1. If you feel weak and powerless, know that you\u2019re the kind of person God likes to use. \n- 1 Corinthians 1:26-31 ; 2 Corinthians 12:1-10 . \n- Because of the way that the world usually works, we presume that the strong and the powerful land the ones that have all the advantages. It\u2019s just business as usual. \n- Understanding the truths that we\u2019ve been discussing this morning, we see that God is up to something different. We begin to see that God actually has a preference for using the weak and powerless.

Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. That brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight. \nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" faces a chorus of calls to step aside, and Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign. \n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\" \nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed. \n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" \nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" \nLate in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. \nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. \nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" \nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\" \nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable. \nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\" \nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker. \nWhile Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe. \nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" - women who have come forward on sexual harassment. \nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations. \nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them. \nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. \nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003. \nFranken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations. \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Juliet Linderman in Washington and Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama, contributed to this report.

Disney would get the film rights to franchises such as the \u2018X-Men,\u2019 while News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch would keep Fox\u2019s news, sports and broadcast network. comments A seismic shift is underway as two of Hollywood\u2019s biggest behemoths are set to merge in a potential landmark moment for the entertainment industry, as Disney reportedly prepares to buy Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox.\n\u201cIf the deal goes through, it represents a sea change within the traditional industry,\u201d said Jason Squire, editor of \u201cThe Movie Business Book\u201d and a University of Southern California associate professor. \u201cDisney, which is already a powerhouse that in the theatrical realm is powering forward beyond the competitors, will become even more powerful.\u201d\nThe Disney brand, Squire added, caters to everyone from kids to preteens to retirees.\n\u201cIt is now, without the acquisition, an extraordinary, carefully planned and overseen effort to satisfy every generation,\u201d he said.\nIf it goes through, the number of major Hollywood studios drops from six to five. \u201cIn terms of sellers in the marketplace, agents, managers, producers, production companies \u2014 they have one less buyer,\u201d Squire said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a factor.

The Disney management is first-rate.\u201d\nThe moviegoer, Squire added, will be \u201cperfectly fine,\u201d as ticket prices are set by movie theatres and not distributors. And the deal means Disney gets the film rights to \u201cX-Men\u201d and the \u201cFantastic Four.\u201d\nFox would sell its movie and TV production studios but keep its news, sports and broadcast network, CNBC reported, and the deal could be struck as early as next week.\nDisney currently holds 18 percent of the domestic box office while Fox has 12 percent, according to Forbes.com, and the deal could give Disney 30 percent.\nCNBC reported that Fox\u2019s assets are worth $60 billion. Disney CEO Robert Iger, The Wall Street Journal reported, would likely stay on to help with the acquisition.\nSelling off its movie and production studios means Fox would have more to spend on news.\n\u201cDisney won\u2019t own Fox News or Fox Sports, but what do you think the owners of Fox News are going to do with lots more money on hand and an explicit devotion to news and media?\u201d wrote Forbes.com contributor Scott Mendelson. \u201cIt\u2019s not Disney\u2019s responsibility to make sure that its money doesn\u2019t go toward evil, but the powers behind Fox News having more money and more free time to devote to media and politics is not going to be good for media and politics.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jessica heslam", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "fox", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "squire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert iger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott mendelson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rupert murdoch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason squire", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "disney", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "walt disney company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "news corp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "21st century fox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forbes.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forbes.com", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:36.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1afaddcbfa21806b3974d182a85f26f10543858b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJwVqYwmb5BaTAixkp2wC7TydcfziZQhbVtFjH5BmPW_zk5QL.B2TY0qwKlHzw5XTXVznIRXj.XCjewT6PCz4UeXPBNVigTEcJNsKx0BCB8eRFF1_aa5h.e2OAzE3Ovbt9MUQO3KmH_sYK34nIQWVFEkSDSsErdb2b.4am9NyWBNE-", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Appliances-Microwaves-Over-the-Range-Microwaves/N-5yc1vZc3pa/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "LG Electronics 1.7 Oven in Stainless Steel with EasyClean Interior-LMV1762ST", "title_full": "LG Electronics 1.7 cu. ft.

He was paternal to me. So I needed a moment to process everything, because I thought I knew this guy, and then he\u2019s being accused of rape.\u201d \n\u201cWe all knew he was a dog,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe knew that he was a... tough guy, a brute, a tough guy to negotiate with. I didn\u2019t know that he was a rapist.\u201d \n\u201cBeing able to hear when the woman wore the microphone and Harvey was telling her to watch him shower, I felt sick in my bones for an entire day,\u201d she adds. \u201cI was just sick... He didn\u2019t lay a finger on her, and I felt chilled to my bones. Imagine having a man who is that powerful telling you to do something (and) you\u2019re saying no. (He\u2019s) threatening you, saying, \u2018Don\u2019t embarrass me...\u2019\u201d \nJennifer insists the whole movie industry has been hit hard by Hollywood\u2019s sexual harassment and assault scandal, which reared up after a New York Times expose on Weinstein\u2019s bad behaviour was published in early October. \nBrett Ratner, director James Toback, and actors Kevin Spacey, Jeffrey Tambor, Robert Knepper, and Jeremy Piven have also been hit with misconduct allegations. \n\u201cIt\u2019s so widespread, the abuse, from so many different people,\u201d Jennifer continues. \u201cIt\u2019s directors, it\u2019s producers... I think everybody needed to (process it). Everybody needs to deal with this in their own way; everybody needs to heal.\u201d \nThe Weinstein story and the allegations that followed brought back bad memories for Lawrence, who felt humiliated during the audition process of one unnamed movie, when the female producer asked her to strip for a nude line-up \u201cwith about five women who were much, much thinner than me\u201d. \n\u201cI was abused by a woman on a movie,\u201d she tells Oprah. \u201cThere was a general consensus on (that) movie that I was fat, and so it wasn\u2019t just the woman. Everybody agreed that I was fat. And she had to be the mouthpiece... \n\u201cOn that movie, I called my agent, and I called everybody. It\u2019s like, there\u2019s not really anything anybody can do because the behaviour is so normalised. And then you become more powerful, and people start f**king with you less. People at the beginning of their careers don\u2019t want to rock the boat because if you rock the boat, you\u2019ll be called difficult.\u201d \nLike many leading ladies in Hollywood, Jennifer is hoping the sexual misconduct allegations, sparked by the Weinstein drama, will change the movie industry for the better. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know a woman who hasn\u2019t been touched by some sort of abuse,\u201d she explains. \u201cI\u2019m sad by the women\u2019s stories, but I\u2019m excited by the change that\u2019s going to come from it. The rule book is being rewritten right now. People are terrified... \n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to women. We\u2019ve talked about forming a commission... If every A-list actor decides to join this commission, we know everybody in the industry. I know every studio head in town. If I\u2019m on this commission, and (if) I get an email about somebody being treated badly on a set, I can send an email.

Tama na ang zarzuela. May Blue Ribbon daw on Monday tapos yung isa ayaw daw eh ang hinihingi ng bayan ay accountability [My appeal to President Duterte is that he should be on the top of this and accountability. Enough with the show. They said there is a blue ribbon (hearing) on Monday but the public wants accountability], \u201d Leachon said. \n\u201c Alam mo napanuod ko na lahat ng teleserye sa senado [I have watched all shows in the Senate] \u2014 about hazing, BOC, shabu, ZTE \u2026 Tapos presidential spokesperson ay trying to stop\u2026 eh whitewash ito [I have watched all shows in the Senate\u2026 And then the presidential spokersperson is trying to stop (it) but this is whitewashing],\u201d he added. \nLeachon also said Dr. Antonio Danz presented to him the trial of Sanofi Pasteur through the New England Journal of Medicine that there is a \u201csafety signal\u201d explaining that those vaccinated but do not have dengue prior to immunization are \u2018in danger\u2019 in the third year. \nThe doctor added that they tried to present the study in a House committee hearing but were stopped by five congressman, including then Akbayan Representative and now Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque. \n\u201c Sabi naming may question kami sa safety , hindi doon sa efficacy at wag muna nating bakunahan nang mga walang testing yung mga bata , [We told them we have questions on safety and not on efficacy, and that they should not vaccinate the children without testing],\u201d Leachon said. \n\u201c Pumunta, nagsulat, sa kongreso pero day one pa lang hinarang kami ng mga congressman; lima sa pangunguna ni Presidential Spokersperson Harry Roque . Introduction pa lang, nandoon ang dating S ecretary. Hindi siya kasama doon, ah.

Marie are out of the running. \n\u201cTechnical studies and engagement with people in the area identified a number of factors that would pose challenges in siting a repository,\u201d the organization said. \u201cThese include complexities associated with the geology, limited access and rugged terrain, and low potential to develop the breadth of partnerships needed to implement the project.\u201d \nThree other communities in northern Ontario remain as potential sites: Ignace about 250 kilometres northwest of Thunder Bay, Manitouwadge, about 395 kilometres east of Thunder Bay, and Hornepayne, about 480 kilometres east of Thunder Bay. \nThe other two remaining potential sites \u2014 South Bruce and Huron-Kinloss \u2014 are close to the Bruce nuclear reactor on the Lake Huron shoreline near Kincardine, Ont., site of a long and ongoing battle by Ontario Power Generation to win approval for a deep geologic repository for low and intermediate level radioactive waste. \nDan Marchisella, mayor of Elliot Lake, expressed disappointment at the exclusion of his community after five years, calling it a \u201chuge potential loss\u201d for the entire district. \nThe former mining town, once known as the uranium capital of the world, felt that putting itself forward was the responsible thing to do given the vexing question of how best to safely store waste that remains toxic for thousands of years, he said. \n\u201cThe footprint of that geology they were looking for is not large enough,\u201d Marchisella said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to access that area.\u201d \nThe hunt for a place to permanently store used nuclear fuel rods \u2014 about 2.7 million bundles currently exist \u2014 began in earnest in 2010, with 22 communities expressing interest. The dangerous material is currently stored in pools of water or in vaults on site at reactors in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Manitoba. The envisaged repository would be about 500 metres underground. \n\u201cThe decision to narrow our focus is part of an ongoing, rigorous process to identify a single, safe site in an area with an informed and willing host and strong potential for the partnerships that will be required to implement the project,\u201d said Mahrez Ben Belfadhel, a vice-president with the waste-management organization. \nWhile the organization expects to be able to choose its preferred site by about 2023, winning any approval for an underground bunker is likely to go years beyond that date if Ontario Power Generation\u2019s odyssey is anything to go by. \nThe utility took years to win tentative approval in 2015 to build a bunker at the Bruce site near Lake Huron for material that is far less toxic than nuclear fuel rods but has made little progress since. \nFederal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna is now waiting for Indigenous communities in the area to weigh in \u2014 a process likely to take at least another year. In addition, scores of communities around the Great Lakes have decried any suggestion the site so close to the lake is suitable \u2014 paving the way for what could be years of court battles. \nIn defence of its choice, Ontario Power Generation has said transporting radioactive material to long distances to a storage site would only add costs and increase the risk of toxic releases. \nMarchisella, who said nuclear material already moves safely up and down Canada\u2019s highways every day, did express concern at storing waste anywhere near a Great Lake, as OPG is proposing for its facility. \n\u201cAs the planet gets warmer, we know that water levels continue to rise,\u201d Marchisella said. \u201cSo when you look at the northern communities further up north, we\u2019re higher up in altitude.\u201d \nTo ease the pain of rejection, the waste organization said it would make up to $600,000 available to Blind River, Elliot Lake and Sagamok Anishnawbek First Nation, and another $300,000 for Spanish and the North Shore for community projects.

This is the first time a DAMEN Cutter Suction Dredger has been deployed in the Scandinavian market, the company said in its press release.\nThe new dredger was delivered in only a few weeks from stock and has been put to work straight away in the Port of Pori, where it is dredging at a depth of 4.5 metres.\nThe DAMEN CSD450, which can dredge up to 14 metres deep, offers Vesirakennus Ojanen Oy the advantage that it has continuous production via the CSD\u2019s pipeline to the designated disposal areas, he added.\nA DAMEN CSD is suited to ports and rivers that have a lot siltation and stones, and it is also a robust machine, well able to operate in harsher, icy conditions. These dredgers are also active in the Arctic, Canada and Russia.\nA major reason Vesirakennus Ojanen Oy chose a DAMEN CSD450 was because it was available directly from stock and could be delivered in just a few weeks. Sami Ojanen, owner and director, comments on why the company chose the new DAMEN CSD: \u201cOur company saw the CSD450 as the perfect fit technically and because of Damen\u2019s technical support. The increased pumping distance provided by the new dredger also enables us to expand the range of the projects we can carry out.\nDamen also holds several optional extras in stock. The Vesirakennus Ojanen Oy dredger was customised with a day accommodation unit added beneath the control cabin with a capacity for four people. The Finnish company also decided to add the option of an anchor boom system.\nRemko Bouma, DAMEN Sales Manager North, West & South Europe, added: \u201cDamen has a wide variety of options in stock. It is plug & play - all the foundations are built into the vessel already, so a customer can get up and running in just a few weeks.\u201d DAMEN also carried out the dredger\u2019s commissioning and trained the crew on site in Pori.\nAnother option included is a \u2018navigation package\u2019 (signal lights, deck lights and search lights). This is very important for a country like Finland, which only gets a few hours of daylight in the winter. The company also chose Damen\u2019s navigation package for precision dredging and monitoring. The next step can be a production measurement system, which enables the customer to be comprehensively informed about the performance of the dredger. To be able to dredge in shallow waters the dredger is also delivered with a wedge piece, which can be placed between the cutter unit and cutter ladder to guarantee the right angle of the cutter.\nMr Marcus emphasised: \u201cAll the DAMEN Cutter Suction Dredgers are dismountable, so it is easy to transport them. In this case the dredger could be transported to Finland in a very short time and when this job is completed it can easily be transported to the next project.\u201d\nDamen has previously delivered two DOP pumps to Vesirakennus Ojanen Oy, which was founded in 2003. The DOP pumps are used to fill Geotubes with dredged material. By pumping in these tubes the water is being drained and the filled bags can be stored or even used to construct dams, riverbanks and walls etc.\nDamen Shipyards Group\nDamen Shipyards Group operates 33 shipbuilding and repair yards, employing 9,000 people worldwide. DAMEN has delivered more than 6,000 vessels in more than 100 countries and delivers some 180 vessels annually to customers worldwide. Based on its unique, standardised ship-design concept DAMEN is able to guarantee consistent quality.\nDamen\u2019s focus on standardisation, modular construction and keeping vessels in stock leads to short delivery times, low \u2018total cost of ownership\u2019, high resale values and reliable performance. Furthermore, DAMEN vessels are based on thorough R&D and proven technology.\nDamen offers a wide range of products, including tugs, workboats, naval and patrol vessels, high speed craft, cargo vessels, dredgers, vessels for the offshore industry, ferries, pontoons and superyachts.\nFor nearly all vessel types DAMEN offers a broad range of services, including maintenance, spare parts delivery, training and the transfer of (shipbuilding) know-how. DAMEN also offers a variety of marine components, such as nozzles, rudders, anchors, anchor chains and steel works.\nDamen Shiprepair & Conversion (DSC) has a worldwide network of sixteen repair and conversion yards of which twelve are located in North West Europe. Facilities at the yards include more than 50 floating and (covered) drydocks, the largest of which is 420 x 90 metres, as well as slopes, ship lifts and indoor halls. Projects range from the smallest simple repairs through Class\u2019 maintenance to complex refits and the complete conversion of large offshore structures. DSC completes around 1,350 repair and maintenance jobs annually, both at yards as well as in ports and during voyage.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "damen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sami ojanen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "damen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "remko bouma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vesirakennus oj damen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vesirakennus ojanen oy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dsc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "damen shipyards group damen shipyards group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "damen shiprepair & conversion", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "finland damen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pori", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north west europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west & south europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "port of pori", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arctic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:37.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a0f10982897508154a4d9eb3859f90618d95685b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Rp_5vv9o816cu6Lbq3oNAC.R8Iv8e.eQ4jmbdSpzf.9S5MaOpCHzNHViXi1C7nj8vp6pGF_9y5l8sSwtA0f5HfrLFSt3gvMdz53ZiHxyQZ_FdBoo5BvyrMQ60QfvP7jan9KBUaH.wV6Wzah7xr17qGIHftMzmfZzeQpP9A64Nsw--", "site_full": "www.thenewstrend.com", "site": "thenewstrend.com", "site_section": "http://www.thenewstrend.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TheNewsTrend", "title": "Jamie Oliver blames Brexit for his own restaurant failures: \u2018I can\u2019t compromise\u2019 | Celebrity News | Showbiz & TV", "title_full": "Jamie Oliver blames Brexit for his own restaurant failures: \u2018I can\u2019t compromise\u2019 | Celebrity News | Showbiz & TV", "published": "2017-12-07T08:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.thenewstrend.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jamie-oliver-blames-brexit-for-his-own-restaurant-failures-i-cant-compromise-celebrity-news-showbiz-tv.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a0f10982897508154a4d9eb3859f90618d95685b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Rp_5vv9o816cu6Lbq3oNAC.R8Iv8e.eQ4jmbdSpzf.9S5MaOpCHzNHViXi1C7nj8vp6pGF_9y5l8sSwtA0f5HfrLFSt3gvMdz53ZiHxyQZ_FdBoo5BvyrMQ60QfvP7jan9KBUaH.wV6Wzah7xr17qGIHftMzmfZzeQpP9A64Nsw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "TheNewsTrend Staff", "published": "2017-12-07T08:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Jamie Oliver blames Brexit for his own restaurant failures: \u2018I can\u2019t compromise\u2019 | Celebrity News | Showbiz & TV", "text": "Clippers vs Lakers LIVE stream: How to watch NBA online and on TV | Other | Sport The 42-year-old TV chef has had six branches of his famous Jamie\u2019s Italian spots closed in recent months and has now revealed that the current political and economic climate have been major contributing factors in the shrinking of the brand.

Cincinnati and Detroit also are bidding. \nSacramento's bid includes Kevin Nagle, a minority owner of the NBA's Sacramento Kings, and Jed York, CEO of the NFL's San Francisco 49ers. The group said in July it was starting pre-construction activity for a 19,621-seat downtown stadium. \n\"The committee asked very tough questions, and we'll come back with all the answers,\" Nagle said. \"We never take anything for granted.\" Advertisement \nNashville's group includes John Ingram, the chairman of Ingram Industries Inc., and the Wilf family, owner of the NFL's Minnesota Vikings. The Metro Nashville City Council on Nov. 7 approved $225 million in revenue bonds to construct a 27,500-seat soccer stadium and an additional $50 million in bonds for renovations and improvements around the site at the current fairgrounds. \n\"People all across our city, from elected officials to business and civic leaders, soccer fans and the public, have joined together in support of this bid,\" Ingram said. \"We believe MLS and Nashville are a perfect match and are ready to prove that Music City is Soccer City.\" \nCincinnati's group includes Carl H. Lindner III, co-CEO of American Financial Group and owner of FC Cincinnati in the second-tier United Soccer League. The Cincinnati City Council approved a plan for the city to invest up to $36 million in infrastructure such as roads around a privately funded stadium.

It remains unclear whether the drone is currently with China or whether it has been handed back to India.\nThe matter is being dealt with in accordance with established protocols and through institutional mechanisms that exist for similar situations in the India- China border areas, the statement added.\nIndian border security personnel immediately alerted Chinese counterparts to locate the UAV.

In my Father's house are many mansions: if [it were] not [so], I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, [there] ye may be also.\" \nRev. 21:3-4 \"And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God [is] with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, [and be] their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\" \nRev. 22:3-5 \"And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him: And they shall see his face; and his name [shall be] in their foreheads. And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.\" \nUntil I had the privilege of staying a few weeks with a pastor friend and preaching in a number of rural churches in the pristine and beautiful mountains of West Virginia, I could not appreciate the words of John Denver's beautiful song, \"Almost heaven, West Vir-ginia...\" \nUntil my daughter and her family moved to North Carolina, the history, geography and contemporary nature of the place were of little interest to me. But now I find the place has a strange attraction and fascination for me. Perhaps it's because I have loved ones there. \nUntil I was sure God was calling me to plant churches in the great land down under, I knew very little about it, nor did I have any particular desire to make the twenty-four hour plane trip to see it. But now, since I have so many loved ones in Australia, both in the physical and spiritual sense, the Lord has given me a deep love and affinity for the country. \nOf course, although there are many beautiful spots on God's green earth, none could compare to the marvelous wonder and beauty of heaven. Even so, the main attraction of heaven for the Christian is not the place but the people. The main Person Who draws us home- ward and heavenward is Jesus Christ. In heaven we shall see Him face to face. Just as our roots sometimes tug at us, drawing us back to the places and people of our origins, so does our heart draw us to that land that is fairer than day. \nBy faith we can see it afar. It is a real place. It is not, as some may say, just a fantasy figment of a fertile imagination. It is not just an adult version of a big rock candy mountain. Nor is it pie in the sky by and by. It is the ultimate dwelling place of God with His people. I am convinced that heaven is not only a real place, but a very SPECIAL PLACE. Let us look at what the scriptures say make heaven SPECIAL! \nHEAVEN IS SPECIAL BECAUSE IT IS A PREPARED PLACE FOR A PREPARED PEOPLE. We can know heaven is a real place because our Saviour tells us He has gone there to prepare a place for His particular, peculiar and prepared people. The reality of heaven and hell are foundation principles of the faith once delivered to the saints. Remove these from the Word of God and we have no rationale for a gospel.

The music includes several traditional favourites and some newly composed music as well. Our featured composer this year is the English composer, Bob Chilcott. He has been described by The Observer as \u201ca contemporary hero of British Choral Music\u201d and has become one of the most widely performed composers of choral music in the world.

\nWhen I opened my box of Christmas stamps this year, I was so surprised to find this stamp set for today's card.  I had purchased it last February at a stamping show and filed it away, forgetting it for sure over the year.   \nI elected to make a shaker card also since I had recently purchased a tiny COW punch and also had an additional stash of mini cow confetti in my collection.  Here's what I came up with for today's card called Mooey Christmas! \n\nThe image is by Country Bumpkin Stamps, (CB-08 Mooey Christmas) and stamped inside says Wishing you an UDDERLY Fabulous Holiday! \nAfter stamping and Copic coloring, I die cut the image with Gina Marie's X-stitched oval dies and also made the shaker window using the same die.  I used two sizes of the oval die, taped together, to get the frame for the shaker, and cut with black and also with foam.  Die cutting foam for shaker cards is much easier than trying to place foam tape in small spaces and around curves.  I made EIGHT of these cards so there were a lot of mini cow confetti all over me, my desk and the entire room!   \nThanks for stopping by today ~ and remember to comment below or on my Facebook page, Not Just Scrap s, to be entered for a drawing after Christmas for a crafting prize.
