Initial predictions also show lower fuel consumption compared to \u201cstandard\u201d designs as well as lower LNG boil-off due to the GTT membrane, compared to a Type C tank. \nMa Yingbin , vice chief engineer, DSIC, said, \u201cWhile we are still in the initial stage of the project and the design is subject to ongoing change, the initial results are indicating that we will meet our goal of having a ballast-free ship that is equal to, or better than existing conventional designs.\u201d \nHe added that with exceeding expectations from owners and operators, the project\u2019s phase two is expected to further refine and validate the design, resulting in more efficient small-scale LNG carriers.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

\nInterim coach Steve Spagnuolo said the decision on how to use the rookie over the final stretch of the season has been put on hold after the Giants fired coach Ben McAdoo and general manager Jerry Reese on Monday. The only thing known for sure is Eli Manning will start against the Cowboys on Sunday. \n\u201c[Offensive coordinator] Mike [Sullivan] and I and the offensive coaches will talk about that as we go,\u201d Spagnuolo said after practice Wednesday when asked about the plan for Webb. \u201cThe No. 1 focus right now is to figure out a way to beat the Dallas Cowboys. I can tell you that. And, each week we\u2019ll talk about those other things.\u201d \nWebb said he isn\u2019t concerned with the uncertainly around him. see also Eli Manning wants a Giants encore next season Eli Manning has loved being the quarterback of the New... \n\u201cI don\u2019t get to pick and choose what happens,\u201d Webb said. \u201cAll I get to do is control what I can control. I am the quarterback of the scout team right now.\u201d \nOne of the reasons for the organization replacing Manning with Geno Smith last week against the Raiders was to get a look at the quarterbacks behind the two-time Super Bowl MVP. The Giants are in line for a top pick in a draft that is loaded with highly touted quarterbacks, but they haven\u2019t seen Webb \u2014 their third-round pick last spring \u2014 play outside of the preseason and in practice.

Let\u2019s just say it is celebrating very quietly. What started as an Ideas Boom supported by an all-singing, all-dancing $28 million advertising campaign now gets a behind-closed-doors clinking of shandy glasses. \nRemember, this was a policy considered so important that it warranted its own Budget-style lock-up of the press gallery in Canberra. Not anymore. Now it\u2019s a press release acknowledgement of a milestone. \nBut let\u2019s not rain on the parade just yet, because there are plenty of reasons to be cheerful. And besides, if we can\u2019t celebrate the successes then we have given in to the truly hideous political environment of which we all despair. \nThe NISA arrived in the startup and innovation sectors like a breath of fresh air, so let\u2019s breathe deep. We can get to talking about the rain later. \nIt is still early days, and hard to quantify some of the NISA initiatives. But there are some standouts. In no particular order, let us acknowledge: \nVastly improved access to capital in the startup sector. This is in part due to the tax breaks to encourage angel investors, and partly due to some generous incentives to encourage investment in early stage venture capital limited funds. \nAn estimated $280 million has been invested by angels into early stage companies in 2016-17, while the amount of money committed to ESVCL partnerships (VC finds) grew from $620 million in 2015-16 to more than $1.3 billion in 2016-17. \nThose numbers are worth a party somewhere, given the dearth of early-stage dollars that had bedevilled the startup sector. \nThe CSIRO innovation fund and accelerator program. The jury is definitely still out on whether the $200 million Main Sequence Ventures can make a dent. But the NISA-identified the hole in the market and the follow-through has seen this fund established and make its first investments in science-based startups. This is worth a cheer (and ditto the Biomedical Translation Fund.) \nThe CSIRO\u2019s accelerator programs probably would have happened under chief executive Larry Marshall anyway, regardless of whether it was wrapped in the NISA package. \nBut as part of the package, it has proved an incredible success \u2013 as an instrument of cultural change its impact goes beyond the CSIRO (making it easier for outside organisation to engage with CSIRO expertise.) \nThe Incubator Support program from the Industry department had a confused start \u2013 it looked too much like free money \u2013 but has started to find its way. The program has been used in conjunction with state governments programs to rapidly boost startup and innovation precincts. \nThe results will be difficult to measure, but as a contributor to the momentum of startup sector exhibiting shockingly rude health, it should be given a tick. \nBut here comes the rain. What\u2019s going on with the R&D Incentive Scheme? Of the $9 billion of so that taxpayers invest in R&D support \u2013 either directly or indirectly \u2013 about two-thirds is through the R&D tax incentive. \nThe NISA specifically asked three eminent Australia\u2019s to study the scheme. Innovation and Science Australia CEO Bill Ferris, Chief Scientist Alan Finkel, and Treasury secretary John Fraser handed their report and recommendations to government 19 months \u2013 and they STILL haven\u2019t got a response. \nIn the meantime, the R&D tax incentive has been accessed by local companies in record numbers \u2013 and yet there is ongoing uncertainty about the scheme as the Tax Office was applied a series of seemingly conflicting definitions to its rule book. \nEven given the report being handed from one minister to another as the portfolio has changes hands (Pyne to Hunt to Sinodinos to Cash/Laundy) the uncertainty is unhelpful. \nThe government won\u2019t say when it will respond to the 3F review, saying through a spokesman: \u201cThe Government continues to consider how best to respond to the recommendations made by the Review panel. \n\u201cThe Government will respond to the Review\u2019s recommendations once it has finished its deliberations. \n\u201cThe R&D Tax Incentive is a significant and important component of Australia\u2019s innovation system, and the Government does not take reform of the program lightly.\u201d \nThe NISA also charged the newly-created Innovation and Science Australia (ISA) to first benchmark the Australian innovation ecosystem, and then to put together a 2030 Strategy for the nation. \nThe ISA handed its report to government several weeks ago, but still no word on when it will be released. It is hoped it will arrive this year, but nothing guaranteed: \n\u201cThe Government is considering the plan and will work with Mr Ferris and the Office of Innovation and Science Australia to coordinate a release date,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe Plan will be a key element of the Government\u2019s policy making moving forward, and will help inform how we strengthen Australia\u2019s role as a leading innovation nation.\u201d \nThe NISA had originally been intended as the first iteration of a rolling policy of continuous improvement. But from the outside at least, it seems the focus is lost. And the Grand Patriarch of its design and delivery \u2013 Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 does not provide the political cheerleading he once did. \nWhich is a shame, because it was the political patronage from the highest office that did more than anything to shift the needle. \nSo why has government gone so silent? Here\u2019s that spokesperson: \n\u201cNearly all the NISA initiatives have now been implemented, and we are starting to see some early positive results. We will also continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the Government\u2019s current investments in innovations, and make appropriate adjustments, as required. \n\u201cThe Government recognises that innovation remains key to Australia\u2019s future prosperity. It is therefore taking a forward-looking, systematic and strategic approach to the future of innovation policy \u2013 to be informed by the ISA 2030 Strategic Plan, the Chief Scientist\u2019s National Research Infrastructure Roadmap and our Digital Economy Strategy (which is currently being developed).\u201d \nThe National Innovation and Science Agenda was a modest initiative.

PicFocus is a specially designed image editing utility created with this specific purpose in mind, more specifically to help you rapidly and effortlessly bring into focus a particular area in a photo. Drag and drop support and slick looking user interface With the help of PicFocus, you can quickly draw out a line between the subject which you want to highlight and the background that needs to be blurred or desaturated. PicFocus comes with an elegant and minimalist user interface which provides you with a viewport and a right side panel containing all the tools you need to direct the attention to the portion of the picture you consider to should be the focus. Once you load up an image either by drag and dropping or by clicking the top left corner button, you have to draw up the delimitation between the photo's subject and the background. Tweak your photo's background and foreground using the side panel It is important to note that if you don't read the app's description or browse its screenshots, you might want to paint over the entire background. Unfortunately, this will not work as PicFocus expects you to draw the edge between the subject and background as a single line, and it might frustrating until you figure out how exactly you are supposed to mark out the focus edge. This being said, it would probably be a good idea if the development team adds a short walkthrough of the editing process within the app screen displayed before loading the image you want to edit. If you succeed marking the focus edge, the next step is to click the Apply button in the left side panel and tweak the background's blur, highlights, saturation, and warmth levels until you obtain the perfect result. The side panel also enables you to tweak the foreground's sharpness, clarity, vividness, and warmth levels, and, if you've messed up anything throughout this process, you can rapidly reset them to the default settings using the Reload buttons next to the Background and Foreground titles. User-friendly and straightforward tool to highlight a photo's subject Once you've finished editing your photo, you can export it to a JPEG, TIFF, BMP, GIF, or PNG format, or share it using an extensive assortment of services and apps by clicking the Share button in the top left corner of the main screen. All things considered, the PicFocus macOS application is a useful tool have in your image editing ammunition box for when you need to quickly touch up a photo and give it a DSLR look in just a few seconds.

In Australia, this currently applies only to telecommunications and internet service providers. \nThe government had been close to extending the scheme to include online platforms earlier in the year, but retreated from at the last moment in the face of intense lobbying from content owners, including the Australian Recording Industry Association, Foxtel, the AFL and News Corp. \nThere have now been nine public consultations on copyright run by government, with the last six recommending that the safe harbour regime be extended to online platforms. The Productivity Commission also recommended this in its report last year, with the government saying it \u201csupports in principle\u201d this recommendation. \nDespite this, the government has again declined to take action. Senator Fifield said further consultation would be undertaken before it is possibly extended to other sectors, including tech companies. \n\u201cThe measures in the bill will ensure these sectors are protected from legal liability where they can demonstrate that they have taken reasonable steps to deal with copyright infringement by users of their online platforms,\u201d Senator Fifield said in a statement. \n\u201cExtending the safe harbour scheme in this way will provide greater certainty to institutions in these sectors and enhance their ability to provide more innovative and creative services for all Australians.\u201d \n\u201cThe measures in the bill initially extend the application of the existing safe harbour scheme to sectors that provide beneficial services to all Australians and who are working collaboratively with copyright owners to address infringement.\u201d \nThe move has been criticised by StartupAus, with its chief operating officer Alex Gruszka calling it a \u201cvery disappointing decision\u201d. \n\u201cWe continue to lag behind others that have employed such a scheme, including the US, UK, Europe, South Korea and Singapore. We continue to have a significant barrier to starting a business like Google, Facebook, YouTube, SnapChat, Reddit or Pinterest,\u201d Mr Gruszka told InnnovationAus.com . \n\u201cWe also risk losing RedBubble, Envato and a host of Australian startups that are unprepared to take on that additional risk, and may see moving overseas as a necessity.\u201d \nExtending the safe harbour protections to online content providers was one of nine key recommendations included in this year\u2019s StartupAus Crossroads report. \nRedBubble founder and chief executive Martin Hosking has previously threatened to move his company overseas if the safe harbour regime isn\u2019t expanded. He also slammed the government over the decision. \n\u201cWe are very disappointed. Australia tends to like the idea of innovation but often the reality of it is much more challenging for Australian politicians, and I think we\u2019ve seen that today,\u201d Mr Hosking told InnovationAus.com . \n\u201cInnovation inevitably is challenging, it\u2019s not an easy thing to do and when you do have very staunch lobbyists it\u2019s hard for politicians to make the more difficult decisions, especially in this political environment,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a poor outcome, and Australia is left as the only country in the OECD which hasn\u2019t had the nous to come up with safe harbour legislation that deals with the reality of the internet.\u201d \nRedBubble, which has a market cap of more than $225 million, is facing a number of lawsuits in Australia over copyright infringing content posted by users on its platform. \nIf the safe harbour scheme was extended to online service providers, the company would have been protected from many of these challenges. \n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a reality in which user-generated content cannot be dealt with in a legal environment on the internet. The situation we have right now is that sites which depend on user-generated content don\u2019t have a secure legal framework, and that\u2019s very challenging,\u201d Mr Hosking said. \nWhile Australia has a number of successful two-way marketplaces including RedBubble and Envato, Mr Hosking said the current copyright laws are preventing huge tech giants from being launched and grown locally. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some successes but we haven\u2019t had anywhere near the successes of the very great companies that emerge out of Silicon Valley that rely on user-generated content, like Facebook and Google. They are two of the five largest corporations in the world,\u201d he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hosking", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex gruszka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch fifield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin hosking", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "envato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gruszka", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "news corp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "startupaus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oecd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "innovationaus.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "innnovationaus.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foxtel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "productivity commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian recording industry association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "envato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:00.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "059ca56aae20c15f7c1faac8cab8ddfd3ad8e808", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JxB.1wk07tj5DUJUCH8Wr7C6jWynC56WiQTUi556rA9qKX8NoZ10zG2gMebl4mY3eEapAbizz.I04T_MRkVw.K7WzN3QGtnAk-", "site_full": "elitmen.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://elitmen.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "ELITE WORLD", "title": "3 Deadly Mistakes Men Make In Bed That,Causes Weak Erection,Makes Their Wife Cheat..and How to Avoid Them", "title_full": "3 Deadly Mistakes Men Make In Bed That,Causes Weak Erection,Makes Their Wife Cheat..and How to Avoid Them", "published": "2017-12-07T11:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "059ca56aae20c15f7c1faac8cab8ddfd3ad8e808", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JxB.1wk07tj5DUJUCH8Wr7C6jWynC56WiQTUi556rA9qKX8NoZ10zG2gMebl4mY3eEapAbizz.I04T_MRkVw.K7WzN3QGtnAk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Eimiuhi Ehijie (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "3 Deadly Mistakes Men Make In Bed That,Causes Weak Erection,Makes Their Wife Cheat..and How to Avoid Them", "text": "3 Deadly Mistakes Men Make In Bed That,Causes Weak Erection,Makes Their Wife Cheat..and How to Avoid Them \n3 Deadly Mistakes Men Make In Bed That,Causes Weak Erection,Makes Their Wife Cheat..and How to Avoid Them \n\n\nMy Grandpa married 5 wives and had 19 children and there was no time any of the wives packed out of his house according to what my Dad told me. I don\u2019t mean to scare you but the Number 1 reason women cheat on their husband is lack of sexual satisfaction. That is why you see older women have sugar boys, they claim their husbands are now weak or too busy to give them what they want in bed. \n\nThe saying \u201cHell hath no furry like a woman scorned \u201c is not just a saying , nothing gets a woman pissed than a 2 minute sex performance. So what do most Nigerian women do if their husband cant satisfy them. 10 percent take it as their fate and get used to it but nag once in a while. 30 percent of them tell their friends about it or go online to seek other people opnion;they get different advice ranging from using sex toys, masturbating to orgasm and having a side boyfriend. The remaining 60 percent simply find a younger guy who can satisfy them,sometimes they go for the gate man,or the driver or maybe the neighbor .It would amaze you that no matter a woman\u2019s societal class she can do have sex with just anybody to cure her sex cravings. In this short article I would outline 3 silly mistakes men make in bed and also introduce you to a complete permanent solution to two minute embarrassing issue.   \n#1 \u2013 Neglecting Foreplay It is not just about penetration, most men skip the foreplay part and this aspect is where the woman get really aroused ,wet and ready for penetration. Some women even take foreplay more serious than the main thing.But most men just want to get an erection and zoom in. Now the issue is if after zooming in without good foreplay you cant go for upto 10 minutes which is the point at which a woman get into the sex then it makes no sense to her, because you are the only one who enjoyed it. \n #2 \u2013 Not Focusing On Her Desires Believe me \u201cLadies first\u201d doesn\u2019t just apply in social etiquettes, but in lovemaking as well! Try to listen to her moves,if she is ot feeling the sex position you would know, most men only try to satisfy themselves without thinking about the woman\u2019s desires. After sex take a good look at her face,ask her he sex positions she likes, the spots she would like you to hit. My wife wants it very deep so most times I raise her legs up hit it for 15 mins and she gets orgasm. You have to study and focus on her sex desires or else she would find it elsewhere \n #3 \u2013 Not Lasting Long Enough My brother in the midst of economic downturn, Evans the kidnapper story amongst others, the last thing a woman wants is 2 minutes sex. At least if she cant control economic matters and the bad news she hears on tv,work stress ; a lasting and earth shaking sex with the man she loves would complement for all that. Truth is more than 20 million Nigerian men cant last upto10 minutes on first round, and most of them cant get an erection after first round.. The major causes of this embarrassing issue is: 1.Poor diet and lack of exercise. 2.Stress and psychological problem 3.Excessive masturbation and pornography. \n\n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "evans", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:00.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d635e8c8a86ab8d355e83046080b58ac4dd8c766", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLttQ.TkyOebktVp03GUsFpuarVbJLfXz5fN30t0_2WZ1dByeWf2qCpwt5fCoLesZRbxUdEFJonfxQa.TNiXL8v8o-", "site_full": "floridastate.forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://floridastate.forums.rivals.com/forums/tribal-council-club-level.34/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Tribal Council -

Then we had so many ideas about what to wear and how to wear and what to do in the entire song. I'm really looking forward to it,\" she added.

Williams, 36, won this year\u2019s Australian Open while pregnant and gave birth to a baby girl in September. She has not played a competition since, raising questions over whether the 23-time Grand Slam winner would attempt to defend her title. Tiley is optimistic she will return for a crack at her seventh Melbourne Park crown after marrying Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian last month. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that she\u2019ll be ready in our view and she wants to break a record that is Margaret Court\u2019s. It would be a pretty significant accomplishment for her to be able to do that, \u201d he told the Herald-Sun newspaper. Margaret Court, an Australian has 24 major titles, making her the most successful player in Grand Slam history. Tiley described the Australian Open, which will be held from January 15-28, as a \u201cfamily-friendly event\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this before. Roger Federer travels with his four kids and we are a family-friendly event,\u201d he said, referring to Williams and her baby.

Elizabeth Tower and Big Ben are an iconic part of the London cityscape, similar to the Space Needle in Seattle. It has taken me months to grasp Parliament, the Royal Family, and the importance of Westminster locale has to the United Kingdom. \nAs someone from the United States, it\u2019s a little hard to understand the functions of Parliament and the Royal Family\u2019s role in the government. If you\u2019re interested in history, architecture, or government, I highly recommend taking a tour of the Houses of Parliament before the proposed restoration commences and the Houses are temporarily relocated. The Elizabeth Tower and Big Ben have already seen some restoration this year as the clock paused chiming until 2021. \nNow, it\u2019s time for some full disclosure: I\u2019m still learning about the Houses of Parliament and the government as a whole. I\u2019ve never been into politics or government affairs, especially when they are splashed across the news. I applaud Brits (and other EU countries) for knowing the issues and being involved. With the recent election of President Trump, I\u2019m taking it as a wake-up call to have more interest in the causes that matter to me, like public lands and climate change. \nI\u2019ve found this video to be helpful when starting to figure out how Parliament works. A Quick Rundown about the Palace of Westminster \nAlso known as the Houses of Parliament, the Palace is the meeting place for both the House of Commons and the House of Lords and managed by the speakers of both houses and their committees. A Summary of the Houses of Parliament Blue Badge Tour Palace of Westminster Architecture \nAfter the 1834 fire, Charles Barry won the public competition to design present Gothic-styled palace. Instead of taking the proposed several years to rebuild, it took roughly 30 years. The tour highlights some of the key designs. Barry mentored and worked with the young Augustus Welby Pugin to help with the Gothic design as Barry\u2019s expertise was more of a classical-style. Westminster Hall \nWestminster Hall is where the tours begin and one of the few areas that allow photography. Westminster Hall has been in existence as early as 1097, is the oldest building in Parliament and was the largest hall of its time. \nThe hammer-beam roof (first commissioned in 1393) has been restored over the years as the architectural feat required reinforcement and the roof needed replaced. A fire in 1834 destroyed most of the interior of the hall but the roof was hosed with water in order to save it. Most recently, the beams were in a bad state due cavities caused by death-watch beetle. Concealed steelwork was added while trying to preserve the original aesthetic. It still stands even after being bombed during the Second World War in May of 1941. St. Stephen\u2019s Hall \nExit Westminster Hall and enter St. Stephen\u2019s Hall passing through New Dawn door, which was designed by Mary Branson to celebrate 150 years since the campaign for women\u2019s votes. The door is a light installation with \u201cglass discs are a direct reference to the parchment scrolls which line the famous Act Room of the Parliamentary Archives in the Victoria Tower, and where the legislation which brought women the vote and a say in the laws that govern them is stored.\u201d Source . \nTip: Take a picture of the door on the beginning of the tour and at the end. Compare the photos and see how they have changed in the 90-minutes. \nThe Hall is lined with art and sculptures recovered from St Stephen\u2019s Chapel after the fire. It\u2019s also where the public lines up to enter the House of Commons to observe debates. Central Lobby \nThe Central Lobby is the midpoint between the two Houses. It is also a place where the public can lobby to Parliament Members and the Lords. As one enters the lobby, the decorative encaustic tiled floor welcomes its visitors. The tiles were designed to take year of foot traffic without losing its pattern. Currently, the tiles are being restored. Royal statues decorate the arches surrounding the high windows in the lobby depicting past kings and queens. \nThe lobby also hosts the Admission Order Office, Reception Desk, a live broadcast point, and a post office. The Reception Desk is staffed when either of the Houses are in session and is where the visiting public can attempt to schedule a meeting with their MP (Member of Parliament). A Live Broadcast Point was established in the lobby where the press can interview Members. On days the Prime Minister attends the House of Commons, gallery tickets are issued at the Admission Order Office. Tickets aren\u2019t required on days the Prime Minister isn\u2019t present. Norman Porch \nLocated at the base of the Victoria Tower, the Norman Porch is used by the Sovereign when entering the palace. The Royal Staircase is used to enter the Norman Porch and is the procession for the State Opening of Parliament on the path to the House of Lords. \nFun fact: Queen Victoria rarely attended the state openings. Queen Elizabeth II has now only missed it twice for the birth of her children. Robing Room \nAlso known as the Queen Chambers, the room is used by the Head of State to dress before the State Opening of Parliament. When ready, the Head of State (the Queen) leaves the Robing Room, passes through the Royal Gallery, Prince\u2019s Chamber, and enters the House of Lords. Royal Gallery \nContinuing the procession from the Robing Room, the Head of State enters a procession of trumpets with roughly 300 people in the hall for the State Opening. Normally used for important occasions, such as state receptions and dinners, the Royal Gallery is now used as a working space for peers. Originally called Victoria Gallery, it\u2019s the largest room of the Palace and a part of Victoria and Albert timeframe. Look around the gallery and see portraits of past monarchs. \nTwo large fresco paintings hang in the gallery and were two out of eighteen commissioned to the Irish artist, Daniel Maclise. Maclise researched both the Battle of Waterloo and Battle of Trafalgar to get accurate representations for the pieces. Maclise was new to the fresco style, where painting was one done on plaster. Waterloo (1861) and Trafalgar (1865) took longer than planned (16 to 18 months each) and the fading paint resulted in without further commissions. Prince\u2019s Chamber \nBefore and after business, Members use this area to discuss topics of interest with direct access to the House of Lords Chamber. As you enter, the marble Statue of Queen Victoria by John Gibson is hard to miss. Dated 1855, the statue includes Justice and Mercy next to Queen Victoria with pedestal panels representing commerce, science, and industry. \nPrince Albert commissioned 28 portraits of monarchs from the Tudor Royal Family to artist Richard Burchett and his pupils. The portraits circle the room and are oil paint on timber panels. If you look close, you\u2019ll find some of the wife portraits and names to be incorrect. Above the portraits, a series of six paintings of the Spanish Armada of 1855 hang as a tribute to the tapestries destroyed in the 1834 fire. Mark Piggott made a generous donation and the paintings were finally finished in 2010. House of Lords Chamber \nPugin and Barry view the chamber as their masterpiece since this House of Lords Chamber is where the Sovereign, the Commons and the Lords come together. The room is decorated in red for the color of the Lords. A canopy made of wood and gilded in gold is where the throne (1847) is located and used for the State Opening of Parliament. The Lord Great Chamberlain carries in a white stick raised to summoned Commons. Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod goes to the Central Lobby and bangs on House of Commons door three times after the door is purposely slammed in his face. After, the Members of the House of Commons join the House of Lords in the Lords Chamber to hear the Sovereign make a speech to open Parliament from the throne. \nCentered between the throne and the benches, the Woolsack is where the Lord Speaker sits. However, unlike the House of Commons, the Speaker doesn\u2019t conduct the business of the House of Lords but is the representative of the Lords. Yes, the Lords still wear wigs. \nMembers are appointed and are life peers whose jobs are to amend the bills and legislation that comes out of Parliament. House of Lords is a check and balances for the House of Commons. The House of Lords can delay but never veto legislation. Then the game of ping pong between the Houses happen law is signed. The House of Lords has roughly 800 Members. Prime Minister appoints Members to House of Lords and Members average age is 69 with the youngest being 39\u2012and usually are aristocrats. Former Members of the House of Commons usually come here to die is the joke. \nThe statues above the galleries in the Lords Chamber are of the 18 barons who sealed the Magna Carta\u2012a fundamental English law document. The Moses Room \nThe Moses Room is used by the Grand Committees and is named after the large fresco artwork that hangs in the room. Member\u2019s Lobby of the House of Commons \nThe tour continues winding through decorated corridors and libraries. The Member\u2019s corridor links the Commons Chamber and is used for a working or a waiting room for Members. When the House of Commons is in session, the only people permitted in the lobby besides the MPs are security staff and the press. Lobby correspondents can wait here and whips make sure MPs vote how they are supposed to vote for their party. Message and letter boards are located in the lobby where MPs can check to see the topics of the discussions in the Chambers. The boxes light up when they have messages. \nThe Churchill Arch was restored after the Second World War bombings at the direction of Winston Churchill, a former Prime Minister. Along with the arch, there are statues of prior prime ministers in the lobby. \nParliament is a factory of law. A division bell will ring in many buildings and Members have only minutes to vote by walking through the lobbies. There are two lobbies: aye lobby and no lobby. Clerks count the votes and give results to Speaker of the House. The average is 5.5 months to get a bill through the Houses and approved. Royal assent is the final stage of the bill. House of Commons Chamber \nThe House of Commons is known as the place where Members pass laws, debate issues, and question the ministers. The current chamber was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott after it was heavily bombed during the Second World War. Unlike the red decor in the House of Lords, the benches in the House of Commons are green. The Speaker\u2019s chair is located in the middle aisle on the one end of the chamber. Benches face each other with two sides: the opposition (left of the Speaker) and government (right of the speaker). Member\u2019s sit in their affiliation sections (Conservative, Labour, etc.). There are currently 650 Members in the House of Commons. \nVisiting on a day that Parliament is in session? Consider attending the sessions in the public galleries that overlook. Here, the public can get a sense of how laws are passed in the United Kingdom. It was quite exciting when I visited outside of the tour. Know Before You Go 1. Tickets \nIf you can, buy tickets ahead of time. The tours (guided and audio) do not run when Parliament is in session, so make sure to look at the calendar at least a couple of weeks before your visit. If you wait to the last minute, you may be disappointed. \nI haven\u2019t seen long queues at the ticket office, which is located across the street from Parliament near the Underground Station. The staff can let you know what you can access during the week if you didn\u2019t buy tickets ahead of time. 2. Tours and Entrance \nPick the tour that best suits your travel style: Guided or audio. If you want to go at your own pace, go with the audio tour. The guided tours give you some information you may not find on the plaques and audio guide and gives you access to ask a knowledgeable Blue Badge Guide any question you may have. I chose to go guided since I had a bunch of lingering questions on how things work. \nAfter securing your tickets, cross the street and walk down the outside of Westminster Palace. You\u2019ll pass several private entrances before arriving at the Cromwell Green Entrance. Present your ticket, go through security, and meet your tour or pick up your audio guide in Westminster Hall. 3. House of Commons Debates \nAre the tour tickets sold out or is Parliament in session? Head to the ticket office or go to the Cromwell Green Entrance to see if there is a long queue to watch the debates. Only a couple hundred people from the public are permitted to watch at a time so depending on the topic and if the Prime Minister is scheduled to be present, you may find yourself waiting for awhile. Either get there early or make a game day decision. Note: If you\u2019re going on the tour, you\u2019ll see the room where the House of Commons meet.

departments undergo their own digital transformation and focus on delivering improved citizen services, Macquarie Government managing director Aidan Tudehope says it is a timely opportunity for the public sector to re-look at everything from cultural impediments to procurement reform. \n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to crank the competitive marketplace with a whole lot of different offerings,\u201d Mr Tudehope told the Open Opportunity Canberra forum last week. \n\u201cWhen we think about the Digital Marketplace and we think about injecting competition in the way we procure IT, we do need to think about all the different flavours.\u201d \nMr Tudehope says if more competition was injected in the IT procurement process, it will drive better prices, better services and better innovations. \n\u201cThe IT infrastructure component and what cloud brings to government is way more than just new tech. It has the ability to have continuous improvement in the way we procure because we all know for the last 20 years the role of IT procurement has been a sad place,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIn fact, I would suggest IT procurement has made it a real challenge for many CEOs to maintain their seat at the executive table, because the way we procure IT has always been about long-term contracts \u2013 in some cases not just for years but decades. \n\u201cThis really restricts the ability to inject innovation, price, competition, new service levels and new ways of doing things.\u201d \nAnother element of the digital transformation process that government needs to build on, Mr Tudehope says, is improving the level of public trust in government services. \n\u201cThe reality is the most important thing government has \u2013 and can so easily lose \u2013 is the trust of its citizens,\u201d he said. \n\u201cWe can talk about digital transformation, user experience, innovating in the way we deliver citizen services, but the minute government, at any level, misses a beat when it comes to security and the trust element that feeds into, we really do go back to ground zero. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that in a couple of examples elevated by some Commonwealth IT failures. The reality is you have to make sure when you\u2019re doing this transformation \u2013 not just the citizen bit \u2013 but the transformation of how we move our IT infrastructure as an enabler, we have to be very mindful of this.\u201d \nMr Tudehope expects this distrust in government will begin to change when the Data Breach Notification is mandated from February next year, and security parameters will be non-negotiable and \u201cbaked in from the get-go\u201d of any new solution. \nAccording to Glenn Archer, visiting fellow of Australian National University and the former chief information officer of the Australian Government, in order for government to build trust, more rigour need to be applied during the deployment of services. \nRussell Wilson, special counsel from Maddocks, suggested government needs do a better job at promoting and providing transparency around what solutions are deployed, as well as how people\u2019s information are used. \n\"Government has a PR piece to do, and that's to explain to citizens the benefits of taking potential risks in order to deploy robust strategies,\u201d he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aidan tudehope", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maddocks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russell wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glenn archer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tudehope", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "macquarie government", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commonwealth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian national university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digital marketplace", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:01.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d53e11375f74c462851305b2d8763a871b682989", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxUYwafDFrjp.Xow1f5R9cuIRfrwnOIdKYY_7X9SNuaSUJdBfgZQgaq1L3bN.VDQnFT1tKm5oXbNqlpvu.vq7pm", "site_full": "inikalteng.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://inikalteng.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "ini kalteng", "title": "Google Alert - flowers", "title_full": "Google Alert - flowers", "published": "2017-12-07T11:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d53e11375f74c462851305b2d8763a871b682989", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxUYwafDFrjp.Xow1f5R9cuIRfrwnOIdKYY_7X9SNuaSUJdBfgZQgaq1L3bN.VDQnFT1tKm5oXbNqlpvu.vq7pm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "rony saputra (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google Alert - flowers", "text": "flowers As-it-happens update \u22c5 December 7, 2017 NEWS Harry & David, 1-800- Flowers .com Launch Southern Living Line Gourmet Retailer 1-800- Flowers .com and Harry & David have teamed up with Time Inc. to launch a collection of gourmet food and floral inspired by Southern Living magazine.

The utility is using the Adobe Camera RAW engine and Lightroom to allow you to work directly on RAW files. Use powerful tools to create your own high-quality, time-lapse videos To start working with the LRTimelapse application, simply use the built-in importer tool to add the RAW pictures from your time lapse photo shoot sessions. However, LRTimelapse also comes with an integrated file browser that allows you to navigate both your local storage and external drives. Within the LRTimelapse user interface, you can browse through the sequences and preview the captured images. Depending on the data you have available you must choose the workflow you want to apply to your sequence. LRTimelapse offers you the possibility to configure how many keyframes you want to use and then helps you export the data into the Lightroom application for further editing. After you process the keyframes within Lightroom, you can import the sequence back to LRTimelapse, add transition effects and preview the results. Robust workflows that can give amazing effects to your time-lapse videos The best part is that LRTimelapse fully integrates with your Lightroom installation with the help of a plug-in, so sending data to and fro is as easy as pressing a button. Besides the Basic and DeFlicker time lapse workflows, LRTimelapse also integrates the Holy Grail configuration tool that can help you create seamless day to night transitions without making too many adjustments. Finding your way around is fairly intuitive, but to learn basic notions and to get tips and tricks on how you can efficiently use LRTimelapse, make sure to go online and watch the video tutorials provided by the developer.

Amazon Internet Services Pvt Ltd (AISPL), an Indian subsidiary of the Amazon Group which undertakes the resale and marketing of AWS Cloud services in India, has achieved full CSP empanelment by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). The government organisations and state-run banks can now increase agility and speed innovation with AWS\u2019s flexible and highly secure \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d Cloud services. \u201cThe empanelment of the AWS Cloud is paving the way for innovation so that government bodies can serve citizens more effectively, achieve scientific breakthroughs, reach broader constituents, and invest more time and resources into their core missions,\u201d said Peter Moore, Regional Managing Director, Amazon Web Services, Public Sector \u2013 Asia Pacific. AISPL successfully completed the STQC (Standardisation Testing and Quality Certification) audit from the MeitY for Cloud services delivered from the AWS Asia Pacific (Mumbai) Region. \u201cWe are excited to deepen our engagement with central, state and local governments and public sector bodies in India to offer them the broadest suite of cloud services, and a transformational approach to accelerate the deployment of digital services in the country,\u201d Moore added. AWS public sector customers in India include Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corp (APSSDC), the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), CSC e-Governance Services (set up by the Ministry of Electronics and IT), Gujarat Technical University, Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati. By using AWS, the Quality Council of India (QCI) has expedited the accreditation process of its various projects. \u201cWe chose AWS as the technology platform for their massive economies of scale, support for open standards, and highly secure infrastructure. The optimisation that AWS Cloud provides has reduced costs, and boosted the security of data within India \u2014 which is one of the prime concerns for many of our clients,\u201d said Dr Ravi P, Singh, Secretary General, QCI. According to Dr Amit Sethi, Associate Professor, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, hyper-scale Cloud platform such as AWS enables educational institutes to increase the speed of research. \u201cIt also reduces time-to-results by running high performance computing (HPC) in the Cloud, and scaling to larger numbers of parallel tasks rapidly than would be practical in many on-premises environments,\u201d Dr Sethi added. Since the launch of AWS Asia Pacific (Mumbai) Region in June 2016, more than 120,000 customers including Tata Motors, Lupin, Future Group and Shoppers\u2019 Stop have adopted AWS Cloud for a broad range of applications. \u201cData Security Council of India (DSCI) appreciates the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology\u2019s (MeitY\u2019s) policy to promote cloud adoption in government by empaneling cloud service providers,\u201d noted Rama Vedashree, CEO, Data Security Council of India. MeitY has been advising government bodies and departments to procure Cloud services only from the empaneled and audit-compliant CSPs.

He described it as historic and an \u201cimportant step towards peace\u201d.\nHamas, the militant group which aims to liberate Palestine from the Israeli occupation, made the \u201cgates of hell\u201d remark in a reference to how it claimed the decision would hit US interests in the region.\nHundreds of people gathered to protest against Mr Trump \u2019s decision outside the US Embassy in Istanbul, Turkey. Extra security was also put in place at US embassies in the Middle East and Germany.\nAnalysis: Trump's Jerusalem Announcement Likely to Inflame Israeli-Palestinian Tensions\nThe US embassy in Tel Aviv, which is set to switch to Jerusalem as part of the move, urged its diplomats and their relatives not to carry out personal travel in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City and the West Bank for now.\nHowever, there were more peaceful scenes at a wall to the old city of Jerusalem, where the Stars and Stripes flag was projected onto it - alongside a projection of the Israeli flag.\nPalestinians believe the status of East Jerusalem, which has been under Israeli rule since the 1967 Six-Day War \u2013 but until now not recognised as its capital internationally, should not be discussed until the later stages of peace talks. This is backed up by the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords.\nAccording to reports in Palestine, Hamas chief Ismail Haniya warned of \u2018serious repercussions of this decision which constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and a dangerous escalation that will drag the region into a new phase of conflict.\nMr Trump said the decision, which turned decades of US foreign policy on its head, was \u201clong overdue\u201d adding that many of his predecessors had wanted, but failed, to recognise the city in this way.\nAnalysis: Trump's Jerusalem Announcement Likely to Inflame Israeli-Palestinian Tensions\nIn a White House address, the President said he had \u201cjudged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America, and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians\u201d.\nMr Netanyahu, who said he was \u201cprofoundly grateful\u201d, added that he would \u201ccontinue to work with the President and his team\u201d to make that dream \u201ccome true.\u201d\nEarlier, the Arab League called Mr Trump\u2019s move \u201ca dangerous measure that would have repercussions\u201d in the region. The group also suggested it called into question the US\u2019s role as a \u201ctrusted mediator\u201d in peace talks. King Salman of Saudi Arabia told him by phone the decision would \u201charm the peace negotiation process and escalate tension in the region\u201d.\nJordan\u2019s King Abdullah said joint efforts were required to deal with the fall-out and any decision which undermines the Palestinians \u201caspirations for their own independent state, with East Jerusalem as its capital\u201d.\nAnalysis: Trump's Jerusalem Announcement Likely to Inflame Israeli-Palestinian Tensions\nMahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, the self-governing body of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, went further, saying the US had effectively abdicated its role as peace mediator.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Mr Trump\u2019s move was \u201cregrettable\u201d.\nPope Francis said: \u201cI appeal strongly for all to respect the city\u2019s status quo, in accordance with the relevant UN resolutions.\u201d The UN said the city was \u201ca final-status issue\u201d.\nNicola Sturgeon said Mr Trump\u2019s decision on Jerusalem was \u201creckless, wrong and a threat to peace\u201d.\nThe First Minister tweeted last night that the move was \u201cbeing rightly condemned across the international community\u201d.\nPrime Minister Theresa May said the US President\u2019s announcement was \u201cunhelpful\u201d to prospects for peace in the region.\nShe said: \u201cOur position on the status of Jerusalem is clear and long-standing: it should be determined in a negotiated settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and Jerusalem should ultimately be the shared capital of the Israeli and Palestinian states.\u201d\nShe said the British Embassy would not move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, adding: \u201cTo have the best chances of success, the peace process must be conducted in an atmosphere free from violence.\u201d\nAnalysis: Trump's Jerusalem Announcement Likely to Inflame Israeli-Palestinian Tensions\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran felt it was \u201cout of despair and debility that they want to declare Jerusalem as capital of the Zionist regime\u201d.\nHuman rights group Amnesty International said the US was guilty of \u201cviolating its own international legal obligations not to recognise or assist an illegal situation and to ensure respect for the Geneva Conventions.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ismail haniya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicola sturgeon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdullah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mr trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pope francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ayatollah ali khamenei", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "british embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arab league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amnesty international", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestinian authority", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "old city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:02.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d635e8c8a86ab8d355e83046080b58ac4dd8c766", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLttQ.TkyOebktVp03GUsFpuarVbJLfXz5fN30t0_2WZ1dByeWf2qCpwt5fCoLesZRbxUdEFJonfxQa.TNiXL8v8o-", "site_full": "floridastate.forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://floridastate.forums.rivals.com/forums/tribal-council-club-level.34/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Tribal Council -
