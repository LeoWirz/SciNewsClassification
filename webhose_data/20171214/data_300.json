He went to washroom and asked Hiten to come along with him. Hina asked Hiten not to follow Vikas. She asked Hiten to come in the ground area and save her place for the captaincy.

On the buzzer, everyone rushed towards parking area expect Hiten and eventually Hina was out of the race.

Hiten told Vikas it was because of him he had to listen to Hina\u2019s condescending remarks. Vikas hugged Hiten. Akash called Hiten a loser for betraying Hina and then they both got into an argument.

The Celtics are 8-0 against the West. \nThe Celtics played without Jaylen Brown and Morris. Brown sat with an inflamed right eye, while Morris was out due to left knee soreness. \nIt forced Stevens to rely heavily on his reserves. They came through in the fourth, leading a 10-0 run to put Boston back in front 80-73. \nDallas fought back to tie it up at 85. But the Celtics ran off eight straight points to push their lead to 93-85 with 2 minutes to play. \n\u201cJust covering for one another. We\u2019re a team. We\u2019re pros for a reason,\u201d said Terry Rozier, who led all Celtics reserves with 12 points. \u201cYou put all that hard work in and you have to be ready.\u201d \nHarrison Barnes led the Mavericks with 19 points and seven rebounds. Dirk Nowitzki added 16 points and six rebounds. \nBoston\u2019s bench outscored their Dallas counterparts 36-23 for the game. \n\u201cThey have a good team, they keep coming,\u201d Nowitzki said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really good tonight. I didn\u2019t close the game the way I wanted to.\u201d \nDallas had just three turnovers in the opening 24 minutes and led 57-47 at the half. \nThe Celtics fought through periods of sloppiness offensively, committing seven turnovers in the first two quarters. They were also outscored 20-12 in the paint. \nThough it\u2019s early, Horford said it feels good to be 22-4 after all they\u2019ve been through. \n\u201cI\u2019m very happy,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing into the season you never have any expectations. This is good. We want to keep building on it.\u201d \nStevens is also cautiously optimistic. \n\u201cI feel good about where we\u2019re headed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go.\u201d \nTIP-INS \nMavericks: Were outrebounded 53-45. ... Were outscored 34-32 in the paint. \nCeltics: Stevens said both Brown and Morris are expected to be with team when it departs for three-game trip on Thursday. \nQUOTABLE \n\u201cOur first half was really good. Their second half was better, and that\u2019s the game.\u201d\u2014 Dallas coach Rick Carlisle. \nWILD THIRD \nThe Mavericks took a 59-47 lead earlier in the third quarter. But the Celtics erased the deficit with a 15-2 run. It was part of a fast-moving quarter that saw the lead change hands eight times. \nBarnes had 12 points in period for Dallas. Horford paced Boston with 10 points. \nNOEL SURGERY \nCarlisle announced before the game that forward Nerlens Noel will have surgery later this week in Cleveland for a torn ligament in his left thumb. \n\u201cHe\u2019ll be out for several weeks,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cI don\u2019t know for how long.\u201d \nNoel has appeared in 18 games this season, but hasn\u2019t played since Nov. 22. \nDIRK\u2019S LONGEVITY \nNowitzki hasn\u2019t said whether this will be his final NBA season at age 39. He\u2019s already tied Kobe Bryant for the most seasons spent with one franchise at 20. Another season would give him the outright record, but Carlisle said he believes it is still an open question. \n\u201cI believe it\u2019s going to depend on how he\u2019s feeling. I don\u2019t know any NBA player that wouldn\u2019t want to continue playing into oblivion,\u201d Carlisle said. \nUP NEXT \nMavericks: At Milwaukee on Friday. \nCeltics: Begin three-game trip Friday at San Antonio Can't Find Something?

That includes Google's Chromecast streaming device, an alternative to Fire TV, and an internet-connected speaker called Home, which is trying to catch up to Amazon's market-leading Echo. Amazon's high-end Echo Show has a screen that can display video. \n\"Given this lack of reciprocity, we are no longer supporting YouTube on Echo Show and Fire TV,\" Google said in a Tuesday statement. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThe battle highlights the power that the world's major technology companies are gaining as they dominate important corners of commerce and communications. As the world's largest online retailer, Amazon has tremendous sway over what people buy, while the results delivered by Google's ubiquitous search engine often help determine what people do on and off the web. \nGoogle is hoping to pressure Amazon into selling Google's products by taking away access to the world's most widely watched video service. Unless a truce is reached, YouTube will stop working on Fire TV on Jan. 1. YouTube was supposed to disappear from the Echo Show Tuesday, although Amazon has previously found ways to make unauthorized versions of YouTube available on that device. \nThe dispute between Amazon and Google mirrors the face-offs that occasionally crop up between pay-TV providers and TV networks when it comes time to re-negotiate their deals. \nBut in this instance, the two tech heavyweights aren't fighting over licensing fees. Instead, they are jockeying to position their gadgets and, by extension, their digital services into homes as internet-connected appliances and devices become more deeply ingrained in people's lives. \nThe bickering between Google and Amazon has been going on several years as they have ratcheted up the competition with each other. One of the first signs that the companies were at odds came when Amazon redesigned Google's Android mobile software for its Kindle tablets. Two years ago, Amazon ousted Chromecast from its store, even though that device had previously been its top-selling electronics gadget. \nThe latest standoff between Google and Amazon was ridiculed by a trade association of high-speed internet providers. The group, USTelecom, has been trying to persuade skeptics that internet providers will preserve equal access to all digital services, even if the Federal Communications Commission adopts a proposal to rescind current \"net neutrality\" regulations . \nInternet providers are committed to \"protections like no content blocking or throttling,\" said USTelecom CEO Jonathan Spalter. \"Seems like some of the biggest internet companies can't say the same. Ironic, isn't it?\" \nBesides withholding Chromecast and the Home speaker from its store, Amazon has also rankled Google by declining to sell an internet-connected thermostat made by Nest, which is owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc. Amazon also doesn't allow its Prime video streaming service on Chromecast, an omission that Google wants to change. \nAmazon also doesn't sell Apple's video streaming player. But that could change if Amazon's video streaming service starts working on Apple TV, something Apple has said would happen by the end of this year. But that announcement was made in June and Prime video still isn't available on Apple TV. \nRoku's market-leading streaming players are sold through Amazon. Roku's players feature channels for watching both Prime video and YouTube.

slave trade market.\n\nOnyeama disclosed this to newsmen after the Federal Executive Council meeting that took place yesterday, December 6th. According to him, the Federal government is currently in talks with officials of Nigeria\u2019s Charge D\u2019Affairs in Libya to ascertain the number of Nigerians held up in Libya detntion centers so as to expedite action in bringing them back home. He said information from the officers shows that some Nigerians are unwilling to come back home.\n\n\u2018The charge d\u2019affairs officials have said a number of Nigerians, not all of them, do not want to come back home. Certainly, it has to be only those that want to come back home\u2019. he said\n\nOver 3000 Nigerians have been evacuated home since the illicit slave trade business happening in Libya was brought to light.

She is a gorgeous 4 mon old terrier mixture and has the most gentlest soul. Right now she weighs around ten pounds. She seems like she may be a tall and lanky girl when fullgrown. Harley is a shy little girl but will come around in the right home. She is really thriving at her foster home and making progress everyday. Harley is a very happy girl and will greet you with a cute tail wag when you come home. Harley would do best in a calm household with a family who will give her the love and patience she needs to help her adjust into her new loving home. ... ( read more ) A home with young kids isn't recommended just because she is so shy. However, Harley absolutely adores all dogs and would be a fantastic playmate!! She gets along so great with her foster doggie brother and sister and loves to chase them in the yard. Harley will need a fenced in yard as she is still a little skittish and needs training with walking on a leash and being socialized with new people over time.

Edison when my son was nine years old. He is now 22 and in the Air Force. Edison has always been a great dog and playful though he has slowed down in the past couple of years. He still likes to chase his toys but not as much. He is a very smart dog which will get him in trouble at times. Personally, I think it is because he has a sense of humor. He adores people and being with the family sitting on the couch beside me watching television. It is hard to let him go but with a new grandson who is not very gentile being only 1 1/2yrs old. I want Edison to be safe and happy.

Poppy is a fun loving little girl and is pretty chill to be such a young puppy. At times Poppy can be a little shy but not too bad. She does not mind being held and loves to give snuggles and kisses on the face. Poppy adores all dogs and would be a fantastic playmate for a dog big or small. Her foster sister is a 70lb pit mixture and Poppy adores her and loves to play with her. Poppy is doing excellent at sleeping in a crate at night and coming along wonderfully with house training. ... ( read more ) Right now she weights around eight pounds and should not get too much bigger. She should stay between fifteen to twenty pounds as she is a pretty petite little lady. She has a fenced in backyard at her foster home and this girl loves to be outside running and playing with her puppy friends!! She loves to play with toys and a ball is a favorite. Poppy is excited to find her forever home! Poppy will be ready for adoption Dec. 20.

A positive Chaikin Money Flow indicates that the stock is strong while a negative CMF indicates that the stock is weak. The CMF indicator passing through the zero line (rising above or falling below) may indicate a shift in the overall trend for the equity. The indicator, created by Marc Chaikin, is based on the theory that the strength of the market can be determined by looking at where the price closes compared to its daily range and volume. If the market is strong you will see if closing in the upper half with a high volume. A weak market can be seen if it closes in the lower half of the range on high volume. \nTaking a deeper dive into the numbers, A&W Revenue Royalties Income Fund (AWRRF) has a 50-day Moving Average of 26.83, the 200-day Moving Average is 27.23, and the 7-day is noted at 26.63. A popular tool among technical stock analysts is the moving average. Moving averages are considered to be lagging indicators that simply take the average price of a stock over a specific period of time. Moving averages can be very useful for identifying peaks and troughs. They may also be used to help the trader figure out proper support and resistance levels for the stock. \nValue investors may be scanning the shelves for bargain stocks. They may be looking to spot those shares that haven\u2019t been doing a whole lot and are being generally overlooked by the investing world. Value investors may be searching for stocks with lower price to earnings ratios that possess higher dividend yields. Investors looking for growth stocks may be willing to shell out a little more for a stock that has the possibility of increasing EPS at a quicker pace. Some investors may favor one category of stocks over another, but they may need to find a combination at some point. As markets tend to move in cycles, it may be necessary to align the portfolio to the category that is best positioned to make consistent gains in the future. \nTraders may be relying in part on technical stock analysis. A&W Revenue Royalties Income Fund (AWRRF) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -74.35. Despite the name, CCI can be used on other investment tools such as stocks. The CCI was designed to typically stay within the reading of -100 to +100. Traders may use the indicator to determine stock trends or to identify overbought/oversold conditions. A CCI reading above +100 would imply that the stock is overbought and possibly ready for a correction. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally. \nAt the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for A&W Revenue Royalties Income Fund (AWRRF) is 14.16. Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. The ADX is typically plotted along with two other directional movement indicator lines, the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI). Some analysts believe that the ADX is one of the best trend strength indicators available. \nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is one of multiple popular technical indicators created by J. Welles Wilder. Wilder introduced RSI in his book \u201cNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\u201d which was published in 1978. RSI measures the magnitude and velocity of directional price movements. The data is represented graphically by fluctuating between a value of 0 and 100. The indicator is computed by using the average losses and gains of a stock over a certain time period. RSI can be used to help spot overbought or oversold conditions. An RSI reading over 70 would be considered overbought, and a reading under 30 would indicate oversold conditions. A level of 50 would indicate neutral market momentum. The 14-day RSI is currently sitting at 44.90, the 7-day is at 41.41, and the 3-day is spotted at 52.49 for A&W Revenue Royalties Income Fund (AWRRF).

Power was restored around 2am and that was when the fire started. There was a sudden explosion in the shop. It was difficult to get close to the place because everywhere was on fire. The heat was intense.\n\n\u201cLater, firefighters brought out their corpses. It was the body of the woman that was brought out first, before those of the two children. They initially couldn\u2019t find the pastor. After some search, they found his corpse in the shop, where he was probably attempting to find a way out,\u201d the printer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.\n\nThe two children, Miracle and Marvellous, were said to be aged six and three  respectively.\n\nA friend of the victim, Okechukwu Idoko, claimed to have mobilised some residents to put out the fire before the arrival of the firefighters, adding that their efforts were futile.\n\nIdoko said he had discussed with the victim the previous day on the completion of his (Kenneth\u2019s) house in the Ikorodu area of the state.\n\n\u201cHe said he wanted to lay the tiles on the floor, and I advised him to put certain things in place first. That was our last discussion before he died. Despite the fire, the money he made from the previous day sales in the shop, and his telephone were intact,\u201d he added.\n\nPunch Metro reports that Kenneth\u2019s wife, Favour, had been sick for some time.\n\nHer sickness was said to have been caused by two caesarean births, which left her bedridden. She had to be taken to the village for treatment.\n\nA family member of the victim, Okey Emereonye, said the sickness affected the finances of the family, which made Kenneth to quit his former apartment and relocate the family to the shop.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen I visited them on Sunday at this place, I was surprised to see that she had returned from the village. She was making chin-chin, which she branded, \u2018Mirvel,\u2019 from the names of their children. I asked why Favour was brought back and Kenneth said he believed that being around her children would hasten her healing. I never knew it was the last time I would see them.\n\n\u201cKenneth was the breadwinner of the family. His parents are still alive. They have been informed and the bodies of the victims were taken directly to the village through the help of his church members.\u201d\n\nThe Director of the Lagos State Fire Service, Rasak Fadipe, said the agency received a distress call around 2.48am, adding that the Alausa and Ilupeju fire divisions responded.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe met the fire well alight and our men put it out. There were two levels of burglar proof \u2013 one at the entrance of the shop, while the other covered the extension. We found it difficult to gain access because of the burglar proof bars.\n\n\u201cWe should not turn our houses to prisons. Safety is very important. Every member of a family should know how the door is locked at night. We should discourage the use of keys to lock doors.

Services were stretched up to, and in some places beyond breaking point. \n\u201cThis time preparations have never been more thorough. \n\u201cBut we have to recognise we are not where we would want to be as we head into winter. \n\u201cThe NHS is already under severe pressure, and while the additional funding in the recent Budget is welcome, it has come very late to be used to maximum effect. \nCan you or can\u2019t you spread the flu if you\u2019re feeling well? #flumythbuster \u2026 #flufighter https://t.co/9rkaLOz9Ur #StayWellThisWinter pic.twitter.com/cuyP7BiYd7 \n\u2014 NHS England (@NHSEngland) November 9, 2017 \n\u201cWe can not say with certainty how tough this winter will be, but the likelihood is that services will be sorely tested. \n\u201cWe must hope the considerable efforts to curb the impact of flu are successful.\u201d \nCommenting, Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine \u2013 which represents hospital doctors who look after patients admitted as an emergency who do not need surgery \u2013 said: \u201cWhile staff on the frontline will, as always, pull out all the stops to provide safe care, the fact remains the NHS is 1,400 beds short of what it needs this winter. \n\u201cThe fear is that we have not faced an infection crisis over winter for several years and if the Australasian experience is repeated here the system will be swamped as never before. \n\u201cThere is a real sense of foreboding that this may be the winter that finally breaks the backbone of the service.\u201d \nPregnant? Flu can cause serious complications for you and your baby. Protect yourself now, with the free flu jab \n\u2014 NHS England (@NHSEngland) October 28, 2017 \nSara Gorton, head of health at the union Unison, added: \u201cThis alarming report shows the amount of strain the NHS is under even before winter pressures have kicked in. \n\u201cA lack of beds, staff shortages and the funding squeeze are all issues the Government should have addressed years ago. \n\u201cEven with the extra money announced in the Budget, it still falls well short of what the NHS needs. \n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult for the NHS to plan for a crisis when it is already running at capacity and staff are stretched all year round.\u201d \nLabour\u2019s shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: \u201cThis serious warning from NHS Providers illustrates just how appalling this winter could be for patients. \n\u201cSerious questions remain around unsafe bed occupancy levels and the additional pressures a major flu outbreak would present on already overstretched services. \n\u201cDespite the Government announcing extra winter funding in the Budget, it beggars belief that this money has still not been allocated to struggling Trusts. \nThe flu can

12, 2017 \n\u201cThe sad truth is that when this money does eventually arrive it will likely come far too late to be used to maximum effect.\u201d \nA Department of Health spokesman said: \u201cAs NHS Providers say themselves in this report, trusts have done all they can to prepare for extra winter pressures this year. \n\u201cThis has been supported by \u00a3435m to cope with winter, including making sure people get directed to the right service if they go to A&E, and \u00a31bn this year to help meet adult social care needs. \n\u201cThis year\u2019s winter preparation also includes an unprecedented system-wide push for all NHS workers to have the flu jab, aimed at helping protect patients in hospitals and in the community.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

Ti-X does NOT appreciably climb in resistance, with heat. This mimics the performance characteristics of a \"traditional\" Kanthal or NiCr heating element. Ti-X still contains NO Nickel, Chromium and minimal Iron content. Ti-X is tailored specifically for VV/VW and mechanical mods .\nThe X stands for \"extreme\". We recognize a market for \"cloud chasing\" and more traditional wire characteristics. Ti-X can be approached (build wise) like Kanthal A-1 or NiCr resistance wires. The total heat output is dependent on power applied, since the resistance is relatively fixed across the elements heating \"window\".\nTi-X is produced with our same attention to detail, and undergoes our multi-stage vacuum annealing process, as well as our Ultra-Sonic / Steam cleaning method. Ti-X is a VERY \"stiff/springy\" material. This aids in it's durability, and ability to hold shape over extreme heats and durations of time. We highly recommend using a \"coil jig\" to wind/form Ti-X.\nAs with our Ti-Wire (pure Titanium wires), we DO NOT recommend dry burning/firing Ti-X for extended durations of time. Ti-X is still VERY fast (compared to Kanthal A-1) and will exceed it's maximum temperature (and fail) in a prolonged \"dry fire\" situation. As with our Ti-Wire product line, Ti-X will not form any oxides or deposits (at vaping temperatures) and does not require high heat to clean (just scrub under warm water, as with our Ti-Wire).\n0.6mm Ti-X is approximately 1.8 ohms per foot, at 27 deg C.\nPLEASE NOTE Ti-X IS NOT A WIRE FOR USE WITH TEMPERATURE CONTROL OR TEMPERATURE PROTECTED DEVICES .

The report, titled \u201cVaricose Vein Treatment Market: Global Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment, 2016-2026,\u201d projects that rising prevalence of obesity will fuel the incidence rate of varicose veins in the world. Occurrence of varicose vein is medically-proven to be higher among obese people. Along with this, the demand for varicose vein treatments is also expected to grow on the account of effectiveness of the treatments, utilisation of user-friendly devices, and growing emphasis of medical practitioners on ensuring patient safety during critical treatment of varicose veins. Towards the end of 2026, the global market for varicose vein treatment will have reached value of US$ 931.4 Mn, registering a robust growth at 6.4% CAGR. \nRead Report Overview @ https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/varicose-veins-treatment-devices-market \nBacked with strong clinical evidence, endovenous laser ablation devices are more popular to treat varicose veins. However, compared to other procedures such as foam fillers, vein stripping costs, and blast with electricity, endscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is a costlier treatment alternative. Launch of cost-effective EVL devices will work as a favourable opportunity for new entrants as well as existing players in the market. Decreasing the procedure costs and enhancing the adoption of affordable devices will cumulatively boost the adoption of varicose vein treatments. \nAmong the wide variety of endovenous laser ablation devices available in the market, some of them may lead to complications such as thrombophlebitis, nerve damage, burns and deep vein thrombosis conditions. There is a potential opportunity for endovenous laser ablation device manufacturers to tap the larger market by offering competitive products that cause lesser complications. \nApropos the report, more than 40% of the market revenues will remain concentrated in North America, throughout the forecast period. By 2026-end, North America\u2019s varicose vein treatment market will have reached a value of US$ 420 Mn. US-based AngioDynamics, Inc. will be observed as a key player in the market during this period. In terms of revenue growth, the varicose vein treatment market in Asia-Pacific excluding Japan (APEJ) region is projected to be at the forefront. By exhibiting 7% CAGR, the APEJ varicose vein treatment market will witness active participation of Korean medical device manufacturer, Wontech Co., Ltd. Apart from these, Syneron Medical Ltd., Dornier MedTech GmbH, Alma Lasers Ltd., Alna-Medicalsystem GmbH, LSO Medical, Energist Ltd. and intros Medical Laser GmbH are other companies partaking in the growth of global varicose vein treatment market. \nRequest Sample Report @ https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-2538 \nThe report further reveals that hospitals and ambulatory surgical centres as end-users will account for larger share of global revenues, while specialised clinics will register fastest revenue growth at 7.2% CAGR. The report also identifies endovenous laser treatment as the dominant varicose vein treatment in the market, procuring revenues worth over US$ 500 Mn by end of 2026. \nUnattended varicose veins can cause one severe pain through swelling, ulceration, venous eczema, and lipodermatosclerosis. Treating them through appropriate measures becomes quite crucial. One may opt for non-surgical remedies such as sclerotherapy, leg elevation, or alternative invasive techniques such as endovenous laser treatments. Collectively, these therapies can be addressed as varicose vein treatments, medically-practiced in all parts of the world. The demand for such varicose vein treatments is expected to grow in the years to come. \nBuy Full Varicose Vein Treatment Market Report @ https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/checkout/2538 \nCONTACT: \nFuture Market Insights 616 Corporate Way, Suite 2-9018, Valley Cottage, NY 10989, United States T: +1-347-918-3531 F: +1-845-579-5705 Email: sales@futuremarketinsights.com \nWebsite: www.futuremarketinsights.com ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "angiodynamics, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alma lasers ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valley cottage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wontech co., ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syneron medical ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global industry analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "energist ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alna-medicalsystem gmbh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lso medical", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dornier medtech gmbh", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "asia-pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:49.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "02f864165e149727d94fded2a13d1ca9edaecf86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKzVAP6SxecijhehBVpMTW0KV2eMEH9E6Wo4MdTyY_9Emfm8gNAYZmhap6K9XzI0VZwbbDEFETV0zGLKn1VDZ7UH", "site_full": "panther6actual.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://panther6actual.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Paint-it-Pink", "title": "Chinese ZTZ-169C", "title_full": "Chinese ZTZ-169C", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "02f864165e149727d94fded2a13d1ca9edaecf86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKzVAP6SxecijhehBVpMTW0KV2eMEH9E6Wo4MdTyY_9Emfm8gNAYZmhap6K9XzI0VZwbbDEFETV0zGLKn1VDZ7UH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ashley (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Chinese ZTZ-169C", "text": "\n\nAs you can all guess, with Terror Tree now out, tanks, especially large tanks, have been on my mind.\n\nThese are old Ral Partha Demolisher tanks from the original FASA BattleTech miniatures range.  Back in the day, when I was young, I bought one, which despite my best efforts to shed stuff over the years I still have.  It's the one at the back.\n\nOver the past few years I acquired two more, which were originally bought to be turned into cybertanks for Ogre/GEV.  But I have a shed ton of Ogre cybertanks, so they've become surplus to requirements.\n\nSince then, I've been of two minds about what to do with them.  \n\nAs a BattleTech tank, it really is way too big to use, if you agree that the battlemech models are accurate 1/300th scale representations.  If on the other hand, like me, you're in the habit of using the Dark Age Mech Warrior infantry for your BattleTech games, because they look better, then these Demolishers do look the business.\n\nThey would also make a reasonable 15mm, nominal 1/100th scale tanks too.  So, decisions, decisions.\n\n\nAfter much thought, I've decided to use them as part of my ongoing Bad Dog project, as I want some tank to support my Chinese All Terrain Suits, and I've given them the designation ZTZ-169C.  I think that the Demolisher looks pretty good next to these Chinese All Terrain Suits I made.

Facebook user Israel Joe shared the story. He wrote; Yesterday 4th December, I was called to a situation that made me wept right here in the city of Warri, Nigeria. Chiamaka have been severally harassed and raped by her uncle. Last week, this little girl declined and was brutally tortured to almost stupor by this callous uncle. After much beaten, she succumb and was again raped with blood gushing out of her body. She could hardly go to school with her tattered uniform and excruciating pains from both the rape and torture she got from this animal called uncle. When she opened her body yesterday, with marks of wire all over her back, chest and stomach, and narrated her ordeal to her teacher, the school immediately called the police. The uncle was apprehended and his wife who is an elder sister to Chiamaka's mother surprisingly was ignorant of this wickedness perpetuated by her husband. I guess you can't look at her private part without a lion heart... You can't but cry. Thanks to the Nigerian police (QRS) as their investigations keeps on inspiring us and we shall pursue this case to a reasonable conclusion to ensure justice is done. We had to admit this young girl who could barely walk at the hospital yesterday. Why this rapes and sexual harassment against the girl child? Why this gender violence against this child.

In addition to the core funding and support from TechX, BP Ventures will offer a small, exclusive group of Pioneers a further \u00a3100,000 of funding each, as well as dedicated access to BP\u2019s facilities and expertise. \nWe also want to accelerate market entry to the oil and gas industry for small- and mediumsized companies from all sectors. Our Market Entry programme offers up to \u00a3500,000 funding and unrivalled access to customers to help SMEs fast track a route to market. Participants on both programmes benefit from the support of experienced business mentors, co-working space, forward-thinking business partners, rapid prototyping, test facilities, large scale field trials, and showcase events. \nWe\u2019ll help TechX companies commercialise their solutions, providing a collaborativeenvironment to help nurture their ideas and use our extensive network to make connections to investors and companies across the industry. \nThe fast and flexible online application process is now open for our first Pioneer and Market Entry programmes, which will begin in April 2018. We expect a high volume of applications and competition will be tough. The process for Pioneers will close on 7 February 2018, with places confirmed in March 2018. We welcome applications for our Market Entry programme throughout the year. \nOur Ventures programme, in partnership with Deep Science Ventures, will launch in 2018 and seeks to fill technology gaps with revolutionary companies and products. Harnessing creativity and deep science thinking, we will address future challenges in oil and gas, and the low carbon economy. \nDavid Millar, TechX director said: \n\u201cOur mission is to find new technology companies that can help unlock the full potential of our industry \u2013 helping them take their solutions to market \u2013 faster. We\u2019re offering a new generation of entrepreneurs unrivalled funding and support to accelerate innovation. \u201cWe\u2019ve put together three exciting programmes and have almost 100 experienced mentors and partner companies on-board to provide expert advice and support to the start-ups and SMEs carefully selected to take part in TechX. \n\u201cNow is the time for us to recapture the entrepreneurial spirit that created the UK oil and gas industry to identify innovative new technologies to make the oil and gas industry fit for the 21st century. I\u2019m confident TechX will play an important role.\u201d \nRt Hon Philip Hammond MP, chancellor of the Exchequer said: \u201cToday\u2019s TechX announcement is an exciting step which supports small businesses to bring their ideas to market, while addressing the unique challenges faced by the oil and gas industry. This will ensure that Aberdeen continues to lead innovative thinking about future North Sea exploration and production. \u201cAs we create an economy fit for the future, it is vital we back bright ideas and invest in new technologies, which is why the government is investing up to \u00a390m in the Oil and Gas Technology Centre to help it champion the future exploration and production of UK oil andgas\u201d. \nPaul Wheelhouse, Scottish Government Minister for Business, Innovation and Energy said: \n\u201cInnovation remains crucial to the oil and gas sector for maximising economic recovery and reducing costs, driving growth in exports and generating sales within the supply chain, and, ultimately, securing the long-term sustainability of the North Sea. That is why I am delighted to launch The Oil & Gas Technology Centre\u2019s TechX, which will see partners support the development of the next game-changing energy companies.\u201cSince its creation through the Aberdeen City Region Deal, the Centre has approvedinvestment of more than \u00a319m across 30 projects in partnership with industry, expanded its membership to more than 70, and recently opened its Innovation Hub, all of which will help address the challenges facing the oil and gas sector.\u201d \nMark Thomas, regional president, BP North Sea said: \u201cBP is delighted to support the TechX Pioneers programme, an initiative which will accelerate new ideas and ways of working. Our commitment to the North Sea is as strong as ever with our plans to target 200,000 barrels a day by 2020 in the region. \n\u201cTapping into game-changing technology will play an ever-increasing role as we seek toexplore in and produce from the more technically-challenging corners of our basin. I believe TechX can be a catalyst for change in the North Sea that will impact the industry for decades to come.\u201d \nDavid Gilmour, VP of Business Development at BP Group Technology and head of BP Ventures added: \u201cOne of BP Ventures\u2019 core principles is to identify and invest in game-changing technology companies that are accelerating cutting edge innovations across the entire energy spectrum. This collaboration with the TechX programme will allow us to uncover breakthrough thinking and innovation that can help transform the energy sector.\u201dThe Oil & Gas Technology Centre was established in October 2016 with \u00a3180 million funding as part of the Aberdeen City Region Deal. With almost 70 memberships, the Centre has approved investment of more than \u00a318m in 30 projects in partnership with industry since it launched in February 2017.Visit www.theogtc.com/TechX to get involved.

Funding has also been approved for the pro cycling Tour Series and the Great Aberdeen Run. \nEarlier this year Nuart Aberdeen festival organisers hailed the overwhelming response from members of the public to the first year of the ambitious international festival. \nArtists from around the world showcased their talents by creating eye-catching, artistic murals around the city centre which attracted large crowds over the Easter weekend. \nNuart Aberdeen was brought to the city by business organisation Aberdeen Inspired and Aberdeen City Council, and was supported by main sponsor Burness Paull LLP. \nHeld in the Norwegian city since 2001 and widely regarded as the world\u2019s leading celebration of street art, Nuart Aberdeen was the first overseas version of the festival. \nThe festival has won four awards this year, including the UK Association of Town and City Management\u2019s Innovation Award, the Visit Scotland Award for Tourism. \nIt also won the place management BID award at the 2017 National Business Improvement District (BID) Awards, and was also the signature piece Aberdeen Inspired\u2019s winning entry to secure the 2017 European BID of the Year win in July. \nAdrian Watson, chief executive of Aberdeen Inspired, said: \u201cWe are delighted to bring the Nuart Aberdeen street art festival back for a second year in 2018 to build on the success we enjoyed this year. \n\"We are very grateful to Aberdeen City Council which was bold and ambitious in supporting us and understood that the city, and the wider north-east, got a very real return for the investment. \n\"We understand the challenges to the public purse, but the Nuart Aberdeen festival seems to be one that is universally accepted as being a game changer and one we all ought to be proud of and get behind. \n\u201cWe had an overwhelmingly positive response to the festival and it was great to see so many people admiring the works since the festival in April. One of the many successes of the festival is that it has attracted visitors from other European countries as well as people from closer to home. \n\u201cNuart Aberdeen truly captured the hearts and minds of the public in the north-east and way beyond. It was seen by many as \u2018transformational\u2019, on so many different levels, and of a scale and ambition that is in keeping with where this city needs to be. \n\u201cThe festival left a legacy in the city and with its much-anticipated return in April of next year, we hope it continues to act as a stimulus in attracting many more high calibre cultural activities to Aberdeen. This has been great illustration of what we can achieve as a team and undoubtedly helps Aberdeen City Centre\u2019s transition to the next level, through our City Centre Masterplan.\u201d \nAs well as street art, there was also an extensive festival programme of activity including walking tours, talks, presentations and art workshops. \nThe festival artists also worked alongside local artists to create a lasting impression in the city centre by brightening up forgotten spaces with their work. \nMartyn Reed, director and curator of Nuart, said: \u201cQuite a few people have asked me, \u2018how are you going to top last year\u2019 and to be honest, I thought the same myself for a while afterwards. \n\u201cOur debut year showed us what an amazing sense of community exists in Aberdeen, so many people came together to create work in a real spirit of collaboration. We felt we could achieve anything and I\u2019m looking forward to coming back to the city in 2018 to keep the momentum going.\u201d \nAberdeen Inspired is the banner under which the Aberdeen BID (Business Improvement District) operates, a business-led initiative within the city centre in which levy payers within the BID zone contribute. Proceeds are used to fund projects designed to improve the business district. As a result of its on-going success, the organisation won 2017 European BID of the Year in July. \nMore information on the work of Aberdeen Inspired is available at: www.aberdeeninspired.com \n\nFor more information about the Nuart Aberdeen Festival, please visit: www.nuartaberdeen.co.uk Something to say?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nuart aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martyn reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adrian watson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nuart aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burness paull llp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk association of town", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeen city centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "policy and resources committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeen inspired", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "business improvement district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeen city council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nuart aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:51.036+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "84c49036be945ead6c0d7aba7610500117c2d4a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mv2acpv4HmI1II8OAx5.20a", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp; Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "Why do people call her an alpha bitch?", "title_full": "/co/ - Why do people call her an alpha bitch? - Comics & Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T07:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 37, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc76d3c0bda53e460d1735512cb35335492e4371", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mv2acpv4HmI1D4z0Yvt_pcS6ifVMjjDfYs-", "ord_in_thread": 33, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>97333017\n>>97333020\nFuck it dude.

Most of us have come across this rhetorical many a times. Every well-wisher has an opinion or advice to share, each different from the other of course. Why are there so may varied thoughts? \nDrinking water is the best way to stay hydrated. Keep aside the hydrating juices, liquids and other stuff. Water is the core for human beings. We cannot survive without water. What could be effect of dehydration? Well, death. While water is essential for life, too much water can also turn detrimental and fatal. \nWhat can be the best way or rather the right way to go about? Let\u2019s Find out! Water- Nectar of Life \nAll life forms require water to survive. A human body is made up of 70% water on an average. When we say human body, we denote all the parts; the cells, the glands, the organs and every other component of the human body need water for function. \nThe brain is made up of 85% water. Any fall in this equilibrium may cause the tissues of the brain to shrink. Water content in blood is 82% and lungs are 90%. \nDo you know? Just a 2% drop in the body\u2019s water supply can trigger signs of dehydration. Water is the lubricating oil for the smooth functioning of the engine that is our body. \nRight from the moment food enters the body to its final residual excretion, water is a requisite. Water acts as a lubricant in the cartilages and joints gifting us the fluidity in movement. The movement of water within our cellular systems helps to maintain proper body temperature. Water is responsible for the absorption and distribution of nutrition throughout the body. Water is essential to flush out the unwanted toxins from the body as urine, sweat and regular bowel movements. \nGoing on water fasting for a day, perhaps once a month can bring you miraculous changes in improving your health and immunity. \nNectar indeed! How much water should you drink? \nThe most widely circulated recommendation for the quantity of water intake per day is eight glasses, which approximately count to 2 liters. \nYou can see many charts and calculations to consume specific quantity of water according to your height, weight, etc. But just like any other health requisite, there can be no hard and fast rules as some people live in tropical regions, perspire more, therefore requires more water intake sports person will require more water than an office admin people involved in physical work would require more water \nIn addition, the body type aka Prakriti also counts on intake of water. If your body type is Pitta (heat) or Vata (air) or combination of any of these, you would need more water intake. Nevertheless, one can always follow a few simple do\u2019s and don\u2019ts to stay out of trouble. \nDo\u2019s Arrange a clean source of water and ensure availability at all times Always carry your water bottle \u2013 whether out for a walk or out to work Drink water in sips instead of gulps. Take water at short intervals regularly to answer thirst. Try to keep track of how much water you drink per day. \nDon\u2019ts Do not compromise with the purity of water. Do not reuse crushable bottles to drink. Do not force drinking yourself too much water when not thirsty. Do not replace water with beverages. Only water is WATER! \nSo, what is the best way to drink water? Drink water whenever you are thirsty, don\u2019t skip, don\u2019t postpone, don\u2019t go for alternatives Drink water when you feel hungry, sometimes thirst may appear as hunger Drink a glass of water in an empty stomach to energize the internal organs \nThe quantity of water you drink or your body require vary with every individual, vary within an individual during different seasons, lifestyle etc. The human body is very much resilient. The body has the ability to health on its own. However, there comes a few things to consider.

An oscillator is an indicator that is used as a counter trend showing when the market is overbought or oversold. These indicators are momentum based. The CMF is based largely on the Accumulation Distribution Line; it compares the close value with the high and the low for that same day. Generally, CMF indicator could be used as an indicator of buying and selling pressure. When CMF is above zero it is indicator of buying pressure and when it is below zero it is indicator of selling pressure. \nTaking a deeper dive into the numbers, SmartFONZ (FNZ.NZ) has a 50-day Moving Average of 2.42, the 200-day Moving Average is 2.30, and the 7-day is noted at 2.42. A popular tool among technical stock analysts is the moving average. Moving averages are considered to be lagging indicators that simply take the average price of a stock over a specific period of time. Moving averages can be very useful for identifying peaks and troughs. They may also be used to help the trader figure out proper support and resistance levels for the stock. \nValue investors may be scanning the shelves for bargain stocks. They may be looking to spot those shares that haven\u2019t been doing a whole lot and are being generally overlooked by the investing world. Value investors may be searching for stocks with lower price to earnings ratios that possess higher dividend yields. Investors looking for growth stocks may be willing to shell out a little more for a stock that has the possibility of increasing EPS at a quicker pace. Some investors may favor one category of stocks over another, but they may need to find a combination at some point. As markets tend to move in cycles, it may be necessary to align the portfolio to the category that is best positioned to make consistent gains in the future. \nTraders may be relying in part on technical stock analysis. SmartFONZ (FNZ.NZ) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -108.95. Despite the name, CCI can be used on other investment tools such as stocks. The CCI was designed to typically stay within the reading of -100 to +100. Traders may use the indicator to determine stock trends or to identify overbought/oversold conditions. A CCI reading above +100 would imply that the stock is overbought and possibly ready for a correction. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally. \nAt the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for SmartFONZ (FNZ.NZ) is 20.22. Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. The ADX is typically plotted along with two other directional movement indicator lines, the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI). Some analysts believe that the ADX is one of the best trend strength indicators available. \nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is one of multiple popular technical indicators created by J. Welles Wilder. Wilder introduced RSI in his book \u201cNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\u201d which was published in 1978. RSI measures the magnitude and velocity of directional price movements. The data is represented graphically by fluctuating between a value of 0 and 100. The indicator is computed by using the average losses and gains of a stock over a certain time period. RSI can be used to help spot overbought or oversold conditions. An RSI reading over 70 would be considered overbought, and a reading under 30 would indicate oversold conditions. A level of 50 would indicate neutral market momentum. The 14-day RSI is currently sitting at 40.02, the 7-day is at 29.60, and the 3-day is spotted at 13.20 for SmartFONZ (FNZ.NZ).
