To this end, Swiss powerhouse of ideas Rinspeed has designed an elaborate and unparalleled mobility ecosystem in its latest concept car, the \u201cSnap.\u201d\nRinspeed boss Frank M. Rinderknecht makes the hardware and software, which is bound to be outdated quickly, part of the high-wear chassis (\u201cskateboard\u201c) \u2013 and separates it from the durable passenger safety cell (\u201cpod\u201d). From now on, they both will go their separate ways \u2013 whereby the pod can even be useful when stationary: it can be anything from a variable shopping pod or a spacious camping pod to a cozy cuddling pod and even provide a breathtaking, fully connected user experience for the occupants of the passenger cabin. The sky is here the limit for the possible applications.\nThe Swiss mobility visionary uses an ingenious trick to disentangle the different lifecycles of various automotive components: The skateboard carries the durable mechanical and the fast-aging IT components. They are recycled after a few years of intensive use once they have reached the end of their design life, while the much less stressed pod is able to remain in service for much longer, before it also must be sent to recycling. This benefits the environment, because it plays a significant role in conserving natural resources.\n\nAlmost as an aside, the innovative Swiss solve a problem that many know from the navigation systems in their own vehicles: they no longer find the way, because software and map data are outdated. What is merely annoying here can quickly become a safety issue in self-driving cars in the near future.\nNo question, when it comes to the Snap, the name really says it all, because everything fits together perfectly and can be snapped together. In keeping with a tried and proven tradition, the twenty-fourth concept car from Rinspeed was again designed at Swiss company 4erC and technically executed at Esoro. An extensive study of the Snap ecosystem conducted by EY shows its (virtually) unlimited possibilities. The electric vehicle \u2013 as always when Rinderknecht is at work \u2013 is chock-full of technical and visual finesse, contributed by a reputable network of global companies. The two steering axles along with the integrated electric powertrain come from ZF. They allow the Snap to turn practically on a dime and produce no emissions in urban traffic. The Snap runs on weight-optimized and stylish 7\u00d718 Borbet alloy wheels shod with tires of size 225/35-18, which are optimized to minimize fuel consumption. By the way, all adhesive bonds in and on the Snap are realized with innovative adhesives from Sika Automotive.\nOptionally, there is even a \u2018personal assistant\u2019 in the form of an autonomous, intelligent robot to accompany the occupants. It will also be happy to help with running errands, carrying purchases, or handle other tedious tasks.\n\nThe city runabout is brimming with sensors. For example, US company Gentex is contributing the Iris scanner for occupant detection and dimmable front and rear glass elements, which can also be found on the Boeing Dreamliner. The sophisticated Lidar sensors from Ibeo in Hamburg ensure that obstacles on the road are detected by means of real-time measurement of the light reflections. The Harman Autonomous Drive Platform that is part of the skateboard makes safely moving through city traffic possible. It uses the NXP BlueBox, a sensor fusion solution. In turn, the Smart Antenna, jointly developed by NXP and Harman, ensures safe communication to the world outside as well as a high-speed connection to the Harman Ignite Cloud Platform. With 5G, Car2X, radio tuner, BT, and WiFi, it covers the entire spectrum of wireless networking possibilities. Sprint, a leading US telecommunications company, is committed to ensuring stable networks. Moreover, with highly-sensitive pod recognition and its customized Smart Access solution, the chip giant NXP offers a broad range of technologies that show promise for the future. Europe\u2019s leading business software company SAP contributes by enabling the digitized ecosystem through innovative technologies and software solutions in the areas of smart cities, connected health, connected mobility, and transportation. And TomTom provides HD maps for autonomous driving and navigation technologies that enable predictive driving for passengers\u2019 comfort. Finally, the Israeli start-up Valens\u2019s HDBaseT Automotive connectivity technology connection is responsible for the fast and secure transmission of even ultra-high-definition, high-resolution multimedia signals between the numerous vehicle components.\nAn innovative marketplace net from MHP allows custom use of the wide variety of pods and skateboards with a wide range of service providers. Also not commonplace for a concept vehicle: The transmission of data and information was independently and impartially tested and certified by Dekra, the globally operating testing and certification experts. And who supplies the electricity for all these consumers? It flows into the vehicle via the quick-charging cable with high-voltage technology from Harting based in the East Westphalian town of Espelkamp.\n\nHarman developed the \u2018True Level 5\u2019 HMI, an operating concept perfectly tailored to the needs of changing passengers in a fully autonomous vehicle. The goal of the development: maximum possible individualization paired with optimal protection of personal data. To this end, there is three-level user authentication, depending on the desired personalization. A token unlocks the vehicle and customizes the displays. Personal cloud content is available after identification by face recognition. As a result, the voice-controlled intelligent personal assistant knows the preferences and habits of each passenger and suggests, for example, a suitable restaurant for every passenger, depending on personal preferences. In addition, a third level of biometric identification is required if health data of the passenger are to be recorded and analyzed.\nEach passenger has three displays at his disposal for interaction. Personal settings are selected with the \u2018Personal Control Panel\u2019 featuring an interactive control dial. Personal contents and messages are shown on the touch-controlled \u2018Hover Tabs,\u2019 which are brought into position by swiveling arms. Two large centrally placed screens provide route information and movie enjoyment. The Lexicon surround sound system with Ambisonics Escape signal processing delivers a unique audio experience with all applications.\nThe Snap uses six projectors to communicate visually with the outside world. Two of them use the windshield and the rear glass to send full-color messages to other road users such as \u2018Right of way granted\u2019 or \u2018Caution, children.\u2019 Four laser projections on the side windows are used for communication with boarding passengers. The necessary functional interlayers for all-round glazing come from the Japanese manufacturer Sekisui.\nThere is also a host of technical innovations in the appealing exterior of the Snap, which is more reminiscent of architecture than of automotive design. For example, from German lighting specialist Osram Opto Semiconductors, which installs digital license plates as well as the entire lighting system \u2013 including interior LEDs that emit ultraviolet light to render bacteria harmless and thereby improve hygiene. The front and rear panels as well as lighting elements in the rocker panels are multifunctional and can display multimedia contents. They come from US company Techniplas, a leader in the design and manufacturing of engineered products for mobility. The safe swapping of the pods is ensured by lightweight-design supports from Swiss Company Georg Fischer.\nThe wellness features of the interior play a vital role in self-driving cars. In this area, Rinspeed has for years rightfully relied on the innovative Swabian textile developers at Str\u00e4hle+Hess, who work with Dutch company Stahl, the world market leader for leather and man-made surfaces in automotive interiors. Functionality goes hand in hand with the discriminating design standard. The occupants relax on naturally soft leather from automotive leather specialist Bader. The storage systems from Dr. Schneider Unternehmensgruppe, some of which are even portable, offer optimal storage space complete with cup holders and wireless charging system. The portable storage compartment is a truly clever solution. Also able to convince is surface specialist Benecke-Hornschuch Surface Group with its groundbreaking and partially translucent materials used on seating areas, storage facilities, floor, and as side panels. With traditional Korean Sanggam printing for seats and trim, the South Korean upholstery fabric manufacturer Kolon sets accents in the interior. Now then, time to lean back and drink some fresh tea. That is another thing the Snap designers also thought of! Mint and strawberries for homemade and healthy infusion drinks grow in urban farming containers from Kostal.\nSnap \u2013 rarely has a concept car more precisely described the problems an entire industry has with the different lifecycles of various car components \u2013 and offered up an interesting solution at the same time. Maybe something goes \u2018click\u2019 with many who will marvel at the new creation of Swiss mobility mastermind Frank M. Rinderknecht at the CES in Las Vegas and in spring of 2018 \u2013 in the backyard of the Swiss national so to speak \u2013 at the Geneva Auto Show. As always professionally staged by Saarland ad agency Vollmond.\nThe post CES 2018: Rinspeed Snap \u2013 The Sum Of Its Parts Is Greater Than The Whole appeared first on Electric Cars Report .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "valens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dekra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harting", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georg fischer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schneider unternehmensgruppe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rinderknecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rinspeed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kostal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank m. rinderknecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hess", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stahl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sekisui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hmi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tomtom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nxp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ambisonics escape", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sika automotive", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nxp bluebox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boeing dreamliner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harman ignite cloud platform", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mhp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harman autonomous drive platform", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benecke-hornschuch surface group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "techniplas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "osram opto semiconductors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "optionally", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sprint", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gentex", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ibeo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "espelkamp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saarland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "str\u00e4hle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rinspeed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "esoro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:10.068+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13f64b8abec88ddf7b25ae31874fdb97f8201f35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90J5ryLRQGLz93i16UGrqdkJgn6kMyRv3ceZhC6arQezf2_LUdCtR9sbanIHpxrR1p4T3i16SdnYcL8gFHtq.Gi51uZC.7810-", "site_full": "www.topix.net", "site": "topix.net", "site_section": "http://www.topix.net/rss/who/tom-hanks.xml", "site_categories": ["entertainment"], "section_title": "Tom Hanks News", "title": "The Post Review", "title_full": "The Post Review", "published": "2017-12-06T23:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://picproxy.topixcdn.com/pics/up-", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13f64b8abec88ddf7b25ae31874fdb97f8201f35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90J5ryLRQGLz93i16UGrqdkJgn6kMyRv3ceZhC6arQezf2_LUdCtR9sbanIHpxrR1p4T3i16SdnYcL8gFHtq.Gi51uZC.7810-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T23:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "The Post Review", "text": "Topix \u203a Tom Hanks \u203a The Post Review The Post Review Next Story Prev Story Wednesday Dec 6 Read more: ComingSoon.net \nMeryl Streep as Kay Graham Tom Hanks as Ben Bradlee Sarah Paulson as Tony Bradlee Bob Odenkirk as Ben Bagdikian Tracy Letts as Fritz Beebe Bradley Whitford as Arthur Parsons Bruce Greenwood as Robert McNamara Matthew Rhys as Daniel Ellsberg Alison Brie as Lally Graham Carrie Coon as Meg Greenfield Jesse Plemons as Roger Clark David Cross as Howard Simons Zach Woods as Anthony Essaye Pat Healy as Phil Geyelin When All the President's Men was released in 1976, Steven Spielberg was just off his wild success with Jaws and neck-deep in one of his most personal films, Close Encounters of the Third Kind .

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall.\nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation.\nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box \u2014 although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months.\nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters.\nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action.\n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\"\nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\"\nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East.\nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move.\nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\"\nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts.\n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.\nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\"\nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians.

Bookings: Open Bookings Closure: 26 January 2018 \nWe Believe in Creating Greater Freedom for You to Succeed \nWHY YOU SHOULD ATTEND Many Governments have now implemented the IFMIS system for accounting and reporting (among other financial management functions). The Integrated Financial Management System is a powerful system that effectively supports your ability to be effective in enhancing planning, budgeting, procurement, expenditure management and reporting. If you are a finance manager or head of a department with PFM responsibilities such as Budgeting, Procurement and reporting, e.t.c., you need to enhance your knowledge about how IFMIS works and learn its capabilities beyond what you already know. In the end, enhanced compliance with PFM laws and best practice will enable realisation of both transparency and accountability as well as contribute to the realisation of greater socio-economic development. \nStrengthened Public Financial Management is an essential ingredient for sustainable socio economic development and poverty reduction. Strong PFM systems also improve aid effectiveness and overall accountability for Aid and public funds. \n\nWHAT WILL BE COVERED Overview of IFMIS system, functionalities within IFMIS, Setting up the system, System maintenance, Reconciliation in IFMIS, Budgeting, Procurement, Accounting and Reporting, Security controls, PFM Act & Regulations, among other interesting topics. \nTRAINING APPROACH We engage our clients on the basis of the experiences they derive from our solutions rather than merely on the basis of the range of products we market. \nThe training will integrate lecture/case study and practical examples to deliver effective learning that will bring new value to your organization.

In order to maintain its leadership on this market, Orange Belgium decided last year to invest in new IoT technologies based on international standards. Today Orange announces the availability of Narrow Band-IoT (NB-IoT) and LTE-M technologies, so called \"Mobile IoT\", on the whole Belgian territory, reaching nationwide coverage both indoors and outdoors. \nThe NB-IoT and LTE-M technologies are Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) cellular network layers that will allow millions of everyday objects to be connected to the Internet of Things (IoT). LPWA technologies offer many advantages when connecting objects to the Internet of Things, such as extending the battery life of the connected equipment by up to 10 years thanks to low energy consumption, or drastically reducing the cost of the radio modules inside the devices that need to be connected. Smart furniture, smart parking and asset tracking for instance become possible.\nOrange turns Belgium into a Mobile IoT test lab by launching the first nationwide LPWA cellular network in Belgium \nToday Orange Belgium announces the nationwide roll-out of Mobile IoT on its network, as committed 1 year ago. \nThe Mobile IoT technologies bring a different approach to LPWA technologies. Apart from the extended battery life and the minimal cost of the radio modules, NB-IoT and LTE-M: \nalso enable full bidirectional communication between the object and the network allowing firmware software updates over the air; have the best possible mobile coverage (up to +20dB compared to 2G/4G coverage), considerably improving signal penetration inside buildings; can rely on a guaranteed connectivity abroad (roaming) on other operators' Mobile IoT networks; And they are the safest solution for IoT connectivity as it operates in licensed spectrum. Moreover, the SIM card offers secure connections thanks to LTE networks' unique capabilities in terms of authenticating and encrypting the data in transit. Gabriel Flichy, Chief Technology Officer of Orange Belgium, explains: \"The choice for Mobile IoT technologies is future-proof as it is fully consistent with the future evolution towards 5G. It will then be possible to connect objects that require very high reliability e.g. for the remote control of critical devices and automation processes. Today we are already using our Mobile IoT network together with the Flemish government for a project with connected bikes in collaboration with our partners Huawei and Sensinxs; IMEC is testing a smart plug project as part of Antwerp's City of Things program and we have teamed up with CommuniThings for smart parking solutions.We invite all application developers, system integrators and early adopters to test the advantages of Orange Mobile IoT network.\" More info on the website business.orange.be/iotstarterskit or via [email protected]   \nOverall Mobile IoT will act as the catalyst for companies to establish connections that would not have been viable with existing technologies. Consumers will see a huge variety of new products, services and applications enabled by Mobile IoT. \nAbout Orange Belgium Orange Belgium is one of the leading telecommunication operators on the Belgian market, with over 3 million customers, and in Luxembourg through its subsidiary Orange Communications Luxembourg.

Choosing things that you like and in a style that you love is going to happen without really thinking about it. One of the choices you will make is where to hold your wedding, and the location is often the biggest clue to other people as to the kind of wedding you want and person that you are. So here are some examples of wedding venues; what do they think they would say about you? Hotel Ballroom Choosing a hotel is a pretty popular choice these days as you get the added benefit of having places for people to stay. Having said that, it is one of the most upscale places to hold a wedding, alongside a manor house, country club or a specific events venue like Liberty Grand . If this is your choice, then you\u2019re likely to enjoy the finer things in life and like to get pampered regularly. You want to make a luxury impact with your venue choice, and a hotel ballroom is a pretty safe option to do so. Rustic Barn If you choose a barn for your wedding then it could be that you are someone that grew up in the country and loves to explore outdoors. You could be a city girl that just enjoys the countryside and wants quite a relaxed and rustic looking wedding . Whatever kind of girl you are, you know as a bride that a wedding in a barn can look super chic and romantic; just imagine all of those twinkling fairy lights and chopped logs! The perfect choice for a chilled out but sophisticated couple. Outdoor Wedding If you\u2019d prefer to say \u2018I do\u2019 at the top of a mountain, in the woods, a backyard or a field, then it is all about getting back to nature and keeping things simple. You have the natural background of the outdoors as your decor, so it can be a good option for a zen bride that doesn\u2019t want to get stressed. You are likely to have a bit of a retro sense of style and love all things vintage. A flower crown is going to be a must, right? The Beach Nothing says luxury and laid back like getting married on a beach, especially if you are getting married abroad on the white sands of the Caribbean, for example. You are likely to not be the girl that has been planning this all of her life and you\u2019d like to keep the guest list fairly small, just keeping it to close friends and family.

Written by Dattaraj Thaly Read Time: 2 - min Kumar Sangakkara says Virat Kohli will break one of his big batting records. \u00a9 AFP \nIndia cricket captain Virat Kohli notched up 2818 runs across all formats in international cricket in 2017 - the third-highest total ever registered in a calendar year. Former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara (2868 in 2014) and former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting (2833 in 2005) occupy the number one and two positions respectively on that list. With Kohli rested from Sri Lanka ODIs and T20Is, the 3rd Test against Dinesh Chandimal's side was his last outing of the year. Interestingly, Sangakkara, who continues to hold that record, feels the 29-year-old Indian is bound to overtake him next year and better his own record a year later. The stylish left-hander described Kohli as 'different class'. \"I don't think that will last long the way @imVkohli is batting. He will probably overtake it next year and then do it again the year after. He is a different class,\" he tweeted.

A magician, enveloped in sanctified vestments and carrying a wand inscribed with hieroglyphic figures, could by the power vested in certain words and symbols control the invisible inhabitants of the elements and of the astral world. While the elaborate ceremonial magic of antiquity was not necessarily evil, there arose from its perversion several false schools of sorcery, or  black magic . Egypt, a great center of learning and the birthplace of many arts and sciences, furnished an ideal environment for transcendental experimentation. Here the black magicians of Atlantis continued to exercise their superhuman powers until they had completely undermined and corrupted the morals of the primitive Mysteries. By establishing a sacerdotal caste they usurped the position formerly occupied by the initiates, and seized the reins of spiritual government. Thus black magic dictated the state religion and paralyzed the intellectual and spiritual activities of the individual by demanding his complete and unhesitating acquiescence in the dogma formulated by the priestcraft. The Pharaoh became a puppet in the hands of the Scarlet Council--a committee of arch-sorcerers elevated to power by the priesthood. These sorcerers then began the systematic destruction of all keys to the ancient wisdom, so that none might have access to the knowledge necessary to reach adeptship without first becoming one of their order. They mutilated the rituals of the Mysteries while professing to preserve them, so that even though the neophyte passed through the degrees he could not secure the knowledge to which he was entitled. Idolatry was introduced by encouraging the worship of the images which in the beginning the wise had erected solely as symbols for study and meditation. False interpretations were given to the emblems and figures of the Mysteries, and elaborate theologies were created to confuse the minds of their devotees. The masses, deprived of their birthright of understanding and groveling in ignorance, eventually became the abject slaves of the spiritual impostors. Superstition universally prevailed and the black magicians completely dominated national affairs, with the result that humanity still suffers from the sophistries of the priestcrafts of Atlantis and Egypt. Fully convinced that their Scriptures sanctioned it, numerous medi\u00e6val Qabbalists devoted their lives to the practice of ceremonial magic. The transcendentalism of the Qabbalists is founded upon the ancient and magical formula of King Solomon, who has long been considered by the Jews as the prince of ceremonial magicians. Among the Qabbalists of the Middle Ages were a great number of black magicians who strayed from the noble concepts of the  Sepher Yetzirah and became enmeshed in demonism and witchcraft. They sought to substitute magic mirrors, consecrated daggers, and circles spread around posts of coffin nails, for the living of that virtuous life which, without the assistance of complicated rituals or submundane creatures, unfailingly brings man to the state of true individual completion. Those who sought to control elemental spirits through ceremonial magic did so largely with the hope of securing from the invisible worlds either rare knowledge or supernatural power. The little red demon of Napoleon Bonaparte and the infamous oracular heads of de Medici are examples of the disastrous results of permitting elemental beings to dictate the course of human procedure. While the learned and godlike d\u00e6mon of Socrates seems to have been an exception, this really proves that the intellectual and moral status of the magician has much to do with the type of elemental he is capable of invoking. But even the d\u00e6mon of Socrates deserted the philosopher when the sentence of death was passed. Transcendentalism and all forms of phenomenalistic magic are but blind alleys--outgrowths of Atlantean sorcery; and those who forsake the straight path of philosophy to wander therein almost invariably fall victims to their imprudence. Man, incapable of controlling his own appetites, is not equal to the task of governing the fiery and tempestuous elemental spirits. Many a magician has lost his life as the result of opening a way whereby submundane creatures could become active participants in his affairs. When Eliphas Levi invoked the spirit of Apollonius of Tyana, what did he hope to accomplish? Is the gratification of curiosity a motive sufficient to warrant the devotion of an entire lifetime to a dangerous and unprofitable pursuit? If the living Apollonius refused to divulge his secrets to the profane, is there any probability that after death he would disclose them to the curious-minded? Levi himself did not dare to assert that the specter which appeared to him was actually the great philosopher, for Levi realized only too well the proclivity of elementals to impersonate those who have passed on. The majority of modern mediumistic apparitions are but elemental creatures masquerading through bodies composed of thought substance supplied by the very persons desiring to behold these wraiths of decarnate beings. THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF BLACK MAGIC Some understanding of the intricate theory and practice of ceremonial magic may be derived from a brief consideration of its underlying premises. First . The visible universe has an invisible counterpart, the higher planes of which are peopled by good and beautiful spirits; the lower planes, dark and foreboding, are the habitation of evil spirits and demons under the leadership of the Fallen Angel and his ten Princes. Second . By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible to contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some human undertaking. Good spirits willingly lend their assistance to any worthy enterprise, but the evil spirits serve only those who live to pervert and destroy. Third . It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the magician becomes for a stipulated time the master of an elemental being. Fourth . True black magic is performed with the aid of a demoniacal spirit, who serves the sorcerer for the length of his earthly life, with the understanding that after death the magician shall become the servant of his own demon. For this reason a black magician will go to inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing for him beyond the grave. The most dangerous form of black magic is the scientific perversion of occult power for the gratification of personal desire. Its less complex and more universal form is human selfishness, for selfishness is the fundamental cause of all worldly evil. A man will barter his eternal soul for temporal power, and down through the ages a mysterious process has been evolved which actually enables him to make this exchange. In its various branches the black art includes nearly all forms of ceremonial magic, necromancy, witchcraft, sorcery, and vampirism. Under the same general heading are also included mesmerism and hypnotism, except when used solely for medical purposes, and even then there is an element of risk for all concerned. Though the demonism of the Middle Ages seems to have disappeared, there is abundant evidence that in many forms of modern thought--especially the so-called \"prosperity\" psychology, \"willpower-building\" metaphysics, and systems of \"high-pressure\" salesmanship-- \n\nBAPHOMET, THE GOAT OF MENDES.\n  From Levi's  Transcendental Magic . The practice of magic--either  white  or  black --depends upon the ability of the adept to control the universal life force--that which Eliphas Levi calls the great magical agent or the astral light. By the manipulation of this fluidic essence the phenomena of transcendentalism are produced. The famous hermaphroditic Goat of Mendes was a composite creature formulated to symbolize this  astral light . It is identical with Baphomet the mystic pantheos of those disciples of ceremonial magic, the Templars, who probably obtained it from the Arabians. p. 102 black magic has merely passed through a metamorphosis, and although its name be changed its nature remains the same. A well-known magician of the Middle Ages was Dr. Johannes Faustus, more commonly known as Dr. Faust. By a study of magical writings he was enabled to bind to his service an elemental who served him for many years in various capacities. Strange legends are told concerning the magical powers possessed by Dr. Faust. Upon one occasion the philosopher, being apparently in a playful mood, threw his mantle over a number of eggs in a market-woman's basket, causing them to hatch instantly. At another time, having fallen overboard from a small boat, he was picked up and returned to the craft with his clothes still dry. But, like nearly all other magicians, Dr. Faust came at length to disaster; he was found one morning with a knife in his back, and it was commonly believed that his familiar spirit had murdered him. Although Goethe's Dr. Faust is generally regarded as merely a fictional character, this old magician actually lived during the sixteenth century. Dr. Faust wrote a book describing his experiences with spirits, a section of which is reprinted below. (Dr. Faust must not be confused with Johann Fust, the printer.) EXTRACT FROM THE BOOK OF DR. FAUST, WITTENBERG, 1524 (An abridged translation from the original German of a book ordered destroyed.) \"From my youth I followed art and science and was tireless in my reading of books. Among those which came to my hand was a volume containing all kinds of invocations and magical formul\u00e6. In this book I discovered information to the effect that a spirit, whether he be of the fire, the water, the earth or the air, can be compelled to do the will of a magician capable of controlling him. I also discovered that according as one spirit has more power than another, each is adapted for a different operation and each is capable of producing certain supernatural effects. \"After reading this wonderful book, I made several experiments, desiring to rest the accuracy of the statements made therein. At first I had little faith that what was promised would take place. But at the very first invocation which I attempted a mighty spirit manifested to me, desiring to know why I had invoked him. His coming so amazed me that I scarcely knew what to say, but finally asked him if he would serve me in my magical investigations. He replied that if certain conditions were agreed upon he would. The conditions were that I should make a pact with him. This I did not desire to do, but as in my ignorance I had not protected myself with a circle and was actually at the mercy of the spirit, I did not dare to refuse his request and resigned myself to the inevitable, considering it wisest to turn my mantle according to the wind. \"I then told him that if he would be serviceable to me according to my desires and needs for a certain length of time, I would sign myself over to him. After the pact had been arranged, this mighty spirit, whose name was  Asteroth , introduced me to another spirit by the name of  Marbuel , who was appointed to be my servant. I questioned  Marbuel  as to his suitability for my needs. I asked him how quick he was, and he answered, 'As swift as the winds.' This did not satisfy me, so I replied, 'You cannot become my servant. Go again whence you have come.' Soon another spirit manifested itself, whose name was  Aniguel . Upon asking him the same question he answered that he was swift as a bird in the air. I said, 'You are still too slow for me. Go whence you came.' In the same moment another spirit by the name of  Aciel  manifested himself. For the third time I asked my question and he answered, 'I am as swift as human thought.' 'You shall serve me,' I replied. This spirit was faithful for a long time, but to tell you how he served me is not possible in a document of this length and I will here only indicate how spirits are to be invoked and how the circles for protection are to be prepared. There are many kinds of spirits which will permit themselves to be invoked by man and become his servant. Of these I will list a few: \" Aciel : The mightiest among those who serve men. He manifests in pleasing human form about three feet high. He must be invoked three times before he will come forth into the circle prepared for him. He will furnish riches and will instantly fetch things from a great distance, according to the will of the magician. He is as swift as human thought. \" Aniguel : Serviceable and most useful, and comes in the form of a ten-year-old boy. He must be invoked three times. His special power is to discover treasures and minerals hidden in the ground, which he will furnish to the magician. \" Marbuel : A true lord of the mountains and swift as a bird on the wing. He is an opposing and troublesome spirit, hard to control. You must invoke him four times. He appears in the person of Mars [a warrior in heavy armor]. He will furnish the magician those things which grow above and under the earth. He is particularly the lord of the  spring-root . [The  spring-root  is a mysterious herb, possibly of a reddish color, which medi\u00e6val magicians asserted had the property of drawing forth or opening anything it touched. If placed against a locked door, it would open the door. The Hermetists believed that the red-capped woodpecker was specially endowed with the faculty of discovering  spring-root , so they followed this bird to its nest, and then stopped up the hole in the tree where its young were. The red-crested woodpecker went at once in quest of the spring-root, and, discovering it, brought it to the tree. It immediately drew forth the stopper from the entrance to the nest. The magician then secured the root from the bird. It was also asserted that because of its structure, the etheric body of the  spring-root  was utilized as a vehicle of expression by certain elemental spirits which manifested through the proclivity of drawing out or opening things.] \" Aciebel : A mighty ruler of the sea, controlling things both upon and under the water. He furnishes things lost or sunk in rivers, lakes, and oceans, such as sunken ships and treasures. The more sharply you invoke him, the swifter he is upon his errands. \" Machiel : Comes in the form of a beautiful maiden and by her aid the magician is raised to honor and dignity. She makes those she serves worthy and noble, gracious and kindly, and assists in all matters of litigation and justice. She will not come unless invoked twice. \" Baruel : The master of all arts. He manifests as a master workman and comes wearing an apron. He can teach a magician more in a moment than all the master workmen of the world combined could accomplish in twenty years. He must be invoked three times. \"These are the spirits most serviceable to man, but there are numerous others which, for lack of space, I am unable to describe. Now, if you desire the aid of the spirit to get this or that, then you must first draw the sign of the spirit whom you desire to invoke. The drawing must be made just in front of a circle made before sunrise, in which you and your assistants will stand. If you desire financial assistance, then you must invoke the spirit  Aciel . Draw his sign in front of the circle. If you need other things, then draw the sign of the spirit capable of furnishing them. On the place where you intend to make the circle, you must first draw a great cross with a large sword with which no one ever has been hurt. Then you must make three concentric circles. The innermost circle is made of a \n\nA MAGICAL SWORD.\n  From Levi's  The Magical Ritual . Eliphas Levi describes the preparation of a magical sword in substance as follows: The steel blade should be forged in the hour of Mars, with new tools. The pommel should be of hollow silver containing quicksilver, and the symbols of Mercury and the moon and the signatures of Gabriel and Samael should be engraved upon it. The hilt should be encased with tin, with the symbol of Jupiter and the signature of Michael engraved upon it. A copper triangle should extend from the hilt along the blade a short distance on each side: these should bear the symbols of Mercury and Venus. Five Sephiroth should be engraved upon the handle, as shown. The blade itself should have the word  Malchut  upon one side and  Quis ut Deus upon the other. The sword should be consecrated on Sunday. \n\nA MAGIC CIRCLE.\n  From  The Complete Book of Magic Science  (unpublished). The above figure is a complete and faithful representation of a magic circle as designed by medi\u00e6val conjurers for the invocation of spirits. The magician accompanied by his assistant takes his place at the point formed by the crossing of the central lines marked  MAGISTER . The words about the circle are the names of the invisible intelligences, and the small crosses mark points at which certain prayers and invocations are recited. The small circle outside is prepared for the spirit to be invoked, and while in use has the signature of the desired intelligence traced within the triangle. p. 103 long narrow strip of virgin parchment and must be hung upon twelve crosses made of the wood of  cross-thorn . Upon the parchment you must write the names and symbols according to the figure which follows. Outside this first circle make the second as follows: \"First secure a thread of red silk that has been spun or twisted to the left instead of the right. Then place in the ground twelve crosses made of laurel leaves, and also prepare a long strip of new white paper. Write with an unused pen the characters and symbols as seen on the second circle. Wind this latter strip of paper around with the red silken thread and pin them upon the twelve crosses of laurel leaves. Outside this second circle make a third one which is also of virgin parchment and pinned upon twelve crosses of consecrated palm. When you have made these three circles, retire into them until at last you stand in the center upon a pentagram drawn in the midst of the great cross first drawn. Now, to insure success, do everything according to the description, and when you have read off the sacred invocation pronounce the name of the spirit which you desire to appear. It is essential that you pronounce the name very distinctly. You must also note the day and the hour, for each spirit can only be invoked at certain times.\" While the black magician at the time of signing his pact with the elemental demon maybe fully convinced that he is strong enough to control indefinitely the powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily undeceived. Before many years elapse he must turn all his energies to the problem of self-preservation. A world of horrors to which he has attuned himself by his own covetousness looms nearer every day, until he exists upon the edge of a seething maelstrom, expecting momentarily to be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid to die--because he will become the servant of his own demon--the magician commits crime after crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence. Realizing that life is maintained by the aid of a mysterious universal life force which is the common property of all creatures, the black magician often becomes an occult vampire, stealing this energy from others. According to medi\u00e6val superstition, black magicians turned themselves into werewolves and roamed the earth at night, attacking defenseless victims for the life force contained in their blood. MODUS OPERANDI FOR THE INVOCATION OF SPIRITS The following condensed extract from an ancient manuscript is reproduced herewith as representative of the ritualism of ceremonial magic. The extract is from  The Complete Book of Magic Science , an unpublished manuscript (original in the British Museum), with pentacles in colors, mentioned by Francis Barrett in his  Magus . \" Opening Prayer \"Omnipotent and Eternal God who hath ordained the whole creation for thy praise and glory and for the salvation of man, I earnestly beseech thee that thou wouldst send one of thy spirits of the order of Jupiter, one of the messengers of  Zadkiel  whom thou hast appointed governor of thy firmament at the present time, most faithfully, willingly, and readily to show me these things which I shall ask, command or require of him, and truly execute my desires. Nevertheless, O Most Holy God, thy will and not mine be done through JC, thine only begotten Son our Lord. Amen. \" The Invocation . [The magician, having properly consecrated his vestments and utensils and being protected by his circle, now calls upon the spirits to appear and accede to his demands.] \"Spirits, whose assistance I require, behold the sign and the very Hallowed Names of God full of power.

[Having summoned the spirit unto his presence, the magician shall question him as follows:] \"'Comest thou in peace in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost?' [And the spirit shall answer:] 'Yes.' \"'Thou art welcome, noble Spirit. What is thy Name?' [And the spirit shall answer:] ' Pabiel .' \"'I have called thee in the Name of Jesu of Nazareth at whose Name every knee doth bow in heaven, earth, and hell, and every tongue shall confess there is no name like unto the Name of Jesus, who hath given power unto man to bind and to loose all things in his most Holy Name, yea even unto those that trust in his salvation. \"'Art thou the messenger of Zadkiel?' [And the spirit shall answer:] 'Yes.' \"'Wilt thou confirm thyself unto me at this time and henceforth reveal all things unto me that I shall desire to know, and teach me how I may increase in wisdom and knowledge and show unto me all the secrets of the Magic Art, and of all liberal sciences, that I may thereby set forth the glory of Almighty God?' [And the spirit shall answer:] 'Yes.' \"'Then I pray thee give and confirm thy character unto me whereby I may call thee at all times, and also swear unto me this oath and I will religiously keep my vow and covenant unto Almighty God and will courteously receive thee at all times where thou dost appear unto me.' \" License to Depart . \"'Forasmuch as thou comest in peace and quietness and hath answered \n\nTHE PENTAGRAM.\n  From Levi's  Transcendental Magic . THE PENTAGRAM. The pentagram is the figure of the microcosm--the magical formula of man. It is the one rising out of the four--the human soul rising from the bondage of the animal nature. It is the true light--the \"Star of the morning.\" It marks the location of five mysterious centers of force, the awakening of which is the supreme secret of white magic. \nFORM OF PACT WITH THE SPIRIT OF JUPITER.\n  From  The Complete Book of Magic Science . The aforesaid Bond of spirits, together with the seal and character of the planetary angel, must be written m virgin Parchment and laid before the Spirit [for signature] when he appears; at that time the invocant must not lost confidence but be patient, firm, bold, and Persevering, and take care that he asks nor requires nothing of the Spirit but with a view to the glory of God and the well-being fellow creatures. Having obtained his desires of the Spirit, the invocant may license him to depart.\" p. 104 unto my petitions, I give humble and hearty thanks unto Almighty God in whose Name I called and thou camest, and now thou mayest depart in peace unto thine orders and return unto me again at what time soever I shall call thee by thine oath, or by thy name or by thine order, or by thine office which is granted thee from the Creator, and the power of God be with me and thee and upon the whole issue of God, Amen. \"'Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.' [Note.] \"It would be advisable for the invocant to remain in the circle for a few minutes after reciting the license, and if the place of operation be in the open air, let him destroy all traces of the circle, etcetera, and return quietly to his home. But should the operation be performed in a retired part of a house, cc cetera, the circle may remain, as it might serve in alike future operation, but the room or building must be locked up to avoid the intrusion of strangers.\" The agreement set forth above is purely ceremonial magic. In the case of black magic, it is the magician and not the demon who must sign the pact. When the black magician binds an elemental to his service, a battle of wits ensues, which the demon eventually wins. With his own blood the magician signs the pact between himself and the demon, for in the arcanum of magic it is declared that \"he controls the soul who controls the blood of another.\" As long as the magician does not fail, the elemental will fulfil to the letter his obligation under the pact, but the demon will try in every possible way to prevent the magician from carrying out his part of the contract. When the conjurer, ensconced within his circle, has evoked the spirit he desires to control and has made known his intention, the spirit will answer somewhat as follows: \"I cannot accede to your request nor fulfil it, unless after fifty years you give yourself to me, body and soul, to do with as I may please.\" If the magician refuses, other terms will be discussed. The spirit may say: \"I will remain in your service as long as on every Friday morning you will go forth upon the public street giving alms in the name of Lucifer. The first time you fail in this you belong to me.\" If the magician still refuses, realizing that the demon will make it impossible for him to fulfil his contract, other terms will be discussed, until at last a pact is agreed upon. It may read as follows: \"I hereby promise the Great Spirit Lucifuge, Prince of Demons, that each year I will bring unto him a human soul to do with as it may please him, and in return Lucifuge promises to bestow upon me the treasures of the earth and fulfil my every desire for the length of my natural life. If I fail to bring him each year the offering specified above, then my own soul shall be forfeit to him. Signed . . . . . . . . . . . . . \" [Invocant signs pact with his own blood.] THE PENTAGRAM In symbolism, an inverted figure always signifies a perverted power. The average person does not even suspect the occult properties of emblematic pentacles. On this subject the great Paracelsus has written: \"No doubt many will scoff at the seals, their characters and their uses, which are described in these books, because it seems incredible to them that metals and characters which are dead should have any power and effect. Yet no one has ever proved that the metals and also the characters as we know them are dead, for the salts, sulphur, and quintessences of metals are the highest preservatives of human life and are far superior to all other simples.\" (Translated from the original German.) The black magician cannot use the symbols of white magic without bringing down upon himself the forces of white magic, which would be fatal to his schemes. He must therefore distort the hierograms so that they typify the occult fact that he himself is distorting the principles for which the symbols stand. Black magic is not a fundamental art; it is the misuse of an art. Therefore it has no symbols of its own. It merely takes the emblematic figures of white magic, and by inverting and reversing them signifies that it is left-handed. A good instance of this practice is found in the pentagram, or five-pointed star, made of five connected lines. This figure is the time-honored symbol of the magical arts, and signifies the five properties of the Great Magical Agent, the five senses of man, the five elements of nature, the five extremities of the human body. By means of the pentagram within his own soul, man not only may master and govern all creatures inferior to himself, but may demand consideration at the hands of those superior to himself. The pentagram is used extensively in black magic, but when so used its form always differs in one of three ways: The star may be broken at one point by not permitting the converging lines to touch; it may be inverted by having one point down and two up; or it may be distorted by having the points of varying lengths. When used in black magic, the pentagram is called the \"sign of the cloven hoof,\" or the footprint of the Devil. The star with two points upward is also called the \"Goat of Mendes,\" because the inverted star is the same shape as a goat's head. When the upright star turns and the upper point falls to the bottom, it signifies the fall of the Morning Star. \n\nTHE PENTACLES OF THE SEVEN PLANETS AND THE SEALS AND CHARACTERS OF THE PLANETARY ANGELS.\n  From a medi\u00e6val  Book of Spirits  (unpublished).

Al Franken announces his upcoming resignation from the Senate.\nMedia: FedNet/Getty Images WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Sen. Al Franken, a rising political star only weeks ago, reluctantly announced Thursday he's resigning from Congress, succumbing to a torrent of sexual harassment allegations and evaporating support from fellow Democrats. But he fired a defiant parting shot at President Donald Trump and other Republicans he said have survived much worse accusations.\n\"I of all people am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office, and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party,\" Franken said.\nThe 66-year-old Minnesotan, a former \"Saturday Night Live\" comedian who made a successful leap to liberal U.S. senator, announced his decision in a subdued Senate chamber three weeks after the first accusations of sexual misconduct emerged but just a day after most of his Democratic colleagues proclaimed he had to go. His remarks underscored the bitterness many in the party feel toward a GOP that they say has made a political calculation to tolerate Trump and Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore, who've both been accused of sexual assaults that they've denied.\nIn largely unapologetic remarks that lasted 11 minutes, Franken said \"all women deserve to be heard\" but asserted that some accusations against him were untrue. He called himself \"a champion of women\" during his Senate career who fought to improve people's lives.\n\"Even on the worst day of my political life, I feel like it's all been worth it,\" he said.\nFranken's departure, which he said would occur in \"coming weeks,\" made him the latest figure from politics, journalism and the arts to be toppled since October. That's when the first articles appeared revealing sexual abuse allegations against Hollywood titan Harvey Weinstein and energizing the #MeToo movement in which women have named men they say abused or harassed them.\nPhoto: AP Image 1 of / 45 Caption\nClose\nImage 1 of 45 In this image from video from Senate Television, Sen.

Mark Dayton will name a temporary successor, who will serve until a special election next November.\nNow Playing: Franken's comments appended a melancholy coda to the political career of the one-time TV funnyman who became one of his party's most popular and bellicose liberals.\nJust two days earlier, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., a civil rights hero who'd been the House's longest-serving current member, resigned after facing sexual harassment allegations of his own. The two departures underscored the party's determination to show no tolerance for such behavior, a strategy that can bring stunningly fast conclusions to political careers but that party leaders believe could give them high moral ground on a subject that's shown no sign of fading.\nLater Thursday, Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., resigned as well, effective Jan. 3, after admitting he had asked two female staff aides about becoming a surrogate mother. The House Ethics Committee late Thursday also opened an investigation into Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, for allegations he sexually harassed a former staff aide and retaliated against her for complaining of discrimination.\nOn a 2005 audio tape released shortly before last year's presidential election, Trump is heard talking about grabbing women, and several women accused him of sexual assaults. Women in Alabama have accused Moore of unwanted sexual contact and pursuing romantic relationships when they were teenagers and he was in his thirties during the 1970s.\nAsked about Franken's comment about him on Thursday, Trump merely replied, \"I didn't hear it, sorry.\"\nAt least eight women had accused Franken of inappropriate sexual behavior. Until this week, he'd said he'd remain in the Senate and cooperate with an investigation into his behavior.\nThe breaking point came Wednesday, when a former Democratic congressional aide said he forcibly tried to kiss her in 2006, an accusation he denied. Hours later, another woman said he'd inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009.\nThe accusations started last month when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. She also released a photo of him with his hands at her breasts as she napped aboard a military plane.\nOn Thursday, Franken walked to the Senate chamber shortly before noon, hand-in-hand with his wife of 35 years, Franni. As he spoke, members of his family watched from the visitors' gallery, some sobbing. Franken said that thanks to them, \"I'm going to be just fine.\"\nAlmost two-dozen colleagues listened silently at their desks, some dabbing their eyes. Those watching were nearly all Democrats and many were women, including New Yorker Kirsten Gillibrand, who released the first of what became a flood of public statements Wednesday calling for Franken's resignation. Also present was Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, who one Democrat said had spent much of Wednesday persuading his friend to leave.\nAfter Franken spoke, many of his colleagues lined up to hug him.\nHe said he was leaving because he couldn't handle an ethics panel investigation while representing his state effectively. He said he'd remain an activist: \"I may be resigning my seat, but I am not giving up my voice.\"\nRelated Stories The Latest: Franken steps down, takes shot at Trump A star on \"Saturday Night Live,\" the Harvard-educated Franken was elected to the Senate in 2008 by 312 votes. In Washington, he distanced himself from his comedic background, largely avoided national reporters and burrowed into consumer issues. He found his voice as a sharp critic of Trump administration officials and has been listed as a potential 2020 presidential contender.\nHis announcement prompted immediate maneuvering for his seat.\nAmong the possibilities for Minnesota Gov. Dayton's temporary appointment is Lt. Gov. Tina Smith, a trusted Dayton ally. The winner of a special election in November 2018 would serve through the end of Franken's term in January 2021.\nMidterm elections are often difficult for the party that holds the White House, and Trump is deeply unpopular. But Hillary Clinton defeated Trump by just 1.5 points in the state, preserving a four-decade run for the Democrats in presidential elections.\n___\nAP reporters Mary Clare Jalonick, Matthew Daly, Kevin Freking and Andrew Taylor in Washington and Kyle Potter in Minnesota contributed.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cheri bustos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "franken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kirsten gillibrand", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "leeann tweeden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lindsey graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "politico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruben kihuen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buzzfeed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacquelyn martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex brandon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elise stefanik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay reeves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john conyers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew harnik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy klobuchar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gretchen carlson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patty murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juliet linderman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap image", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota state fair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap franken", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "d-n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-mich.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-ill.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-minn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-nev.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:12.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "88733bc19ccc24d9648103499b2e26c6b0a4f1c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOonbalC6sZxtTU32oQ8xNAn_mNDxo_ISjJwqmHPDq0tb2wZGhFcYblfeWGRGWk_CdMs5CSnNeF3epCw1PuJRNXT", "site_full": "sparkleandslippers.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://sparkleandslippers.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Sparkle and Slippers", "title": "Embellished Booties", "title_full": "Embellished Booties", "published": "2017-12-05T13:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "966d47568ff4694d5ceb1f086311d6b1969c2c18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOonbalC6sZxtTU32oQ8xNAn_mNDxo_ISjJwqmHPDq0tb2wZGhFcYblfeWGRGWk_CdMs5CSnNeF3erlzNx7XofcfyzwVnn7acDs-", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "Len Parent", "published": "2017-12-07T04:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "This is absolutely amazing!

Founded in 1985 with headquarters in Lyon, France, the multi-award-winning company now has 300,000 users of its services. With legacy on-premise contact center technology that failed to integrate with its CRM software, Esker found that call handling time was far longer than it needed to be, and knew it needed to improve the experience of its customers who call for technical support. \nEsker adopted NewVoiceMedia\u2019s cloud contact center solution ContactWorld for Service to replace its old system. With seamless CRM integration, the technology intelligently routes incoming calls to the most appropriate advisor and delivers immediate access to a caller\u2019s information and call history, enabling them to provide a personalized customer service experience. Additionally, the sophisticated call recording system allows Esker to better evaluate call handling, providing valuable and actionable insights into customer experience and satisfaction. Supervisors can also monitor calls in real time, better assess their employees\u2019 workload, and easily change call plans so that the team is allocated optimally to meet customer demand. \nSince implementation, Esker has increased efficiencies, is offering a better customer service experience and has access to data to drive successful decision making. Furthermore: \nThe company has been able to handle more than 3,000 inbound and 2,500 outbound calls each year Average call-handling time is down by 25 percent Customer satisfaction has increased to 96 percent Number of missed calls has reduced to virtually zero \u201cUsing ContactWorld is even better than we expected,\u201d commented Mathieu Labaune, technical trainer at Esker. \u201cIt\u2019s great in terms of the look and feel of the solution, and its functionality, including seamless integration with our CRM platform, is highly valuable to us. Agents now receive whispers through their headsets alerting them to the customers\u2019 language and their details pop-up on their screen, meaning they have detailed insights which can help them provide a completely personalized service. Additionally, real-time reporting enables us to track patterns over time and drive further efficiencies.\u201d \nDennis Fois, president and COO of NewVoiceMedia, said, \u201cWe\u2019re delighted that Esker has experienced such incredible success with ContactWorld; from savings in average call handling time, to improved visibility of all agents and 96 percent customer satisfaction. Our true cloud delivery also means that Esker can re-direct customer calls to mobile phones as a contingency or operate hot-desk working practices if required.\u201d \nFor further information about NewVoiceMedia and to download the case study, visit www.newvoicemedia.com \n- ENDS \u2013 \nAbout NewVoiceMedia \nNewVoiceMedia \u2019s cloud contact center and inside sales platform delivers more successful conversations. \nThe leading vendor's award-winning customer contact platform helps organizations worldwide build a more personal relationship with every customer or prospect.

Apologies for the lack of blogs recently, it\u2019s not only been a busy few weeks in the news but I also had my first masters\u2019 assignment due so I have been focusing on that. However, I am pleased to say that it\u2019s done, submitted and I\u2019m pleased with the provisional mark of a distinction.\nSo where should I start with the mess that the political world seems to be in at the moment; well first of all we have the budget \u2013 which to summarise is no way near radical enough. I\u2019m fast coming to the conclusion that we need radical solutions to our problems and while I have been a supporter of the Liberal Democrats I don\u2019t know if their middle ground solution is radical enough. We need to rethink how our whole economy is structured \u2013 to start making it work for all us, why are still clinging onto this lie that capitalism is a fair ideology in which to shape our world. The budget offered no solutions and just promised more austerity and token gestures to those truly struggling \u2013 at the same time the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) downgraded its growth forecasts and predicted that the UK would have the worst standard of living since the end of the Second World War. And Brexit hasn\u2019t even happened yet!\nTalking of Brexit, this week has shown how shambolic not only the process is but how depressingly useless May\u2019s government is. Talks fell apart after the DUP refused to agree to terms which would have seen Northern Ireland remain in a customs union with the Republic of Ireland; therefore maintaining a border-less Ireland and keeping the arrangements of the Good Friday Agreement. Instead the DUP (due to their marriage with the Tories) have been able to throw not only, the already disastrous, Brexit negotiations into further chaos but have also potentially shaken the fragile peace that the Good Friday Agreement secured. And today it was revealed that the Government have not conducted impact assessments for Brexit and the consequences it will have on the UK \u2013 when will enough be enough and as a country we are humble enough to admit this was huge mistake and withdraw from Brexit and remain in the EU? Hopefully it\u2019s not too late\u2026. \nInternationally the state of affairs is not much better \u2013 Trump with his travel ban, re-tweeting of Britain First Islamophobic videos and now his declaration of recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, further demonstrates that he is determined to engage in provocative actions against Muslims both at home and overseas. This alongside his policy towards North Korea, and questionable relationship with Russia is destabilising an already fragile international situation. So where do we go from here? \nAs Christians it would be all too easy to say \u2018we\u2019re not of this world\u2019 or \u2018I just wish Jesus would come back and fix everything\u2019, however, we are instructed to build his Kingdom now and here on the earth as it is. We are of this world, and responsible for it. We need to take action to build his Kingdom here and now; and it doesn\u2019t have to be via grand gestures it can be as simply as challenging the status quo in your everyday life.

My suggestion would be to start working out and cleaning up your diet and see where that leads you (regardless of where the scale measures). 0", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:13.051+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3809f44f58abb476114366b64cf3454d0b881c50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHME_02n3Qs439BujEutahr_6td0_NxFodU45cJgI82dbpbjjtJWYEF22dAD8wz..iTtslW5.lGUAWogXnPxM2CF9uqyMmcUjP9ixfgosXBxHbAtoTyxqGeE08GmzXikBtpQzqCGsISFHQRCd6JgHMBric9sFPm8oJfUTwzC82lvWWEXQzMDGI3Fw-", "site_full": "www.ebay.co.uk", "site": "ebay.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.ebay.co.uk/b/Fishing-Reels/179950/bn_2315805", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Fishing Reels | eBay", "title": "Lineaeffe-JD-500-Multiplier-Boat-Sea-Fishing-With-50lb-Line-Preloaded", "title_full": "Reviews: Lineaeffe-JD-500-Multiplier-Boat-Sea-Fishing-Reel-With-50lb-Line-Preloaded | eBay", "published": "2016-11-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.014, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b18da3eff20d08cb47a7ea3b728aa743e490a8d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHME_02n3Qs439BujEutahr_6td0_NxFodU45cJgI82dbpbjjtJWYEF22dAD8wz..iTtslW5.lGUAWogXnPxM2CF9uqyMmcUjP9ixfgosXBxHbAtoTyxqGeE08GmzXikBtpQzqCGsISFHQRCd6JgHMBric9sFPm8oJfUTwzC82lvWWtpuOiPv7KzsnVZHxF1hQphwsv01XunFreAEo0bYMLv8-", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "wcargill-uk", "published": "2017-11-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "fishing reel", "text": "a good bit of kit works well I have had no problems whatsoever with this purchase.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:14.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d6db2ee9e8de042e0e8a7bb49e66865dd0190acb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHhdzglx.ii.lxmLAbWhpn1xjpgOvgrIT5", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "http://finance.dailyherald.com/dailyherald/action/rssfeed?ChannelID=6958", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "Get News", "title": "Meet MIKE: The Audio Solution Changing How People Create and Hear Sound", "title_full": "Meet MIKE: The Audio Solution Changing How People Create and Hear Sound", "published": "2017-12-07T10:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d6db2ee9e8de042e0e8a7bb49e66865dd0190acb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHhdzglx.ii.lxmLAbWhpn1xjpgOvgrIT5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "Meet MIKE: The Audio Solution Changing How People Create and Hear Sound", "text": "  03:42 AM EST Meet MIKE: The Audio Solution Changing How People Create and Hear Sound \nThough technology continues to leap forward, one industry struggles to maintain its innovative edge is the audio technology industry. Headsets, speakers, and earphones continue to get louder and more immersive but are they more experiential? Over the past five years wires have been removed and design has become more attractive but experience has yet to advance; until one company came to rescue. \nSabinetek as a official partner with Qualcomm, has multiple patents and already delivered successful acoustic solutions to many industry giants in China. Next month, Sabinetek will exhibit at CES 2018 as Innovation Awards Honoree to release its brand new product MIKE. \nMIKE, a new portable microphone, is changing the way we produce and record sound. Unlike traditional microphones which transfer file after the recording, MIKE can transfer data with mobile phone in real-time. This function makes all the difference among the microphone category because functions are not experience. Functions such as stereo sound quality, long distant recording, powerful editing APP, and noise suppression technology are needed together and at the same time. Real-time transmission technology enriches MIKE to replace the mic on mobile phone to make that experience happens. \nThe product comes with an accessory that makes it easily attachable to the musical instrument that the user plays with; another accessory, a hand band, allows the user to wear it while playing certain instruments when needed to (for instance: saxophone, violin), to catch the closest source of the sound. \nWhether a musician, a speaker, educator, reporter, or everyday person MIKE can be used to create a better experience. Music and composers can compose to record demos whenever they feel inspired using the high-quality recording and immediate app sharing function will dramatically improve their production process. Presenters, reporters, and educators can experience the freedom of hands free recordings in real time, taking their listeners even closer to sound. The average Joe can easily record moments and laughs experienced while traveling and throughout life; creating a track record of the amazing memories that shape our life. \nWith the product\u2019s function being fully recognized, the product will likely bring about a revolution to the listening experiences of serious-music-lovers or sound-quality-cravers, and many more. \nCheck our Indiegogo page: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mike-1st-bluetooth-stereo-recorder-for-smartphone-audio/x/16514238#/ \nMedia Contact Company Name: Beijing Sabine Technologies Ltd Contact Person: Media Relations", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sabinetek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "app", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qualcomm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing sabine technologies ltd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:14.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "84e6484e686d996e8ba70f7e62ce8bd8f1f634ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vCLDx9iTsV_JLDjIlFT6Dd3UUF2WmhnJOXwtT1YMmhiM3UFtTJsr4c2Gq.n0H2RDBRVvLYXq.C9urV8Ax1sYEH.cLhGDHHnvW9Wf8c2Ex8OyreMCyOsAocBWrVHosYlA-", "site_full": "www.sfgate.com", "site": "sfgate.com", "site_section": "http://sfgate.com//rss/feed/Politics-RSS-Feed-436.php", "site_categories": ["media", "social"], "section_title": "Politics RSS Feed", "title": "Congress seems set to avert weekend government shutdown", "title_full": "Congress seems set to avert weekend government shutdown - SFGate", "published": "2017-12-07T08:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/71/25/14652786/9/rawImage.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 943, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5, "comments": 0, "shares": 5}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "84e6484e686d996e8ba70f7e62ce8bd8f1f634ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vCLDx9iTsV_JLDjIlFT6Dd3UUF2WmhnJOXwtT1YMmhiM3UFtTJsr4c2Gq.n0H2RDBRVvLYXq.C9urV8Ax1sYEH.cLhGDHHnvW9Wf8c2Ex8OyreMCyOsAocBWrVHosYlA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sfgate.com", "published": "2017-12-07T08:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Congress seems set to avert weekend government shutdown", "text": "Now Playing: The House and Senate pass a stopgap spending bill to prevent a government shutdown this weekend and buy time for challenging talks on a wide range of unfinished business on Capitol Hill. (Dec. 7)\nMedia: Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Congress on Thursday passed a stopgap spending bill to prevent a government shutdown this weekend and buy time for challenging talks on a wide range of unfinished business on Capitol Hill. The shutdown reprieve came as all sides issued optimistic takes on an afternoon White House meeting between top congressional leaders and President Donald Trump.\nThe measure passed the House 235-193, mostly along party lines, and breezed through the Senate on a sweeping 81-14 tally barely an hour later. It would keep the government running through Dec. 22, when another, and more difficult, shutdown problem awaits.\nThe bill now heads to Trump for his signature.\nTopics at the White House session included relief from a budget freeze on the Pentagon and domestic agencies, extending a key children's health program and aid to hurricane-slammed Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida. The trickiest topic, and a top priority for Democrats, involves protections for immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.\nThese \"Dreamer\" immigrants are viewed sympathetically by the public and most lawmakers but face deportation in a few months because Trump reversed administrative protections provided to them by former President Barack Obama.\nPhoto: Alex Brandon, AP Image 1 of / 6 Caption\nClose\nImage 1 of 6 President Donald Trump accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, listens as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., speaks before a meeting with congressional leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017, in Washington. less President Donald Trump accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, listens as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., speaks before a meeting with congressional leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan of ... more Photo: Alex Brandon, AP Image 2 of 6 President Donald Trump speaks before a meeting with congressional leaders including Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017, in Washington. less President Donald Trump speaks before a meeting with congressional leaders including Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., Senate Majority ... more Photo: Alex Brandon, AP Image 3 of 6 House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., left listens with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., and Vice President Mike Pence during a meeting with President Donald Trump and congressional leaders in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017, in Washington. less House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., left listens with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., and Vice President Mike Pence during a meeting with President Donald Trump and congressional leaders in the Oval ... more Photo: Alex Brandon, AP Image 4 of 6 President Donald Trump accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, meets with congressional leaders including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., left, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017, in Washington. less President Donald Trump accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, meets with congressional leaders including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., left, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., Senate Majority ... more Photo: Alex Brandon, AP Image 5 of 6 President Donald Trump accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, speaks before a meeting with congressional leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., left, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017, in Washington. less President Donald Trump accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, speaks before a meeting with congressional leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., left, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., ... more Photo: Alex Brandon, AP Image 6 of 6 President Donald Trump speaks before a meeting with congressional leaders including Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017, in Washington. less President Donald Trump speaks before a meeting with congressional leaders including Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., Senate Majority ... more Photo: Alex Brandon, AP Congress averts shutdown, sends Trump stopgap spending bill 1  /  6 Back to Gallery In back-to-back statements, both Democratic and GOP leaders declared the meeting \"productive.\" The White House called it \"constructive.\" Privately, congressional aides said little progress had been made.\n\"We had a productive conversation on a wide variety of issues. Nothing specific has been agreed to, but discussions continue,\" said Capitol Hill's top Democrats, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, ticking off a roster of Democratic priorities, including domestic spending increases, funding for veterans and money to battle opioid abuse, immigration and health care.\nGOP leaders said they agreed with the need to address immigration, including the almost 1 million immigrants given protections by Obama, many of whom have only known America as their home.\nSpokesmen for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said GOP leaders \"stressed the need to address border security, interior enforcement and other parts of our broken immigration system,\" adding that the tricky immigration issue \"should be a separate process and not used to hold hostage funding for our men and women in uniform.\"\nNegotiations are sure to be challenging. Pelosi staked out a hard line Thursday and insisted that any year-end deal solve the immigration issue.\nPelosi told reporters before the meeting that \"we will not leave here\" without helping the \"Dreamers.\" Her stance was noteworthy because GOP leaders are likely to require Democratic votes for the pre-Christmas spending bill.\nThe White House said \"negotiations on immigration should be held separately on a different track\" and not slow down funding increases for the Pentagon.\nPelosi returned from the White House to oppose Thursday's stopgap bill. Fourteen Democrats supported the measure, however, while 18 Republicans opposed it.\nAmong Republicans, the conservative House Freedom Caucus had resisted the pending stopgap measure earlier in the week, fearing it would lead to a bad deal for conservatives down the road. But on Thursday, the group's chairman, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said the group will likely give leaders whatever support they need to pass the legislation.\nMeadows said they'd help it pass to avoid distractions from the GOP drive to push their treasured $1.5 trillion tax bill through Congress this month. That measure, which mostly benefits businesses and upper-income people, is Trump's and the GOP's top remaining priority and would be their first major legislative triumph of the year.\nBut hours before Trump was to bargain with congressional leaders at the White House over longer-term spending decisions, Meadows said the conservatives would oppose any agreement they feel allows excessive federal spending.\n\"I want to avoid a headline that says President Trump's administration just passes the highest spending levels in U.S. history,\" Meadows told reporters. \"There will be zero support on numbers that are too high, regardless of anybody's position on that.\"\nHe also said Ryan promised he'd fight in coming weeks to pass a full-year budget for the military and leave fights with Democrats over domestic spending for later. It is unclear how that strategy would work, since Republicans control the Senate 52-48 and will need at least eight Democratic votes to pass any spending legislation.\nThe prospects for successful White House talks were buffeted Wednesday when the impulsive Trump blurted to reporters that a shutdown \"could happen.\" He blamed Democrats, saying they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\"\nLast week, an unexpected attack by Trump on Schumer and Pelosi prompted the two to skip a bargaining session.\nThe two-week spending bill also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. That widely popular program provides medical care to more than 8 million children.\nThe CHIP issue is among the year-end items where negotiations have gone positively, and aides say a long-term agreement is nearly in hand.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steve scalise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. scott applewhite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacquelyn martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark meadows", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin mccarthy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "freedom caucus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house freedom caucus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap image", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "children's health insurance program", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol rotunda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-la.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-wis.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:14.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe6ee4b49e3651874dc06562f2e4b3e3b036c5f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzpGR7363LhCOCAggWP.8dRmN20O_qVTHpj5_bJXZlzXizI1i8QM4g0R", "site_full": "www.booking.com", "site": "booking.com", "site_section": "https://www.booking.com/hotel/za/orange-grove-farm.en-gb.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Farm stay Orange Grove Farm, Robertson, South Africa - Booking.com ", "title": "119 Verified Reviews of Orange Grove Farm | Booking.com", "title_full": "119 Verified Reviews of Orange Grove Farm | Booking.com", "published": "2017-01-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 34, "participants_count": 32, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://t-ec.bstatic.com/static/img/facebook-image-else/566c7081f1deeaca39957e96365c3908f83b95af.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 105, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "417bb444cf89749813c825d38b8e6d8afa8cd48a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzpGR7363LhCOCAggWP.8dRmN20O_qVTHpj5_bJXZlzXi75ePxm8h.XLaRWDulApLv2RT8yGdnA7wCUQtmvFJ.xFaGctOUPn99M-", "ord_in_thread": 34, "author": "Timoreta", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\"Fourth time back.\"", "text": "\ub209 There were quite a bit of flies inside and outside the cottage.

Mostly the 'new' bits centred around changes to legislation. The Aussies'  Competition and Consumer Act (the CCA) has a new s45 on anti-competitive 'concerted practices', and an improved version of s46 dealing with abuse of market power, which incorporates the 'effects' test for use of market power as recommended by the Aussies' Harper review of competition policy.\n\nWe, on the other hand, are still lumbered with the 'taking advantage of market power' test that the Aussies have moved on from. As our Commerce Commission said in its just-released Briefing to its Incoming Minister \nThe Commission supports changes to Section 36 [our abuse of market power provision] as our enforcement programme continues to be constrained by practical difficulties in applying the legal tests set down by the courts. We note that the equivalent misuse of market power provision in the Australian Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Section 46) has been amended (and came into effect in October this year), ostensibly to overcome similar issues and limitations encountered by the ACCC with \u2018market power\u2019 cases. Don't know what cavilling nitpicker put 'ostensibly' in there: there's no ostensibly about it. Rod Sims said that \"the old Section 46 saw us powerless to deal with a range of behaviour by powerful firms in many parts of the value chain who were stopping their competitors competing on their merits\". The Aussies did have issues. They did have limitations. They've had a go at fixing them. We haven't (yet).\n\nIf the Aussies are ahead of us in some areas, it was nice to see that at least sometimes we have made the running. Currently our Commission does both merger clearances (no lessening of competition involved) and merger authorisations (there's a lessening, but it's worth it on a net public benefit basis), and has done for yonks. In Australia however there was an 'informal' clearance regime run by the ACCC (though in practice it became rather formalised and not unlike our clearance process), but authorisations went to the Australian Competition Tribunal. Now both clearances and authorisations go to the ACCC in the first instance, which makes total sense. So it was nice to see our own Mary-Anne Borrowdale, general counsel in the competition branch of the Commerce Commission, explaining to the Aussies how the processes work in practice and how to make them work smoothly for everyone.\n\nSims also made the good point that enforcing a competition regime is even more important these days when people are more than usually concerned about inequality and inequity. As he said, \"Often populism opposes the essence of our market economy because it seems to many that the common person loses out and a small elite get wealthy at their expense. As I have repeatedly said, however, the role of the CCA is to ensure that our market economy does, and is seen to, work as it should, to the benefit of people generally\".\n\nI was struck by a couple of other things he said. One was that the ACCC has five criminal cartel cases with the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions on top of others they've already pinged (\"shipping, polycarbonate roofing, electrical cable, air freight, electrical componentry in cars, foreign exchange in the banking sector, airline tickets, and laundry detergent\"), plus \"there are others in our now\u2011healthy pipeline from our investment in establishing our serious cartels unit\". Like all cartel policemen, he's got an interest in talking up his book, if only to make cartel leniency programmes look more attractive to potential dobbers-in: those five with the CDPP for all I know could all be the other Japanese shipping lines after NYK rolled over on its erstwhile co-conspirators. But even after allowing for some puffery it does leave me wondering: if the ACCC is finding stuff, are we? And if not, why not?\n\nSims also said that the ACCC had won a prize for competition advocacy. I'd never heard of the International Competition Network (ICN) / World Bank competition advocacy contest : now that I have, and acknowledging that we in New Zealand can't go through life forever making invidious comparisons with our Aussie mates, I wouldn't mind at all if the Commerce Commission was on the ICN / World Bank podium some day.\n\nLuke Woodward , partner and head of the competition and regulation practice at Gilbert + Tobin , followed Sims on the same 'new era' topic (summary here , full remarks here ). It put the evolution of Australia's competition regime in historical perspective. He said that \"in Australia we developed an excessive level of legal formalism, where statutory construction has at times predominated over competition analysis. This approach has been rigid and not well able to flexibly adapt to developments in thinking over time...Section 46 suffered this fate: it started poorly with judicial glosses; was put on a good workable footing... and then...an artificial and disconnected legalistic approach to causal connections was introduced. The ACCC got shy and backed off. The hunting dog retreated to the porch\".\n\nBut now Australia is in a potentially better position - potentially, because it might get to a place where the substance and the economics prevail over the legalism, or it might not. As Luke said, \"The ACCC\u2019s s 45 and s 46 guidelines don\u2019t as of yet provide any guidance around the competitive theories of harm that the ACCC considers applying. In form, they are documents that look more like they were written by lawyers or administrators with an eye to warning businesses and keeping options open; rather than written by economists articulating a coherent economic theory of harm\".\n\nOther presenters - notably Peter Armitage from Ashurst (on s45) and Kirsten Webb from Clayton Utz (on s46) - made similar points about early days, detail still needing to be filled in, and how things might yet develop through the cases. Where the Aussies take s46 in particular will be hugely important to us if (as I think likely) we'll eventually join them in changing our law to match theirs. Whether we'll opt for a 'concerted practices' provision is more debatable. I can see a logic to one, but as Armitage argued, it's not fully clear what its reach is. If it's meant to catch anti-competitive things that aren't quite caught by the traditional 'contract, arrangement or understanding', fair enough. But (as he instanced) what about the example of smaller coal or iron producers swinging in behind the prices negotiated by the big guys with the big Chinese and Japanese buyers? There's a risk of overreach.\n\nLuke Woodward also had some questions about the ACCC's extensive series of market studies: one came out on the morning of the conference (on the dairy industry ), and another one has got underway since (a highly interesting one, on digital platforms ). Luke worried that they might be going too far: for example, \"If regulators themselves are prone to regulatory failure,then having found market failures, we run the risk of not correcting market failures, but simply adding regulatory failure to market failure\" (read his full comments on pp 9-11 of his speech). All I can say is, it's a nice problem to have: up to now our Commerce Commission has been left twiddling its thumbs. The new government, goaded by the petrol  market, looks like it'll finally - finally - let the Commission proactively look at competition issues, but at the usual glacial pace of legislative and policy change in this area it'll be late next year before they have the powers, and 2019 and beyond before we see anything from them.\n\nWe also had sessions on competition issues in key industries, the pick for me being RBB's George Siolis with his commentary on the ACCC's retail electricity inquiry . At the risk of making those invidious comparisons again, I was left with the clear view that we've managed a much better job of regulating electricity lines businesses than the Aussies have, partly because Aussie lines companies were able to see off the regulator's decisions through the courts (a bolt hole that's since been sealed off).\n\nAll up, an engrossing conference, and well done RBB Economics. We're fortunate - in Australia and New Zealand - to have a variety of high level fora where these kinds of issues can get serious treatment. On our side of the ditch, though - those damn comparisons again - we're not very good at translating them into worthwhile reforms within any sensible timeframe.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clayton utz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter armitage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george siolis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rod sims", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luke woodward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "armitage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirsten webb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sims", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gilbert + tobin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary-anne borrowdale", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rbb economics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aussies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commerce commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "competition tribunal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rbb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commonwealth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashurst", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the commerce commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international competition network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icn / world bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:14.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d57d0825be7a17051f477d44f251351b449647f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8_DRNYNHvKGwBXjWTOM6I0DqkaNuiAPwT1cUDqOTHfSh9lfDhN7Map", "site_full": "www.55188.com", "site": "55188.com", "site_section": "http://www.55188.com/forum-8-2.html", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "\u0104\u017e\u0161\u00c9\u0118\u0110\u0118\u013e\u0150\u02dd\u0110\u0139\u010e\u02d8\u02dd\u0165\u00c1\u00f7\u00c7\u0159\u0104\u017c -

By Siobh\u00e1n McNamara Thursday 7 Dec 2017, 8:38 AM 12 hours ago 49,702 Views 35 Comments http://jrnl.ie/3736581 Image: Sebastian Duda via Shutterstock Image: Sebastian Duda via Shutterstock \nA DISTRICT COURT judge has said prolonged vile and evil abuse hurled at garda\u00ed by an arrested retired sergeant was the worst he had ever heard. \nJoseph Kiely (63) of Old Golf Course Road, Tullycullion, Donegal Town claimed to have a cancer curse. He told three garda\u00ed they would die of cancer within five years. The defendant also told a woman into whose car he crashed that cancer would visit her. Tragically, the woman has since died of cancer. \nYesterday\u2019s sitting of Donegal District Court heard that Kiely was arrested for drink driving following a collision at Quay Street, Donegal Town on 11 October 2015. \nSergeant Oliver Devaney attended the scene along with Garda Sean Rogers. \nThey found a Ford Mondeo driven by Shirley Walsh of Ballintra in the main carriageway approaching Donegal Town. Kiely\u2019s Nissan Almera was at a right angle to the Mondeo. Both cars were damaged. Kiely had been exiting a carpark when he collided with Walsh. \nSergeant Devaney said: \u201cI spoke to him and asked him for his driving licence. He said \u2018This is a set-up. It is orchestrated. She crashed into me.\u2019\u201d \nBoth drivers were then breathalysed. Walsh passed the roadside breath test, while Kiely failed. \nSergeant Devaney arrested the defendant. \n\u201cHe said the to the lady in an aggressive tone \u2018Cancer will visit you,\u2019\u201d said the sergeant. \nKiely was taken to Donegal Town Garda Station. During the obligatory 20-minute observation period which precedes a blood, breath or urine test, Kiely was highly abusive. \nSergeant Devaney said: \u201cHe told me \u2018Cancer will visit you. I have the power of cancer over you. Your offspring will get cancer. You will all be dead within five years.\u2019\u201d \nThe comments were aimed at Garda Rogers, Garda Doherty who was also present, and Sergeant Devaney. \nGarda Rogers then gave evidence. \n\u201cHe said he had the tinker\u2019s cancer curse that he got in a dark place in Connemara,\u201d said the garda. He said if I had offspring they would all die kicking and screaming of cancer. And he said I would die of cancer within three years. \nKiely signed all documents at the station with the words \u201ccancer curse\u201d. \nWhen the test was carried out, Kiely showed a reading of 51mcg of alcohol per 100ml of breath. \nChanged \nCounsel for the defence Sean McGee acting for solicitor Catherine Boner of JP Sweeney & Co asked Garda Rogers if he had ever worked with Kiely. \nThe garda replied that he worked under Kiely when on overtime shifts. He said as a sergeant, Kiely had been kind and intelligent. But something had changed in the intervening years. \nIn considering sentence, Judge Kilrane said: \u201cI was in practice for 34 years as a solicitor and for almost 10 years I have been in my present position. I have never heard such vile utterances out of anyone in custody. Shocking, vile abuse and not a murmur of apology. \n\u201cIt is the worst I have ever come across.\u201d \nUnder oath, Kiely claimed garda\u00ed turned a blind eye to his being harassed. He told the court that he had submitted a 100-page file to Garda HQ on the matter of a campaign of intimidation. \nHe did not apologise for his comments. \nThe judge sentenced Kiely to two months in prison, fined him \u20ac500 and disqualified him from holding a driving licence for two years. \n\u201cThe reason for the sentence is the extreme aggravating factors on the night in question,\u201d

His father refuses to acknowledge him and will not give him any information about who his mother it. On his travels Justin comes across a roadside attack. The victim is a goldsmith, Gervase Fitz Randolph who was on his way to court with a letter of news of Richard\u2019s whereabouts. Before he dies, he gives the letter to Justin whom he makes promise to deliver it. When Justin reads the letter he realises he has extremely important information about where the King is.\nJustin reaches London and delivers the letter to Richard\u2019s mother, Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine who is anxiously awaiting news of her son. After reading the letter she commissions Justin to find Randolph\u2019s killer and discover if the attack was random or if there is more to it. In his investigation Justin discovers plenty of people with a motive for the murder \u2013 the goldsmith\u2019s family, a jealous love rival, even the King\u2019s brother, Prince John \u2013 it is a difficult task.\nIn his travels Justin comes across Gracechurch Street and makes new friends there and the odd enemy. There is a real sense of community there. The people there help Justin in his quest and look out for each other. Justin\u2019s fight with his father is in the background all through the story.\nSharon Penman is one of the top historical fiction writers and you can tell this. The historical background is so accurate and detailed. The characters \u2013 real and fictional \u2013 are so well written but the stand out character for me was John. Penman managed to make his seem so creepy, he appears from nowhere and actually gives you shivers.\nI would thoroughly recommend this book.

Venus tileset is Snow freezy and cold theme. Also the faction is Courpus. Imagine the result having a open world. There is a lot of Mountain around the place, High mountain . You can tell from doing one of the outdoor Venus mission right now. For me i'm pretty happy to think we have Another open world. But just think about other Open world concept. Lua for example, I've been there a lot and the structure is very awesome. Imagine we can run around the moon, enter another Orokin buildings, And also no gravity. It's fun you know. Or Jupiter but you had to (Archwing) cough cough** , can't land on surface or you will get killed from high radiation gas. Mercury ? I haven't seen an outdoor node, so its nice to see a red plains and structure around the place. Europa , It's obviously needed an open world. However we know we can't go too far without a cold-resistance or you'll freeze to death except frost. hmm, Void ....I can't really think of it. But it doesn't HAVE to be open world outdoor concept izzit? maybe make the Structure more bigger so we can explore more room and more puzzle. Derelict , Infested orokin ship. I have nothing to say with that, it's a Ship. Eris , I wonder what it will looks like? an outdoor open world fills with endless infested enemies. Even after the Operation: Plague star. I'm sure a lot of people will think Eris is more Nightmare and worse open world so i might think i'll agree with you guys. Pluto is just same as Venus, it's a same tileset after all but little more map than Venus. Ceres , Just think about it. An open world full of Toxic grineer structure and acid rain . It reference to one of the game i might know. Mars , I rate 10/10 that have to be the next open world after Venus and please. I love that tileset, i'd love to see more sand enemies faction or more interesting enemies we never knows. Altho there's also a few mountain but not a lot. And what do i missed, Uranus of course. If only DE fixed the control for Archwing, then maybe it will be worth for... Underwater open world?

The 30-year-old Barcelona forward is still seeking his first senior trophy with the Albiceleste, having come painfully close in the past three and a half years as a losing finalist in the 2014 World Cup, 2015 Copa America and 2016 Copa America, reports Xinhua news agency. \"People are waiting for this group to leave because it has not won for a long time and those who criticize get tired of always seeing the same faces,\" Messi told TyC Sports. \"I think it's the last opportunity for this group. There is a lot of excitement. If we do badly, the entire national team will have to disappear. It's going to be very difficult for anyone to continue because we have already been here for a number of years.\" Argentina endured a torrid qualifying campaign in South America's CONMEBOL group, only securing a World Cup place in the last match against Ecuador in October with a Messi-inspired 3-1 victory in Quito. The Albiceleste have been drawn in one of the toughest World Cup groups alongside Iceland, Nigeria and Croatia.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "messi russia", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "messi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lionel messi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "xinhua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conmebol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albiceleste", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecuador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quito", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "copa america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iceland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "croatia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:15.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d13d320bee41dfac5e17013c2f19df8804cdebcd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvzCtw87tr_xbfZA4YXQ8IZT6kOEemRlEy4-", "site_full": "forums.warframe.com", "site": "warframe.com", "site_section": "https://forums.warframe.com/forum/36-general-discussion/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "General Discussion - Warframe Forums", "title": "Open world", "title_full": "Open world - General Discussion - Warframe Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T17:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.998, "main_image": "https://content.invisioncic.com/Mwarframe/monthly_2017_07/warframe_share.png.bec3c989c4517e865df9b45a300e63e0.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7793, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8e41b050872ccd64ffac85a9944422538ebb25e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvzCtw87tr_xbfZA4YXQ8IZT_JjrK6hzDODO1BkbWqShBg--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "(PS4)s3d_sas", "published": "2017-12-07T17:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Edited 1 hour ago by (PS4)s3d_sas", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://i.imgur.com/9ZbHUPd.png"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:15.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93da05fe1df306547d84170f39c0374fdc6baa97", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYNtGt1pOaY6WrUwIiGs2t4rhvx0umE0rcsFnuXkQ0FZR_u5FDY6RHCEKR79iQbmgd1VCBDzLLdJwWFn99CBlicp4F1zYfrYwJT95ZWTiKrm8X.ytg6eqlAtEN4BaqIME_", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.co.uk", "site": "tripadvisor.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowForum-g2366676-i26627-o8760-Siem_Reap_Province.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Siem Reap Province Forum, Travel Discussion for Siem Reap Province, Cambodia - TripAdvisor", "title": "Angkor Wat Tours", "title_full": "Angkor Wat Tours - Siem Reap Message Board - TripAdvisor", "published": "2006-01-11T12:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.084, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1071, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "520915ee0ad56538fc6bc941d67ed03d7c77683e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYNtGt1pOaY6WrUwIiGs2t4rhvx0umE0rcsFnuXkQ0FZR_u5FDY6RHCEKR79iQbmgd1VCBDzLLdJwWFn99CBlicp4F1zYfrYwJT95ZWTiKrm8X.ytg6eqlAoPkkiETBPe8", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Prooky", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "We asked our hotel to arrange a guide and driver for us for 3 days.

Earlier known as Rajkot-II, the seat is considered as 'safe' for the saffron party which has been representing it since 1985. The constituency goes to polls on December 9 in the first phase of the high-stakes Gujarat elections. Vajubhai Vala, incumbent Governor of Karnataka, had won the seat seven times for the BJP - from 1985 to 2012. In 1985, he had defeated Harshadba Chudasama. Vala vacated the seat for Narendra Modi in 2002 after the latter was then nominated as the chief minister. Later, when Modi moved to Maninagar constituency, Vala continued his undefeated run till 2012. Later, after Vala was shifted to Karnataka, Vijay Rupani won the bypoll from the seat in 2014. Though Rajkot-West is a stronghold of the RSS, the Congress has mounted a strong challenge by bringing in Rajyaguru, the sitting MLA from Rajkot-East, to rework the caste combination in the party's favour. To retain his seat, Rupani has to surmount the angry Patidars as well as the trading community, which is smarting under the impact of demonetisation and rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Out of 3.15 lakh voters in the constituency, the number of Kadva and Leuva Patidars is the highest at 62,000, followed by Brahmins, Lohana and Jain communities. The Congress is trying to direct the simmering anger among Patidars over lack of reservation in education and government jobs under the BJP rule against Rupani. The quota agitation and Hardik Patel joining hands with Congress may dent the BJP's base among the Patidars, who till now were considered as the bedrock of the BJP's support base in Gujarat. Congress nominee Rajyaguru, the richest candidate in Gujarat elections, believes that he has won the \"initial battle\" against Rupani by keeping him busy in the constituency since the poll schedule was announced. \"I wanted to keep the chief minister busy in Rajkot-West constituency and morally I have won the initial battle as the chief minister has to visit his constituency more than once in a week,\" Rajyaguru claimed. However, Rupani has been unfazed and is confident of his victory. He earlier cited the work done by him for the people of the state as well as his constituency, especially bringing the Narmada river water to Rajkot. Rupani had said that he was not facing any challenge in Rajkot West as it is a traditional bastion of the BJP. \"I will win the seat easily,\" he had told in an interview recently. BJP's Saurashtra and Kutch spokesperson Raju Dhruv said that Rupani has always been ready to solve the problems faced by the people of Rajkot or elsewhere in Gujarat. \"As the CM, he has done well and because of his tireless efforts, Rajkot could get the Narmada water in less than five years of the project announced by then chief minister Narendra Modiji,\" Dhruv said. The 182-member Gujarat Assembly will go to the polls in two phases -- on December 9 and 14 -- and the counting of votes will be taken up on December 18.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rupani", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "guj cm rupani", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dhruv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harshadba chudasama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hardik patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vajubhai vala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patidars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajyaguru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narendra modiji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lohana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leuva patidars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vijay rupani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raju dhruv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rajkot west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saurashtra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karnataka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narmada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajkot-west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajyaguru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kadva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kutch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maninagar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajkot-east", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:16.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3c13911d4ad649466e28ce7ff0ecf5785ba3868b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kNOYMWIthylTUGkFjTM60GEnuE17JYp1t1tlYZJR6FwXI8PgbUcFYY7xRHCoCGecm7a2D8sKP7LkqEbDB7czUHhu7Xz7RlWeQpWk8XiLc5QKPRy8952Tw0nMWvduQA1qf5v2LVoQFRrWbxibBt0iEo5ogsy7JT.T_9Ogr8b.xHt9FBCEQtTqTJfI0t0dsmIORSMVzIktPfGWNgcVBCDQf", "site_full": "www.independent.co.uk", "site": "independent.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "The Independent -
