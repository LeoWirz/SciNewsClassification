The Charlotte Observer via AP Diedra Laird Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio speaks at a news conference at the Government Center about the hacking of Mecklenburg County's servers in Charlotte, N.C., Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017. A $25,000 ransom in bit coin was being sought for the files being held. County officials said late this afternoon they are not paying the ransom. The Charlotte Observer via AP Diedra Laird Cyberattack slows North Carolina county as it works on fixes By TOM FOREMAN Jr. and JONATHAN DREW Associated Press December 07, 2017 11:49 AM UPDATED 1 MINUTE AGO CHARLOTTE, N.C. \nTime-consuming paper transactions slowed business Thursday in North Carolina's largest metro area as a county government began the dayslong process of restoring computer systems locked down by a ransomware attack. \nMecklenburg County was using backed-up data to make digital repairs after refusing to pay foreign hackers that froze dozens of county servers earlier this week. In the meantime, services ranging from processing jail inmates to paying tax bills had to be done by hand. \nDarryl Broome, a contractor who does remodeling and demolition work, went in person to a county office to retrieve land information he normally could look up on his home computer. He had to drive 10 miles and spent about a half-hour looking through paper records. \n\"It's a bit frustrating because you learn that you really need certain things online,\" he said. \"You get used to doing certain things online, and when you have to slow down, it costs you time and time costs you money.\"   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government said its separate computer system wasn't affected by the attack. Nor were the computers that handle 911 calls and dispatch for the city and county, said Charlotte Fire Department Deputy Chief Richard Granger. \nMany county-run services have been delayed. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said Wednesday it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, while code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said workers were putting a priority on fixing the systems that power transactions for the health department, court system and the department that oversees building codes and environmental services. \nCyberattacks on local government are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated. Security experts say Mecklenburg County followed the right steps before and after the cyberattack, including declining to pay the ransom. \n\"Unfortunately, it's become all too common,\" said Lawrence Abrams, who runs the cyber security site bleepingcomputer.com. \"It's smart not to pay the ransom if you can avoid it. In paying these ransoms, it's obviously encouraging others.\" \nCounties in Indiana and Alabama are among those that have paid ransoms to regain access to data after a cyberattack since late last year. The Montgomery Advertiser reported that the Montgomery County, Alabama, faced disruptions to some operations even after paying hackers in September. \nOther public organizations have chosen to restore and not pay. In November 2016, a ransomware attack on San Francisco's transit system resulted in officials shutting down ticketing machines, allowing free rides for much of a weekend. But transit officials didn't pay a ransom. The St. Louis library system said it took days to restore electronic services for patrons and weeks more to fix all of its computers after it refused to pay hackers behind a ransomware attack this year. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said Mecklenburg County appears to have done a good job of backing up its data if it's able to restore the system without paying the hackers. \n\"It seems like the county was fairly well-prepared,\" he said. \"Overall, this is not as bad of a story as it could have been.\" \nMecklenburg County computers were hit Monday after an employee opened an email attachment containing malicious software, Diorio said. The attack as publicly revealed the next day. Hackers had sought digital currency worth more than $23,000 to unlock the data. \nA forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. Without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system using backup data. \n___", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dena diorio", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jonathan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irwin carmichael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith gregg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ross rustici", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anjanette flowers grube", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mobile & apps mecklenburg county", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "government center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cybereason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecklenburg county sheriff's office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap diedra laird north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap diedra laird mecklenburg county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte observer", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecklenburg county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.c.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:05.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15b063403f2b81ec1f035bb85f99347083aa0c51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQApyRnPnOVUkinmYWrOsffoO_Jz_gCwZvtYr.ehRJzog--", "site_full": "vk.com", "site": "vk.com", "site_section": "https://vk.com/alphazavr22847", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Yan Veber", "title": "\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u044c like \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0448 \u0435\u0442\u0443 \u0430\u0445\u0443\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0443", "title_full": "\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u044c like \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0448 \u0435\u0442\u0443 \u0430\u0445\u0443\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0443", "published": "2017-11-16T15:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "RU", "spam_score": 0.149, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e2295d5ec3f4d6f956ada12f4faecf346f4051c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQApyRnPnOVUkinmYWrOsffoO_Jz_gCwZt3rZ2b58r8AQ--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Darya Yurchenko", "published": "2017-11-16T15:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "sho za pidaru", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:05.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac055727b186d2877b4c2bb7ef80aea30c081f1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90FqjzWj6mpGzBAyrwjDF8d_FhgfX8p8ao9p5hVtvoXv9MUpja.vVYMEzIHrczBMxW_2EutREKzebJEzVf12SxvsnWOhtWHiY-", "site_full": "www.iphoneforums.net", "site": "iphoneforums.net", "site_section": "http://www.iphoneforums.net/forums/off-topic-discussion.18/", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Off-Topic Discussion | Apple iPhone Forum", "title": "What are you doing right NOW??? ;) | Page 519", "title_full": "What are you doing right NOW??? ;) | Page 519 | Apple iPhone Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T10:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "http://www.iphoneforums.net/data/avatars/m/34/34772.jpg?1317916681", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "438666b426bc874968afe2bbe7ffbd5da102d6e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90FqjzWj6mpGzBAyrwjDF8d_FhgfX8p8ao9p5hVtvoXv9MUpja.vVYMEzIHrczBMxW_2EutREKzebJEzVf12SxQxdu5fUjbYLbAZNHDq7baw--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Data_Daedalus", "published": "2017-12-06T15:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "J.

Erdogan is in Greece on atto-day official visit. Thanassis Stavrakis AP Photo Leaders of Turkey, Greece air grievances at tense conference By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press  24 AM UPDATED 2 MINUTES AGO ATHENS, Greece \nThe leaders of Greece and Turkey publicly aired their grievances Thursday in a tense news conference as a two-day visit to Athens by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan got off to a rocky start. \nThe Greek government had expressed hopes that the visit \u2014 the first to Greece by a Turkish president in 65 years \u2014 would help improve the often-frosty relations between the two neighbors. The NATO allies are divided by a series of decades-old issues, including territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea, and have come to the brink of war three times since the early 1970s. \nBut from the outset, the discussions focused on disagreements. \nOn the eve of his visit, Erdogan rattled his Greek hosts by telling Greece's Skai television that the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne should be \"updated.\" The treaty delineated modern Turkey's borders and outlines the status of the Muslim minority in Greece and the Greek minority in Turkey, among other issues.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nIn a visibly testy first meeting with Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos, the two engaged in a thinly-veiled verbal spat over the treaty and Greece's Muslim minority, which Erdogan is to visit Friday. \n\"This happened in Lausanne, that happened in Lausanne. I get that, but let's now quickly do what is necessary,\" Erdogan told Pavlopoulos. \"Many things have changed in 94 years. If we review these, I believe that all the sides will agree that so many things have to (change.)\" \nThe spat continued during Erdogan's appearance at an unusually candid joint news conference with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. \nThe two listed a series of grievances their countries have with each other, including religious and minority rights, the divided island of Cyprus and the case of ten Turkish servicemen who have applied for asylum in Greece following a Turkish government crackdown after a failed coup last year. \n\"It is very important to strengthen our channels of communication, and this can only happen on the basis of mutual respect,\" Tsipras said. \nThe prime minister said the two also discussed tensions in the Aegean Sea, where Greece complains Turkish fighter jets frequently violate its airspace. \n\"The increasing violations of Greek airspace in the Aegean and particularly the simulated dogfights in the Aegean pose a threat to our relations, and particularly a threat to our pilots,\" Tsipras said. \nFor his part, Erdogan insisted once more that the Lausanne treaty needed to be reviewed, but stressed his country had no territorial claims on its smaller neighbor. \nOn the topic of the Muslim minority in Greece \u2014 which the country recognizes only as a religious minority, while Turkey has long pressed for better rights \u2014 Tsipras said his government agreed that improvements must be made in their quality of life. \n\"But issues that concern reforms involving Greek citizens are not an issue of negotiation between countries,\" he said. \nTsipras noted it was unclear exactly what Erdogan was seeking with his call to update the 1923 treaty. \n\"The truth is I am a little confused about what he is putting on the table,\" he said. \nGreeks have been aghast at Erdogan's previous comments over possibly revising the Lausanne treaty, fearing that could harbor territorial claims. \nErdogan and Tsipras also sparred over Cyprus, a Mediterranean island divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion into a Turkish-occupied north and an internationally recognized Greek Cypriot south. Another round of internationally-brokered peace talks to reunify the island failed earlier this year. \n\"Who left the table? Southern Cyprus did ... we want the issue to reach a fair and lasting solution but that is not southern Cyprus' concern,\" Erdogan said. \nTsipras retorted: \"My dear friend, Mr. President, we must not forget that this issue remains unresolved because 43 years ago there was an illegal invasion and occupation of the northern part of Cyprus.\" \nErdogan also raised the issue of Athens having no official mosque, to which Tsipras responded by saying Greece had restored several mosques around the country, including a centuries-old mosque in Athens. \nThe refugee crisis appeared to be the only issue the two sides did not disagree on, with both noting they had shared a significant burden of the migration flows into the European Union. More than a million people crossed from Turkey through Greece at the height of the crisis. \nLater Thursday, several hundred leftist, anarchist and Kurdish protesters held a peaceful march through Athens against Erdogan's visit. \nOn Friday, Erdogan will visit the northeastern town of Komotini to meet with members of Greece's Muslim minority.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitris tzanakopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexis tsipras", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lausanne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:05.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c909b82bbe2b8c6cd0eab2988cfb7272ad12ebb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKwThABuEBTDxlNPbqSP4cnvSOAZY_UeLghq5qMFWjEaBSObi5fbWQHhbww3r7zPlWJ7mC3e1jhZRY58barpbyGH_nMO9FKJgwoDJPIv3sIn2g--", "site_full": "peninsulaclarion.com", "site": "peninsulaclarion.com", "site_section": "http://peninsulaclarion.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Peninsula Clarion", "title": "Reeling it in: \u2018Coco\u2019 wins over harshest of critics", "title_full": "Reeling it in: \u2018Coco\u2019 wins over harshest of critics", "published": "2017-12-07T07:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://peninsulaclarion.com/sites/default/files/image5077552_web1_AP17296794434312.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c909b82bbe2b8c6cd0eab2988cfb7272ad12ebb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKwThABuEBTDxlNPbqSP4cnvSOAZY_UeLghq5qMFWjEaBSObi5fbWQHhbww3r7zPlWJ7mC3e1jhZRY58barpbyGH_nMO9FKJgwoDJPIv3sIn2g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsengin", "published": "2017-12-07T07:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "Reeling it in: \u2018Coco\u2019 wins over harshest of critics", "text": "Posted December 6, 2017 09:04 pm By Chris Jenness Reeling it in: \u2018Coco\u2019 wins over harshest of critics \nIn this image released by Disney-Pixar, character Hector, voiced by Gael Garcia Bernal, left, and Miguel, voiced by Anthony Gonzalez, appear in a scene from the animated film, \u201cCoco.\u201d (Disney-Pixar via AP) \n\u201cCoco\u201d \nWalt Disney Studios \n1 hour, 49 minutes \nI don\u2019t know if this was a problem in other families, but at our house, \u201cCoco\u201d was a bit of a controversy. \nSure, I know, the latest Pixar offering doesn\u2019t offer most people any more trouble than deciding which showing you\u2019re going to take the kids to and whether or not you need to buy tickets in advance. For us, though, there\u2019s a little more to it. We are a Day of the Dead house. For one, my wife grew up in El Paso, Texas where Hispanic culture is preeminent. We\u2019ve both always liked Halloween, and to be frank, Day of the Dead has a better aesthetic, so it\u2019s a natural fit. To top it off, our daughter was born on November 2 \u2013 better known as Dia de los Muertos. \nSo, great \u2013 what\u2019s the problem? An animated movie set in the actual Land of the Dead surrounding our family\u2019s favorite holiday \u2013 perfect, right? \nExcept that they already made that movie. It was called \u201cThe Book of Life\u201d and it came out in 2014. As soon as trailers for \u201cCoco\u201d started appearing, I could tell a fight was brewing. \u201cHow dare they just rip off \u2018Book of Life?!\u2019\u201d\u201cAre there no new ideas?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going!\u201d And that was just from my wife. The kids were drawing battle lines as well and if it hadn\u2019t been for pure necessity (my son\u2019s 10th birthday party needed an activity) the Jenness family might well have skipped this movie altogether. What a loss that would have been. \n\u201cCoco\u201d is one of the best films I\u2019ve seen all year. And, not that it was an issue to anyone but us, it has virtually nothing in common with \u201cBook of Life\u201d other than calendar location. The story revolves around a young boy in Mexico named Miguel. Miguel is a typical 10-year old boy. He loves his family, he loves his dog, and he loves music. \nIt\u2019s this last part that\u2019s a sticking point. Miguel\u2019s family, as it happens, has forsaken music of any kind, all due to an errant great, great grandfather who, long ago left the family to pursue the life of a musician. The boy is undeterred, however, but when he tries to steal his ancestor\u2019s guitar on the night of Dia de los Muertos, he finds himself in violation of the laws of the Land of the Dead, where only the blessing of one particularly cranky long-dead matriarch will send him home. \nFor Miguel, and the audience that goes with him, the Day of the Dead becomes an amazing journey through a fascinating landscape populated by crazy characters and strange colorful creatures, peppered with just enough danger and mystery to make it the trip of a lifetime. \nIt\u2019s hard to overstate how much I enjoyed this film. In true Pixar fashion, the artwork is lovely, the writing is strong, and the tone is a perfect mix of heart and humor that will satisfy every member of the family. \nWhere the animation studio often excels and even more so here is in the characters themselves. Many are funny, even silly, but they are real, too, even realer than in most \u201creal\u201d movies. \nMiguel, voiced by newcomer Anthony Gonzalez, is the perfect conduit for this story, and doesn\u2019t get overshadowed by the more experienced actors in the production. \nOne of the aspects of this film that really gives it an authentic feel is that the filmmakers wisely chose to cast this Hispanic story with Hispanic actors (shocker, I know). Gael Gabriel Bernal, Edward James Olmos, Benjamin Bratt, and the great Alfonso Arau, who you may remember as El Guapo in \u201cThe Three Amigos,\u201d but probably didn\u2019t know was the director of \u201cLike Water for Chocolate\u201d and \u201cA Walk in the Clouds,\u201d all make appearances, as do actual characters from Mexico\u2019s rich history, such as Frida Kahlo in a hilarious cameo. Everything about \u201cCoco\u201d feels sensitive \u2013 not politically correct, but aware of the culture it is depicting, and like almost everything Pixar puts out, the affection the artists feel for their subject comes through in spades. \nThere is a major misstep in this film, but it\u2019s not a problem with \u201cCoco,\u201d but rather with the cartoon that opens the film. Like post-credit stingers with Marvel films, Pixar has become known for the opening cartoon, usually a nearly wordless art piece depicting one or another beautiful moment or concept. The last one I saw was \u201cPiper,\u201d the story of a baby shorebird trying to get a clam. Occasionally they\u2019ll do a character based one \u2013 I think there\u2019re a couple of \u201cToy Story\u201d shorts and one from \u201cThe Incredibles,\u201d but usually they\u2019re disconnected to anything else Pixar has done. \nThis time, however, we are treated to a nearly fifteen minute \u201cFrozen\u201d adventure which sees Olaf searching for a Christmas tradition to give to the Queen and her sister. So much about this doesn\u2019t work that it\u2019s hard to know where to start. For one, the songs are terrible. These sound like the first drafts of the most mediocre of \u201cFrozen\u2019s\u201d playlist. And there\u2019s so many of them. I bet there are four different songs. There\u2019s only four or five songs in a normal length movie, so why they felt the need to pack them in here is a mystery to me. \nA bigger problem, however, is the entire plot structure. The idea is that, because of the events of the first film, Elsa and Anna have no Christmas traditions and Olaf is going to explore a bunch of different ones in order to find one for the girls to adopt. Leaving aside for a moment the fact that this isn\u2019t the way traditions work and that the plot is about as subtle as a third-rate, straight-to-video holiday special, but the idea of exploring Anna and Elsa\u2019s childhood is a big mistake. The original movie cleverly glosses over all this in one, well-written song. Therefore, you\u2019re not asked to actually confront the fact that these are two children who spent over a decade with absolutely no contact with other children, or any other people besides their parents. Not even each other. \nIf you spend too much time thinking about that, it can seriously mess you up. This short dives in to that childhood feet first and the happy conclusion where the two girls realize that Olaf is their tradition just makes it sadder. The \u201cFrozen\u201d short is not good, but it may have the effect of making \u201cCoco\u201d even better because you\u2019re starved by the time the feature begins. I just hope this doesn\u2019t have the unintended effect of dampening enthusiasm for the eventual \u201cFrozen\u201d sequel. \n\u201cCoco,\u201d on the other hand, they can keep making for as long as they want. Grade: A+ \n\u201cCoco\u201d is rated PG for very mild rude humor and scenes dealing with death and aging. \nChris Jenness is an art teacher, freelance graphic designer, artist and movie buff who lives in Nikiski.

The deep penetration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data in the global business environment has naturally sparked the need for smart Business Intelligence (BI) systems, which can to a large degree, automate decision making, thus removing the need for data professionals. \nIf the current BI systems used in financial services, investment banking, market research, or even healthcare industries are standards to go by, then Smart Data Discovery, powered by Machine Learning is the next game changer for businesses of all sizes and shapes. \nAccording to Gartner, the Business Intelligence market is expected to grow to US$22.8 Billion by 2020 . So, what do these game-changing Business Intelligence and Analytics trends offer to the businesses? Certainly, better visualization coupled with deep data drilling capabilities. Although the BI systems are getting increasingly sophisticated and more complex in terms of technology, here are some transformative trends that have been predicted for 2018. \nMarket Size and Technology Scope \nAccording to a statistics-heavy Report from Business Intelligence, Business Intelligence Market Expected To Grow $20.81 Billion By 2018 , the sudden growth of the 2018 BI & Analytics market will encompass traditional BI, hosted (Cloud) BI, social BI, and mobile BI. The entire market will touch down on $20.8 billion in 2018, which translates to \u201can estimated CAGR of 8.3% from 2013 to 2018.\u201d \nThe Forbes blog post titled Top 10 Trends For Digital Transformation In 2018 suggests that IoT enabled Business Analytics has the power to maximize operational efficiency in every industry sector from \u201cretail to city planning.\u201d The technology torch-bearers like IBM or SAP are investing more on Business Analytics capabilities, now that IoT and Big Data promise to deliver on streaming, operational, and transactional data in real time. Another example of a universal technology is the Blockchain, which began in the financial services but has gradually found its way into hospitality, healthcare, and some other industry sectors. By 2020, according to Datamation, only 20 percent of trade finance will utilize Blockchain, but once the trend is well set, there will be no looking back. \nThe Rise and Growth of Data Analytics \nThe sudden prominence of Data Analytics in the global business community has been triggered by the volume and variety of business data, which creates unique challenges for BI and Analytics users. The article titled Disruption Ahead: The Big Trends In Business Intelligence Analytics by the Digitalist magazine claims that the transformative BI will not only increase user adoption, but also promote the utilization of BI platforms among mainstream business users. Also read T he Top 10 Technology T rends for 2018 to understand how AI, Cloud, IoT, and business apps will jointly contribute to reshaping the IT landscape in every business. \nTop Tech Trends of 2018 BI & Analytics Market \nThe industry-wide buzz is that given the criticality of immediate and accurate decision making, every business user wants to have the capability for independently visualizing and analyzing data for improved results. According to the blog post titled Top Business Intelligence Trends to Watch Out for This 2018 , the hallmarks of \u2018modern\u2019 BI are enhanced Data Visualization, deep Data Mining, and intelligent Self-Service Analytics. \nThe author of this Dataviz article claims in Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2018 that Gartner\u2019s Technology Trend No. 2, which is Intelligent Apps and Analytics will ensure that in the next few years, every business application or service embraces AI at some level. This article further states that the market fetish for \u201ceverything AI\u201d is giving rise to a battleground for all analytics platforms and service providers. \nForrester Wave Reports on BI platforms have traditionally segmented the advanced visualization tools from the low-end reporting and regular visualization platforms. According to The Forrester Wave\u2122: Enterprise BI Platforms with Majority On-Premises Deployments, Q3 2017 , enterprise BI platforms, which featured advanced Business Intelligence capabilities required data professionals to develop the output. The mainstream BI platforms like Tableau and Qlik, on the other end satisfied the needs of ordinary business users. However, now Forrester acknowledges that advanced visualization is integral to most BI platforms, especially because Cloud-based BI has made it possible for medium or small sized businesses to have access to advanced analytics. Many of the features that differentiated scalable systems from low-end systems before are now commonly found across BI platforms. \nThe changing landscape within the overarching heading of Business Intelligence and Analytics trends have given rise to two major challenges that have to be mitigated by businesses of all sizes to democratize BI and extract real value from analytics activities. \nChallenge 1: Managing Large Troves of Business Data \nAs global businesses gear up to utilize the novel smart data discovery and Augmented Analytics platforms in 2018, the most difficult problem is always the massive volumes of data. In traditional BI & Analytics systems, 80 percent of this data remained unused or underutilized, thereby severely restricting the usefulness of the analytics systems. Now with hosted BI platforms and IoT devices pouring out diverse types of data, advanced data cataloging tools are required to access data from many different sources. Read the ZDNet article titled Data to Decisions: New Trends in Leveraging Analytics , to understand how the businesses have planned to face the data volume challenge. \nChallenge 2: Limitations of ML-Powered Predictive Models \nAccording to the The Forrester Wave\u2122: Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning Solutions, Q1 2017 , Data Scientists in 2017 required tools to develop ML-powered, predictive models, and a platform to manage the models. Though these BI platforms gained popularity among the data professionals, no one ever thought that these tools had the potential to replace the human Data Scientists, and make way for Self-Service BI. That said, as businesses continue to depend on Self-Service BI & Analytics enabled by Big Data, Cloud, IoT, and Predictive Analytics tools for all types of decision-making, Self-Service Analytics platforms with superior data visualization capabilities will gain momentum in 2018. \nAccording to the blog post titled What Does Business Intelligence Look Like in 2018? , organizations are slated to embrace the \u201cself-service\u201d BI, but of course with more governance, so that business users have more control over the data they analyze. \nAugmented Data Preparation and Augmented Analytics \nBoth Augmented Data Preparation and Augmented Analytics are designed to empower the citizen Data Scientist with tools that go beyond data discovery, and helps prepare business data in a manner which facilitates \u201cstrategic, operational and tactical activities\u201d for future business planning. With Augmented Data Preparation, common business users will be able to test the data against particular hypotheses without the help of IT staff. On the other hand, Augmented Analytics will deliver insights through advanced ML-enabled tools. The ultimate goals of these two novel technologies are to rapidly increase user adoption and enhance data awareness. Get the full story in DATAVERSITY\u00ae\u2019s What is Augmented Analytics and Why Does it Matter? \nBusiness Analytics Landscape in 2018: The Top Trends Given the two major challenges just described for the future generation of BI and analytics, here is a round-up 2018 Business Intelligence and Analytics trends, as confirmed by reliable industry literature: Augmented Data Preparation will gain popularity among the business users as they will be able to pursue data-testing tasks without the help of IT staff. Data visualization, which emerged as the front runner of 2017 trends, will continue to dominate the BI platforms in 2018. Smart Data Discovery will give a tremendous impetus to predictive analytics in 2018, making it the favorite business analytics activity. With the passion for going \u201cvisual,\u201d citizen Data Scientists or mainstream business users will depend on mobile analytics in 2018 for day-to-day decision making. Augmented analytics will be a sought-after capability for mainstream BI users. The larger organizations will heavily invest in building an in-house BI/analytics platform. \nThe blog post titled Business Intelligence (BI) Trends to look forward to in 2018 describes these impending trends very well. In DATAVERSITY\u00ae\u2019s To Get Value from Data, Data Discovery Must Come First! , the readers of this post will get a sense of the advanced statistical tools and ML capabilities of modern BI systems, which carry the promise of innovative analytical solutions. This has been possible due to the increased data awareness through superior data visualization and data understanding. \nWhile traditional BI technologies have been lacking in good data storage facilities or good data visualization tools, the modern ML-powered analytics platforms bring improved data visibility and comprehension. The new data discovery methods promise huge cost reductions and enhanced results.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

It\u2019s about as bad as you imagine \u2013 almost like the return of the SuperPoke from a decade ago. \nEssentially, the social network is now adding a bunch of variations to the \u2018Hello\u2019 greeting it quietly introduced last month for some users. In addition to saying \u2018Hello\u2019, you can now send a hug, wink, poke or high-five. These options become available when you hold the \u2018Hello\u2019 button, similar to how the additional Reactions work with the Like button. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m certainly not prepared to receive winks from people I haven\u2019t spoken to in years. \nWhen you click the notification alerting you of an incoming Greeting, you\u2019ll be taken to the sender\u2019s profile page, where you can choose to lure them into an endless Greeting loop, by responding. It never needs to end! I just got my first Facebook High-Five. pic.twitter.com/wTuDEOKcGW \n\u2014 Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) December 6, 2017 \nNow, I don\u2019t mean to sound like a cynic, but it looks like Facebook is trying to bring back a feature that became more of an annoyance than a delight to use. Pokes may have had some novelty value back in the day, but now that there are so many different ways to interact with people through social channels, this just feels like it\u2019ll add to the notification noise we\u2019re already tired of. \nI\u2019m hoping that this feature will simply perish in the test lab instead of going live across the platform. We\u2019ve already got plenty of unwanted interactions to deal with, courtesy of Facebook. \nThanks, Zuckerberg.

Grey skies, dark mornings and being cold ALL THE TIME are bad enough without all the extra stress on your mental health. \nHere are a few ways to make things easier on yourself in the Winter months. It\u2019s okay not to be super excited about Christmas \nWhen you\u2019re not feeling 100%, the last thing you want is feeling like everyone else around you is having a holly jolly Christmas. Winter time and Christmas can be really hard for some people, whether it\u2019s dealing with Seasonal Affective Disorder or difficulties around spending Christmas with your family. It\u2019s totally okay to take a step back from the festivities and make extra time for self-care. Choose handmade \nChristmas shouldn\u2019t be a competition over who can spend more. It shouldn\u2019t wrack you with fear searching for a Secret Santa present. You shouln\u2019t feel panicked about getting THE BEST gift. Christmas isn\u2019t about money, it\u2019s about whatever you want it to be about, whether that\u2019s spending time with family, friends, religion, whatever. You do you. \nIt can be really hard when everyone seems to be Christmas shopping from the start of November but instead why not give a handmade gift or something sentimental over something expensive. Getting into debt for Christmas is never worth it and who doesn\u2019t love a handmade gift anyway? Ignore the food guilt \nWe all reach for the carbs a little more in Winter than in the warmer months and maybe that means the scales go up a teeny bit, but what you\u2019re not going to do is beat yourself up for it. \nTry and get some exercise each day if you can and stay hydrated if you\u2019re drinking alcohol. Invest in a SAD lamp \nIf you struggle with getting up in a morning and feel like your mood is impossible to lift in Winter, maybe it\u2019s time to invest in a sad lamp. I have the Lumie Bodyclock Starter 30 Wake-Up Light Alarm Clock with Sunrise and Sunset Features and it\u2019s changed the Winter months for me so much. \nI love that the light starts half an hour before I have to get up so sleepy little me can get used to it before I open my eyes and I also set it before I go to bed so that the light goes out gradually and I feel much more able to relax before bedtime. \nWhat do you do to look after your mental health in winter?

Upon arriving, the troopers couldn\u2019t find any evidence of a home invasion and Vars was the only one there, according to an online dispatch. \nUpon further investigation, troopers found that Vars was out on felony probation or parole for a charge of assault in the third degree on the conditions of not consuming controlled substances or possessing a firearm. He had a handgun and had used a controlled substance, according to the dispatch. \n\u201cNo signs of a home invasion were found at the residence and consumption of a controlled substance is suspected to be a factor,\u201d the dispatch states. \nVars was taken to Wildwood Correctional Complex\u2019s pretrial facility in Kenai and remanded on several probation or parole violations and charged with one count of misconduct involving weapons in the third degree, a class C felony, and one count of misconduct involving weapons in the fourth degree, a class A misdemeanor. He was scheduled to be arraigned at the Kenai Courthouse at 10 a.m. Wednesday. \nThe violation of probation charge is related to a 2012 case in Anchorage in which he was originally charged with 13 crimes, including kidnapping, assault in the third degree and coercion, but the majority of which were dismissed by the prosecution when he pleaded guilty to one charge of assault in the third degree in 2013.

Now to prep the front and the base, i know a drum sander is ideal, but as i don't have one, i'll probably run a sander over the top (might buy a couple of the progrip type clamps for this).\nMy main question is how you sand the internal cuts... do you do this by hand or do you use a dremmel tool or similar? For my Name Plaque, I should be able to get away with sanding by hand, but when i eventually move on to more intricate pieces, how do i sand those?\nThanks in advance,\nDibs \u200bComing Up With Complex Solutions to Non-Existent Problems Since 1985", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://d1r5wj36adg1sk.cloudfront.net/images/icons/icon1.png"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:06.051+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5768cf142288e6a71f6ce9b3526929ec68d8971d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg89XGkb7wsnqDxs.J4m7vkF8UxV9jkxBlITQmg775F2S0nFW5hwrg9DNgrg3Y2Dbc7uyUPKFVxPhQO36tOmqerY", "site_full": "www.woodworkforums.com", "site": "woodworkforums.com", "site_section": "http://www.woodworkforums.com/f161", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "scuba_diving", "sports", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "painting"], "section_title": "WOODWORKING FORUMS - GENERAL", "title": "Name Plaques", "title_full": "Name Plaques", "published": "2017-05-07T04:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3448e119742e30b48fca3e711aff0a9afcf7d2d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg89XGkb7wsnqDxs.J4m7vkF8UxV9jkxBlITQmg775F2S0nFW5hwrg9DNgrg3Y2Dbc7uyUPKFVxPhXBzBOFVrctH4BMQDZ4jA28A6ZDQy8N9rA--", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Dibbers", "published": "2017-12-07T09:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Originally Posted by pawoods Hi Dibs ,When I make these I usually do not need to sand them at all.I find the finish using just the blades is very smooth ,occasionally i might have a small ridge where i start & finish the cut but a light sanding will get rid of this. but if you want to sand them you can make your own files with sand paper glued to small pieces of wood ,paddle pop sticks etc. or buy a set of needle files.If you have any what they call fuzzies on the underside of the project I usually burn them off with a gas torch but only if that side is not showing as you might have a few light scorch marks. Cheers Peter Oh brilliant!

Android Oreo (Go edition) is an optimised experience for smartphones supporting 1 GB or less of memory. Qualcomm Technologies is working with Google to enable the next wave of value-priced smartphones with a focus on speed and reliability.\nThis allows consumer flexibility as mobile users in emerging regions such as India, Southeast Asia and Africa gain access to a wider variety of Android smartphones with a more modern operating system. Mid and low-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon mobile platforms will be ready to be used by device manufacturers shortly after the latest version of Android (in this case Android 8.1 Oreo) is released to the Android Open Source Project.\n\u201cWe are excited to implement Android Oreo (Go edition) within the Qualcomm Snapdragon mobile platform family as it will enable consumers around the world to experience a more robust operating system for lower cost smartphones,\u201d said Nancy Fares, vice president of product management, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. \u201cAndroid Oreo (Go edition) delivers an optimised Android user experience key for emerging regions where lower bill of materials costs are especially attractive, as well as in established regions for pre-paid and lifeline uses.\u201d\nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) ships with a rebuilt set of Google\u2019s most popular apps that were designed from the ground up to address local needs, plus a tuned version of Google Play that allows users to download any app, but also highlights apps designed to work best on smartphones with 1 GB or less of memory. In addition, Android Oreo (Go edition) includes features to control and monitor data usage, plus the same security improvements that Google launched with Android Oreo.

The good news is, at last, they are presentable, even luxurious. New nicely-shaped packaging (oval, pebbles\u2026), original decorations, and precious formulas stand out as the end of the year approaches. Design and skincare have finally blended! There is something else in life besides 75 ml tubes, and given the frequent use we make of them in winter, there is no reason why our hand creams would make us feel ashamed! Why would they look ugly? Oval and soft touch trends They too can be highlighted with pretty decorations or new shapes, like that of Chanel , which is packed in a pretty soft touch pebble (Hand Cream, 50 ml, \u20ac49). To the age-old tube, the luxury house preferred an originally-designed, ergonomic pebble in perfect affinity with the hand which conceals a unique technical innovation that required over four years of collaboration between the Packaging Department, the Artistic Direction, and the formulation laboratory. Inside the packaging, there is a retractable pocket that contains and protects the formula. Just press the pebble to deliver the dose of cream. Use after use, the pocket retracts, but the shape memory pebble remains intact. Isolated from any contact with the outside, the formula is protected from the air and impurities, and the case remains clean. Both elegant and convenient, this perfect travel-sized cream cannot but be shown off! The content is as refined as the container: Rose de Mai and Iris pallida wax extracts, glycerine, hyaluronic acid, shea butter\u2026 And the melting texture shows an exemplary discretion in contact with daily objects. But the selective network is not the only one to offer smart packaging, as can be seen with Nivea , who are launching in supermarkets four new creams in oval packaging that instantaneously curls up in your hand and reveals as pleasant to look at as to touch. The base tip can also be put on a desk, a bedside table\u2026 Head down, the cream is always ready to be delivered (Nourishing Hand Cream with almond oil, Soft Hand Cream with shea butter, Repair & Care Cream with Dexpanthenol, 75 ml, \u20ac2.65 each; Anti-Aging Hand Cream with Q10 + UV filters, 75 ml, \u20ac3.10). The power of aromas and vintage decorations in the spotlight Made in the traditional way, the Green & Spring hand creams inspired from British Victorian gardens are decorated with birds with old-fashioned charm. They also stand out with their generous pump-bottles and aromachological fragrance (Repair & Restore, Relaxing, or Indulging Hand Cream, 300 ml, \u20ac21, on Feelunique.com). You will get the same retro look with the Red Skincare Moroccan Rose or Atlantic Kelp Hand Creams (50 ml, \u20ac17 each), or the Fresh Citron de Vigne or Honeysuckle Moisturizing Hand Creams (30 ml, \u20ac12). Sanoflore is to launch three aromatic nourishing hand creams with delicious perfumes To relax, To focus, or To invigorate (30 ml, \u20ac9.10 each, as from January). Some brands do not hesitate to claim their creams get you ready for sleep (Nourish, Breathe & Sleep Hand Balm by Neom Organics London, 50 ml, \u20ac19)! But new hand creams can also stand out with their gluten-free, vegan formulas and exclusive ingredients, like mango and nut butters in the Hand & Body Balm with argan oil by Kahina Giving Beauty (28.35 g, \u20ac48), or the konjac cream in The Nail Kitchen Hand & Nail Cream (100 ml, \u20ac22).

This reflects positively on the year-on-year sales reported by the global LiDAR market. LiDAR drones are mainly used for enhancing automation and reducing dependence on human efforts. Some of the most common applications of LiDAR drone include archaeology, mapping, precision farming, entertainment, and construction. \nBased on product type, the global LiDAR drone market can be bifurcated into fixed wing and rotary wing. Of these, the rotary wing LiDAR segment is expected to report the highest CAGR between 2016 and 2023. The robust demand that the segment has been witnessing is attributed to the compact size and cheaper price of rotary wing LiDAR as compared to fixed wing LiDAR. Additionally, the design of rotary wing LiDAR enables easy access to confined specs such as bridges and pipeline, due to which it is preferred for monitoring and inspection applications. A rotary wing LiDAR can fly both horizontally and vertically. It can also hover in a fixed position, which makes it best suited for high resolution video capturing and aerial photography. \nThe report provides a comprehensive analysis of the various factors that will have a positive impact on the global LiDAR market. An overview of major restraints threatening the market\u2019s growth is also included in the report. To present insights into the prevailing vendor landscape, the report also includes the profiles of the leading companies operating in the market. \nGlobal LiDAR Drone Market: Key Opportunities and Threats \nThe global LiDAR market is also significantly gaining from the rising demand for laser scanners. These scanners exhibit high wavelength and are used for making clear 3D models for surveyed areas. Based on application, the corridor mapping segment has emerged dominant in the market due to rapid urbanization and increasing construction of highways, roadways, and railways. \nFill the form for an exclusive sample of this report @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=12155 \nDespite witnessing positive growth opportunities worldwide, the lack of skilled pilots is hampering the global LiDAR market to an extent. Unlike pilots for conventional aircrafts, drone pilots are required to ensure reliability of the entire system, which includes ground station, vehicle, and communication equipment. While drones do not carry passengers or on-board pilots, any human error while operating a drone could still prove disastrous. \nDrone systems mainly rely more on autopilot, radio transmission, and computer technology than conventional airplanes. Hence, operating and maneuvering drones require a greater degree of knowledge and expertise because the accident rate in drones is much higher than in manned aircrafts. However, this issue can be resolved by designing advanced drones. \nGlobal LiDAR Drone Market: Regional Outlook \nRegionally, the Asia Pacific market has been exhibiting attractive prospects for vendors operating in the global LiDAR drone market. Increasing awareness of customers regarding the benefits offered by LiDAR drones such as low cost, high accuracy, and government support are key factors fuelling demand for LiDAR drones in Asia Pacific. The regional market is also benefitted by the increasing adoption of LiDAR drones in countries such as India, Japan, and China. \nGlobal LiDAR Drone Market: Competitive Insight \nTo study the prevailing vendor landscape in the market, the report has profiled companies such as Phoenix Aerial Systems, Velodyne LiDAR, Inc., Leica Geosystems AG, and others. Among these companies, Velodyne LiDAR holds a major share in the market and has played a significant role in promoting LiDAR drones worldwide. The report presents an in-depth analysis of the strategies adopted by these companies. Their strengths and weaknesses are studied and insights are presented into the threats and opportunities that these companies could face during the forecast period.

Raymond Joshua Chimaobi Chimnonso Ekwu, your mummy is absolutely distraught without you still. Our home is so silent now without you. Every time I still peep into your room to see if you're there. When I drive back home, I long to see your smiling face radiating that joy of seeing me back. Cooking has lost it's joy because you're not there to ask all those questions: mummy what are you cooking now? What's that? Why do you put that? Mummy please can I stir the contents of what you're cooking? Can I get a piece of meat? No more will I hear you say: mummy my sleep mode is not activated yet when I say: Chimnonso go to sleep right now! No one to ask me: mummy how come am getting pimples on my face and you don't have? And I have to answer: Joshua, you're in your puberty years and becoming a young man? h my son, my baby, the most considerate child, my six feet four inches ( 6ft, 4 inches tall ) adorable giant, I miss you .\nBe that as it may, I want to use this medium to wholeheartedly appreciate God, the eternal rock of ages, the all-knowing emperor of the universe, the pillar of my life, for it all.

The facility would be the second in Manchester, joining the Factory Youth Zone in Harpurhey (pictured). \nUnder the proposals, which will be considered during a meeting on 13 December, the council would contribute 20% of the annual running costs of the facility for up to three years from 2020, plus capital support of \u00a31.2 million. \nAn initial \u00a36m in funding for the project has been provisionally pledged by an individual philanthropist who wishes to support the social development of young people in Manchester. \nLand for   facility would be provided by the council for a peppercorn rent, on a long-term lease. \nCouncillor Luthfur Rahman, executive member for schools, culture and leisure, says: \u201cBuilding on the success of the Factory Youth Zone, the proposed new Youth Zone for Gorton has the potential to help young people from across central and east Manchester as they develop into adulthood, providing a world-class facility where quality educational and recreational opportunities will be available to them seven days a week. \n\u201cMaking this investment in the future of our young people will strengthen the regeneration of east Manchester, while providing young Mancunians with new opportunities to express themselves creatively, raise their aspirations and develop their talents.\u201d \nKathryn Morley, chief executive for OnSide Youth Zones, adds: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted that these proposals are being considered by Manchester City Council, along with the support already shown by generous philanthropic individuals. \n\u201cOur innovative and sustainable financial model has been replicated in many towns and cities   hope that permission for the East Manchester Youth Zone will be another successful chapter in supporting young people who deserve access to even more services which encourage and develop employability skills and a healthier, more active lifestyle.\u201d Related posts:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gorton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathryn morley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luthfur rahman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "manchester city council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyde road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harpurhey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "queensland road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youth zone", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:11.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a338509a5b70e111faaee6cf42e31fbc55ab1410", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj16JfG7tME857oqwGjf4Ey_MgF5LTiRwTrFeOHt.10bB2z6HbVZRUwR8.rTUzhbMkL_Tv6fUIB2AVjewsgjXhIm.aDo_oOpy5QUK2Hbh5kaHuFWXWrxV4Zg-", "site_full": "forums.wynncraft.com", "site": "wynncraft.com", "site_section": "https://forums.wynncraft.com/forums/wynncraft.70/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "Wynncraft | Wynncraft Forums", "title": "What Are The Worst Ids You've Ever Gotten On An Item?", "title_full": "What Are The Worst Ids You've Ever Gotten On An Item?

IMAGE: The BJP has made the mistake of thinking that the BJP and Modi are the same. Gujarat loves Modi, but the same can't be said of the BJP, says Jigar Patel. Photograph: Kind courtesy @narendramodi/Twitter In 2014 when Narendra D Modi was elected prime minister of India, Jigar Patel , an engineer, was elated. He believed in Modi's promise of more jobs, better governance and ' achche din '. \nof late, the engineer, who is in his mid-30s, is unhappy with the PM. \nHe tells Rediff.com 's Syed Firdaus Ashraf why this Gujarat election is all about teaching the BJP a lesson. Two years ago everything happened all of a sudden for me. My surname 'Patel' was suddenly splashed on the front pages of newspapers and hogged headlines everywhere. \nThis change occurred when Hardik Patel began his agitation seeking reservation for Patels in education and government jobs. \nThe demand was justified because we, as Patels, had always supported the BJP. Therefore, we felt this party would not betray us in our demands. \nUnfortunately, as events unfolded I realised that the BJP was not doing justice to Patels. \nDuring the agitation, 14 Patels died in police firing. No action was taken against the policemen. The only action taken by the BJP then was against then chief minister Anandiben Patel who many believe was pressured into resigning her post. \nTwo years have passed and I am still to see any action being taken against the policemen. Now, I believe the BJP has taken the Patel vote for granted. \nThe Patel community stood by the BJP like a rock, but have only been getting empty promises from them. GUJARAT ELECTION: FULL COVERAGE I am not voting for the BJP. My vote will go to anyone who is opposing the BJP, not necessarily the Congress party. \nThe BJP has made the mistake of thinking that Modi and the BJP are the same. The people of Gujarat love Modi, not the BJP. \nIn case Modi forms a new party, the people of Gujarat will vote for him. But the same can't be said for the BJP. \nThis time, if you notice, all the Patels are saying that they will vote for the Congress to defeat the BJP as this party has done injustice to the Patels. \nThe condition of Patel farmers has been the same for the past five years. Despite big talk about the Gujarat model of development, these people have seen no improvement in their lives. IMAGE: 'The Patel, who was a powerful entity in the village, is today powerless.'Hardik Patel, the face of the Patel agitation, at an election rally. Photograph: Amit Dave/Reuters The entire Gujarat development model has been concentrated on constructing big highways and not on creating jobs. \nAnd before someone talks of the development that the state witnessed under Modi's regime in Gujarat, all of it was restricted to big cities such as Ahmedabad, Surat and Rajkot. \nEven a city like Vadodara only saw development when Modi became prime minister in 2014. \nVillages in Gujarat are completely untouched by the 'development model'. There is a crisis of jobs among the rural youth. \nYoungsters in rural Gujarat have moved away from villages to the big cities and are jobless or are doing odd jobs. \nThere is no stability of income for the youth of rural Gujarat. There is sufficient water and electricity for farming, but crop-related issues are yet to be solved by the BJP. The government has failed miserably in trying to control the prices of seeds and pesticides. \nAnd to make the situation even worse for farmers is the fact that the middlemen reap all the profits, leaving nothing for the farmers. It was only in 2016 that the BJP started providing a minimum support price to farmers. \nThe Patel farmers in Gujarat face huge burdens of debt. For instance, the compound wall of my neighbour's house in my village collapsed three years ago. However, he is unable to repair it as he has no money. \nModi should have solved these problems, but he and his government in the state continue to ignore the plight of the farmers. The Patel, who was a powerful entity in the village, is today powerless. \nWhen it comes to education too, the Patels are not receiving any benefits. \nEven after securing more than 90 per cent in schools, they are unable to get into colleges of their choice. \nTen years ago, I secured 70 per cent, but I did not get computer engineering though I stayed in south Gujarat. I had to go to north Gujarat to do my engineering. \nThis was not the case for my other friends who had OBC ( other backward class ) certificates. They got admission in south Gujarat whereas I had to travel to north Gujarat. \nThe Congress will not make a difference in the life of a Patel, but only to teach the BJP a lesson we will vote against it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "patel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narendra d modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hardik patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syed firdaus ashraf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jigar patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anandiben patel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bj", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rediff.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patels", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ahmedabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vadodara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:11.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f934504f96a12b5aec7aff01a7aa9bee361d5fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAihgeQ__4G6NqKwDcOBSO8xg-", "site_full": "groups.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=categories/gmail/share-and-discuss-with-others", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Gmail Help Forum - Google Product Forums", "title": "Why is it my Google Account Email (primary email) suddenly changed.", "title_full": "Why is it my Google Account Email (primary email) suddenly changed. - Google Product Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "http://www.google.com/images/icons/product/groups-128.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f934504f96a12b5aec7aff01a7aa9bee361d5fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAihgeQ__4G6NqKwDcOBSO8xg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Zuhairah Zamri", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Why is it my Google Account Email (primary email) suddenly changed.", "text": "Hi,\nMy google account is created with my other email (hotmail).

Equally, there is a balancing view that the cuts in NHS funding are the driver for these changes.\u201d \nIn terms of stroke care, the report said all groups \u201cfelt that provision of hyperacute and acute services at Sunderland Royal Hospital and South Tyneside District Hospital were the only equitable options, perhaps better defined as \nstatus quo plus.\u201d \nOn children\u2019s and maternity services, it referred to several \u201cclear overall concerns\u201d with the proposals. \nIt said: \u201cChild birth is seen a not a simple, prescriptive event for anyone and reducing services would be to the detriment of the residents of South Tyneside, introducing a perceived unnecessary and unacceptable risk. \n\u201cTransporting a mother in labour independently to Sunderland was felt to have the potential for detrimental effects.\u201d \nIt continued: \u201cChildren get sick 24 hours a day, seven days a week and an appropriate inclusive service needs to reflect that an illness or condition that starts off not being an emergency with a child can quickly become life-threatening. \n\u201cThe options were also felt to contribute to the general downgrading of services at South Tyneside, particularly for a group as vulnerable as children and young people.\u201d \nFeedback was gathered through public events, from surveys, focus groups and submissions. \nA feedback session on the draft report will be held at The Clervaux Exchange in Jarrow where people will be able to hear from the analysts who put together the report. \nThe session will be held on Monday from 6-8pm. \nAnother session will be held at Hope Street Xchange, on Tuesday from 10am to 12 noon. \nPeople can register a place on Eventbrite or the links via www.pathtoexcellence.org.uk. \nMeanwhile, the next meeting of the Joint Health Scrutiny Committee will discuss formal feedback from the Path to Excellence when it meets at Sunderland Civic Centre on Tuesday at 2pm.

But I THINK that a small problem is turning into a BIG problem.\nI have been living Thailand for the past 3 years staying here on OA visas. My current OA visa expires May 2018. I have left Thailand on 2 occasions since may 2018 and all was well.. multiples entry OA visa. My most recent ENTRY stamp is/was wrong it was stamped for a 30 day stay which expires December 9! I am leaving from Surat Thani via DMK next week to Japan... I went to my local immigration office .. I live in Khanom Nahko si Thamorat...today thinking I was being proactive a \"good man\".\nThe officer not only refused to help me one iota but he also threatened me with a 6.000 baht fine because I had forgotten to update my address via a TM47. Now I have TWO problems. However I rent a house here and my landlord has, in the past, he has updated my address..is the really HIS responsibility or mine? I was refused any help at all and direct to go to BKK where \"they made the mistake\".\nQUESTION... do I really have to travel to BKK to fix this by law... or by law is any immigration supposed to be able to fix this mistake? I mean, after Dec 9th I am here illegally because my passport is stamped dec 9 leave by date and yet I have an OA visa that says leave by May 2017. Which of these takes precedence?? I am thinking of going to the immigration people at Surat Thani city to fix this.. am I allowed to do this if I live in NST.. my wife does have family in Surat and I suppose I stay there a few days a month too.. so that's also my house to.. ..\nI spent 3 hours driving on partially flooded roads to fix this mistake.. they said it was my responsibility to check ..I'm thinking... I don't get paid to check your stamps.,, but YOUR men do!! BTW .. I always dress up for the occasion.. jeans and real shoes 55 and a nice clean shirt.. out of respect.. and I always smile and have a relaxed demeanor.. I got zero respect in return was treated like garbage ..I also had my thai wife with me.. who tried to help.. but to no avail.\nTIA for any help offered.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:12.010+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15109285, "moreResultsAvailable": 15109185, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512640092010&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 466}
