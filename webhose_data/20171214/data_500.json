How much are the American people going to take before they replace the reckless Republicans in the next election? Low and middle-income Americans are bracing for the likely passage of a Trump-supported tax bill that deviously redistributes even more of the people\u2019s income to the richest one percent (including a big tax cut for Trump) and the unpatriotic giant corporations.\nGreased through Congress with the support of Republican mega-donors, over the inept opposition of the Democrats who astonishingly offered no tax plan of their own, this tax legislation does exactly the opposite of what House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and their prevaricator-in-chief, Donald Trump, are declaring.\nNamely, this utterly complex brew of greed and handouts for the super-rich gives a gut punch to the masses, including people making below $30,000. Far from a tax cut the Republicans are trying to Peddle to the people, the Senate bill is projected to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over ten years to pay for the huge tax cuts enriching the corporate plutocrats who are laughing all the way to the bank. Such unsustainable losses in revenue sets the stage for cutting Medicare, Medicaid and other critical services to vulnerable Americans, with Republicans using the ballooning deficit they created as their excuse.\nSlashing and burning in every direction, this legislation endangers the financial security of regular Americans of every age, every occupation and, by ending many deductions for local sales and income taxes, hurting state and local budgets.\nRyan and McConnell undermined the integrity of the legislative process by banning public hearings on this tax legislation in the House and Senate. In doing so, they denied the American people, including honest tax experts, the opportunity to adequately examine these dangerous proposals, especially the huge giveaways to multinational corporations at the expense of working class families. No Congress has ever gone this far. If this shameless lack of transparency proves successful, Congressional Republicans will succeed in driving Capitol Hill further under the dictatorship of the oligarchs, using the people\u2019s delegated power against them.\nTo make matters worse, Senate Republicans prevented their Democratic colleagues from even seeing clean portions of the bill until just before the final vote at 1:25 am on Saturday, December 2. When faced with such hyper-partisan foul play, the Democrats should have shut the Senate down with a sit-in until they were given a reasonable amount of time to read this raid on the regular taxpayers, before the final vote.\nHere are some malicious items from the House and Senate bills:\n1. The Senate bill widens the double standard of favoring corporations over individuals, with a top corporate tax rate of 20% compared to a highest tax rate of 38% for individuals. Such blatant corporate favoritism shows which \u201cpeople\u201d the Republican Congress truly represents. Chalk one up for corporate supremacy for further inequality.\n2. The House bill retains business entertainment deductions for hard liquor but takes away deductions from teachers who use their own money to buy needed classroom materials for their students, along with taxing fellowships for graduate students.\n3. The Senate bill repeals the individual mandate for buying health insurance, setting the stage for higher health insurance premiums and 13 million more people going without health insurance over the next ten years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n4. The House bill repeals the medical expense deduction used by millions of ailing citizens. The Senate bill does not.\n5. The House phases out the estate tax, while the Senate bill exempts more rich people from that tax, which only applied to less than 5000 estates a year, according to the Tax Policy Center. These measures were vigorously opposed by 400 very rich Americans, in a public letter to Congress and by another responsible organization called Patriotic Millionaires.\n6. There is a new tax on university and college endowments and tax breaks for parents to send their elementary students to private schools. And this massive piece of legislation is full of escape hatches, such as credits, for preferred vested interests in commercial arenas. Cash register politics.\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that beginning in 2021 taxpayers with incomes of only $10,000 to $30,000 will be worse off, paying nearly $6 billion more in taxes. The Committee also concluded that by 2027, taxes will go up for taxpayers with income below $75,000 by over $27 billion.\nIncrease a standard deduction here, get rid of an exemption there, cause the increase in deductibles for health insurance policies here, but decrease deductibles used by consumers there \u2013 this cruel deception produces a mind shattering complexity and bonanza for accountants and lawyers.\nThe last minute gifts to monied interests emerged as usual from the darkness at the last minute \u2013 what the New York Times called \u201cLast-Minute Breaks for Developers, Banks and Oil Industry\u201d plus tax breaks for offshore profits by the likes of Pfizer, Google and Apple, lower taxes for the top one percent, benefits for car dealers and other goodies for people dealing with speculative security derivatives on Wall Street.\nThe Republican leadership justifies everything they are doing to the powerless people back home by claiming the tax bill will increase wages, investment and economic growth. This trickery could spark the voters to say \u201cenough\u201d and send the Republican scoundrels packing.\nDozens of impartial experts laugh at the fanciful Republican predictions about the \u201cbenefits\u201d of the tax bill, citing historical evidence, and the existing economic growth, enabled by low inflation and low interest rates.\nNothing was more embarrassing for Donald Trump and the Republicans than when Gary Cohn, Trump\u2019s chief economic advisor, asked a business audience how many of them would increase jobs and wages due to what he called this \u201ctax reform.\u201d Almost nobody raised a hand.\nThe corporate bosses in the audience knew what the Republicans don\u2019t want us to know. These big companies are already neck-deep in massive uninvested capital, so they\u2019re wasting trillions of dollars on stock buybacks which don\u2019t produced any jobs. They don\u2019t need more tax breaks for any more capital.\nIt is time for a voter\u2019s revolt!\nTell your members of Congress there is still time to reject the Republican attack on the working class. A shift of just two more votes in the senate (e.g. Senators McCain, Collins and Flake) will defeat the existing legislation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gary cohn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul ryan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tax policy center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pfizer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congressional republicans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joint committee on taxation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicaid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congressional budget office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:10.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5ddbe7df814ffea2130a2402aa95e1a149536388", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg99Jre0rzFBa6MgjL8Nx4jVDgM.ZVn6ElJWDUX1mEqGYtQi6nHXNl0TgaSB3Pv9HSULdBUy9mkDVlRS8qBCAH3r7pwe6qf1pGD3806Q8guwUgwHGa_ewc5o7xi.Go4YAdpZoMZIOyG7pw--", "site_full": "www.newsr.in", "site": "newsr.in", "site_section": "http://www.newsr.in/latest/Science.htm", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Science: newsR", "title": "Trump administration revokes ban on imported elephant trophies", "title_full": "Trump administration revokes ban on imported elephant trophies - newsR", "published": "2017-12-06T23:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.newsserve.net/700/t/20171207/8063f9480a7c76d06d6004d6ed9cd01f.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5ddbe7df814ffea2130a2402aa95e1a149536388", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg99Jre0rzFBa6MgjL8Nx4jVDgM.ZVn6ElJWDUX1mEqGYtQi6nHXNl0TgaSB3Pv9HSULdBUy9mkDVlRS8qBCAH3r7pwe6qf1pGD3806Q8guwUgwHGa_ewc5o7xi.Go4YAdpZoMZIOyG7pw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsr.in", "published": "2017-12-06T23:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "Trump administration revokes ban on imported elephant trophies", "text": "Thursday, 7 December 2017 ( 8 hours ago )\nThe US Fish and Wildlife Service has reversed the ban on elephant parts from Zimbabwe and Zambia, saying it will help fund conservation.

Greeted me like a long lost friend, haha. \nAnd believe me I was stressing out so much about that second delivery \u2013 I mean, God forbid, what if they didn\u2019t turn up and I\u2019m holding a Book Signing???? k! I can\u2019t sign a book without the book! But, bless his cotton socks, he turned up with loads and loads of shiny pretty books for me to marvel over. A hero, forevermore.\nSo yes, my planned Book Launch/Signing is safely going ahead on the 16th. The only thing I have to worry about is making sure I have enough champagne! The real kind and the pretend kind for those that need to stay sober. As for me, I plan on having two, yes TWO glasses! Lol. A bit of a risk because I\u2019m a cheap drunk\u2026two glasses of anything and I\u2019m done \u2013 but considering its being held at my home, I don\u2019t have to drive anywhere and the only thing at risk will be my autograph! I got my pen license many moons ago but tipsy writing is still risky \u2013 gonna have to handle those loopy cursives verrrr carefully. \n(Community service warning: don\u2019t drink and scribe) \nI really wish I could invite all of you to this book launch but I know you will be with me in spirit. I had to hold it here because at this time of year, every venue I tried was booked solid. So, I\u2019m opening my house for three hours and hopefully all will go well. I will probably hold another one next year at a bigger venue, like perhaps our local library. Or somewhere else\u2026we shall see.\nI can confirm that I was not tipsy when I signed a book today and sent it on its way to Norway. I promise. **hiccups delicately.\nMeanwhile\u2026\u2026the mysteries of Amazon\u2026\u2026\nI have discovered that there seems to be numerous Amazon sites around the world and reviews left on, for example, the German Amazon won\u2019t be seen on the USA one. Or the Australian one. Like\u2026..why not??? Why wouldn\u2019t the reviews go against the book, regardless of the country? Or do I have to continually go to each amazon site to read the reviews? I\u2019m finding that to be quite time consuming. I hope that maybe after a certain amount of time, all the reviews get collated onto one site otherwise this will drive me nuts. Such a mystery, that system of theirs\u2026 Ahhh well, it\u2019s another thing I\u2019ve been learning on this magical literary tour.\nOnce again, THANK YOU to each and every one of you who have been leaving reviews. I read them all and I love the feedback. Reviews help other potential readers who may be looking at my book so every word is helpful. Thank you for taking the time to do them and keep it up! It\u2019s addictive for me, I must admit.\nIf any of you are on Goodreads, please leave a review there too or put it on your shelf and recommend it. I\u2019m on there now, so come connect with me there. And, I STILL think my book makes a great Christmas gift. (Maybe not for your 96year old grandma unless she\u2019s a spritely 96 who could out-swear a sailor. Just saying\u2026.)\nDon\u2019t forget to let me know if you have favourite bits or scenes. Until next time\u2026.\nAs always, much love\nZelly ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "god", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zelly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norway", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:11.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c938e2c336d7187c8ee6b4d8811ae17c229df263", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kltitvMrFnH7H5dUHlkH4wQI53PSxl38YhOfqMdksWLZ9RGKgP48nOHajYbXH1kR_ZQL1shrPOyRoovZ_Sjz3jQJbEblgkmwLDHufDpcECb3CqEJbtcsi", "site_full": "www.seabreeze.com.au", "site": "seabreeze.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.seabreeze.com.au/forums/Windsurfing/New-South-Wales", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "New South Wales -

December 7, 2017 \nGerman football legend Lothar Matthaus has claimed that Philippe Coutinho is being played in a wrong position for Liverpool. \nCoutinho has shown his versatility under the management of Jurgen Klopp and has transformed into arguably one of the best playmakers in World football. \nThe Brazil international has been largely deployed on the left of a front three alongside Roberto Firmino, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. He does however play further back when on international duty with Brazil. \nBarcelona are interested in recruiting Coutinho in the near future and see him as a perfect successor to Andres Iniesta who is now entering the latter years of his career. \n\u201cPhilippe Coutinho is the leader of this Liverpool side, the player who can make the difference at the highest level,\u201d Matthaus wrote in his column for The Sun . \n\u201cThat\u2019s why Barcelona wanted him when they lost Neymar to PSG. Brazilian Coutinho is really important for Klopp\u2019s system but I think he is at his best playing somewhat deeper. \n\u201cIf he is slightly off the front line, he will get more time and that makes him more dangerous. \n\u201cDefensively, you have to get at Coutinho as the ball arrives. You cannot afford to let him control it because then it is too late. \n\u201cHe will open you up with a run or a pass, so all you can try to do is block off his angles. But even then he can kill you with one pass and decide a game.\u201d SHARE", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name":

Plenty of songs from all sorts of eras, heard in various media, and I love them all. I hope you like the ranking and comment on it!\n#10. \"Every Breath You Take\" - The Police\nKicking off my top 10 with my favorite song from The Police, \"Every Breath You Take\". I have many fond memories of this song, from various performances of it on talent competition shows, listening to it in the summer of 2008 every time I walked to my driver's ed class (my instructor lived within walking distance of where I live) and just listening to it for the heck of it. Everybody knows this song, and I got back into the song again after hearing it in the final scene of the season 2 finale of the Netflix show Stranger Things , which has many homages to the 1980's. Sting sings this incredibly and it has a great sound to it, even though the lyrics are stalkerish. I don't let that bother me and it will forever be my favorite song from The Police.\n#9. \"How to Save a Life\" - The Fray\nGrey's Anatomy version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHNy-znJP-Y\nThe Fray make their first of two appearances on this throwback list with one of their biggest hits, \"How to Save a Life\", which is one of my favorite songs from my high school years. This song is on my workout playlist, and you might think it's an odd choice for a playlist like that, but hear me out. I actually enjoyed working out in high school, and they usually had the radio playing in the room where the cardio machines were (they also had Dance Dance Revolution in there and once my teacher let me skip the regular activity and just play DDR the whole time), and I heard this song more than once on the radio there, and it actually gave me a good rhythm for working out, so when I bought this song on iTunes again officially, I added it to my workout playlist for the nostalgia factor. I fell in love with this song around the time it was used on Grey's Anatomy (and it was also around the time I started watching Grey's), and naturally in their musical episode, the cast sang it, and I enjoyed that version of the song and linked it below for your listening pleasure.\n#8. \"Chasing Cars\" - Snow Patrol\nSpeaking of Grey's Anatomy, another song that was featured on the show, Snow Patrol's \"Chasing Cars\", comes in at #8 on this ranking. But that is not the reason why I got back into the song. More on that to come. Anyway, this was probably Snow Patrol's biggest hit (\"Run\" was a hit too, but moreso the Leona Lewis version) and it's definitely a beautiful song that I love to listen to. And now for the reason I got back into this song: Mark Jansen and Elena Davies. Someone made a nice little tribute to them after Elena's eviction from Big Brother this summer to a cover of the song, and it was the sweetest video in the world. I have friends who did videos for them and I wish I had their skills, but I show my support for them in other ways. Anyway, to see the video, click https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMVpoCyoGAw. You may need to sign in to view the video, but I hope you enjoy it. It has over 5 million views right now, and it's well deserved since it's a beautiful and sweet video.\n#7. \"Mean\" - Taylor Swift\nTaylor Swift's anti-bullying anthem is my favorite song from Speak Now . I think everyone can relate to the message of the song. Taylor actually wrote this song about a critic who criticized her performance with Stevie Nicks at the Grammys, but it definitely can be related to any situation when someone's not being very nice. I've been bullied from elementary school to high school, both in real life and online, and it was never fun to deal with. I wish this song came out sooner since I dedicate it to all my haters. I did love her Grammys performance of the song where she changed one of the final lines of the song to Someday I'll be singing this at the Grammys , and the audience loved it too. Just a fun and sassy song that's got a great message to it.\n#6. \"You Got It (The Right Stuff)\" - New Kids on the Block\nI mentioned at the beginning of these rankings that another NKOTB song would be appearing on these rankings, and here it is! \"You Got It (The Right Stuff)\" is my favorite song of theirs, and this was the song I requested to have played at my cousin's wedding, but the DJ didn't have it, so I had him play \"Hangin' Tough\" instead. It has such a fun and catchy sound to it and I still listen to this all the time. I've been begging Steven to use this song in his redux (I begged for season 3 winner Josiah Smith to sing it since it's exactly his genre, but he didn't listen to me), but no luck so far. Hopefully someday though since it's an amazing song. I have this on quite a few playlists, including my workout playlist, and one of my new friends from the program I'm in suggested one of their more recent songs to add to that list, so I did. Another fun/guilty pleasure thing I have to share with y'all is from season 24 of Dancing With the Stars. The top 8 theme was boy band vs girl group, and the team dances were inspired by some of the most popular groups in their genres. The male contestants were all on one team, and their dance was a freaking hot mess, but the only reason I liked it was because they included this song in their routine since I feel NKOTB are underappreciated when it comes to boy bands. Click https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glll-Ls7KEQ to watch the dance. Featured here are David Ross, Bonner Bolton, Rashad Jennings and Nick Viall, along with their partners Lindsay Arnold, Sharna Burgess, Emma Slater and Peta Murgatroyd, respectively. On the subject of NKOTB, I did order a shirt with the group on it on Saturday, and I'm hoping it ships soon since I need some new clothes to wear.\n#5. \"All You Wanted\" - Michelle Branch\nMichelle Branch manages to crack the top 5 with my favorite song from her The Spirit Room album, and also my favorite song of hers overall, \"All You Wanted\". It's such a beautiful song and it has a great sound to it. I got back into this because Rose, one of two rock contestants in season 3 of Steven's redux, sang this for the third week of the semifinals and I remembered how much I loved the song, so I downloaded it. I have this on a few playlists that I cycle through regularly so this gets plenty of airplay on my phone. I'm so glad Michelle is back with new music, and one of her new songs will be appearing on my main countdown.\n#4. \"Over My Head (Cable Car)\" - The Fray\nThe Fray make another appearance on this countdown with my favorite song of theirs, \"Over My Head (Cable Car)\". Lead singer Isaac Slade wrote this song about a falling out he had with his brother, Caleb, and after it became a hit, they reconciled. This has an emotional sound to it and it's definitely a great song from the guys that I've loved for years. I got back into it because of this past season of Dancing With the Stars. For the \"most memorable year\" week, Sasha Pieterse did a foxtrot to this song with Gleb Savchenko to commemorate her ending the chapter of being on Pretty Little Liars , and getting engaged to her longtime boyfriend Hudson. This was probably my favorite dance Sasha did since I loved the meaning behind it, and it inspired me to buy the song on iTunes so I had it in my library again. Click https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KwO7uax2zA to see the dance. And before I wrap up this writeup, I want to share a bonus video from my karaoke days. Two of the guys that I had become friends with through the community at the bar I used to go to for karaoke sang this song as a duet together and I loved it. I may be biased since I had a crush on the guy who doesn't wear glasses, and he also had the same name as someone I was interested in for a long time, but I loved it and had to record it. Click http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xjtb0v to see the video. I apologize for the poor lighting, but it was always pretty dark in the bar when I went there.\n#3. \"You Belong With Me\" - Taylor Swift\nThe final song in my Taylor Swift throwback is my favorite song from Fearless , \"You Belong With Me\". I went back and forth with this song and \"Love Story\" as my favorite song from this album, but ultimately, \"You Belong With Me\" won out. I think every girl can relate to liking a guy who's dating someone who's completely wrong for them and they wish they could be with them instead. I dealt with that many times over the years and it's really not that fun. But I do love the song and even used to dance around my room singing it, kind of like how Taylor does in the music video. Although one time I had to lip sync it since I was losing my voice due to a cold. It was still fun though. On the subject of the music video, it was the subject of Kanye West's infamous incident at the VMAs when he interrupted Taylor in the middle of her acceptance speech for Best Female Video, declaring that Beyonc\u00e9 should have won. I definitely hated him for that, and so did everyone else, including President Obama, who called him a jackass. Beyonc\u00e9 did allow Taylor to come back and finish her speech when she won Video of the Year, which was so great of her. Anyway, this is a great song from Taylor and forever one of my favorites.\n#2. \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" - Cyndi Lauper\nOne of my favorite 80's songs, if not my very favorite, managed to reach the top 2 on this ranking. \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" is definitely one of the biggest hits of 1983 and also one of Cyndi Lauper's most well known songs, if not her signature song. Such a fun song with great, empowering lyrics to it. It's been one of my favorite songs for years, and when it came on at a dance in 8th grade I was ecstatic since it's incredible. I also have a Barbie doll somewhere that's modeled after Cyndi Lauper and is wearing the red dress she wore in this video (and also on the cover of her She's So Unusual album). You can't go wrong with this song, and there was another Dancing With the Stars dance that I loved that was set to this song. For the guilty pleasures week, Vanessa Lachey was scheduled to do a Jazz routine with Maksim Chmerkovskiy paying homage to girls nights out, but he had an \"unspecified personal issue\" to deal with, so Alan Bersten stepped in and danced with her. It was a fun dance and the lifts were incredible. Click https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eQXF7JbbGE to watch the dance. She looked like she was having a lot of fun up there.\n#1. \"She's In Love With the Boy\" - Trisha Yearwood\nAnd finally, my favorite throwback song of the year is \"She's In Love With the Boy\" from 1991. Trisha Yearwood is somewhat underrated when it comes to the big country stars (Carrie, Reba, Martina, Faith, etc) and I think she deserves some more recognition since she has some great songs, of which this was her first single. This song was originally written for Kenny Rogers, but he passed on it, so Trisha was chosen to record the song. It tells the story of teenage couple Katie and Tommy and their love story together. Katie's father doesn't approve of the relationship and almost gets violent with him when they return home late from a date, but Katie's mother comes to their defense by pointing out that her own father didn't approve of Katie's father, but she married him anyway and still loves him the same way Katie loves Tommy. I first heard this song back in 2010, when I dated a guy who went to school in Texas (we went to high school together and I knew who he was but we never really talked until we started dating) and always played country music stations in his car, so that kind of put me in a country music phase, and I loved this song immediately when I heard it on country radio. I used to sing it at karaoke too and there's probably a video on Dailymotion somewhere of me singing it. It's definitely one of my favorite songs, and I wanted it to be used for country week of Steven's redux for the reason that Trisha Yearwood deserves some more recognition, but it wasn't used, which frustrated me. But maybe in the future. Anyway, this is a great song and it's my favorite throwback song of the year!\nAnd that is the end of this throwback list! I may start my next ranking tonight if I get enough comments, but we'll see. I want to give some people a chance to catch up as well.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VZOmGOwmxw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eQXF7JbbGE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIb6AZdTr-A", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUFObCZtGWQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjVQ36NhbMk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KwO7uax2zA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbo2n2MzxxE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GemKqzILV4w", "http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xjtb0v", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMOGaugKpzs", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbIEwIwYz-c", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYa1eI1hpDE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHNy-znJP-Y", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuNIsY6JdUw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glll-Ls7KEQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMVpoCyoGAw"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:12.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e5e0c7dd9fbd03182ef53d44e8c899e62bcaf3a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRXO3aRgu7IhC6pZHz8wign5YYj4IhpJJN6OFMfqn369.kMfIjUiRXcZa6p1jAEJAk-", "site_full": "idolforums.com", "site": "idolforums.com", "site_section": "https://idolforums.com/index.php?showforum=534", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Music \u00ab idolforums.com", "title": "AngelOfMusic8908\u0092s 2017 music rankings", "title_full": "AngelOfMusic8908\u0092s 2017 music rankings :: Music \u00ab idolforums.com", "published": "2017-12-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.023, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a5f9e1ef2971aa8bfd0e6ab672938c5881fd569", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRXO3aRgu7IhC6pZHz8wign5YYj4IhpJJN6OFMfqn369.kMfIjUiRXcve5kC0Wf55ukQ5BCXV.t7Q--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "AngelOfMusic8908", "published": "2017-12-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote:\n20.

A couple of them are in Turkish, Moroccan, Chinese, Surinam, and other languages.\nThe Wall Poems project started in 1992 and was funded partly by the private Tegen-Beeld foundation of Ben Walenkamp and Jan-Willem Bruins, with additional funding coming from several corporations and the city of Leiden.

The project officially concluded in 2005 with the Spanish poem De profundis by Federico Garcia Lorca, but new poems continued to be added as recently as 2010.\n\nA wall poem in Leiden, the Netherlands.

In the Enhancing the Experience series Courtney Devereux looks into why these two different sectors are working together. \nHospitality helps the \u201ctired legacy of retailers struggling to fit in their outdated infrastructure with shoppers,\u201d by changing what the consumers expect, according to The Food Retail Group\u2019s 2012 study, Realities and fantasies of retailing. \nThe study says \u201ceating occasions\u201d drive shopping behaviour more than anything else, and that targeting consumers is about fulfilling those fixed needs. \n\u201cProducts and brands are tools to complete occasion-specific tasks, not drivers of shopping experience. Consumers orient themselves toward food, based on the cultural nature of the occasion. They make food quality choices driven by food culture, not by absolute preferences.\u201d \nThese \u2018cultural eating occasions\u2019 are defined as the single most salient cultural distinction currently driving consumer behaviour which ultimately affects every retail channel. Retailers are slowly learning that incorporating food into their offering, or sharing a retail space with a third-party food retailer, can benefit both parties through increased foot traffic \u2013 it also provides customers with a \u201cdestination\u201d retail experience. \nBut do consumers need to be tempted into retail spaces? According to Vicki Lee from Hospitality NZ, both areas will always have a certain pull to them, but are more effective at tempting consumers in when working together. \n\u201cNaturally if you are going out for lunch it\u2019s going to be the restaurant or caf\u00e9 that is the drawcard, and shopping is an add-on if it\u2019s available. Likewise, if the mission is to go shopping then that will be the pull, but it\u2019s made all the better if the precinct or mall also has great food and beverage offerings. \n\u201cWe are now seeing clothing shops with gorgeous cafes in the front of them or part of them. It creates buzz with people coming and going for things other than shopping.\u201d \nChris Beasleigh, national director, retail sales and leasing for JLL, credits the growth of options in retail to this new trend, saying more now than ever, there is more competition in each sector which results in retailers needing to tempt consumers inside. \n\u201cThere are so many different options around so consumers need to be tempted. You have got to up your game, the demands of the new generation are that they want it, and they want it now.\u201d \nHe warns that the trouble of adding a hospitality component to the business has to be worth it for the retailer. \n\u201cIf you do it right then it\u2019s worth it. Fashion has really taken a hit because of the internet but two things have continued to grow \u2013 service retail and food/beverage. But each retailer has to think about will it work in your space. \n\u201cHospitality is very complex, and very complex to set up. You have to do your research and see if it\u2019s actually worth the investment\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t tell everyone to adopt this, it must suit your brand and gain enough revenue to make it worth it for everyone.\u201d \nThe secret sauce \nThe continued success of the retail and hospitality sectors in New Zealand requires careful management and constant control of things such as costs, coupled with a detailed understanding of the market. That both industries have continued to do so well is testament to the incredibly hard work retailers and members of the hospitality are putting in. \nBoth Mark Knoff-Thomas and Vicki Lee stress the importance of retailers doing their homework before including hospitality into their offerings. Lee says there is a lot that the retail sector can learn from their food and drink neighbours. \n\u201cHospitality operators know they need to constantly look for the next new thing to bring people through the door. \n\u201cStats NZ demography data indicates over a six-year period, around 45-50 percent of food and beverage businesses will either close or be sold. This, in itself means we are constantly seeing new hospitality offerings pop up as new owners take over. This often leads to a new product offering and probably a refurbishment, which could be as little as a fresh coat of paint or a complete revamp.\u201d \nBetween large shopping areas like Sylvia Park, medium-sized chains like Citt\u00e0 and smaller offerings like J\u2019aime Les Macarons, it\u2019s clear that many retailers are evolving to meet consumer demand. Yet the responsibility still falls on retailers to make sure that a new business model suits their pre-existing one and will enhance their offering rather than distract from it. \n\u201cDo your research, whatever you do you need to be sure it is going to enhance and complement what you\u2019re already doing - and it\u2019s going to resonate with your consumer,\u201d says Knoff-Thomas. \u201cIt\u2019s really about finding the right things, what you\u2019ve got, what your consumer is like and how hospitality can enhance both those things. It all about instore alignment, you can never stress enough how important the research is.\u201d \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "courtney devereux", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knoff-thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vicki lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris beasleigh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark knoff-thomas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "j\u2019aime les macarons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the food retail group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hospitality nz", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sylvia park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:13.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c75db576b28e63f659eb100bd12faf4b19effffa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5nhqB6eGqTPDMu9C.WWE.zikSWnTCc4m4JwQoHbX1XdXjE7qDU2bQ5ooxxEUZMwK36320qNwqQ2MWITYSzl9to1fEKa_A.Yqu7E.JE0oKWAl7Sfqkav0PU8v6SSBJDeN.kZq0Rdwf1Q--", "site_full": "www.briefingwire.com", "site": "briefingwire.com", "site_section": "http://www.briefingwire.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["marketing", "financial_news", "finance", "business"], "section_title": "BriefingWire.com", "title": "Animal Produce Market Size and Growth Factors Research and Projection 2022", "title_full": "Animal Produce Market Size and Growth Factors Research and Projection 2022", "published": "2017-12-07T05:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19966, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c75db576b28e63f659eb100bd12faf4b19effffa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5nhqB6eGqTPDMu9C.WWE.zikSWnTCc4m4JwQoHbX1XdXjE7qDU2bQ5ooxxEUZMwK36320qNwqQ2MWITYSzl9to1fEKa_A.Yqu7E.JE0oKWAl7Sfqkav0PU8v6SSBJDeN.kZq0Rdwf1Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T05:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "Animal Produce Market Size and Growth Factors Research and Projection 2022", "text": "www.marketresearchnest.com/ Animal Produce Market Size and Growth Factors Research and Projection 2022 MarketResearchNest.com adds \u201cGlobal Animal Produce Market Research Report 2017\u201d new report to its research database.

As for the Stranger Things shoutout, I've yet to watch that show even though I'm aware of how popular it is.\n9. A great song indeed. Interesting choice for a workout playlist, but it does have a bit of a beat to it in the chorus. This is one of my favorite songs by The Fray, but my absolute favorite from them is \"Over My Head (Cable Car).\"\n8. I remember how popular this song was. It's one I like well enough, but I never downloaded it myself. It's a good song though.\n7. I like this song too. \"Enchanted\" is my favorite from Speak Now though.\n6. Yeah, I remember you telling me about this song. It's all right, and sorry about not using it for the redux. Josiah did end up winning the season though.\n5. This is my favorite Michelle Branch song. And that's good Michelle is releasing new music.\n4. My favorite The Fray song! It's a really good song and one I still listen to often.\n3. This is my favorite song on the Fearless album too. And yeah, who knew that VMA incident would be something the media still likes to bring up regularly?\n2. Yeah, everyone knows this song. It's fun, but it's not a song I seek out to listen to.\n1. I remember you telling me about this song. I don't know if Trisha is underrated or not since I didn't really pay attention to country music in the 90's (Carrie made me a country fan). It's a nice song, and I didn't use it for the redux since it didn't really suit any of the remaining contestants.\n- Those were all good covers of the song! I also liked Josh Kaufman and Usher\u0092s duet from The Voice. As for Stranger Things, you should check it out! It\u0092s great.\n- Yeah, it may seem like an odd choice for a workout playlist, but it did give me a good rhythm when I was working out.\n- I\u0092m glad you like the song even if you never downloaded it.\n- \u0093Enchanted\u0094 is a great song too.\n- The point was I didn\u0092t want Josiah to win so he could come back for this season and sing it. But maybe in the future we could use it.\n- I\u0092m excited to talk about Michelle\u0092s new music on this list.\n- I\u0092m glad we have the same favorite song from The Fray. I still listen to this often too.\n- I know, right? I had to discuss it on here even though most people regularly talk about it.\n- Agreed that it\u0092s a fun song.\n- That makes sense why you didn\u0092t use it. Maybe in the future?\nQuote:\nSince I am really quite far behind and missed the entire list while posting I\u0092ll break the songs into categories of my feelings of them:\nReally LOVE / Classics: No Scrubs, The Real Slim Shady, Promiscuous, I Think I'm In Love With You, I Knew You Were Trouble, All You Wanted\nLove: (There's Gotta Be) More to Life, Shadow of the Day, Everytime We Touch, Are You Happy Now?, Wake Me Up When September Ends, Numb, Teardrops on My Guitar, Shape of My Heart, Style, Every Breath You Take, How to Save a Life, You Belong With Me\nReally like: Chasing Cars, Over My Head (Cable Car)\nLike: Dirty Little Secret, Breathless, Stop Draggin' My Heart Around, Breathe (2 AM), You Got It (The Right Stuff), Girls Just Want to Have Fun\nKinda like: Hangin' Tough, Mean\nMeh: Autobiography, Our House, Free Fallin'\nNever heard: Surrender, 17, Gloria, She's In Love With the Boy\nGreat list overall!\nThanks so much for catching up!

Now it's time to begin the official countdown. There are 125 songs on these rankings, and I hope you enjoy them all!\n#125. \"High Enough\" - K.Flay\nKicking off my countdown with an artist I had never even heard of, but when Elliott used it in his redux for one of the contestants I submitted, I enjoyed it. \"High Enough\" isn't a song I would like normally, but it does have a really cool and unique sound to it that I enjoyed. K.Flay has a unique voice and it definitely works for this style of song. It's a cool song, but I don't like it enough to rank it higher than this.\n#124. \"Everyday\" - Ariana Grande featuring Future\nAriana Grande makes her only appearance on these rankings, and she's joined by Future to give us \"Everyday\". This song was released in support of Ariana's Dangerous Woman album, and it does have a cool sound to it, but I didn't really listen to it that much, which impacted its ranking. Ariana has had kind of a quiet year, which is understandable since there was a bombing at her concert in Manchester, England, and that would definitely impact someone like that and make them want to take some time off. Future's verse isn't the best, but he does sound decent on this song. All in all it's a pretty cool song but I didn't really listen to it that often.\n#123. \"Hopeless Romantic\" - Michelle Branch\nMichelle Branch finally made her comeback this year, and she makes an appearance on these rankings with \"Hopeless Romantic\". This has a different sound than I'm used to from her, but it still has a cool sound to it and Michelle definitely sounds great singing it, as usual. I'm glad we finally got some new music from her since it's been forever. Because it has a different sound than I'm used to, it's lower on these rankings, but I still enjoy it and have it on a couple of playlists.\n#122. \"Slumber Party\" - Britney Spears featuring Tinashe\nHere's Britney Spears' only appearance on these rankings, and she's joined by Tinashe, who has another appearance later on, to bring us \"Slumber Party\". The subject matter of this song isn't my favorite, but I do think Britney and Tinashe sound great on this song and it has a really catchy sound to it that's perfect for Britney. I didn't listen to this as much of some of the other songs on this ranking, but I do like hearing it whenever I do happen to listen to it. Tinashe also sounds great on the song and it was a good idea to bring her in. I wish I listened to this more often, otherwise it would be higher on my rankings.\n#121. \"No More Sad Songs\" - Little Mix featuring Machine Gun Kelly\nLittle Mix make their first of 3 appearances on this ranking, and they're joined by Machine Gun Kelly, who also has 3 appearances on this ranking (this one as a featured artist and two as the main artist) for \"No More Sad Songs\". This was my least favorite of the Glory Days singles, but I still like the song and think the girls and Machine Gun Kelly sound great on their respective parts of the song. I didn't listen to this as often as some of their other songs, but I did like it enough to include it on here and share it with all of you. It does have a really fun sound to it and everyone does a good job on it. There's still more from both of them to come, so stay tuned.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHCC4ndeJyE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHmBf4ExtZk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RRY3OVqtwc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j04JKdcXjkU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYcOSA4K2s8"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:13.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e5e0c7dd9fbd03182ef53d44e8c899e62bcaf3a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRXO3aRgu7IhC6pZHz8wign5YYj4IhpJJN6OFMfqn369.kMfIjUiRXcZa6p1jAEJAk-", "site_full": "idolforums.com", "site": "idolforums.com", "site_section": "https://idolforums.com/index.php?showforum=534", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Music \u00ab idolforums.com", "title": "AngelOfMusic8908\u0092s 2017 music rankings", "title_full": "AngelOfMusic8908\u0092s 2017 music rankings :: Music \u00ab idolforums.com", "published": "2017-12-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.023, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be62c5d345b3ebf2b701d662bea876c5c73959d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRXO3aRgu7IhC6pZHz8wign5YYj4IhpJJN6OFMfqn369.kMfIjUiRXcOV.BiB79kqvDUfEnbtEZnQ--", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "itsemilycat", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I'll try to catch up on this when i get the chance!!!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:13.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "662c3f48c5fbce2e0ac370a4815273fbba66e99f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTJ8WBTPGEXr03GkWBGUgM1s8c93mygP0dSwFbJ9_89MsK_Lb30TTw4Pt2POInSCWikCwrMuhW.Uw--", "site_full": "www.viewnews.co.uk", "site": "viewnews.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.viewnews.co.uk/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "View News", "title": "Festive race day up next at Taunton", "title_full": "Festive race day up next at Taunton", "published": "2017-12-07T10:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.viewnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Taunton-Racecourse.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "662c3f48c5fbce2e0ac370a4815273fbba66e99f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTJ8WBTPGEXr03GkWBGUgM1s8c93mygP0dSwFbJ9_89MsK_Lb30TTw4Pt2POInSCWikCwrMuhW.Uw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Howard Larcombe", "published": "2017-12-07T10:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "Festive race day up next at Taunton", "text": "Festive race day up next at Taunton By 0 29 \nTAUNTON Racecourse host the Dave Criddle Travel Festive Race Day on Thursday, December 14th with the first of seven races, boasting a massive prize pot of \u00a366k, due off at 12.30pm. \nThere is a feast for racegoers on offer with two Class 3 events and two three mile races so another great day\u2019s action looks to be in store.

Just one day later, however, you'd be able to sell that bitcoin for $15,000. \nThe market cap of the world's most popular cryptocurrency is currently at $252 billion, and the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies just crossed $400 billion. However, right now most Bitcoin competitors are in the red, possibly because everyone's selling them to buy more Bitcoin. SEE ALSO: How to fix Bitcoin's energy-consumption problem \nInterestingly, Bitcoin's popularity in Korea is even bigger than in the rest of the world; there, the price is already above $19,000 on local exchanges. \nBesides the Korean buying frenzy, Bitcoin's price is likely rising on the news that Bitcoin futures are launching on CME , Nasdaq and CBOE soon. \nFurthermore, Lightning protocol , a technology that should make Bitcoin transactions so much quicker, reached version 1.0 on Wednesday. The three companies working on Lightning \u2014 ACINQ, Blockstream, and Lightning Labs \u2014 said they've successfully tested it on actual Bitcoin transactions. There's still a lot of work to be done before Lightning can safely be implemented, but this is promising news for Bitcoin, which is currently plagued by slow transactions and high transaction fees. \nThe price of Bitcoin is now up 1,500% since January 2017 and roughly 3,500% since January 2016.

That, of course, has the potential to be a lot of people \u2013 not to mention all the services like grocery stores, petrol stations, post offices, clinics, schools, etc. they\u2019ll all need in close proximity to them. \nLord says it\u2019s all doable in an area that\u2019s about a 40-minute drive from central Auckland. \u201cAs a landscape architect, there\u2019s beauty and poetry in rural and urban conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is thinking about it in a different way.\u201d James Lord. \nThat\u2019s all fine and good, but let\u2019s call a spade a spade: this kind of sounds like a bedroom community. Lord bristles at that. \u201cIt\u2019s more than creating a community,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s creating an institution and experience.\u201d \nLord swears Paerata Rise won\u2019t end up like Vancouver, Washington \u2013 a cool, vibrant area that has gentrified dramatically but will forever be overshadowed by the much larger (and far more vibrant) Portland, Oregon just across the Columbia River. \u201cWe have to create places for people,\u201d he says, emphasising the importance of keeping people engaged and feeling like they belong to a community. \nAnother important thing with a planned community such as Paerata Rise, Lord says, is providing access to the outdoors. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from living completely outside to slowly being interior creatures,\u201d he says. \u201cHopefully it [Paerata Rise] sets a precedent.\u201d \nLord adds there\u2019s a reason for that. \u201cNew Zealand is one of the most beautiful countries in the world \u2013 and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so easy to screw it up. We think it can\u2019t happen here. We have to keep New Zealand beautiful.\u201d \nNaturally, there are some lessons Lord has learned, too, in designing the community. \u201cIf you don\u2019t bring people along for your journey, you\u2019re going to fail,\u201d he says. \u201cListening is the answer to everything.\u201d Tagged: architecture , design , Auckland , New Zealand , urban , Aotearoa , James Lord , Paerata Rise \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "james lord", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben mack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lord", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paerata rise", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "james lord of surfacedesign , inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paerata rise", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "auckland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:15.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f689ee74168070e256745f7afd25e10f58ab379", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSQkbwbIqLoWRtL0WeOoK4p_45ceG3XnTrHxlr4vfX62PLRSWzTa1ae5mby5W4aou265rMt6Qyi33foCH9YmN3a_1Q0JcoHeTc-", "site_full": "hartford.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://hartford.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist hartford | for sale search", "title": "wood burls cherry, maple -amazing butternut", "title_full": "wood burls cherry, maple -amazing butternut", "published": "2017-12-07T09:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_b0U5l05Zfrf_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f689ee74168070e256745f7afd25e10f58ab379", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSQkbwbIqLoWRtL0WeOoK4p_45ceG3XnTrHxlr4vfX62PLRSWzTa1ae5mby5W4aou265rMt6Qyi33foCH9YmN3a_1Q0JcoHeTc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "wood burls cherry, maple -amazing butternut", "text": "QR Code Link to This Post various wood burls - various size cherry with amazing grains 4-5ft sections or spike butternut burl swirling around logs most amazing and rare butternut burls i've seen also lots of crotches-figured maple, walnut , cherry and more if you're into carving -these butternut burls can become once in a lifetime opportunities see photos   6415774763", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:16.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0f83bb6508cad6996bb1299314fe76e8cb3f734f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p6Ka1CU4keYW9cKY1MtOgN0XFnLA3FTsO", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/d/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/d/ - Hentai/Alternative - 4chan", "title": "Amputee thread", "title_full": "/d/ - Amputee thread - Hentai/Alternative - 4chan", "published": "2017-11-27T22:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 84, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "88a3c221a85b3e7dea452ad8c87d4f9e6182cbf2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p6Ka1CU4keYW9cKY1MtOgNzSsuZbX3BpI1Lx1O__hz20-", "ord_in_thread": 73, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-05T13:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>7746141\nI guess.

The reality of that sucks big time. Supportive people though are in abundance so take some comfort there ok.\nI saw a popular UK talk show host make a big deal out of the SSM postal voting process and how much it cost the Australian taxpayers; I'm embarrassed tbh. International headlines like this make us Aussie's look like a bunch of morons; or at least our gutless pollies.\nMy sis works in a private school and we discussed how kids are being forced to sit thru sex ed classes with subjects like transgender equality, gender identity, masturbation and a plethora of adult concepts at very young ages. I listened and wondered how I'd respond but was left dumbfounded and sad. I have no doubt in my mind she voted no. It blindsided voting.\nI did sex ed in high school and had to have a letter from my parents. Yes, it was the 70's, but it was a time of change for women, sexual freedom and focus on limiting pregnancies. There were those who poo-poo'd it, but they fell into the background of religious fundamentalism and old school 'skeletons in the closet' mentality. This however, is very different.\nWhat I want is for gender confused children to have a voice; with resources to support their journey including that of their parents. Why are these 'classes' aimed at children instead of parents???? Little minds need one on one discussions instead of a room full of cruel and snickering peers. I'm scared for us all...I hope it's a huge propaganda campaign.\nSez", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:17.005+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15106958, "moreResultsAvailable": 15106858, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512640277005&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 436}
