Exact dates of the event were yet to be finalised.\n\"HIL will return at the end of 2019. It is on track. We are working with FIH for the window. We haven't finalised the exact window yet,\" Norman said on the sidelines of the ongoing Hockey World League (HWL) Final here.\n\"Everyone likes to make money. Everyone likes to make sure that you have the best possible scenario in place. We still have little bit of time to relook at everything. We have already confirmed to our broadcaster for 2019.\n\"We will need to reconfirm with FIH because they will also have a qualifying event leading upto 2020 Tokyo Olympics and that will happen before the HIL so that the players are free,\" added Norman, who is also a member of the HIL Governing Committee.\nThe next men's hockey World Cup is scheduled to be held at the Kalinga Stadium here from November 28 to December 16 next year and the HI CEO said they have got the necessary approvals for the conduct of the tournament.\nPakistan are one of 16 participating teams in the World Cup, but their participation remains in doubt as they failed to turn up for last year's Junior World Cup in Lucknow owing to diplomatic tensions between the two nations.\nNorman said like any other competing nation, Pakistan is also welcome and it is upto them to follow the procedures and ensure smooth processing of visas.\n\"They (Pakistan) are welcome here like every other team. We have got permission from Ministry of Youth Affairs for the conduct of the tournament, which includes 16 teams, and Pakistan is part of the 16 teams.\n\"We have also written to the Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of External Affairs and we have got permission from one of the two and the other approval is expected soon,\" Norman said.\n\"Now it's upto Pakistan. Every country has a set of requirements which they need to complete for applying for visas. They need to provide all details.\"\nShe rubbished rumours that the World Cup might be shifted out of Bhubaneswar.\n\"Absolutely not. I am not sure from where anyone heard that,\" a bemused Norman said.\nThe HI CEO said the Kalinga Stadium will sport a completely new look for next year's mega-event.\n\"This pitch is three years old and it will be changed for the World Cup. The practice pitches will be changed. Construction work will finish by the end of May. After that we will be laying the pitch and it will require two months for that.

First it was a night club fight and now, it\u2019s even something more controversial and messy. The father of one has tried so hard to distance himself from social media scandals, but recent events have shown that the pop star has been proved wrong. Earlier in the week, news broke that the pop star has another love child by a second baby mama, Binta Diamond Diallo who hails from Guinea, though Wizkid has not confirmed or denied the rumour about him having another child with his alleged baby mama, Binta Diamond Diallo.\n\n\nSources close to Wizkid confirmed that his erstwhile girlfriend, Tania Omotayo, broke up with him recently, though both of them had a mutual understanding to remain civil and matured about the new development, all in a bid to avoid media scandals. Obviously, this is why she has kept her distance from the music star for sometime now. She even boycotted most of wizkid\u2019s events. One of such events was his Industry Nite. Tania was on vacation to Dubai with her friends. Could this have been possible if they were still love birds? It looks like Wizkid has been caught in a web spun with his own hands. The news of his second baby mama seems to ring true. According to reports, the alleged baby mama, Binta Diamond and Wizkid have been in a secret relationship for sometime now. When she became pregnant they kept the relationship on a low key till she gave birth and shared the name of her son on her Instagram page. Surprisingly, she named the child after the star boy, \u2013 Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun \u2013 which is Wizkid\u2019s exact first, middle and last names. Since the news broke out about Wizkid\u2019s alleged second baby mama, the pop star has avoided the social media and has so far not officially confirmed or denied the rumour. Meanwhile, reports had it that Binta Diallo has made some new revelation regarding her new-born son. She was said to have explained why she intentionally named her son after the Afro-pop star, saying it was to avoid a repeat of the situation with Wizkid\u2019s first baby mama- Oluwanishola Ogudugu. When Sola had the singer\u2019s son in 2011, Wizkid repeatedly denied having any child until the evidence was too immense for him to run from. Binta, having learned from Sola\u2019s experience, didn\u2019t want to fall into such a media ordeal, and as such, chose to expose the fact that she had just given birth to Wizkid\u2019s son. However, in a statement during the week, his management said, Wizkid hasn\u2019t confirmed the news making the rounds that he has fathered another child. \u201cWizkid still hasn\u2019t confirmed any news about him having another child. We know he is single and will be releasing his EP next month.\u201d Wizkid alleged baby mama is said to be a Guinean model based in the United States. She has taken to her instagram page to release pictures of herself during pregnancy.\u201d\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rotimi agbana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wizkid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kehinde ajose  ayo balogun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ayodeji ibrahim balogun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "binta diamond diallo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oluwanishola ogudugu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "binta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tania omotayo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "k.a wizkid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "binta diamond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "binta diallo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wizkid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "industry nite", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "guinea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:48.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a499686e1b115aff8fde0fcf4b8e1c396b280bd4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS7qymNfQA8Gv12pKQMteM3iCIn61wJ2dEWrShO_E9APbaMDwYRErBb3ZT0xEdyMbgFB.50_TBHhFosif7rADGu_ZoT4L5SCeMH5y6SrZ02Xt9yzHDC.1LNg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Australia", "title": "The Cat Empire co-founder Felix Riebl has released a new song about the death of Julieka Dhu while in police custody.

Photo: Michael Sohn, AP Germany's Social Democrats OK talks on a new Merkel govt 1 / 6 Back to Gallery BERLIN (AP) \u2014 Germany's center-left Social Democrats agreed Thursday to open talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives on whether to renew their governing coalition or at least to support a minority government. Party leader Martin Schulz, Merkel's defeated challenger in Germany's Sept. 24 election, secured a party congress's agreement to a motion calling for talks on \"whether and in what form\" the party could support a new government. Delegates voted down a call from party's youth wing to explicitly rule out a repeat of the \"grand coalition\" of Germany's biggest parties in which the Social Democrats have been junior partners since 2013. But the road to a new government is likely to be lengthy and bumpy \u2014 a several-hour debate revealed little enthusiasm for a coalition. Schulz had insisted after the Social Democrats' disastrous election result in September that the party would go into opposition. He said he still wouldn't contemplate joining a new coalition after Merkel's talks with two smaller parties collapsed last month. But President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made clear he doesn't want a new election, and Schulz reversed course. Schulz told Thursday's previously scheduled congress that the leadership's plan for talks, which he hopes to start next week, \"takes no option off the table\" and wouldn't automatically lead to a coalition. \"We don't have to govern at any price, but we also shouldn't want not to govern at any price,\" he said. \"What is important is what we can implement.\" Schulz has promised a ballot of the party's entire membership on any coalition deal with Merkel's Union bloc. On Thursday, leaders agreed also to hold a party congress to consider whether to move on from exploratory talks \u2014 if they are successful \u2014 to full coalition negotiations. If no coalition is agreed upon, that would leave only a minority government or a new election as options. Merkel has said she is \"very skeptical\" about leading a minority government, which hasn't yet been tried in post-World War II Germany. Schulz, however, made clear that some form of support for a minority conservative government is very much an option for his party. \"I give you this promise: we will explore every path,\" he told delegates. In his speech, Schulz listed center-left priorities such as equal treatment for men and women in the labor market and a relatively liberal approach to immigration, rejecting the idea of a cap on the number of refugees allowed into the country. The former European Parliament president called for a eurozone budget to boost investment and growth in Europe, and a European finance minister who would curb \"tax dumping.\" He also advocated aiming for a federal \"United States of Europe\" by 2025, and argued that countries that don't sign up to a treaty establishing a federal setup should then automatically leave the European Union. Merkel gave a skeptical response when asked at a separate event in Berlin about Schulz' push for a federalized Europe. She said she would concentrate on securing greater cooperation on economic, security, defense and other issues by 2025. The Social Democrats have been part of Germany's government for 15 of the past 19 years \u2014 twice joining a \"grand coalition\" under Merkel, from 2005 to 2009 and again from 2013 until now. But the party suffered historically poor election results after both Merkel coalitions, with support slumping to a post-war low of 20.5 percent in September. \"The renewal of the Social Democratic Party will happen outside a 'grand coalition,' or it won't happen,\" said the leader of its youth wing, Kevin Kuehnert.

Industrial sugar offers wide range of sweetening solutions to the manufacturers. Industrial sugar is an important commodity that is traded in the international market. India is a popular country where industrial sugar is cultivated and exported across the globe. It is a sweet, soluble carbohydrate that is used in adding to various food items. There are various types of industrial sugar that are derived from various sources. The table sugar or the granulated sugar is the most common form of sugar that our body consumes, is customarily used as sucrose in the form of food additives. Industrial Sugar beet is another major source of industrial sugar that lately gained popularity in the market during the 19th century. It is cultivated as a root crop in temperature regions that experiences adequate rainfall with enough fertility for the soil.\nDownload exclusive Sample of this report: https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=26327 \nIndustrial sugar is a booming commodity across the globe with challenging factors that are driving the market. Rise in the average international prices and the increase in the importance of international trade of industrial sugar is resulting in the soaring demand for industrial sugar. Moreover, the growth is predominantly supplemented by the rising population and increasing consumption of sweetened items. The rise in the confectionery products, especially bakery items are fueling the higher usage of industrial sugar in the market. However, certain restraints like the water consumption due to monoculture production of industrial sugar are a major drawback for the industrial sugar market globally. Additionally, the recent changes in the trend of consuming alternate sweeteners or sugar substitutes are adding up to the negative demand of the industrial sugar market.\nThe global industrial sugar market can be segmented on the basis of type, application and source. On the basis of type, the industrial sugar can be segmented into white sugar, brown sugar and liquid sugar. Amongst these, the white industrial sugar is the commonly used type of sugar in the market. Brown industrial sugar is popular in the western countries and is available in sachets and jars. The growing retail industry and expansion of product of portfolio of industrial sugar are driving the global industrial sugar market in recent years. On the basis of application, the industrial sugar market can be segmented on the basis of dairy, bakery, confectionery, beverage, canned and frozen foods and pharmaceuticals. Dairy, bakery, confectionery and beverage are the most popular areas in which huge amounts of sugar are used on a daily basis. Furthermore, by source the industrial sugar market can be segmented into cane sugar and beet sugar. Cane sugar is the most popular and common source of industrial; sugar globally. This has resulted in the increase in demand of sugarcane in the international market.\nGeographically, industrial sugar is expected to be a leading market across the globe. Regions like North America and Europe are the largest consumers of these type of products and the same is being propagated in to the developing regions like Asia- Pacific and Latin America. Recently the developing regions have been in great demand by the producers and the trend of such consumption is passing on to the developing countries. The growing South African industrial sugar infused products has created an increasing demand for the industrial sugar market in recent years. Nevertheless, the size of the population and the rate of change in consumption pattern are pushing the demand for industrial sugar consumption. However, the increase in demand for industrial sugar in Asia Pacific has increased due to the higher consumption of confectionery products. Therefore, Asia Pacific industrial sugar is expected to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period majorly due to the nutritional transition compounded by lifestyle changes in the developing countries.\nThe global market for industrial sugar is highly consolidated. The prominent vendors in the industrial sugar market are Cargill incorporation (U.S.), Archer Daniels Midland (U.S.), Raizen SA ( Brazil), Sudzucker AG ( Germany) , Tereos ( France) , Nordzucker Group AG ( Germany), Tongaat Hulett Sugar South Africa Limited ( South Africa), Illovo Sugar (PTY) Limited ( South Africa), Dangotte Group ( Nigeria), E.I.D Parry Limited ( India).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tereos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "archer daniels midland", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "industrial sugar market evolving industry trends", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dangotte group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sudzucker ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "e.i.d parry limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cargill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illovo sugar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raizen sa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nordzucker group ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tongaat hulett sugar south africa limited", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "asia- pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latin america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:49.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12918d8cdce1769c921e563aea57d4135e9cfd11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpQ8qnJvoSs5EJJ_66Rio.sBWaSMJvjRFGN0QEns87GBjEWz23a0p3akWc6JUbnDMVvbr6MOmwrN6bbe3yhkEdG1IRXIuU25G6F9guatvUf8s74XEIwhxXiD", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual?page=4\n", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK - HotUKDeals - page 4", "title": "Deadpool 4K UHD Blu-ray + Blu-Ray + UV Copy - \u00a315.99 - Amazon Prime / \u00a317.98 non-Prime", "title_full": "Deadpool 4K UHD Blu-ray + Blu-Ray + UV Copy - \u00a315.99 - Amazon Prime / \u00a317.98 non-Prime - HotUKDeals", "published": "2017-12-04T05:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 20, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2847250_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb5d8670f09b951b44a6070fc52973531623950b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpQ8qnJvoSs5EJJ_66Rio.sBWaSMJvjRFGN0QEns87GBjEWz23a0p3akWc6JUbnDMVvbr6MOmwrN6bbe3yhkEdG1IRXIuU25G6F9guatvUf8s99qx9K3LT_PM_K9wgNdfXWFMz2EPrk48Q--", "ord_in_thread": 15, "author": "webhose.io", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I'm probably thinking of daredevil actually", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:49.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "46c32fe27f9f836951197a034e4e2b27d1208e3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR5JuX9.TvWz1wsViRLR.nSirMvjQdqpooX8F2UAVTHJb7ty8IDlLtpYdgW8ubd665M.fkcR8EVtQ--", "site_full": "pypi.python.org", "site": "python.org", "site_section": "https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=rss", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "PyPI Recent Updates", "title": "Mopidy-Radio-Rough-HTML 1.0.0", "title_full": "Mopidy-Radio-Rough-HTML 1.0.0", "published": "2017-12-07T11:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1784, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "46c32fe27f9f836951197a034e4e2b27d1208e3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR5JuX9.TvWz1wsViRLR.nSirMvjQdqpooX8F2UAVTHJb7ty8IDlLtpYdgW8ubd665M.fkcR8EVtQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "Mopidy-Radio-Rough-HTML 1.0.0", "text": "Rough html gui for listening to internet Radio Rough HTML Radio rough HTML is a rough and simple interface for Mopidy. It is intended to provide a usable interface to excellent Mopidy via simpler devices and browsers that do not support fanciness that is java script.Or you can use it if you like things simple and as fast as can be. I will work on pretty much anything with any sort of browser - tried it on an old IPod, pi zero with dillo, a ubuntu box ...Once installed it will let you search YouTube, browse thousands of internet radio streams (via TuneIn) or podcasts published on iTunes. It will also support any additional Mopidy extensions you care to install (look `here <https: docs.mopidy.com=\"\" en=\"\" latest=\"\" ext=\"\" backends=\"\"/>`_ for what's available, much interesting stuff like internet archive, spotify, soma fm ... ). The look and feel are based on the principles of rough design. It serves its purpose without trying to sell anything, including itself.Installation If you already have `mopidy installed <https: docs.mopidy.com=\"\" en=\"\" latest=\"\" installation=\"\"/>`_ and running, you can install just by running on a command line::: sudo pip install Mopidy-Radio-Rough-HTMLOn Raspberries, probably the ideal setup is to run it with Pi Music Box.

Why would you want to when there are so many great & much cheaper yote bullets?\nIn my experience, yes. It's all about placement. You certainly aren't going to get big exit holes, but every one of the coyotes I've shot with them have gone down pretty quickly.\nI killed a coyote here at ~150 yards, through the body behind the shoulder and, at the shot, the coyote dropped, got back to it's feet, spun around a couple of times and fell over dead. Another one I shot though the body just keeled over and didn't move. Same with the bobcat I shot with them.\nI was shooting that Sierra 65gr SP before I got these and the effects were roughly the same. This one is a little more accurate in all three of my rifles, but not by much.\nEd\nThanks that sounds good and about what I expected, The Sierra 65 BTSP will probably stay my go to bullet in my bolt action at least till I use them up then I may try the Fusion, ordered 1000 Fusions for the ARs,, I have alot of everything but bullets for them.\nLast edited by PPosey; 12/05/17 .
