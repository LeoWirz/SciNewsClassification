Speaking in Gaza on Thursday, Hamas' leader Ismail Haniyeh said, \"We should call for and we should work on launching an intifada in the face of the Zionist enemy.\" He also said, \"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision.\" \nRead more: US Embassy move to Jerusalem could spark 'third intifada' Germany's former ambassador says \nTaking to Twitter, Hamas also described the US decision as being a declaration of war. \nMeanwhile, there have been violent clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli troops across the West Bank and along the Gaza-Israel border, with stones being hurled at anti-riot troops. Israeli soldiers turned water cannons on Palestinians in Bethlehem, and fired tear gas. Around 15 demonstrators were reportedly wounded, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. Watch video 00:25 Merkel 'not in agreement' with Trump's embassy move \nThe Palestinian Authority has called a general strike in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and schools and shops in these areas remain closed. Hundreds took to the streets on Wednesday, burning American and Israeli flags and 10 Palestinians were arrested in East Jerusalem overnight after Molotov cocktails were thrown. \nHamas' declaration has heightened fears that violence and unrest on the streets of the Israeli-occupied territories could escalate in the coming days. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated that the Israeli military would be deploying more troops to the West Bank ahead of Friday's planned protests. \nThere is a general strike in Gaza and shops and schools remain closed \nWorldwide condemnation \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is the latest head of state to publicly criticize Trump's decision. He described Trump's actions as throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire.\" \nSaudi Arabia's royal court made a rare public rebuke of the US on Thursday, saying Trump's announcement was \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" The US' move puts the Sunni nation in a difficult position, because the kingdom has had close ties to Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. \nIraq's senior Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, said Trump's announcement had \"hurt the feelings of hundreds of millions of Arabs and Muslims.'' He called on the \"Umma,\" or Islamic nation, to combine forces to restore Palestinian sovereignty over Jerusalem \u2014 no matter how long it takes. \nThe West Bank has erupted in violence \nIndonesian President Joko Widodo, leader of the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, said on Thursday, \"Such unilateral recognition violates various resolutions of the UN Security Council, of which the United States is a permanent member. It could also shake global stability.\" \nEight members of the UN Security Council, including Britain, France, Egypt, Italy and Sweden have called for an emergency meeting to discuss the US' move, which will be held on Friday. \nThis comes after many countries sought to distance themselves from US policy on Wednesday. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on Twitter that the German government \"does not support this position because the status of Jerusalem can only be negotiated within the framework of a two-state solution.\" \nTrump bound to Israel forever \nSpeaking at Israel's foreign ministry on Thursday, Israel's Netanyahu was full of praise for Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \"President Trump bound himself forever with the history of our capital,\" he said. \"His name will now be proudly displayed alongside other names in the city's glorious history.\" \nIsraeli and American flags were hung on Jerusalem's city hall \nNetanyahu also claimed that Israel is in contact with other countries that plan to follow the US' move. \"We are already in contact with other countries that will make a similar recognition, and I have no doubt that as soon as the American embassy moves to Jerusalem, and before that, many embassies will move to Jerusalem.\" \nHowever, he did not name any of these countries. \nRead more: Opinion Trump wantonly fans the flames of Middle East conflict \nTwo-state solution further out of reach \nTrump's recognition of the contested capital has been interpreted by Palestinians as putting an end to the possibility of a two-state solution. In his speech, Trump claimed, \"The US remains deeply committed to helping facilitate a peace agreement that is acceptable to both sides,\" he said. \"I intend to do everything in my power to help forge such an agreement.\" \nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh has called for a new Palestinian intifada \nHowever, the secretary-general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Saeb Erekat, said that Trump had destroyed all hopes of such a peace deal. \"He destroyed the two-state solution.\" Meanwhile, Hamas has said that Trump's decision will \"open the gates of hell\" on US interests in the region. \nPalestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas has described Trump's announcement as \"reprehensible.\" He said that it will undermine peace efforts and embolden Israel \"to pursue the policy of occupation, settlement, apartheid and ethnic cleansing.\" \nAbbas is traveling to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II, who is seen as the Palestinians' closest Arab ally. There is speculation that the two leaders may try to coordinate a response to Trump's announcement. \nThe competing claims to Jerusalem, particularly the Old City, with its significant Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites, lies at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Trump's decision has profound symbolic meaning for both sides. \nA spokesman for Lebanon's Shiite movement Hezbollah, which is part of the government in Beirut, described Trump's declaration as a \"treacherous and malicious aggression\" against the rights of Palestinians,\" adding that the only way for them to restore their lost rights was through armed \"resistance.\" \nLebanon is technically still at war with Israel, although there have been no recorded instances of fighting since 2006. Repeated Hezbollah attacks forced Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon in 2000, and the group went to war with Israel once again in 2006. City of strife: Jerusalem's complex history Jerusalem, the city of David \nAccording to the Old Testament, David, king of the two partial kingdoms of Judah and Israel, conquered Jerusalem from the Jebusites around 1000 BC. He moved his seat of government to Jerusalem, making it the capital and religious center of his kingdom. The Bible says David's son Solomon built the first temple for Yahweh, the God of Israel. Jerusalem became the center of Judaism. City of strife: Jerusalem's complex history Under Persian rule \nThe Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (3rd from the left) conquered Jerusalem in 597 and again in 586 BC, as the Bible says. He took King Jehoiakim (5th from the right) and the Jewish upper class into captivity, sent them to Babylon and destroyed the temple. After Persian king Cyrus the Great seized Babylon, he allowed the exiled Jews to return home to Jerusalem and to rebuild their temple. City of strife: Jerusalem's complex history Under Roman and Byzantine rule \nSince the year 63 CE, Jerusalem was under Roman rule. Resistance movements rapidly formed amongst the population, so that in 66 CE, the First Jewish\u2013Roman War broke out. The war ended 4 years later, with a Roman victory and a renewed destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. The Romans and Byzantines ruled Palestine for approximately six hundred years. City of strife: Jerusalem's complex history Conquest by the Arabs \nOver the course of the Islamic conquest of Greater Syria, Muslim armies also reached Palestine. By order of the Caliph Umar (in the picture), Jerusalem was besieged and captured in the year 637 CE. In the following era of Muslim rule, various, mutually hostile and religiously divided rulers presided over the city. Jerusalem was often besieged and changed hands several times. City of strife: Jerusalem's complex history The Crusades \nFrom 1070 CE onward, the Muslim Seljuk rulers increasingly threatened the Christian world. Pope Urban II finally called for the crusade. A total of five Crusades set out to conquer Jerusalem within 200 years. In 1244, however, the crusaders finally lost control of the city and it once again fell under Muslim rule. City of strife: Jerusalem's complex history The Ottomans and the British \nAfter the conquest of Egypt and Arabia by the Ottomans, Jerusalem became the administrative seat of an Ottoman administrative district in 1535. In its first decades of Ottoman rule, the city saw a clear revival. With a British victory over Ottoman troops in 1917, Palestine fell under British rule. Jerusalem went to the British without a fight. City of strife: Jerusalem's complex history The divided city \nAfter World War II, the British gave up their Palestinian Mandate. The UN voted for a division of the country in order to create a home for the survivors of the Holocaust. Some Arab states then went to war against Israel and conquered part of Jerusalem. Until 1967, the city was divided into an Israeli west and a Jordanian east. City of strife: Jerusalem's complex history East Jerusalem goes back to Israel \nIn 1967, Israel waged the Six-Day War against Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Israel took control of the Sinai, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem. Israeli paratroopers gained access to the Old City and stood at the Wailing Wall for the first time since 1949. East Jerusalem is not officially annexed, but rather integrated into the administration. City of strife: Jerusalem's complex history Muslim pilgrimage to Israel \nIsrael has not denied Muslims access to its holy places. The Temple Mount is under an autonomous Muslim administration; Muslims can enter, visit the Dome of the Rock and the adjacent Al-Aqsa mosque and pray there. City of strife: Jerusalem's complex history Unresolved status \nJerusalem remains to this day an obstacle to peace between Israel and Palestine. In 1980, Israel declared the whole city its \"eternal and indivisible capital.\" After Jordan gave up its claim to the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1988, the state of Palestine was proclaimed. Palestine also declares, in theory, Jerusalem as its capital.

Huge study putting 3-D scans to the test", "text": "Dec 7, 3:54 AM EST A better mammogram? Huge study putting 3-D scans to the test By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer WASHINGTON (AP) -- A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. It's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? The issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. That trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. The 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. It's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" WHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? That depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) The American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. The American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. And the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. WHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? Standard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. Some studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. HOW TO DECIDE? Understand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. Breast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. Consider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. As for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. THE NEW STUDY About 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. Researchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. --- This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Sen. Al Franken's departure from the Senate solves one problem for Democrats, demonstrating their will to push out one of their own when sexual harassment allegations pile up. Now they must worry about keeping one more vulnerable seat when they already had their hands full in next year's election. Franken said Thursday he would resign, just a day after new allegations brought the number of women alleging he had groped or tried to kiss them to at least eight. In a sometimes emotional speech delivered on the Senate floor, Franken said some of the accusations were false, but acknowledged he couldn't continue. \"I know in my heart that nothing I have done as a senator - nothing - has brought dishonor on this institution,\" Franken declared. The former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live\" is the latest to fall in the national wave of sexual harassment allegations, coming just two days after the resignation of Michigan Democratic Rep. John Conyers, who was the longest-serving member in the current House. His rapid fall leaves Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton to appoint a replacement to serve until at least 2018, when the state would hold an election to finish Franken's six-year term ending in 2020. Dayton said Thursday he expected to do so \"in the next couple of days.\" Franken's exit gives Republicans an opening to expand their reach in an already favorable Senate map - two dozen Democratic senators are up for re-election next year, including 10 in states that President Donald Trump carried in 2016. That difficult math raises the question of whether Dayton will appoint a temporary placeholder or try to give a Democrat a running start for the 2018 campaign. His lieutenant governor, Tina Smith, has been most frequently mentioned for the temporary appointment. Smith is a trusted former chief of staff for Dayton and also ran former Vice President Walter Mondale's brief Senate campaign in 2002 after Sen. Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash. But Smith previously announced she wouldn't run for governor next year, suggesting she would be no more than a caretaker. Dayton could also look to a pair of fellow Democratic statewide elected officials: Attorney General Lori Swanson or State Auditor Rebecca Otto. Otto is running for governor and Swanson is thinking about it; either could conceivably turn into a Senate candidate. While Dayton weighed his choice, eyes were already turning to the 2018 race, especially among Republicans. Former Gov. Tim Pawlenty - the last Republican to win a statewide election in Minnesota, in 2006 - was seen as a potential heavyweight contender in the GOP. Another possibility, former Sen. Norm Coleman, quickly ruled himself out. The timing of Franken's departure is uncertain. Fellow Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Franken indicated he would officially step down sometime \"by the end of the year.\" It's an abrupt end for someone who had been seen as coming into his own in Washington. Franken, 66, had gained respect as a serious lawmaker in recent years and had even been mentioned in talk about the 2020 presidential race. But his downward spiral began Nov. 16, when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. Other allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003. But Franken remained defiant in his parting speech, saying that \"some of the allegations against me are simply not true\" and disputing the details relayed by other accusers, as he had from the start. And he pointedly noted that he was being forced out while Trump - who has been accused of worse offenses and bragged on a leaked \"Access Hollywood\" videotape of grabbing women by their genitalia - emerged unscathed. Trump and fellow Republicans have also endorsed Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore, who has been accused by multiple women of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. \"I, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party,\" Franken said. --- Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

(Associated Press) By Associated Press By Associated Press December 7 at 4:40 AM \nANKARA, Turkey \u2014 Turkish prosecutors are seeking a maximum one year prison term for a former beauty queen who was stripped of her crown over a social media posting deemed to be \u201cinsulting\u201d to the victims of last year\u2019s failed coup, state-run Anadolu Agency reported on Thursday. \nProsecutors in Istanbul have charged 18-year-old Itir Esen with \u201covertly insulting a section of the public\u201d for a remark she posted on Twitter as the country held memorials on the anniversary of the July 15, 2016 coup attempt, the agency reported. \nEsen was stripped of her Miss Turkey 2017 title a day after the competition in September when the tweet came to light. The model and university student denies any intent to insult. \nTurkish media reported that the tweet, which has since been erased, said: \u201cI got my period on the morning of the July 15 martyrs\u2019 day.

The grand imam of Egypt\u2019s al-Azhar, the premier seat of Sunni learning, also rejected the move, accusing Trump of denying Palestinians their right to Jerusalem.\n\u201cThis administration does not respect the dignity or values of others,\u201d Hezbollah\u2019s secretary general, Hasan Nasrallah, said in a televised address Thursday night. He urged Palestinians and other Arab nations to withdraw from peace talks until the decision was reversed and advocated protests on the streets and in social media.\nIran, which backs Hezbollah, also weighed in, with its army chief calling Trump\u2019s decision \u201cunwise\u201d and a clear violation of international law, Iran\u2019s state news agency reported. If conflict follows, he said, it would be the fault of the United States and Israel.\nDemonstrators hold Turkish and Palestinian flags as they shout slogans during a protest against the U.S. intention to move its embassy to Jerusalem and to recognize the city as the capital of Israel, near the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, Turkey, Dec. 7. (Umit Bektas/Reuters) Even stalwart U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 otherwise admirers of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 took aim at the administration over the new policy.\nThe Saudi government described the decision as an \u201cirresponsible and unwarranted step,\u201d according to the state-run news agency. Qatar, too, warned of \u201cserious repercussions\u201d for stability in the region.\nJerusalem, although divided, is considered holy by Jews, Christians and Muslims, and Palestinians envision the eastern part of the city as the capital of any future state. Israelis, for their part, see Jerusalem as their own eternal, undivided capital.\nPrevious U.S. administrations kept the embassy in Tel Aviv, pending a final peace agreement that would determine Jerusalem\u2019s status.\n[ \u2018This will be bad\u2019: Clashes break out in West Bank after Trump speech ]\nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who has partnered closely with the United States in the fight against the Islamic State, said the move could lead to \u201cdangerous escalation\u201d in the region.\n\u201cThe U.S. administration must reverse this unjust decision,\u201d Abadi said Thursday. Iraq\u2019s Foreign Ministry also said it had summoned U.S. Ambassador Douglas Silliman to deliver a formal letter of protest.\nOn Dec. 5, the Trump administration said there was a plan to formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Here\u2019s how world leaders reacted. (The Washington Post) In Turkey, where relations with Washington were already strained over U.S. support for Kurdish militias in Syria, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim likened Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem to pulling \u201cthe pin on a bomb ready to blow in the region.\u201d\nSpeaking at a conference in the capital, Ankara, Yildirim said that Turkey, a NATO member, would not recognize the decision, Reuters news agency reported.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Ankara urged Americans to stay away from planned protests outside the embassy, as well as consulates in Istanbul and Adana.\nAt the U.S. Embassy in the Jordanian capital, Amman, on Thursday, protesters denounced the United States, chanting against the decision and holding signs that read: \u201cNo to U.S. arrogance.\u201d\n\u201cBefore, the U.S. was a partner in peace to solve the problem in Palestine. Now, Jordanians see the U.S. as part of the problem,\u201d said 60-year-old Hafeth Khawaja.\n\u201cAll of the moderates in this region that stood by America, and put their faith in America for so many years, now look like fools,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been betrayed.\u201d\nBeyond the region, German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday restated her opposition to the policy. \u201cIt is clear that in the framework of negotiating a two-state solution the status of Jerusalem also needs to be dealt with,\u201d the Associated Press Quote: d her as saying. \u201cIn that context, we disagree with the decision yesterday.\u201d\nMerkel\u2019s remarks were in line with critical statements earlier from major European allies of the United States such as Britain, France, Germany and the Netherlands.\n[ \u2018It\u2019s catastrophic\u2019: U.S. allies reject Trump\u2019s Jerusalem decision ]\nIn Pakistan, Islamists protested in Islamabad, Karachi and Peshawar.

He added that the move legitimizes attacks on U.S. forces, of which there are thousands in Iraq.\nMoqtada al-Sadr, an Iraqi Shiite cleric who has long opposed the United States, said governments should expel Israeli diplomats and temporarily shutter American embassies.\nIn Afghanistan, a Taliban spokesman said in an emailed statement that the decision will \u201cfan the flames of conflict in the entire world.\u201d\nTrump, the spokesman said, has exposed U.S. support for a \u201cpolicy of occupation and colonization of Muslim lands.\u201d\nEl-Ghobashy reported from Baghdad.

With many on both sides deciding a headline-grabbing federal closure would be a political blunder - at least for now - the House planned to approve legislation Thursday financing federal agencies through Dec. 22. The Senate seemed ready to follow. Without legislation, many agencies would run out of money after midnight Friday and grind to a close. The two-week spending measure is aimed at giving both parties' bargainers more time to reach longer-term budget decisions. To jumpstart that negotiating, Trump and congressional leaders were meeting Thursday to try reaching agreements. The prospects for successful White House talks were buffeted Wednesday when the impulsive Trump blurted to reporters that a shutdown \"could happen.\" He blamed Democrats, saying they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\" Last week, an unexpected attack by Trump on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., prompted the two Democrats to skip a bargaining session that was planned then. This time, the White House smoothed the waters by following up with a more peaceable, written statement. It praised Pelosi and Schumer for choosing to \"put their responsibility to the American people above partisanship\" and said Trump was anticipating productive talks between \"leaders who put their differences aside.\" Later, the White House issued another statement indicating Trump would sign the two-week spending extension. It also laid out administration budget goals, saying money for the military including missile defense and security along the border with Mexico \"must be prioritized in a long-term funding agreement.\" For Republicans, a shutdown would put a humiliating bookend on a year in which they've controlled the White House and Congress with little to show for it. They want the public to focus instead on the GOP's prized $1.5 trillion tax bill, which party leaders hope to send Trump by Christmas. The two-week spending bill also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program. That widely popular program provides medical care to more than 8 million children. Even the head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members have been threatening to oppose the temporary spending measure, predicted passage. \"No one wants a shutdown, including Freedom Caucus members,\" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters. The roughly 30-member caucus has been trying to win promises from leaders of spending curbs and quick passage of a full-year defense budget in exchange for backing the short-term bill. Without support from many of them, Republicans would need votes from Democrats to push the temporary spending measure through the House. While many Democrats seemed likely to oppose the short-term bill, enough were expected to support it in the Senate to allow its passage there. They know they'd still have leverage on subsequent bills needed to keep the government running. Republicans control the Senate 52-48 and will need at least eight Democratic votes for passage. Democrats have been using their leverage to insist on spending boosts for health care, infrastructure and other domestic programs that would match increases Republicans want for defense. Democrats are also seeking an agreement to extend protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children.

On Wednesday, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to take that position, capping a steady, if unlikely, evolution for a billionaire who had no experience dealing with the perilous politics of the Mideast when he first launched his presidential bid. The decision reflects the influence of powerful allies in Trump's inner circle, including Vice President Mike Pence and Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, men determined to coach Trump on the issue and its importance to conservative Jews and evangelical Christians. It comes despite widespread criticism from allies in the Middle East and Europe, and concerns from some members of his own Cabinet. \"Today we finally acknowledge the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel's capital,\" Trump said from the White House. \"This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It's something that has to be done.\" It is not something any other president has followed through on, despite similar campaign promises. Trump was drawn to the idea of breaking with that presidential precedent, seeing the chance to issue an order that both his predecessor Barack Obama, a frequent Trump target, and previous Republican presidents were reluctant to issue, according to two advisers familiar with the president's thinking. Administration officials are braced for blowback but insisted the move would not upend efforts to forge peace between Israelis and Palestinians. But Trump's gambit appeared to be driven less by diplomatic strategy and more by the president's wishes to fulfill a campaign promise that was hard to imagine two years ago. Appearing before a forum organized by the Republican Jewish Coalition, an influential lobbying group largely funded by Adelson, Trump was asked a delicate, but predictable, diplomatic question: Did he believe Jerusalem was the undivided capital of Israel? The presidential candidate, who prided himself on candor and straight talk, dodged. \"You know what I want to do? I want to wait until I meet with Bibi,\" Trump said, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A smattering of boos erupted from the audience. But as Trump's candidacy took off, he began courting pro-Israel American Jews and evangelical Christians. Adelson, a Las Vegas casino magnate, consistently raised the topic in nearly all of his phone calls and meetings with the president, according to a person with knowledge of the Trump team's thinking. In 2016, Trump indeed vowed to recognize Israel's claim to Jerusalem and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv, aligning himself with most mainstream Republican presidential hopefuls. Other influential voices urged Trump to follow through on that promise in the final months of the campaign and after the election, including Pence. The person familiar with the Trump team's thinking also called David Friedman, who worked as a lawyer for Trump before becoming U.S. ambassador to Israel, an \"unsung hero\" in keeping the process on track. During the presidential transition, Trump and his advisers discussed making an announcement on Jerusalem and the status of the U.S. Embassy on Inauguration Day or shortly thereafter. One option Trump advisers discussed was converting the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem into an embassy and having Friedman work from that post, while keeping the bulk of U.S. officials in the much larger facility in Tel Aviv, according to aides. But the Trump team backed down amid intense pressure from the State Department and Pentagon, where career officials raised alarms about the prospect that it would inflame the Middle East, according to a person familiar with the discussions. In subsequent months, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis continued to urge caution, according to U.S. officials. The officials, Trump aides and the person familiar with the team's thinking all insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the internal deliberations. Aides said the issue never fell off the president's radar. Steve Bannon, his former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. Conservative faith leaders, like Faith & Freedom founder Ralph Reed, also pushed the cause to senior aides. Wednesday's announcement was praised by those who have been advocating for White House action. \"This sends a clear message, a very important message, that we will not allow threats of terrorism to determine policy. It's not just words this time,\" said Morton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America. Trump's decision was immediately denounced by Palestinian Authority head Mahmoud Abbas, who said in a televised statement that the U.S. move \"is a declaration of withdrawal from the role it has played in the peace process.\" Trump officials recognized the risks to the peace process, but have made a deliberate calculation that the outrage will blow over and the impact will be limited. The U.S. officials most heavily engaged in the discussion are Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, and special envoy Jason Greenblatt, who has made multiple trips to the region. Both Kushner and Greenblatt supported the president's decision even though they anticipated it would upset the Arab world, according to a White House official. But because the men had already not anticipated presenting a plan until sometime next year, they believe the anger over Jerusalem could subside before negotiations begin, the official said. --- Lemire reported from New York. --- Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/ @JonLemire and Pace at http://twitter.com/JPaceDC", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jonathan lemire", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "julie pac", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "morton klein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason greenblatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenblatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "--- lemire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david friedman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bibi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adelson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheldon adelson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike pence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "friedman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james mattis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "zionist organization of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. consulate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith & freedom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestinian authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "e associated press ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:50.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5aca85dc0a20de6bcb4c62e30f4fe56661aef3b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFTYhNWHVqlgIbbuTBVRa.mmorU0glKjP31q59.ljOdRmdaNtix4UZ4Q--", "site_full": "community.babycentre.co.uk", "site": "babycentre.co.uk", "site_section": "http://community.babycentre.co.uk/groups/a2975/breastfeeding&rlogin=failure", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "Breastfeeding - BabyCentre", "title": "Nursing tops", "title_full": "Nursing tops - BabyCentre", "published": "2017-12-07T13:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://imageserve.babycenter.com/2/000/255/nrKyiFsi40BtxZxTC7UgwMdYjjpmErFE_sm.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8006, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "55cb2bdb4a2e6de8e8befa6402fa2b513597a965", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFTYhNWHVqlgIbbuTBVRa.mmorU0glKjP31q59.ljOdRl2hmFTdkhIrouPS8Kv_Jdw", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Confettiangel", "published": "2017-12-07T13:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "They\u2019re not nursing or maternity tops but Primark have got some lovely button down and zip down shirts and loads of colours and patterns.

But that's not the whole story. A new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. Experts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. Call it Medicaid's health care challenge. A federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" In small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. Thirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. The Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. In other findings: - Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. - Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. - Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. Still, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" Having a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. In one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. In theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" Salo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. Some states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. The Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. For the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP/Andrew Medichini \nOTTAWA \u2013 The Liberal government wants to lift the mystery surrounding the G7 summit as it prepares to host the gathering next year, in hopes that Canadians will feel more included and, perhaps, less inclined to protest on the periphery. \n\u201cThe idea is to get input from Canadians,\u201d Peter Boehm, the Canadian G7 summit sherpa, said in an interview with The Canadian Press. \n\u201cWhat are they thinking about some of the big themes in the world, whether it\u2019s economic inclusion, what the jobs of the future might look like, climate change, energy and, indeed, some of the big foreign policy and security questions that might be out there?\u201d said Boehm. \nThe efforts to open the process up to Canadians includes Boehm speaking at a public event Thursday night, organized by the Toronto branch of the Canadian International Council and the G7 Research Group at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto. \n\u201cA lot of this is listening and then feeding it through, but also a chance for us to demystify what the G7 is,\u201d said Boehm, who is preparing for Canada to assume the G7 presidency in January, six months before it hosts the summit at a resort in La Malbaie, Que. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a big gathering where you see a lot of people and even more security.\u201d \nHeavy \u2014 and armed \u2014 security presence is a common sight on the edges of G7 summits, where the need to protect the leaders of powerful countries takes on added urgency due to crowds gathered for demonstrations, which have sometimes turned into violent clashes with police. \nThe turbulent Toronto G20 summit in 2010, which included mass arrests and cases of police misconduct, reverberated for years. \nBoehm suggested involving Canadians along the road to the G7 summit is one way to get ahead of the issue. \n\u201cWe all have the right to express our views and we fully expect that there will be people who will be expressing their views,\u201d said Boehm. \u201cMy own view is that it is best to do that from an informed perspective, so that\u2019s part of the reason for the outreach.\u201d \nStill, Boehm said the summit organizers will nonetheless be prepared for protests. \n\u201cIn the past at large gatherings there has also been infiltration by less desirable elements who do not want to express views nor hear views, but they want to create mayhem,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, on the security side, we will certainly be ready for that.\u201d \n\u2014 Follow @smithjoanna on Twitter", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trudeau", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joanna smith", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "justin trudeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angela merkel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald tusk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shinzo abe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean-claude juncker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald j. trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paolo gentiloni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter boehm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boehm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taormina", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "canadian international council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the canadian press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "g7 research group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "munk school of global affairs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ottawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la malbaie", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:50.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a34a857a9ec7195f6de45035f96e85b6c7380eec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZROkKpaIVe38s2Fgp28pRtRwN2C1fHWirTObNUX7WLOXTx5BGITU4_cwPdMCWJ5H5U-", "site_full": "www.fiatforum.com", "site": "fiatforum.com", "site_section": "https://www.fiatforum.com/500/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "500 -

Like a lot of others, I too was sad to see Madge go, very unfortunate, especially the fact, like Richo, he too had fallen under the South\u2019s spell, I think it\u2019s the reason he hasn\u2019t aligned himself with any other club, he loves the club so much, but we must move on, life is for the living, Seibold also looks like a good bloke, very astute, very enthusiastic, very learned, willing to employ new technology & new systems, his new coaching system is very exciting & I would love nothing more than for it to be a total revelation in the world of Rugby League & logically I can\u2019t see why it shouldn\u2019t.\nSome of us have followed the game a long time, we\u2019ve seen coaches & players come & go, life goes on, time to get behind the coaches & team\nWell isn\u2019t this whole Angus thing bloody annoying? Some have already got him in a roosters jersey,\nIf it\u2019s a difference he wants to make off the field, then our prominence in indigenous Australia & our Souths care arm of our organisation seems a good fit, surely if he was to get into some extra curricular film making & starting his own charity, we have some decent links to the world of film & business?\nI invisage that there will now be some input into this, both negative & positive, there are also probably some more points to make as to the overall health of our organisation, I see us in a good place, please respond & give me your opinions & I\u2019ll of course give you the Truth Click to expand...

4:00 am EST Last Updated Dec 7, 2017 at 4:20 am EST David Decary-Hetu, assistant professor of criminology at the University of Montreal, is seen on Friday, November 3, 2017 in Montreal. Technological advances in artificial intelligence are fuelling a new race between hackers and those toiling to protect cybersecurity networks.THE CANADIAN PRESS/Paul Chiasson \nMONTREAL \u2013 Technological advances in artificial intelligence are fuelling a new race between hackers and those toiling to protect cybersecurity networks. \nCybersecurity is always a race between offence and defence but new tools are giving companies that employ them a leg up on those trying to steal their data. \nWhereas past responses to cybercrimes often looked for known hacking methods long after they occurred, AI techniques using machine learning scan huge volumes of data to detect patterns of abnormal behaviour that are imperceptible to humans. \nExperts expect machines will become so sophisticated that they\u2019ll develop answers to questions that humans won\u2019t clearly understand. \nDavid Decary-Hetu, assistant professor of criminology at the University of Montreal, says defenders have an edge right now in using artificial intelligence. \n\u201cBut who knows what\u2019s going to happen in a few years from now,\u201d he said in an interview. \n\u201cThe main issue is that if you\u2019re defending a system you have to be good 100 per cent of the time, but when you\u2019re attacking the system you only have to be successful once to get in.\u201d \nDecary-Hetu said a growing list of corporate and government officials, including Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz, who say infiltrations are their top worry have a very good reason to fear. \nThe Bank of Canada warned in its semi-annual review released this month that the high degree of interconnectedness among Canadian financial institutions means any successful cyberattack could spread widely throughout the financial system. \nReports suggest cybercrime costs the Canadian economy between $3 billion and $5 billion a year, including ransom paid to foreign criminals. \nHacks of Sony Pictures, Uber, Ashley Madison, Yahoo and multinational retailers have sparked unsettling headlines about security of personal information. \nOne of the latest to face scrutiny is global credit-reporting firm Equifax. Hackers accessed the personal information, including names, social insurance and credit card numbers, as well as usernames, passwords and secret question/secret answer data of 19,000 Canadians and 145.5 million Americans. \nCurrent detection systems tend to only recognize improper activity based on past events, often long after the damage is done. \nAn example of this is Equifax, which discovered the breach in July, months after hackers first infiltrated the system. It only notified the public in early September. \nNiranjan Mayya, founder and CEO of Toronto-based Rank Software, said it takes on average 143 days for a breach to be detected. \nThe challenge is growing as the number of connected devices in the world continues to soar. \n\u201cClearly the old style techniques of looking at cybersecurity threats and having people go through each threat aren\u2019t working anymore, so automated means of detecting threats has become more and more important,\u201d he said. \nDavid Masson, Canadian manager for U.K.-based Darktrace, said artificial intelligence will help to keep up with threats by quickly identifying and stopping attacks by picking up on subtle markers that identify bad behaviour. \nHe said his company\u2019s systems map a customer\u2019s entire network, including every user and device, to discern even the slightest deviations as they emerge. \nMasson said AI is needed to keep up with threats by automating defence responses to growing machine-on-machine attacks launched by sophisticated hackers. \n\u201cYou\u2019re kind of looking at a cyber arms race,\u201d he said in an interview. \n\u201cIf you want to keep up with this threat and put the advantage back in the hands of the defenders you\u2019re gonna have to use AI.\u201d \nOntario-based utilities company Energy+ Inc. said installed Darktrace technology alerted it to a user going to a malware site in Russia and uploading undisclosed sensitive data to a third-party cloud provider that its existing security was unable to catch. \nSome observers temper the current exuberance about AI, saying it\u2019s not a silver bullet and these are nascent days for the technology. \nReceptiviti CEO Jonathan Kreindler says the hype around artificial intelligence has accelerated and has almost become a branding exercise for some companies that aren\u2019t even offering truly leading edge technology. \n\u201cThe term AI is now being applied to any sort of algorithmic reasoning unfortunately,\u201d said Kreindler. \nHis firm uses AI to scour writings for unconscious use of language to understand the psychological state of company insiders who are responsible for 80 per cent of cybersecurity issues. \nCanada\u2019s largest IT company, CGI Group, said artificial intelligence is a growing field of interest for customers, although the average client is in the fairly early stages of considering AI adoption in cybersecurity. \nCGI cybersecurity expert Andrew Rogoyski said that still puts them one step ahead of most hackers, who are typically interested in stealing data using the cheapest tools possible. \nRogoyski added that he expects a strengthening of defensive mechanisms might force hackers to also adopt innovative techniques such as AI. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a race, it\u2019s been going on for 20 years plus and the race just keeps evolving. We keep leapfrogging each other,\u201d he said. Join the conversation Sign in to comment (not connected to your Insider Club login). You're logged in as Loading profile... Unexpected error.

All has not been well between the 23-year-old and his former record label after the singer exited the label in October. The record label on Tuesday said it had obtained a court injunction restraining Kiss Daniel from further use of his stage name, and the commercial exploitation of the songs recorded in the past four years. However, Daniel in a statement through his lawyer, L&A Legal Consultants, stated that the federal high court, Lagos, refused G-Worldwide Entertainment the right to stop him from performing, recording or using the stage name Kiss Daniel. The statement reads: \u201cWe are solicitors to Oluwatobiloba Daniel Anidugbe (Kiss Daniel) our attention has been drawn to the unfortunate publication by G-Worldwide Entertainment Ltd currently circulating on social media in respect of the exit of our client from G-Worldwide Entertainment Ltd. It has been said that \u201cA lie unchallenged becomes the truth. \u201cIn view of the above, we wish to say as follows on behalf of our client: The Federal High Court sitting in Lagos denied and refused G-Worldwide Entertainment Ltd.\u2019s application for injunction restraining our client from performing, recording or using the stage name \u2018Kiss Daniel\u2019. \u201cIn other words, the court refused to grant any order of injunction to restrain or prevent Kiss Daniel from performing, recording or using the stage name \u201cKiss Daniel\u201d as requested by G-Worldwide Entertainment Ltd. This application for injunction was surreptitiously and secretly filed without notice to our client but the court saw through the deceit and refused the application. \u201cKiss Daniel formally terminated his contract with G-Worldwide Entertainment Ltd via a letter dated 30th of October, 2017. The termination was done in compliance with the provisions of the Recording Contract between the parties. On 31st of October 2017, our client filed a law suit against G-Worldwide Entertainment Ltd at the Lagos State High Court and G-Worldwide Entertainment Ltd has already entered its appearance and file its defence/objection to the said suit. \u201cIt took G-Worldwide Entertainment almost a month after our client had sued of the Lagos State High Court before G-Worldwide Entertainment Ltd deemed it fit to file the present suit, which is yet to be served on our client up till now. With regards to the name \u201cKiss Daniel\u201d, our client was already using the combination of the stage name \u201cKiss\u201d long before he ever met G-Worldwide Entertainment Ltd. The addition of \u201cDaniel\u201d (which is his middle name) was at his instance. \u201cIt is therefore, laughable and unbelievable that G-Worldwide Entertainment Ltd will purportedly claim to own or have dashed our client his own middle name. The status quo under the contract between the parties as at the date G-Worldwide Entertainment Ltd filed its suit was that our client is no longer signed to G-Worldwide Entertainment Ltd since the termination was done a month earlier. \u201cTherefore, our client shall obey and comply with that status quo as directed by the court, it is a common principle of law that no court will stop an act which has already been completed.

(Reuters) Jerusalem: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday many countries would follow the United States in recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital and contacts were underway. Wednesday's announcement by US President Donald Trump reversed decades of peace-making policy on Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim, and drew censure from many countries, among them key allies of Washington. \"I would like to announce that we are already in contact with other countries which will issue a similar recognition,\" Netanyahu said in a speech at Israel's Foreign Ministry. He did not name any of these countries. The United States plans to open an embassy in Jerusalem, a move it says could take three to four years. The US Embassy is currently in Tel Aviv, Israel's economic hub, as are those of other countries. \"I have no doubt that the moment the American Embassy moves to Jerusalem, and even before then, there will be a movement of many embassies to Jerusalem. The time has come,\" Netanyahu said.

There isn't much that you can miss out or fudge at that scale and, although I had a good set of works drawings and had paid several visits to first Clapham and then York to see it as preserved, there were a number of issues unresolved, particularly regarding the pipework around the steam dome which was almost invisible in published photographs. Richard kindly arranged for me to borrow all the relevant photos in his father's collection, including those portraying Wren's siblings, and, after much use of a magnifying glass, I eventually resolved how the pipework was actually arranged.

The teacher used a speed radar monitor and posted the results on Twitter, clocking drivers between 30 and 56 mph. \nCrosswalk posts were recently placed in the street near the school, but Balto says drivers would hit them and knock them over. \nHe placed the Brady images on the posts with the hope that people would slow down.

Now Iraq's Omar Mohammed, in Europe on Tuesday, Dec. 5, 2017, wants the world _ and his family _ to know his identity. (AP Photo) \nThe historian carried secrets too heavy for one man to bear. \nHe packed his bag with his most treasured possessions before going to bed: the 1 terabyte hard drive with his evidence against the Islamic State group, an orange notebook half-filled with notes on Ottoman history, and, a keepsake, the first book from Amazon delivered to Mosul. \nHe passed the night in despair, imagining all the ways he could die, and the moment he would leave his mother and his city. \nHe had spent nearly his entire life in this home, with his five brothers and five sisters. He woke his mother in her bedroom on the ground floor. \n\u201cI am leaving,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cI am leaving,\u201d was all he could say. He couldn\u2019t endanger her by telling her anything more. In truth, since the IS had invaded his city, he\u2019d lived a life about which she was totally unaware. \nHe felt her eyes on the back of his neck, and headed to the waiting Chevrolet. He didn\u2019t look back. \nFor nearly two years, he\u2019d wandered the streets of occupied Mosul, chatting with shopkeepers and Islamic State fighters, visiting friends who worked at the hospital, swapping scraps of information. He grew out his hair and his beard and wore the shortened trousers required by IS. He forced himself to witness the beheadings and deaths by stoning, so he could hear the killers call out the names of the condemned and their supposed crimes. \nHe wasn\u2019t a spy. He was an undercover historian and blogger . As IS turned the city he loved into a fundamentalist bastion, he decided he would show the world how the extremists had distorted its true nature, how they were trying to rewrite the past and forge a brutal Sunni-only future for a city that had once welcomed many faiths. \nHe knew that if he was caught he too would be executed. \n\u201cI am writing this for the history , because I know this will end. People will return, life will go back to normal,\u201d is how he explained the blog that was his conduit to the citizens of Mosul and the world beyond. \u201cAfter many years, there will be people who will study what happened. The city deserves to have something written to defend the city and tell the truth, because they say that when the war begins, the first victim is the truth.\u201d \nHe called himself Mosul Eye . He made a promise to himself in those first few days: Trust no one, document everything. \nNeither family, friends nor the Islamic State group could identify him. His readership grew by the thousands every month. \nAnd now, he was running for his life. \nBut it would mean passing through one Islamic State checkpoint after another, on the odds that the extremists wouldn\u2019t stop him, wouldn\u2019t find the hard drive that contained evidence of IS atrocities, the names of its collaborators and fighters, and all the evidence that its bearer was the man they\u2019d been trying to silence since they first swept in. \nThe weight of months and years of anonymity were crushing him. \nHe missed his name. \n___ \nFrom the beginning, Mosul Eye wrote simultaneously as a witness and a historian. Born in the midst of the Iran-Iraq war in 1986, he had come of age during a second war, when Saddam Hussein fell and the Americans took over. At 17, he remembers going to a meeting of extremists at the mosque and hearing them talk about fighting the crusaders. \u201cI should be honest, I didn\u2019t understand.\u201d \nAs for the Americans, whose language he already spoke haltingly, he couldn\u2019t fathom why they would come all the way from the United States to Mosul. He thought studying history would give him the answers. \nThe men in black came from the north, cutting across his neighbourhood in brand new trucks, the best all-terrain Toyotas money could buy. He had seen jihadis before in Mosul and at first figured these men would fade away like the rest. But in the midst of pitched fighting, the extremists found the time to run down about 70 assassination targets and kill them all, hanging enormous banners announcing their arrival in June 2014. \nBy then a newly minted teacher, the historian attended a staff meeting at Mosul University, where the conquerors explained the Islamic State education system, how all classes would be based upon the strictest interpretation of the Qur\u2019an. To a man who had been accused of secularism during his master\u2019s thesis defence just the year before, it felt like the end of his career. \nIn those first few days, he wrote observations about the Islamic State group on his personal Facebook page \u2014 until a friend warned that he risked being killed. With the smell of battle still in the air, he wandered the streets, puzzling over its transformation into a city at war. He returned to find his family weeping. The smell of smoke and gunfire permeated the home. \nOn June 18, 2014, a week after the city fell, Mosul Eye was born . \n\u201cMy job as a historian requires an unbiased approach which I am going to adhere to and keep my personal opinion to myself,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI will only communicate the facts I see.\u201d \nBy day, he chatted with Islamic State fighters and vendors, and observed. Always observed. By night, he wrote in his native Arabic and fluent English on a WordPress blog and later on Facebook and Twitter. \nThe city turned dark, and Mosul Eye became one of the outside world\u2019s main sources of news about the Islamic State fighters, their atrocities and their transformation of the city into a grotesque shadow of itself. The things IS wanted kept secret went to the heart of its brutal rule. \n\u201cThey were organized as a killing machine. They are thirsty (for) blood and money and women.\u201d \nHe attended Friday sermons with feigned enthusiasm. He collected and posted propaganda leaflets, including one on July 27, 2014, that claimed the Islamic State leader was a descendent of the Prophet Mohammed\u2019s daughter. Back home, writing on his blog in his other, secret identity, he decried the leaflet as a blatant attempt \u201cto distort history\u201d to justify the fanatics\u2019 actions. \nHe drank glass after glass of tea at the hospital, talking to people who worked there. Much of the information he collected went up online. Other details he kept in his computer, for fear they would give away his identity. Someday, he told himself, he would write Mosul\u2019s history using these documents. \nThe most sensitive information initially came from two old friends: one a doctor and the other a high school dropout who embraced Islamic State\u2019s extreme interpretation of religion. He was a taxi driver who like many others in Mosul had been detained by a Shiite militia in 2008 and still burned with resentment. He swiftly joined an intelligence unit in Mosul, becoming \u201cone of the monsters of ISIS\u201d \u2014 and couldn\u2019t resist bragging about his insider knowledge. \nOnce he corroborated the details and masked the sources, Mosul Eye put it out for the world to see. He sometimes included photos of the fighters and commanders, complete with biographies pieced together over days of surreptitious gathering of bits and pieces of information during the course of his normal life \u2014 that of an out-of-work scholar living at home with his family. \n\u201cI used the two characters, the two personalities to serve each other,\u201d he said. He would chat up market vendors and bored checkpoint guards for new leads. \nHe took on other identities as well on Facebook. Although the names were clearly fake, the characters started to take on a life of their own. One was named Mouris Milton whom he came to believe was an even better version of himself \u2014 funny, knowledgeable. Another was Ibn al-Athir al-Mawsilli, a coldly logical historian. \nInternational media picked up on Mosul Eye from the first days, starting with an online question-and-answer with a German newspaper. The anonymous writer gave periodic written interviews in English over the years. Sometimes, journalists quoted his blog and called it an interview. In October 2016, he spoke by phone with the New Yorker for a profile but still kept his identity masked. \nIntelligence agencies made contact as well and he rebuffed them each time. \n\u201cI am not a spy or a journalist,\u201d he would say. \u201cI tell them this: If you want the information, it\u2019s published and it\u2019s public for free. Take it.\u201d \nFirst the Islamic State group compiled lists of women accused of prostitution, he said, stoning or shooting around 500 in the initial months. Then it went after men accused of being gay, flinging them off tall buildings. Shiites, Christians and Yazidis fled from a city once proud of its multiple religious. \nWhen the only Mosul residents left were fellow Sunnis, they too were not spared, according to the catalogue of horrors that is Mosul Eye\u2019s daily report. He detailed the deaths and whippings, for spying and apostasy, for failing to attend prayers, for overdue taxes. The blog attracted the attention of the fanatics, who posted death threats in the comments section. \n___ \nLess than a year into their rule, in March 2015, he nearly cracked. IS executed a 14-year-old in front of a crowd; 12 people were arrested for selling and smoking cigarettes, and some of them flogged publicly. Seeing few alternatives, young men from Mosul were joining up by the dozens. \nThe sight of a fanatic severing the hand of a child accused of stealing unmoored him. The man told the boy that his hand was a gift of repentance to God before serenely slicing it away. \nIt was too much. \nMosul Eye was done. He defied the dress requirements, cut his hair short, shaved his beard and pulled on a bright red crewneck sweater. He persuaded his closest friend to join him. \n\u201cI decided to die.\u201d \nThe sun shining, they drove to the banks of the Tigris blasting forbidden music from the car. They spread a scrap of rug over a stone outcropping and shared a carafe of tea. Mosul Eye lit a cigarette, heedless of a handful of other people picnicking nearby. \n\u201cI was so tired of worrying about myself, my family, my brothers. I am not alive to worry, but I am alive to live this life. I thought: I am done.\u201d \nHe planned it as a sort of last supper, a final joyful day to end all days. He assumed he would be spotted, arrested, tortured. The tea was the best he had ever tasted. \nSomehow, incredibly, his crimes went unnoticed. \nHe went home. \n\u201cAt that moment I felt like I was given a new life.\u201d \nHe grew out his hair and beard again, put the shortened trousers back on. And, for the remainder of his time in Mosul, smoked and listened to music in his room with the curtains drawn and the lights off. His computer screen and the tip of his cigarette glowed as he wrote in the dark. \nThe next month, he slipped up. \nHis friend the ex-taxi driver told him about an airstrike that had just killed multiple high-level Islamic State commanders, destroying a giant weapons cache. Elated, Mosul Eye dashed home to post it online. He hit \u201cpublish\u201d and then, minutes later, realized his mistake. The information could have come from only one person. He trashed the post and spent a sleepless night. \n\u201cIt\u2019s like a death game and one mistake could finish your life.\u201d \nFor a week, he went dark. Then he invited his friend to meet at a restaurant. They ate spicy chicken, an unemployed teacher and the gun-toting ex-taxi driver talking again about their city and their lives. His cover was not blown. \nThe historian went back online. Alongside the blog, he kept meticulous records \u2014 information too dangerous to share. \nHis computer hard drive filled with death, filed according to date, cause of death, perpetrator, neighbourhood and ethnicity. Accompanying each spreadsheet entry was a separate file with observations from each day. \n\u201cISIS is forcing abortions and tubal ligation surgeries on Yazidi women,\u201d he wrote in unpublished notes from January 2015. A doctor told him there had been between 50 and 60 forced abortions and a dozen Yazidi girls younger than 15 died of injuries from repeated rapes. \nApril 19, 2015: \u201cThe forensics department received the bodies of 23 ISIS militants killed in Baiji. They had no shrapnel, no bullets, no explosives and the cause of death does not seem to be explosion. It is like nothing happened to the bodies. A medical source believes they were exposed to poison gas.\u201d \nJuly 7, 2015: \u201c43 citizens were executed in different places, this time by gunfire, which is unusual because they were previously beheadings. A source inside ISIS said that 13 of those who were executed are fighters and they tried to flee ..\u201d \nHe noted a flurry of security on days when the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, seemed to be in town. \nMany in Iraq, especially those who supported the Shiite-dominated leadership in Baghdad, blamed Mosul for its own fate. Mosul Eye freely acknowledged that some residents at first believed the new conquerors could only be an improvement over the heavy-handed government and the soldiers who fled with hardly a backward glance at the city they were supposed to defend. \nBut he also wrote publicly and privately \u2014 of the suffering among citizens who refused to join the group. He was fighting on two fronts: \u201cOne against ISIS, and the other against the rumours. Trying to protect the face of Mosul, the soul of Mosul.\u201d \nHe tested out different voices, implying one day that he was Christian, another that he was Muslim. Sometimes he indicated he was gone, other times that he was still in the city. \u201cI couldn\u2019t trust anyone,\u201d he said. \nIn his mind, he left Mosul a thousand times, but always found reasons to stay: his mother, his nieces and nephews, his mission. \nBut finally, he had to go. \n\u201cI had to run away with the proof that will protect Mosul for years to come, and to at least be loyal to the people who were killed in the city.\u201d \nAnd he did not want to become another casualty of the monsters. \n\u201cI think I deserve life, deserve to be alive.\u201d \nA smuggler, persuaded by $1,000 and the assurances of a mutual acquaintance, agreed to get him out. He was leaving the next day. Mosul Eye had no time to reflect, no time to change his mind. \nHe returned home and began transferring the contents of his computer to the hard drive. He pulled out the orange notebook with the hand-drawn map of Mosul on the cover and the outlines of what he hoped would one day be his doctoral dissertation. Into the bag went \u201cFather Bombo\u2019s Pilgrimage to Mecca,\u201d an obscure American satirical novel from 1770 that he had ordered from Amazon via a new shop that was the only place in town to order from abroad online. \nIt was time to leave. \nHe wanted to make sure his mother would never have to watch the capture and killing of Mosul Eye. \nOn Dec. 15, 2015 he left Mosul, driving with the smuggler to the outskirts of Raqqa, a pickup point that alarmed him. From there he and other Iraqis and Syrians were picked up by a second set of smugglers and driven by convoy to Turkey. \nThey had no trouble crossing the border. \n__ \nIn Turkey, Mosul Eye kept at it: via WhatsApp and Viber, from Facebook messages and long conversations with friends and relatives who had contacts within IS. From hundreds of kilometres away, his life remained consumed by events in Mosul. \nBy mid-2016, deaths were piling up faster than he could document. The IS and airstrikes were taking a bloody toll on residents. His records grew haphazard, and he turned to Twitter to document the atrocities. In February 2017, he received asylum in Europe with the aid of an organization that learned his backstory. He continued to track the airstrikes and Islamic State killings \nHe mapped the airstrikes as they closed in on his family, pleading with his older brother to leave his home in West Mosul. Ahmed, 36, died days later when shrapnel from a mortar strike pierced his heart, leaving behind four young children. \nIt was only then that Mosul Eye revealed his secret to a younger brother \u2014 who was proud to learn the anonymous historian he had been reading for so long was his brother. \n\u201cPeople in Mosul had lost hope and confidence in politicians, in everything,\u201d his brother said. Mosul Eye \u201cmanaged to show that it\u2019s possible to change the situation in the city and bring it back to life.\u201d \nAs the Old City crumbled, Mosul Eye sent co-ordinates and phone numbers for homes filled with civilians to a BBC journalist who was covering the battle, trying to get the attention of someone in the coalition command. He believes he saved lives. \nThen, with his beloved Old City destroyed, Mosul Eye launched a fundraiser to rebuild the city\u2019s libraries because the extremists had burned all the books. None of his volunteers knew his identity. \nAn activist who helped co-found a \u2018Women of Mosul\u2019 Facebook group with Mosul Eye describes him as a \u201cspiritual leader\u201d for the city\u2019s secular-minded. \n\u201cHe was telling us about the day-to-day events under ISIS and we were following closely with excitement as if we were watching a movie. Sometimes he went through hard times and we used to encourage him. He won the people\u2019s trust and we became very curious to know his real personality,\u201d said the activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she believed she was still in danger. \nFrom a distance, finally writing his dissertation on 19th century Mosul history in the safety of a European city, he continued to write as Mosul Eye and organize cultural events and fundraisers from afar \u2014 even after Mosul was liberated. \nThe double life consumed him, sapped energy he\u2019d rather use for the doctoral dissertation and for helping Mosul rebuild. And it hurt when someone asked the young Iraqi why he didn\u2019t do more to help his people. He desperately wanted his mother to know all that he had done. \nHe felt barely real, with so many people knowing him by false identities: 293,000 followers on Facebook, 37,000 on WordPress and 23,400 on Twitter. \nIn hours of conversation with The Associated Press, he agonized over when and how to end the anonymity that plagued him. He did not want to be a virtual character anymore. \nOn Nov. 15, 2017, Mosul Eye made his decision. \n\u201cI can\u2019t be anonymous anymore. This is to say that I defeated ISIS. You can see me now, and you can know me now.\u201d \nHe is 31 years old. \nHis name is Omar Mohammed. \n\u201cI am a scholar.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maggie michael", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lori hinnant", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "saddam hussein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "viber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mouris milton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul eye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omar mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yazidis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu bakr al-baghdadi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibn al-athir al-mawsilli", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "isis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wordpress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul eye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "old city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raqqa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tigris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baiji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west mosul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul eye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baghdad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:54.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19ac3d79ddc2e50c725f8bde96f62cded008b376", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJiSzUSGcbCA1CZvAUsVQv4UUOhlOH5xZfJR7zfcz0VnTFu4I.hpZ9GWhjaOBAGJDwd8OXlKXlE.O1jBSuPF_P_Jftj_SxyeJv8oNfx9Vquza6biuT6cVZ7s9KFbNxA8yJgLpe_n3k.MfDRrk5AwveLw--", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Bath-Bathroom-Cabinets-Storage-Over-the-Toilet-Storage/N-5yc1vZcfvp/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Zenna Home 23 W x 64-1/2 in.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) \nOTTAWA \u2013 Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland added her voice to a chorus of global leaders appealing for calm in the Middle East on Wednesday in the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s move to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. \nCanadians in the region were being urged to exercise caution around planned protests against the U.S. announcement, which included a process to relocate the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, upending decades of the U.S. policy. \nBy recognizing Israel\u2019s claim to Jerusalem, Trump is seen by the Palestinians as siding with Israel on the most sensitive issue in the conflict. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem \u2014 which Israel captured in 1967 \u2014 for their capital. \nBut Trump declared it was time for a new approach to Mideast peace after decades of failure. Calling Jerusalem Israel\u2019s capital, he argued, was merely recognizing the obvious. \n\u201cWe cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past,\u201d the president said. \nFreeland had been briefed on the announcement in a call Monday with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, sources told The Canadian Press. The two are together this week at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where Tillerson has been getting an earful from world leaders over Trump\u2019s move. \n\u201dWe are strongly committed to the goal of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East, including the creation of a Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace and security with Israel,\u201d Freeland said in a statement. \n\u201cWe call for calm and continue to support the building of conditions necessary for the parties to find a solution.\u201d \nPrime Minister Justin Trudueau, who is on a state visit to China, told reporters Thursday that Canada will keep its embassy in Tel Aviv. \n\u201cCanada has a long-standing policy on the Mideast that we need to work toward a two-state solution through direct negotiations,\u201d Trudeau said. \n\u201cWe will continue to engage constructively and substantively in the region with partners and friends around the world.\u201d \nWorld leaders from the Pope to the Chinese government raised concerns Wednesday that Trump\u2019s move would further escalate tensions in the region and threaten the ongoing peace process, as well as any potential for the U.S. to broker any kind of peace. \nIn Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his nation was \u201cprofoundly grateful\u201d and Trump\u2019s announcement was an \u201cimportant step toward peace.\u201d \nHowever, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that the U.S. shift \u201cis a declaration of withdrawal from the role it has played in the peace process.\u201d \nNew Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh said the U.S. decision was counterproductive and Canada should speak up. \n\u201cIt is something that needs to be pointed out as being divisive,\u201d Singh said. \nThe Conservatives offered no comment, perhaps remembering their own political history. \nMuch like Trump\u2019s decision was part of a campaign promise, in 1979, Progressive Conservative leader Joe Clark made a similar promise ahead of the federal campaign. \nHe reiterated it upon winning power, but after a significant outcry from business and community leaders, backed away from the idea. \nEven former prime minister Stephen Harper, a staunch supporter of Israel, never proposed the idea, though his former foreign affairs minister courted some controversy when he met with an Israeli politician in east Jerusalem, which many diplomats refuse to do. \nBut that the proposal continues to have some political traction domestically was evident during the campaign to replace Harper, when contender Kellie Leitch proposed moving the embassy as part of her platform. \nShe wouldn\u2019t comment Wednesday. \nGroups who advocate on behalf of the Jewish community do feel the Liberals should follow Trump. \n\u201cSince the re-establishment of the modern State of Israel, Jerusalem has been the home to Israel\u2019s democratically elected parliament, independent supreme court, and national government offices,\u201d the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs said in a statement. \n\u201cWe have always maintained that Canada should formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\u201d \n\u2014 with files from the Associated Press Join the conversation Sign in to comment (not connected to your Insider Club login).

For seconds, this isn\u2019t an animated feature, but a live action affair \u2013 so Reynolds will be motion captured for the role according to Hollywood Reporter . \nvia GIPHY \nSo we\u2019re looking at something not too far removed from Andy Serkis as Gollum in Lord of the Rings, apparently, which means Reynolds won\u2019t have to binge drink Haagen Dazs smoothies to achieve Pikachu\u2019s classic rotund form (this may sound implausible, but it\u2019s what Ryan Gosling claimed he did for a role that never was in The Lovely Bones . ) All the same, it\u2019s hard to imagine a giant yellow blob with a deerstalker hat blending in too conspicuously with the London sets \u2013 so stake outs are likely not on the cards.

President Donald Trump is forging ahead with plans to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital despite intense Arab, Muslim and European opposition to a move that would upend decades of U.S. policy and risk potentially violent protests. (AP Photo/Adel Hana) \nThe dramatic U.S. policy shift on contested Jerusalem is seen by the Western-backed Palestinian leadership as a dangerous betrayal and game changer that is bound to propel them into a risky confrontation with the U.S. and Israel on the global stage. \nPalestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas hasn\u2019t decided yet whether to formally abandon U.S.-led negotiations with Israel, a troubled process that after two decades has failed to bring the Palestinians closer to statehood. However, those close to Abbas say a Mideast era of stop-and-go negotiations and Washington\u2019s monopoly as mediator is now over. \nHere is a look at what could come next. \nWHY JERUSALEM MATTERS \nTrump\u2019s recognition Wednesday of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital contradicts longstanding international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the holy city will be determined in negotiations. With Trump\u2019s sharp pivot, the U.S. is seen as siding with Israel, which claims all of Jerusalem, including the Israeli-annexed eastern sector the Palestinians seek as a future capital. \nThe dispute over Jerusalem forms the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but transcends a mere real estate argument. The city, home to Judaism\u2019s holiest site, is also sacred to billions of Muslims and Christians worldwide, and perceived slights to their claims have triggered major protests or violence in the past. \nABBAS\u2019 RESPONSE SO FAR \nAbbas has been trying to rally international support, reaching out to leaders from Pope Francis to the EU foreign policy chief and Arab leaders. He warned Trump in a phone call that the U.S. shift will rock the region and threaten Washington\u2019s plans for a Mideast peace deal. \nIn a speech after Trump\u2019s announcement, Abbas said the U.S. has effectively removed itself from any role as a Mideast broker, but he did not say what immediate steps, if any, the Palestinians plan to take. \nAbbas is to hold internal consultations with officials from the Palestine Liberation Organization and his Fatah party, and plans to meet Thursday with his closest Arab ally, King Abdullah II of Jordan. \nA MOMENT OF TRUTH? \nThe crisis over Jerusalem may push Abbas, the most steadfast Palestinian champion of seeking statehood through negotiations, to a point he avoided for so long \u2014 acknowledgment that the \u201cpeace process\u201d isn\u2019t working, at least in its current format. \nCritics have argued that endless negotiations mainly serve Israel by providing diplomatic cover for its expansion of settlements on war-won lands. Abbas also derived some political legitimacy from the process, positioning himself as the only leader with a shot at delivering statehood. \nTrump says he remains committed to brokering a Mideast deal, despite the Jerusalem pivot. However, those close to Abbas say it\u2019s time to look for alternatives. \nAny talks with U.S. officials are now \u201csuperfluous and irrelevant,\u201d said Hanan Ashrawi, a senior PLO official. \u201cThe peace process is finished.\u201d \nAbbas has warned in the past that a failure to achieve a so-called two-state solution could prompt Palestinians to pursue a single state for two peoples, a prospect most Israelis reject. \nThe Palestinian leader may be reluctant to break away from his longstanding policies or lack the political courage to do so, but not shifting course now would be worse, said analyst Bassem Zbaidi. \n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the Palestinians to say no before coming under pressure to accept\u201d future U.S. proposals that could fall far short of their minimal demands, he said. \nOTHER OPTIONS? \nSome PLO and Fatah officials suggested shifting from co-operation with the U.S. and avoidance of conflict with Israel to a more confrontational approach. \nFatah supports halting contacts with the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, closing the PLO office in Washington and filing a complaint against the U.S. at the U.N. Security Council over plans to start a multi-year process of moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, said senior Fatah official Nasser al-Kidwa. \nThe Palestinians could also try to press prosecutors at the International Criminal Court to charge Israeli leaders with war crimes, including over settlement building, others said. \nAbbas has refrained from such a step until now, under apparent U.S. pressure. \nThe International Criminal Court prosecutor is currently conducting a preliminary examination of the situation in the Palestinian territories, but this is a more open-ended review and could take years. The probe was triggered by \u201cPalestine\u201d becoming a member state of the court. The status change, in turn, was made possible by the 2012 U.N. General Assembly recognition of a state of Palestine in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, the lands Israel captured in 1967. \nHELP FROM EUROPE? \nThe Palestinians are increasingly looking to Europe for help, encouraged by the harsh criticism of Trump\u2019s Jerusalem policy by European leaders. \nEuropean states in the past were relegated by Washington to the role of paymaster, sending hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to support the Palestinian self-rule government and help manage the long-running conflict. \nEuropean states often take a more critical view of Israeli policies than the U.S, especially on settlements, but have failed to challenge Washington\u2019s monopoly as mediator. \nPalestinians now hope the growing rift between European leaders and the U.S. over Jerusalem will earn them diplomatic points. An immediate goal is to persuade influential Western European countries to recognize a state of Palestine. \nRISK OR OPPORTUNITY? \nFor Palestinians, Trump\u2019s policy shift offers both risk and opportunity. \nJerusalem has repeatedly been a flashpoint for violence, and Palestinian protest marches planned later this week could lead to clashes with Israeli troops. \nSuch confrontations can spin out of control, as they did more than a decade ago when they escalated into an armed uprising. Abbas staunchly opposes violence as counterproductive, but he may not be able to contain widespread public anger. \nSome say Trump\u2019s policy shift may create a moment of clarity and help end years of paralysis \u2014 by making it impossible to perpetuate the idea that statehood is possible under the old paradigm. \n\u201cThat option is now off the table and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d said Diana Buttu, a former legal adviser of the Palestinian self-rule government. \u201cThis had really held us up for so many years.\u201d \n___ \nAssociated Press writer Mohammed Daraghmeh in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, contributed to this report. \n___ \nLaub, the AP bureau chief for Jordan, has covered the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since 1987. \nThis is an Associated Press analysis on what\u2019s next for the Palestinians following President Donald Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.

Their skin color can vary, and occasionally they have extra or missing tentacles/eyes.\nKingdom Background: Pikromyrians are an ancient race which emerged from the depths of the caves thousands of years ago. Over time, they began building a civilization for themselves, learning how to make machines and utilize their surroundings for their benefit. Lacking any outside contact with other races, the use for a military was negligible, so whatever forces they have are either strictly for domestic purposes, or leftovers from the wars between tribes years ago. However, the extreme application of automation throughout industry has kickstarted the economy to unprecedented efficiency.\nKingdom Tags: Lagging Military, Advanced Economy\nLeader Name: Arguzshikopilin is the rough transliteration to English.\nLeader Appearance: Arguzshikopilin isn't that unique, as far as four-eyed tentacle monsters go. He has purplish, almost pink skin.\nLeader Background: Arguzshikopilin was a manager of a certain very famous engineering project back in the day, and was elected to the Senate by the People, and then was elected by the Senate to the title of Imperator.

Johannesburg's 1921 Chamber of Mines building has become more than just an iconic architectural monument -- it's roof is now the first agricultural playground for a pilot project to assess the feasibility of growing herbs and vegetables on the rooftops of inner city buildings.\nOctober 2017 saw the launch of the project, called The Urban Agriculture Initiative, which was hosted the by Chamber of Mines and the Johannesburg Inner City Partnership, in which the Chamber is a key stakeholder.\nAt the unveiling the parties unveiled the first crop, which was planted on the rooftop of the Chamber building by 29-year-old agripreneur Nhlanhla Mpati. There they displayed a tumbling, vibrant basil crop that has already been harvested and sold to the Johannesburg Fresh Produce Market and surrounding cafes and coffee shops.\nSince starting farming in the city, Nhlanhla has produced some 15kg of basil and he has received orders for the next six months -- a major success story for this fledgling project.\nBut the Chamber of Mines is not the only agripreneur development. Another participant in the Johannesburg Inner City Partnership, FNB's Bank City, is currently producing enough nonstarch vegetables for its canteen from its rooftop farm and has a surplus to send to its branch canteens.\nAs a result of the Chamber's successful pilot project, the department of small business development (DSBD) has agreed to fund the startup costs of another 24 projects in the inner city of Johannesburg -- helping to provide sustainable employment to 24 farmers.\nAbove that, property owners in the city have made 60 buildings available for these rooftop farms. The Chamber of Mines intends giving farmers more space as it still has an unused area of 400 square metres in its 93-year old heritage building.\n\"It's about being innovative and disruptive in the space,\" Mpati said , \"That's why I say that within five years [the farmers] should be millionaires.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hugh masekela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ana nhlanhla mpati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corey feldman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mpati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimpho maja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammad ali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garreth van niekerk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trevor noah kissed beyonc\u00e9", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhlanhla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacob zuma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bonang mohale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhlanhla mpati", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "scandal-hit steinhoff rhodes university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chamber of mines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conference defiant martins could elicit eskom inquiry's first subpoena hawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state capture inquiry entertainment mzansi international celebrity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fnb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "urban agriculture initiative", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christian leaders warned trump against recognising jerusalem as israeli capital anc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "joburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "halala people africa tech joburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannesburg inner city partnership", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:57.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d01d9d1cde13ffbc985b21727d0354a5c2fa9ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3InKB6dkksQ..nqYH_8ZEzwPcrsQPZ58yp7Mzpid2wvuQzpLTY7zeGZPgCPQEl0LDlf5gZQbGVtMY_Hz3j_0z9PxBKyTI16dws-", "site_full": "ehmkaynails.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://ehmkaynails.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "ehmkay nails", "title": "Zoya Party Girls for Holiday 2017, Swatches and Review", "title_full": "Zoya Party Girls for Holiday 2017, Swatches and Review", "published": "2017-12-06T13:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e0bca7d19c8b77150b9a4595a89742abe188db85", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3InKB6dkksQ..nqYH_8ZEzwPcrsQPZ58yp7Mzpid2wvuQzpLTY7zeGZPgCPQEl0LDlf5gZQbGVtMY_Hz3j_0z9PJDnQPTvowLyJ0duaDB9Vew--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Sparklepuss Polish", "published": "2017-12-07T07:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "You're totally right about the reds and pinks.

They usually aren't, all things considered.\nKingdom Background: A large group of elves with their typical equipment and supplies, emigrating from a fallen forest drove. Hardy and desensitized to the tragedies of the forest, they adopted their aloof presence with a aspect of bare survival. Most have a distinct bias against the thing forced them away from their homeland. They live in the ash lands of a recently active volcano, eking out an existence farming what they can, and attempting to strike the Earth for materials. Health problems are common, but these elves are prone to adaption, and their shooken up society has settled nicely, all things considered. Most elves are used to a spontaniously created religion, which revolves around religious self fufillment fulfillment through mental and physical training then anything else, while more rowdy individuals are exiled to the mines or sent to a solitary life in the military equivalent to train themselves out of weakness.\nAlthough the current leader is from a military origin in terms of her rise to power, she is more then a warlord, and the very small, but exceedingly trained military reflects that. The dozens of tent cities that had sprung up in the outskirts of the (as of yet unnamed) volcano are rife with Elven art and culture, while dozens of mining shafts are dug into the barren earths, supervised by foreign miners and done with foreign techniques and Elven Criminals. The elves import most of the food they get to supplant their doomed forest farms, in exchange for the various \"enchanted elven goods\" (Metal/stone/bone) along with the few exotic elven weaponry they could produce with metals (Metal War-Bows, Mage equipment/ foci, Etc) Foreigners are usually welcomed, although the strict rules often result in large numbers of people enslaved in what is essentially mining camps. Unconfirmed reports of less scrupulous individuals hiring bands of bandits to capture travelers and other such rabble are often overlooked by the houses and the society at large.\nthe current leader is often accused of gimping the military, by only allowing so few into the numbers, but she refuses to compromise the young nation for what she claims is wasted posturing. Her push and focus on socioeconomic change has resulted in a booming economy and a society that is relatively robust.\nKingdom Tags: See below, you have 2 points to spend at first\nrobust culture(1)\nlagging military(-1)\naccelerating economy (2)\nLeader Name: Han'Qerr of House Mieros\nLeader Appearance: An impressively regal elf, she stands at a surprisingly short 5'4, with a fit form and usually has a back-scabbard on her back, which contains a steel broadsword,Runed and humming in power, even at formal occasions were she would otherwise be wearing regal clothing.\nLeader Background: When the great calamity of the Tree Grove occurred, she had led her relatively small commandant of military forces in an exodus away from the doomed lands, through the terrible wastelands along with the thousands of those who chose to fled with the foolish caraven leaders rule, and for decades they had churned through the desert, as more and more died from the depraved conditions until they had ended up at the end of the line, where the volcano had detonated, further lowering the numbers of the group. The Caravan leaders were lynched, and the group settled on the teetering end of what may be extinction, and a half dozen more decades later, the sprawling tent cities could finally be called a nation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:57.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "61b7452af00584bcd6f60f1a4f152125316ad907", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWHWxXJT3jLbW2LG5as9Qe32.SUWq1bDpO59vK5h_cqX02c3VcukIRI8rtJaXklc9nLsBC89MeeMS2nsoyxPMjHdpNjQkwwrWcRm3iHoQfQqKce_RLAoQsqmSFynA0IVWb", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/petpet/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "PetPet Diapers With Best Price At Lazada In Malaysia", "title": "Petpet Jumbo M50 (3 + 1 FREE packs)", "title_full": "Petpet Jumbo Pack M50 (3 + 1 FREE packs) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2000-12-31T18:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 220, "participants_count": 184, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.024, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cbda8958a906e1fb2a8573536fd9d2973889aa50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWHWxXJT3jLbW2LG5as9Qe32.SUWq1bDpO59vK5h_cqX02c3VcukIRI8rtJaXklc9nLsBC89MeeMS2nsoyxPMjHdpNjQkwwrWcRm3iHoQfQqKce_RLAoQsqk0jKxm22pjlf7pdoDCeWto-", "ord_in_thread": 219, "author": "Nor A.", "published": "2017-12-06T08:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "Murah dan berbaloi...", "text": "Murah dan berbaloi dgn penghantaran percuma", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:57.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cbba99a907673410a32567436f87174ec5c246e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b2mgF8c2D1y0CaUh2LifJlQ2K1ax8QE4E3hw82kpZEIQjo34WBKuiOGWwHwyo14PZo8G3fy0_sQ--", "site_full": "www.bay12forums.com", "site": "bay12forums.com", "site_section": "http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?board=15.0", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "Forum Games and Roleplaying", "title": "Markov's Kingdoms [OOC]", "title_full": "Markov's Kingdoms [OOC]", "published": "2017-12-06T09:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.8, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 76718, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d764a8a8b205edb14b8d97f4d0d58953ae85d68b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b2mgF8c2D1y0CaUh2LifJlQ2K1ax8QE4E3hw82kpZEIQjo34WBKuiOGWwHwyo14N0XHlPr1m9qlB20ViCHSBL", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "bloop_bleep", "published": "2017-12-06T10:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "So, when are we starting?
