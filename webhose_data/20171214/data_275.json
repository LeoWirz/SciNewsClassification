As of November that year, it was TripAdvisor's top-rated restaurant in London.\"\nHe bought a mobile phone and registered the number as the restaurant's while refusing to give an address as it was \"appointment-only\", enlisting the help of friends to meet people nearby and guide them to the premises.\nThe restaurant slowly climbed the rankings on the back of reviews from friends.\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Read More \u201cHave I REALLY broken the law?\u201d What happens after you bag a suspiciously cheap bargain Guardian restaurant critic Jay Rayner even tweeted: \"At last: a restaurant that recognises food is all about mood.\n\"Of all the shed-based eating experiences out there this one sounds like the best.\n\"Or at least second best. (I have my own shed, hence). Personally I'm keen to try 'contemplation'.\"\nButler writes in his piece: \"I realise what it is: the appointments, lack of address and general exclusivity of this place is so alluring that people can't see sense. They're looking at photos of the sole of my foot, drooling. Over the coming months, The Shed's phone rings incessantly.\"\nAfter his restaurant made it to number one, he held a special event for guests at which he served, for free, heated ready meals from a discount supermarket.\nRead More Tripadvisor how-to: 6 tips to find cheap flights, best-value hotels and top reviews On leaving, one couple asked if their attendance would allow them preferential bookings in future.\nIceland ready meals were on the menu, too (Image: Getty) Butler concluded: \"So there we go: I invited people into a hastily-assembled collection of chairs outside my shed, and they left thinking it really could be the best restaurant in London, just on the basis of a TripAdvisor rating.\"\nTripAdvisor said in a statement: \"As there is no incentive for anyone in the real world to create a fake restaurant it is not a problem we experience with our regular community, therefore this 'test' is not a real world example.\"\nHow to spot a fake online review - the signs Is all quite what it seems? (Image: Getty) TripAdvisor, which has 45million reviews of more than 500,000 destinations, is a popular first stop for holidaymakers seeking honest opinions about places to stay.\nBut, there are now entire industries offering to pay people in exchange for reviews - so how can you tell the difference?\nIf the review sounds too good to be true it probably is. Watch out for \"hotel speak\" - formal or technical terms or phrases that the average visitor probably wouldn't use. An excessive use of superlatives and adverbs, and an unnecessary amount of exclamation points are the calling cards of many adverts/fake reviews.\nRepetition is an obvious sign, if you spot similar reviews using similar descriptions, phrases - it's probably fabricated.\nFrequency - if you suddenly notice a spike in positive posts around that hotel, restaurant or place of interest, it may be a warning sign that all is not right.\nWho wrote it? If you find a suspicious comment, click on the user and have a scroll through their profile. If there's no more activity, there's probably something wrong.\nIf in complete doubt, TripAdvisor has a forum page for spam posts where you can posts questions to its moderation team for advice.\n Money Newsletter mirrormoneysaving Follow @MirrorMoney Subscribe to our Money Tripadvisor", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorMoney", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://www.facebook.com/mirrormoneysaving"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "oobah butler", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jay rayner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emma munbodh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "butler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josie clarke", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tripadvisor", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "garden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:36.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "29f320c65866626e524ff9c54cf023673c846f38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT3.LaHO6F1Y3RziHj_cvlDGP3903Tk4_eUDKt8wpMnu2PRlIqSqECidsBaWriVpar4ifA0Jbg.4aWYB.4f9QrfJV30nkKS.68rnxQJYzYQZw--", "site_full": "www.thaivisa.com", "site": "thaivisa.com", "site_section": "https://www.thaivisa.com/forum/forum/1-thai-visas-residency-and-work-permits/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Thai visas, residency and work permits - Thailand Visa Forum by Thai Visa | The Nation", "title": "Non-Im O-A Long Stay Financial Req.", "title_full": "Non-Im O-A Long Stay Financial Req. - Thai visas, residency and work permits - Thailand Visa Forum by Thai Visa | The Nation", "published": "2017-12-06T22:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11618, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "94f45af2813ca238bdb819d6f8a9565ca1c3c23b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT3.LaHO6F1Y3RziHj_cvlDGP3903Tk4_eUDKt8wpMnu2PRlIqSqECidsBaWriVpar4ifA0Jbg.4aWYB.4f9QrfJV30nkKS.68wY2IC.8F6Sw--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "elviajero", "published": "2017-12-07T00:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "2 hours ago, siddv said: My question is, upon the 1st 90 day reporting date when I'm in Thailand, will I be required to have 800,000 in my Thai bank account?\nNo. You will not be required to prove the funds again at any 90 day report.\n2 hours ago, siddv said: I do understand that by the time I extend at the end of 1 year I may be required at that time to have 800,000 in my Kasikorn account.

Time to ride By - December 7, 2017 Anna Meassick | Cigar Rhode Island bike paths will become accessible to students when sections of path are added around URI. \nAlthough going up the infamous University of Rhode Island hill can be a daunting task, some students and professors around campus have found a way to make it easier\u2013without waiting in line for a shuttle. Regardless of the fact that they still require a concerted effort from the operator, bikes can be a great method of self-transportation, particularly when navigating the campus. The smooth pathways and sidewalks that this campus has to offer are not just suitable for those who wish to cruise on a longboard, but unlike a longboard, bikes work well both ways on the hill. \nLike the famous Alpe d\u2019huez, a mountain that has been a staple in the Tour de France for decades, riders around URI can become intimidated by the hill. \u201cSure, it\u2019s great riding down, but riding up is a different story,\u201d remarked one anonymous cyclist around campus. While this may be true, for professionals, the Alpe d\u2019huez is unavoidable\u2013just like the hill that the University is built on. \nFor example, imagine this scenario: a commuter student arrives on campus at 10:35 a.m., and the only place they can park is the Plains Road Lot. Dreadful! It takes them only two minutes to unpack their bike from the back seat of their car, and that includes putting the front tire back on the frame. Class starts at 11 a.m\u2026. in Swan Hall. If they were to wait for the shuttle, perhaps they would arrive to class on time\u2013but as we all know, the shuttles can be a bit inconsistent, and this student might end up cutting it close. However, with a bike, the journey to class can become both leisurely and timely. It may be a bit difficult in the wintertime, especially with snow on the ground, but for now, students should seize the opportunity to cycle up our Alpe d\u2019huez. \nThis year\u2019s Tour de France includes a summit finish on the steep mountain, the first since the 2015 edition of the Grand Tour. It will take place on July 19: Stage 12 (of the total 21) within the famous old race. Undoubtedly, it will be an important stage within the race\u2013all riders will be hard-pressed to perform on the incline. \nA race like the Tour de France is all about time\u2013how fast can you, as a professional rider, burst up the climbs to the finish? Well, getting around campus is also all about time (as is college in general), and saving precious time can be valuable to all students. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get to class on time,\u201d shouted one sweaty rider, in passing. In a blur, they sped off in the direction of Chaffee; as a cycling fan myself, I understood. Life is all about time.

It marked the fifth 3-Michelin Star meal I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to visit to this point in my life. Those other four restaurants ( Eleven Madison Park , Daniel , Per Se , and Jean-Georges ) along with Blue Hill At Stone Barns (technically it has 0 stars as it\u2019s not in NYC, but it\u2019s ranked the 11th best restaurant in the world) helped shape my palate and my expectations of what a world renowned fine dining experience should entail. Perhaps they deserve credit for my being so impressed by Le Bernardin. The atmosphere didn\u2019t feel as precious as Per Se or Daniel. I liked that. The quality of the food surpassed that of Daniel and JLean-George. It wasn\u2019t as irreverent as Eleven Madison Park, or as inventive and unique as Blue Hill, but it certainly deserves all the accolades it has earned since opening in 1986. \nThe occasion for this dinner was my uncle\u2019s birthday. Originally our plan was to go to Marea, which is no slouch (2 Michelin stars) but was not described by my uncle as a \u201cbucket list\u201d destination. I\u2019ve been to Marea before and really liked the 4-course tasting menu. I would have been satisfied with another meal there. Unfortunately they were closed for a private event that night. I suggested either Gramercy Tavern (the Dining Room) or Aquavit as alternatives. Mom liked the price at Gramercy Tavern so we made a reservation there. Pretty much at the last minute our Le Bernardin reservation came through, so I had to don a suit and tie (which, quite frankly, made me feel overdressed) which turned out to be the only downside of the evening. \nOur first order of business upon being seated was a bottle of wine. I planned on sticking to water for the night but my uncle insisted I drink at least a glass with him and my aunt. He settled on a Chardonnay from the Russian River Valley (?) which went quite well with the style of cuisine (French, seafood). Almost immediately upon opening the bottle, we were presented with an amuse bouche. And thus, the meal began\u2026 \nHere was a trio of amuse-bouche , which included three different bites of seafood. The first, I believe, focused on roe. The second was uni, and the third was truffled lobster in a velout\u00e8. Each one was more outstanding than the last, with the lobster being so good I wanted to jam my tongue in the cup to make sure I got to taste every last morsel. \nAmazingly, all four of us ordered four very different meals from the four-course tasting menu. The only photographs I took were of my plates, sadly. This was my \u201calmost raw\u201d dish. Striped Bass Tartare; Baby Zucchini, Parmesan-Lemon Confit and Sauce Vierge. It was served with very thin toasts. I thought it was probably the best of what anyone ordered during this course. My uncle had the oysters, my aunt had the yellowfin tuna carpaccio (which was quite good) and mom had salmon which was nice. I really appreciated the parmesan-lemon confit for the little extra bit of funk it imparted. The chardonnay really helped this one \u201cpop.\u201d \nThere was a bread course in between the first and second plates. I think I was the only person at the table who didn\u2019t ask for seconds or thirds on the bread. I felt like such a glutton at this point in my trip that I foolishly thought this would be the best time to cut down on my carb intake. I make the worst decisions. \nMy second course came from the \u201cbarely touched\u201d menu. Charred Octopus; Tomatillo Salsa, Red Wine-Mole Sauce. Not only was it one of my favorite bites of the meal, it might just be the best octopus preparation I\u2019ve ever had. It was meaty and tender, and really elevated by the salsa and mole sauce. I much preferred it to my uncle\u2019s lobster, which came in a black truffle sauce. I think my aunt got the artichoke. I can\u2019t remember what mom ordered of this menu. Maybe she got the lobster also? I can\u2019t remember. Maybe she got tuna? Who knows. Sorry mom. \nThis was it. The third (main) course, from the \u201clightly cooked\u201d menu. For some reason I almost ordered the halibut because I liked the way it was described (lots of Japanese-inspired flavors) but I wound up with the \u201cSurf And Turf\u201d dish. Grilled Escolar (white tuna) and Seared Wagyu, \u201cEndive Farcie,\u201d and Red Wine-Peppercorn Sauce. The wagyu was one of the most delicate and delicious pieces of meat I\u2019ve ever tasted, and the escolar might have been even better. Together they worked in perfect harmony, while the peppercorn sauce added a tiny hit of spice that was very welcome with each bite. My mother couldn\u2019t resist ordering the same, and we exchanged many a nod and smile while wiping our plates clean. My aunt had the salmon which was barely touched / almost raw and tasted great, but was no match for my dish. I forget what my uncle had. Oops! \nBefore our desserts were brought to the table (or was it simultaneously?) my uncle was presented with a small piece of chocolate cake adorned with a birthday candle. I went to town on my Mont Blanc (Chestnut Cr\u00e9meux, Rum-Candied Chestnut, Vanilla Ice Cream) and then ate half of my uncle\u2019s \u201cApple\u201d (Brown Butter Mousse, Apple Confit, Armagnac Sabayon) which was made to LOOK like an apple sitting on a plate but once you took your fork to it the dish transformed brilliantly. Someone else at the table ordered the banana s\u2019more and I don\u2019t know what else we ate. I pretty much cleaned everyone\u2019s plates because they were full and I was trying to savor every last bite. \nFor a mignardises we were presented with a plate of petit-fours (or should I say\u2026petit-fives! No? Really? Okay\u2026Fine\u2026I\u2019ll show myself the door). There was a salted caramel chocolate truffle, some kind of passionfruit jelly that had a weird herby note to it, a mini tart, a macaron, and a cake with\u2026raisin? I forget. I liked the macaron and the tart the best. None of them were otherworldly, but I appreciated the effort and execution. \nAnd that was it. We got the check, we finished the wine, and we exited into the brisk New York City night. Surprisingly, no one showed us to the exit, thanked us, or wished us well as we departed. In terms of the fine dining experience that was probably the only blemish on the evening. Weird, right? At Daniel they frou-frou over you throughout the meal, basically rolling out a red carpet for you every time you stand up from the table. Mom described it as feeling as if she was eating in a Faberg\u00e9 egg. Whatever. It\u2019s not a big deal. I just thought it noteworthy at the time. \nLe Bernardin! Great food!

Photo courtesy of Sports Information. \nFast and furious isn\u2019t just the title of an overly drawn-out movie franchise. It\u2019s a way to describe how the Rowan men\u2019s swimming and diving team began their competition at the WPI Gompei Invitational this past weekend. \nThe team won the 800 freestyle with a time of 6:53.50, senior John Tepper won the 1650 freestyle and freshman Kevin Gillooly won the 50 free with a time of 21.13, which stands as the top time for the team in the event for the year. Senior Colin Fisher finished third in the 200 individual medley, while freshman Dylan Regan and junior captain Eric Feuerstein tied for third in the 50 freestyle. \nA big key that has been working for the Profs\u2019 success has been the performances of the underclassmen, who did their job throughout the meet to keep the team in contention and secure the top spot. \n\u201cIt\u2019s nice,\u201d said head coach Brad Bowser on the underclassmen performance at the meet. \u201cIt\u2019s something to grow off of. It\u2019s showing us that we can lose six All-American\u2019s and still be able to compete at a high level and on a national scene. For us, we were just looking to see where we\u2019re at. The ball of what this team can do is starting to roll and starting to be put together.\u201d \n\u201cThe freshman are starting to really step up,\u201d Bowser added. \u201cI\u2019m still looking for a little bit more from them, but that\u2019s just because what we lost has to be counteractive with the freshman right now for us to be able to do anything.\u201d \nAlthough they were able to come out with a first place finish over the weekend, the team is still not 100 percent \u201cthere yet.\u201d The Profs are still missing a couple key parts and are trying to put all of their skills together to be anywhere near the level of competition they were at last season. \n\u201cWe\u2019re missing a junior, Dan Lawton, in our backstroke events since he\u2019s hurt,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of pulling at strings to win events. That\u2019s why us winning this weekend was sort of a surprise to me. I thought WPI would\u2019ve been a tough go-at and Stevens as well, but we were able to have enough depth in our top lineup to pull out a win.\u201d \nThere\u2019s no shortage of practice for the team with finals week on deck and the semester coming to an end for an almost month break. When asked about his plans for the team, Bowser had one word to describe them. \n\u201cTraining,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cWe will take this week to sort of get them prepped again and then next week goes into finals week, so we\u2019ll do Monday and Tuesday built towards specifics. A lot of stuff will be maintenance, just getting them in the water, then they will go away for two weeks. A key thing is these guys staying in shape, staying in the pool and training over the holidays.\u201d \nThe team comes back to train the first week of January before hosting Montclair State University on Saturday, Jan. 13. \nFor comments/questions   sports@thewhitonline.com or tweet @TheWhitOnline .

China\u2019s Google \u2013 Baidu. With the rocket-fast China economy development, David privileged with the experiences and witnessed the growth of the young entrepreneurs in the country. David\u2019s thought, if he can initiate the connection between his own country, Indonesia and China\u2019s massive growth of travellers to overseas, he can support the golf tourism to Indonesia. Being an active member of Indonesia Chambers of Commerce in China (Inacham), he is based in Beijing. He has been actively involved in Indonesia Tourism Promotion Activities held in China. In 2017 he has been appointed as the Secretary General of Indonesia Diaspora Global \u2013 China. Introducing Indonesia golf holiday to Chinese golfers is his main dream. He started to prepare a business model and actively discussed the concept he wrote to golfers, MBA alumni of Tsinghua University in Beijing who is the most active golf team in China, travel channels, including to Garuda Indonesia and other travel components and various financial institutions. David listened to the comments of Indonesia Golf Courses\u2019 General Managers as he wanted to make his system could help the General Managers to increase the value of the golf courses. Once he has complete the business plan, David looked for the partners who can make his dream comes true. He wanted to create a \u201cmade-in-Indonesia\u201d for his beloved country Indonesia and his fellow Indonesians. He remembered his former Boss in Jakarta who has been in software development for more than 35 years, Ir. Hidayat Tjokrodjojo, the founder of PT Realta Chakradarma and bring up his ideas and to his long-time friend Jakarta who is the owner of Rarampa Manadonese Restaurant. His idea has been well-accepted and three of them designed the mobile application and website of IndoGolf Passport which is soft-launched today, on November 29, 2017. David has been an old friend of Nicklaus Company. With almost 9 years of relationship with the company, he invited Mr. Ted Simons the COO of Nicklaus Academies to support him with introducing the Nicklaus philosophy & approach to the Indonisian Golfers. Jack Nicklaus Academy of Golf, Jakarta (JNAG) will be opened early 2018 in Gading Raya Golf & Country Club. David also invited his golf teaching professional he met in St. Andrews\u2019s Old Course Hotel, Mr. Chris Marrs as the Chief Operating Officer of Jack Nicklaus Academy of Golf Indonesia who will look after the teaching qualities and the development of the academy in Indonesia. With the solid and experienced team, David believes IndoGolf Passport will bring different value of golf games and golf teaching to Indonesia. The major focus will be introducing Junior Golf Education and International Golf Tournament, Nicklaus Teaching Standards to everyone who believes in golf as a sport and golf as a way of connecting people.

Raring is averaging over 12 points a game and has scored more than 10 in six straight contests. Photo courtesy of Sports Information. \nThe Rowan women\u2019s basketball team has bounced back from a three-game skid with two wins in a row against New Jersey Athletic Conference (NJAC) opponents Rutgers-Camden and William Paterson University. In the 99-79 blowout win over WPU, senior guard and co-captain Alex Raring scored a career-high 22 points and added 6 assists. \nWhether it\u2019s being in the starting lineup, or coming off the bench, Raring has been one of the key contributors for the Profs so far this campaign. She is averaging 12.4 points per game, third highest on the team, and three rebounds a contest. \nIn terms of her solid play so far this season, the motivation for Raring has been simple. \n\u201cIt\u2019s my last shot,\u201d Raring said. \nRowan has a very young team, it\u2019s clear to see that as they have nine underclassmen out of 14 total roster spots. Raring recognizes that and has embraced the role of being a senior captain. \n\u201cWe have a very young team so me and the older girls know it\u2019s important for us to step up and be big leaders,\u201d Raring said. \u201cThat is definitely a big role for me this year.\u201d \nUnder head coach Gabby Lisella, Raring has yet to experience a losing season. This season marks Lisella\u2019s 18th season as Rowan\u2019s head coach and recruited Raring out of Mainland Regional High School. Raring has loved being able to play under Lisella, for the entirety of her college career. \n\u201cPlaying for Gab has been awesome,\u201d Raring said. \u201cShe is very open and adaptive. She loves listening to what we have to say and always adapts to us.\u201d \nThe senior knows this is her fourth and final year playing basketball at Rowan University. She is very proud of her four years here and the bond she\u2019s made with her team. \n\u201cWhat I\u2019m most proud about is how much fun I\u2019ve had every year here at Rowan,\u201d Raring said. \u201cEvery team I\u2019ve been a part of, no matter what year it is, I\u2019ve had fun. There\u2019s been a family type bond every year.\u201d \nAlong with basketball, Raring played soccer and field hockey in high school. However, playing basketball in college was an easy choice. \n\u201cI\u2019ve just always had so much fun playing basketball,\u201d Raring said. \u201cI wanted to extend the fun I get out of playing as long as I possibly could.\u201d \nFor comments/questions   sports@thewhitonline.com or tweet @TheWhitOnline .

Yesterday, Drea Smith couldn\u2019t do anything spectacular\u2014even walking and texting at the same time was a challenge. But today, she suddenly has more answers than Google, can speak and understand numerous languages, and she can fight. Like a boss. Super freaky. Drea has no idea where her encyclopedic knowledge has come from, but she\u2019ll take it when she discovers someone out there knows her secret and wants her badly. And that they\u2019ve been searching for her since she was born. Since she was created. With the help of her best friend Dylan, who just wants to keep her safe, and Maddox, a mysterious new boy who is prepared to get her answers, Drea will have to push her new skills to their limit as she uncovers nothing is quite what it seems. As she uncovers\u2026Eugenica. Get Preorder Info Here! \n\n\nExclusive Excerpt : \u201cRight on. I\u2019m Maddox.\u201d He extends his hand toward me. Right on? Who says that? And who shakes hands unless they\u2019re meeting an adult? A guy with perfect hair and bright white teeth does. And he\u2019s smiling at me. Waiting for me to say something, do something. Crap. I extend my hand. Please don\u2019t let it be sweaty. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Alexandrea.\u201d As soon as he takes it, something inside me ignites. I barely passed chemistry, but it\u2019s the only word I can use to describe the feeling. It\u2019s not a connection, it\u2019s something deeper. Stronger. More powerful. Like energy maybe. And it\u2019s hot like fire. I pull my hand away and grip my fist to my chest. Maddox Georgas has a beautiful smile, model worthy. But when he sees my confused expression, it falters some. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d \u201cJust\u2026I\u2019m not much of a Shakespeare scholar.\u201d The warmth that ignited my skin when we shook hands is gone now. It was nerves, that\u2019s all. \u201cYou might regret this.\u201d His smile widens again as he sweeps an arm toward the door. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\nAbout AM Rose: \nA.M.

Sunlight triggers the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in charge of boosting your mood. When the sun goes down at night, serotonin converts to melatonin\u2014a hormone that makes us sleepy. The next morning, the arrival of daylight converts melatonin back to serotonin, giving us the get-up-and-go we need to make it through the day. \nRELATED: How to Get More Sunlight During the Day \nWhat do carbohydrates have to do with all of this? In Rosenthal\u2019s 1984 study, 79 percent of participating SAD sufferers complained of heightened carbohydrate cravings. And there's a reason your body wants them. Consuming carbohydrates boosts the availability of the amino acid tryptophan, which is what sunlight converts to mood-boosting serotonin and vitamin B6. The problem is, you\u2019re not consuming anything that contains high levels of tryptophan, says Gedgaudas. \nThe best sources for tryptophan are seafood, poultry, grass-fed meats, leafy greens, and green vegetables such as asparagus and broccoli. But because SAD causes you to crave refined carbs, you eat less of those healthy foods and as a result, your body has no tryptophan to turn into serotonin. Because of this, your energy levels plummet and you feel bad. \"So you feel tired and you feel out of it, and you feel like you want to be sleeping. You\u2019re depressed,\" she says. \nWhile Gedgaudas thinks refined carbs should be eliminated permanently, if that's not an option for you, it still is a good idea to cut back in the winter, particularly for SAD sufferers. Even though refined carbohydrates give you energy and provide a short-term mood lift, they're really just a \"short term fix,\" Gedgaudas says. \"White rice, potatoes, cereal, pasta\u2014you can kind of look upon those as being like paper on a fire,\" she says. They tend to flood your system with tons of energy all at once, and then you experience a blood sugar crash that causes you to crave more carbs, and the cycle goes on and on. Even carbohydrates such as brown rice and beans can have the same effect, she says, but at less severe levels. What's more, she adds, \"grain-based diets are part of the reason people are so deficient in tryptophan. Grains don't contain this essential amino acid, and eating grain-based diets depletes tryptophan.\" \nInstead, Gedgaudas suggests a more efficient energy source: fat\u2014a long-lasting, even-burning fuel. Healthy fats, such as organic coconut oil and ghee (Indian clarified butter), along with grass-fed meats provide all the tryptophan your body needs at a consistent level, keeping your mood elevated. In fact, a study in the Journal of Affective Disorders found that giving volunteers tryptophan supplements was as effective as light therapy for treating SAD. \nRELATED: How Much Fat, Protein, and Healthy Fats Should You Be Eating? \nThe fuel switch is not always easy. Cravings for starchy or sugary treats can be intense for the first few days, but that goes away, says Gedgaudas. While you're transitioning, add healthy fats such as coconut oil to healthy complex carbohydrates; doing so will slow down your body's absorption of carbohydrates, resulting in a longer, steadier energy burn. \"Taking omega-3s for SAD I think is quite important, as well,\" she adds. They improve your body's serotonin receptors and help ward off depression. (Need some extra motivation? Check out the Cyclist's Bucket List and get out there!) \nOf course carbohydrates are just one piece to the SAD puzzle. There are lots of other ways you can lighten seasonal depression, if giving up carbs isn't doable. Getting more sunlight is essential, whether it\u2019s through spending more time by the window, incorporating a walk everyday or investing in a full spectrum lightbox for your desk at work.

December 7, 2017 \nThe University of Rhode Island\u2019s men\u2019s basketball game against Providence College sold out of student wristbands for last Saturday\u2019s game. Fifty of those sold-out student wristbands were offered to the University\u2019s athletics department on a first-come, first-serve basis. The result: at least two student athletes sold tickets for more than face value. \nIt\u2019s common for students to buy tickets for events and sell them to others to make a profit. Although this isn\u2019t encouraged, it still happens. However, when student athletes take the same action, there can be consequences. According to the NCAA regulations, the 16.2.2.4 sale above face value nonpermissible procedure states that \u201ca student-athlete may not purchase tickets for an athletics contest from the institution and then sell the tickets at a price greater than their face value.\u201d \n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen this happen before,\u201d said Paul Kassabian, associate athletic director and the University\u2019s NCAA compliance. \u201cThis is the first time.\u201d \nThere were three means of receiving wristbands for the PC game: Rhody Ruckus, a student booster group where members automatically receive a wristband and their membership fee increased $10, 50 student athlete wristbands and regular student admission. \nNCAA regulations state that it is legal to give student athletes early access to tickets. According to Thorr Bjorn, director of athletics, those tickets were handed out at random and not all athletes were able to obtain a wristband. They were able to be picked up on Friday on a first-come, first-serve basis for those athletes who had practice early in the morning on Saturday and were unable to stand in line like all other students. That morning, however, two student athletes posted to Facebook groups for the different graduating classes about selling their free tickets. One even was advertising to sell four wristbands when the student was only supposed to be allowed one. \n\u201cThe intent is not for them to give it away,\u201d Bjorn said. \nTypically, the Ryan Center allows for a certain number of tickets to be sold to the public and students before allowing more students in. For example, here\u2019s a case where the Ryan Center intends to sell 7,500 tickets with 1,500 of those being student tickets for the student section. If the student section sold out and the event only sold 3,000 tickets total between students and the general public, the Center will allow more students to come and sit in other sections not designated for students. It guarantees students free admission to all other basketball games. \n\u201cAs long as there are tickets available, we don\u2019t charge students,\u201d Bjorn said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want to pull away the opportunity to pull away student tickets.\u201d \nThe Cigar reached out to the student athletes who offered the wristbands to the public for a comment but there was no response. \nKassabian intends to inform student athletes of their rights. \u201cThis is not a permissible behavior if they violate NCAA rules,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are ramifications. If there are allegations of wrongdoing, we will investigate if there\u2019s evidence.\u201d \nThe athletics department and the NCAA compliance are currently looking into the situation.

The Shenkar design school graduate is credited with challenging traditional design techniques and taking fashion innovation to new depths, creating \u201cfashion art\u201d with intricate hand-tracings. \nThe lacy lingerie collection (created with black Flexy plastic, which comes with the pen), which include \u201cdelicate and volumetric lace items, based on classic textile design imagery (flora and fauna),\u201d according to Saadon, has already earned her much acclaim, but the textile designer continues to call attention to the 3D design implement because of its eco-friendly, cost-effective and innovative nature. \n\u201cInnovation is something very important to me,\u201d Saadon tells NoCamels, referencing the late Israeli president Shimon Peres\u2019s oft-repeated sentiment that Jews and Israelis look for ways to make positive changes because they aren\u2019t satisfied with the status quo. \u201cThe greatest contribution of Jews to the world is \u2018dissatisfaction\u2019 because it is the source of creativity,\u201d he once said. \nSaadon says she wants \u201cto be a part of the amazing things happening here in Israel. I\u2019m always looking around to see what we already have in our world in order to work it into my process.\u201d \nEngineering and design \nSaadon didn\u2019t start off as a designer. She was more focused on engineering and tech and almost studied electrical engineering at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. But a style tour with her mother that included a behind-the-scenes look at the Tel Aviv fashion world convinced her she wanted to move into textiles and she enrolled at the prestigious Shenkar College of Engineering, Design, and Art in Ramat Gan where she majored in weaving. It wasn\u2019t until her fourth year at the distinguished design school that she realized engineering and design are quite similar and can go hand in hand. \nSEE ALSO: The Future of Food? How New Israeli Tech Could Have You Eating Meals Made By A 3D Printer \nSaadon says she happened upon the 3Doodler as she was working out what to do her final graduation project. She came across an Internet commercial featuring a child drawing a 3-dimensional model of the Eiffel Tower using the 3D pen. After learning how to produce fabric structures made of yarn using intricate weaving, knitting, and flatting techniques, the simplicity of the pen struck her, she says, and she ordered one. \nSaadon\u2019s first garment was a bra, she reveals, because even if she didn\u2019t know at first what she was making, she felt it was easier to test her capabilities on a smaller garment that could be fully functional. \nSaadon\u2019s first garment using the 3Doodler pen was a bra. (Photo: Courtesy) \nShe eventually created her entire final project, 3DLace, a line of feminine lace undergarment items hand-made with yarn, using this 3D printing technique. \nThe process \nThe process of creating a handmade, one-of-a-kind haute couture piece can be painstaking and time-consuming, though Saadon says she likes the detail of it. \u201cYou need a lot of patience,\u201d she explains, noting that she can spend as much as 10 hours a day in the studio working on her garments. \u201cYou need to know what to do, how to paint, so you don\u2019t make mistakes. I did a lot of experimenting to understand what parts need to be more flexible.\u201d \nInitially dissatisfied with the thin polymer plastic, Flexy, that comes with the pen \u2013 which looks like a cross between a thick marker and a portable glue gun \u2013 Saadon experimented polymers called PLA and ABS, known in the field of 3D printing, to find material that would maintain functionality and shape, but still be somewhat flexible. She only realized that the Flexy was the best plastic for her creations with further experimentation. It allowed her to produce surfaces having textile qualities like draping, movement, flexibility, and lightness, even while drawing a 3D structure of varying density. \n(Photo: Your Best Digs) \nSaadon says she never really knows what she is creating until she is well into the process. \u201cI start to design with materials and work with my hand before deciding what I will actually make \u2014 a dress, an accessory, a piece of clothing. The potential comes with my experimentation with plastic. There are no stitches so the garments are custom made based on Saadon\u2019s personalization or a buyer\u2019s interest. \nHer lingerie collection includes floral shapes of plastic and materials that form webbing when draped over the body. Some are attached to nude tulle and mesh. \n(Photo: Doron Sieradzki) \nShe has also designed dresses with fish scales and fishtails to test the dense parts and loose parts of the fabric. According to Saadon, the fish tails fall away from the surface under the force of gravity due to the fabric\u2019s more dense nature. \nPresenting her projects to the world \nSaadon was in New York earlier this year to showcase her 3D designs at New York Fashion Tech Week and participate in New York Textile Month. In August, she was invited to present her work at the \u201cInternet of Fashion\u201d Meetup group on 5th Ave Microsoft store in Manhattan. Surprising her at the talk was Maxwell Bogue, the CEO of 3Doodler, who presented her with a 3D pen and invited her to the company offices. \nAccording to Saadon, Bogue said his team at WobbleWorks, the company that makes the 3Doodler, came up with the 3D pen when they were making designs for children in a 3D printer and wanted the kids to have an easier way to draw freely and make their own creations. Later, Saadon says, the 3Doodler team made modifications to the pen after receiving feedback from adults who were using it. \nSEE ALSO: Israeli Design Student Prints Brilliant Collection At Home \nWhile Saadon\u2019s pieces are novel in their own way, 3Doodler is aware that other fashion designers and artists are using the 3D pen for their own undertakings. Australian designer Erica Gray used ABS plastic in combination with the 3Doodler to create wearable art with skeletal and animal imagery for her futuristic Forms Organic series. Rachel Goldsmith used the 3Doodler for a collection of lamps and other fine art that was displayed in Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) design store windows. \nA model wearing Saadon\u2019s 3D floral lace designs (Photos: Doron Sieradzki) \n3D printer vs 3D pen \nSaadon shrugs off any comparisons to two Israeli designers who have made names for themselves through fashion collections created with a 3D printer, Danit Peleg and Noa Raviv , also Shenkar graduates. \nPeleg created the world\u2019s first entirely 3D printed fashion collection for her final project and now has a customization platform on her website for customers to personalize and order their own 3D garments. \nIn 2014, Raviv created a 3D print collection by manipulating digital images using computer modeling software developed by Stratasys, an international leader in 3D printing with research and development facilities in Israel. Her work has also been displayed in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. \nThe biggest difference between Saadon and the two designers, Saadon explains, is that their work is computer-based. \u201cI\u2019m using tech but it\u2019s the tool that I use. I work with my hands. I draw everything. They can repeat the designs that they do. The things that I\u2019ve done, I can\u2019t repeat them. They are more couture and handmade,\u201d she explains. \nDanit Peleg Liberte Jacket was created through a 3D printer and a computer, not by hand. (Photo: Courtesy) \nFollowing the success of her 3D lace collection, Saadon is now experimenting with new fabrics for different shapes and occasions, creating new flexible haute couture for bridalwear, swimwear, and shoes. She is also experimenting with the more advanced 3Doodler Pro, which can draw in metal, wood, nylon, and polycarbonate.

Mars? You\u2019re going to need good tires\u2026 \nExploration requires mobility. And whether you\u2019re on Earth or as far away as the Moon or Mars, you need good tires to get your vehicle from one place to another. Our decades-long work developing tires for space exploration has led to new game-changing designs and materials. Yes, we\u2019re reinventing the wheel\u2014here\u2019s why. Wheels on the Moon \nEarly tire designs were focused on moving hardware and astronauts across the lunar surface. The last NASA vehicle to visit the Moon was the Lunar Roving Vehicle during our Apollo missions . The vehicle used four large flexible wire mesh wheels with stiff inner frames. We used these Apollo era tires as the inspiration for new designs using newer materials and technology to better function on a lunar surface. Up springs a new idea \nDuring the mid-2000s, we worked with industry partner Goodyear to develop the Spring Tire , an airless compliant tire that consists of several hundred coiled steel wires woven into a flexible mesh, giving the tires the ability to support high loads while also conforming to the terrain. The Spring Tire has been proven to generate very good traction and durability in soft sand and on rocks. Spring Tires for Mars \nA little over a year after the Mars Curiosity Rover landed on Mars, engineers began to notice significant wheel damage in 2013 due to the unexpectedly harsh terrain. That\u2019s when engineers began developing new Spring Tire prototypes to determine if they would be a new and better solution for exploration rovers on Mars. \nIn order for Spring Tires to go the distance on Martian terrain, new materials were required. Enter nickel titanium , a shape memory alloy with amazing capabilities that allow the tire to deform down to the axle and return to its original shape. These tires can take a lickin\u2019 \nAfter building the shape memory alloy tire, Glenn engineers sent it to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\u2019s Mars Life Test Facility. It performed impressively on the punishing track. Why reinvent the wheel? It\u2019s worth it. \nNew, high performing tires would allow lunar and Mars rovers to explore greater regions of the surface than currently possible. They conform to the terrain and do not sink as much as rigid wheels, allowing them to carry heavier payloads for the same given mass and volume. Also, because they absorb energy from impacts at moderate to high speeds, there is potential for use on crewed exploration vehicles which are expected to move at speeds significantly higher than the current Mars rovers. Airless tires on Earth \nMaybe. Recently, engineers and materials scientists have been testing a spinoff tire version that would work on cars and trucks on Earth. Stay tuned as we continue to push the boundaries on traditional concepts for exploring our world and beyond. \nMake sure to follow us on Tumblr for your regular dose of space: http://nasa.tumblr.com . \n1) that\u2019s absolutely awesome. \n2) you\u2019re going to get roadkill guts in that eventually if you drive it around on Earth.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "moon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glenn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "goodyear", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jet propulsion laboratory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:41.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3be8511b7537cb88cbd07b0ccb8e95bdc48858f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpCWNuDdAtXGvCISu.d2IV0C_FDLY7EPDkALXazlkHWGNXCX2tHADc1e86N7JeoTjfZBrnzNPZg.CZCoCigsfRq1kiJd2pDCyFxdbY2_UuZnLi5yXu21tAWdtMM4tTrcfnYOBuOcgiKBKvkq0wnM0dQ2sk8wFh.9vg-", "site_full": "thewhitonline.com", "site": "thewhitonline.com", "site_section": "http://thewhitonline.com/feed", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "The Whit Online", "title": "Women\u2019s swimming and diving\u2019s Carlee Timmins and Alex Bambrick break two school records", "title_full": "Women\u2019s swimming and diving\u2019s Carlee Timmins and Alex Bambrick break two school records", "published": "2017-12-07T02:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://thewhitonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Miranda_Coughlan2.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3be8511b7537cb88cbd07b0ccb8e95bdc48858f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpCWNuDdAtXGvCISu.d2IV0C_FDLY7EPDkALXazlkHWGNXCX2tHADc1e86N7JeoTjfZBrnzNPZg.CZCoCigsfRq1kiJd2pDCyFxdbY2_UuZnLi5yXu21tAWdtMM4tTrcfnYOBuOcgiKBKvkq0wnM0dQ2sk8wFh.9vg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jaiden Campana", "published": "2017-12-07T02:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Women\u2019s swimming and diving\u2019s Carlee Timmins and Alex Bambrick break two school records", "text": "Women\u2019s swimming and diving\u2019s Carlee Timmins and Alex Bambrick break two school records By 0 741 Junior captain Miranda Coughlan swims during an event earlier this year. Coughlan came in third in the 100 freestyle at the WPI Gompei Invitational this past weekend. Photo courtesy of Sports Information \nOlympian and all-time great Michael Phelps once said, \u201cRecords are always made to be broken no matter what they are. Anybody can do anything that they set their mind to.\u201d \nWe\u2019re not sure if the Rowan women\u2019s swimming and diving team rehearsed or thought of this quote before the WPI Gompei Invitational this past weekend, but they sure did take a page out of Phelps\u2019 book and broke some school and personal records. \nSophomores Carlee Timmins and Alex Bambrick etched their names into the Rowan women\u2019s swimming and diving records. \nTimmins broke her own record, as well as Rowan\u2019s record, in the 500 freestyle with a time of 5:04.94. Her previous personal best was 5:08.19 in last year\u2019s Metropolitan Championships, which stood as the school\u2019s top record at the time as well. \n\u201cWhat I saw individually was Carlee swimming a best time and smashing her best records, both in the mile, 1,000 and 500,\u201d said Brad Bowser, head coach. \u201cShe dropped four seconds there [in the 500], nine seconds in her 1,000 and 16 in her mile. She had a really awesome meet.\u201d \nBambrick\u2019s performance in the 200 backstroke is what put her name on the top. She came in third at the meet, but her time of 2:06.42 broke her personal set last year of 2:10.49 and Rowan\u2019s record of 2:06.63 set back in 2011. \n\u201cSeeing Alex have a great last day in the 200 back, she had a great meet but her 200 back, breaking a school record and all, that was a huge accomplishment for her,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cBecause I know last year she had a rough time at Mets with being sick with the flu. For her to be able to come back this season and do that was really special to see.\u201d \nSophomore Megan Miller won the 50 breaststroke with a time of 30.44 and junior Miranda Coughlan finished third in the 100 freestyle with a time of 52.34. Unusual to this story by now, both times served as both swimmers\u2019 best times in their collegiate careers in those events. Miller\u2019s previous best in the 50 breaststroke was 32.14 last February, as Coughlan\u2019s best time in the 100 freestyle was 52.37 in last year\u2019s Metropolitan Championships. \n\u201cWe\u2019re 100 times better than where we were last year at this time,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cThe program is really seen a lot from that sophomore class and I think they are just a year older and a little bit more experienced. I see the fact that the girls are really performing at a higher level and we\u2019re itching to get into that national scene.

BEGINNING THE END The Queen will be in Portsmouth today as guest of honour at the commissioning of the UK\u2019s \u00a33bn new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth. But Theresa May has reportedly cancelled her trip to the event as she focuses instead on rescuing her \u2018Brexit breakthrough\u2019 plan.\nExactly a week away from the next EU summit, May\u2019s most pressing problem is on getting agreement on the Northern Ireland border issue. Irish PM Leo Varadkar said she\u2019d told him yesterday \u201cshe wants to come back to us with some text tonight or tomorrow\u201d, though he added that \u201cwe can of course pick it up in the New Year\u201d. And although the DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds described the delay suggestion as \u201ca dangerous game\u201d, his own party is briefing it can wait too. A DUP source has a rather blood-curdling line in the Sun: \u201cWe\u2019re going to slow it all down. This is a battle of who blinks first \u2014 and we\u2019ve cut off our eyelids.\u201d\nAlthough May is looking forwards not back, the blame game within Government is well underway as to how on earth this week\u2019s planned breakthrough could have collapsed. Several Tory MPs yesterday told me of their unhappiness with new Chief Whip Julian Smith, with one minister saying he failed to properly keep the DUP in the loop when tasked to brief them on Sunday. Some in the DUP also blame Damian Green, who is meant to coordinate with devolved governments, for the communications breakdown, but it\u2019s Smith that\u2019s in many sights now.\nAnd even if May can come up with a form of words that gets the DUP back on board to move Brussels talks onto \u2018Phase 2\u2019, that next phase could be much more tortuous for the PM. Philip Hammond let slip that the Cabinet hadn\u2019t even discussed, let alone agreed, on the \u2018end state\u2019 for Brexit. Yes, 18 months on from the EU referendum, our Government has not yet decided what kind of Brexit it wants.\nThe most notable feature of PMQs yesterday was the way May stressed the details of the Irish border issue could all be sorted in Phase 2 as part of wider UK-EU trade talks. That\u2019s because the Cabinet hasn\u2019t signed off such phrases as \u2018regulatory alignment\u2019. And Brexiteers think the DUP have done everyone a huge favour by focusing minds on what kind of trade we really want. Boris pushed back on \u2018alignment\u2019 in Cabinet on Tuesday, but Michael Gove kept his counsel, leaving others to suspect he was keeping his powder dry for the battle ahead over what the \u2018end state\u2019 will look like.\nChris Grayling insisted on Today that ministers \u201chave had detailed discussions discussing the European Union issue\u201d. Yet No10 told us yesterday the first \u2018end state\u2019 Cabinet discussion would take place by the end of the year. Brussels sounds even more intransigent on trade and transition than it does on the Irish border, divorce bill or citizens\u2019 rights. With Hammond pushing in the \u2018Norway\u2019 direction on trade, Brexiteers pushing in the \u2018Canada-plus\u2019 direction and Brussels, May\u2019s own future hangs in the balance as she tries to find a workable compromise. If she can\u2019t sort the end-state, early 2018 may be the beginning of the end of her premiership.\n 2. NEW MODEL ARMY David Davis is often seen as the leader of the Brexit Roundheads, full of military discipline and no-nonsense English pride. Well, after having reassured the Tory backbench troops on Tuesday that \u2018regulatory alignment\u2019 is not a phrase to fear, yesterday he faced heavy fire over those tricky Brexit \u2018assessments\u2019. Davis finally admitted that his Department had not conducted any formal assessments of the impact of Brexit on various sectors of the economy. But it was this argument that caught the ear: \u201cThe assessment of that effect is not as straightforward as people imagine. I am not a fan of economic models as they have all been proven wrong.\u201d\nDavis suggested there had been a \u2018qualitative\u2019 rather than \u2018quantitative\u2019 review of various sectors, though the value of this entire exercise was ridiculed on Twitter by Tory MP Sarah Wollaston (one of the few to read the documents). Davis added: \u201cWe will at some stage do the best we can to quantify the effect of different negotiating outcomes as we come up with them\u201d. Yet it looks like the Treasury has already done such work. In another bit of Philip Hammond\u2019s evidence that risked being missed yesterday, he revealed his officials had \u201cmodelled and analysed a whole range of potential alternative structures\u201d post-Brexit. He said that placing them in the public domain now would be \u201cdeeply unhelpful to the negotiation\u201d. Maybe Labour\u2019s next move is to demand the Treasury assessment documents be released \u2013 because they at least exist.\nFortunately for DD, his Tory (and DUP) allies on the Brexit committee spared his blushes and concluded he had not misled Parliament . Davis has long had a tight-knit band of followers, although the Sun has a report that suggests his loyal lieutenant Andrew Mitchell has overreached himself. One DD ally told younger MPs at a drinks reception that \u201cTheresa has the smell of death around her. She\u2019ll be gone by Christmas. It\u2019s time to rally around DD.\u201d Under one \u2018dream ticket\u2019 plan, Davis would take over as caretaker PM then hand over to a younger successor in time for the 2022 general election.\n 3. DISABLING HAMMOND Last month he declared \u2018there are no unemployed people\u2019. Yesterday, Philip Hammond\u2019s reputation for being politically tone deaf was confirmed as he responded like a desiccated calculating machine to questions about the UK\u2019s low productivity. The Chancellor replied that \u201cvery high levels of engagement in the workforce, for example of disabled people - something we should be extremely proud of - may have had an impact on overall productivity measurements\u201d. Jaws dropped, charities like Scope were dismayed and Labour\u2019s John Mann was swift to denounce his \u201cappalling\u201d comments.\nEven on his own dry economic measures, let alone the political optics of this, Hammond has been accused of being flat-out wrong, with the number of disabled people in work barely registering on productivity levels. Labour MP Marsha de Cordova, who has impaired sight, pointed out the disability employment gap has barely changed since productivity started to stall.\nAnd Hammond couldn\u2019t resist continuing another row yesterday with new Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson over military funding. In full-on Treasury patronising mode, he said he would chat to Williamson about spending \u201conce he has had a chance to understand the situation in the Ministry of Defence, and to get his head around the defence budget\u201d. Williamson has plenty of backbench enemies, but Hammond has many more. And it\u2019s all a reminder of how little classroom control the PM has over her ministers.\n Watch this plea for help from Syrian child refugees, part of our newly launched HuffPost/UNICEF Christmas appeal. Please give generously HERE .\n 4. SPEAK YOUR WAIT MACHINE The number of long A&E waits across the UK has more than doubled in the past four years, a new BBC analysis has revealed. More than three million patients who visited UK A&Es waited over four hours in the past 12 months - up by 120% since 2012-13. The Beeb has a handy tracker to let you search your local wait times. Winter \u2018crises\u2019 are one thing, but longer waiting times are the kind of slow-burn issue that really eats away at a Government\u2019s popularity, something Tony Blair spotted when he first drafted the targets in Opposition.\nOne minster told me yesterday \u201cI wet myself laughing when I saw the story that Jeremy Hunt wanted to be PM\u201d, adding the Health Secretary had \u201cno idea\u201d how toxic he was to the party\u2019s brand. What\u2019s no laughing matter is children\u2019s mental health. In a blog for HuffPost , Justine Greening has defended the Government\u2019s green paper on the subject, but today Labour\u2019s Jonathan Ashworth and Angela Rayner have posted their own blog , arguing that without \u201csignificant extra staffing and funding\u201d it\u2019s a missed opportunity.\n 5. WHIP LASHED Here\u2019s a bit of political trivia for you. Who is the longest continuously-serving member of Labour\u2019s frontbench? The answer is Steve Bassam, who was made a junior Home Office minister by Tony Blair in 1999 and rose to become Shadow Chief Whip in the Lords. Well, that 18-year record is coming to an end after the Labour peer announced he will quit following controversy over his expenses.\nBassam said late last night that he would step down in the New Year after the Mail on Sunday exposed he had been wrongly claiming the \u00a36,400 annual cost of travelling to and from his home in Brighton. He says he hasn\u2019t breached the rules but admits it would have been \u201cmore appropriate\u201d not to claim the money and has referred himself to the Standards Commissioner. Here\u2019s a quirk though: Jeremy Corbyn has no direct say in who replaces him in his Shadow Cabinet. Under party rules, it\u2019s up to fellow peers to pick his replacement, as his and the Shadow Lords leader role are both elected posts.\n .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

Guterres made the remarks in the wake of the announcement by the U.S. President Donald Trump recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The UN chief stressed that Jerusalem was an issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the parties. \u201cIn this moment of great anxiety, I want to make it clear: there is no alternative to the two-state solution. \u201cThere is no \u2018Plan B\u2019, Guterres said while speaking to the press at UN Headquarters in New York. The UN chief stressed the need to realise the vision of two states \u201cliving side-by-side in peace, security and mutual recognition, with Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and Palestine, and all final status issues resolved permanently through negotiations\u201d. According to him, it is only through that realisation that the legitimate aspirations of both peoples would be achieved. \u201cI understand the deep attachment that Jerusalem holds in the hearts of so many people. It has been so for centuries and it will always be,\u201d he added. He also noted that since he took up his post as UN Secretary-General, he had consistently spoken out against any unilateral measures that would jeopardise the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians. \u201cFor my part as the UN Secretary-General, I will do everything in my power to support the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to return to meaningful negotiations and to realise this vision of a lasting peace for both people,\u201d he stated. Trump had while announcing his recognition of Jerusalem as Israeli capital, said his decision marked \u201cthe beginning of a new approach to conflict between Israel and the Palestinians\u201d. He recalled that in 1995, Congress adopted the Jerusalem Embassy Act, urging \u201cthe federal government to relocate the American embassy to Jerusalem and to recognise that that city \u2013 and so importantly \u2013 is Israel\u2019s capital\u201d. According to him, the act was also passed in Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago. For over 20 years, every previous American president has exercised the law\u2019s waiver, refusing to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem or to recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital city. \nNAN.

Dr Jenkins graduated with a degree in medicine from St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital, University of London and subsequently trained in cardiovascular medicine in the U.K. National Health Service. \nDr Jenkins is a board member of several growing companies and a member of the Science Board to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA). She also serves on the board of the Center for Talent Innovation in the U.K. \nGregg Sando, CEO of Cell Medica, commented: \u201cWe are very pleased to have Annalisa join Cell Medica as we move forward with our next generation cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Her deep understanding and thought leadership in immuno-oncology drug development, as well as her board and executive leadership experience with innovative biotechnology companies, make Annalisa exceptionally well-qualified to serve as Chair of Cell Medica\u2019s Board.\u201d \u201cI would like to thank Dr Thomas Hecht for his seven years as Chairman of Cell Medica during which we have had to manage the company through the rapidly changing dynamics driving the cellular immunotherapy business. We are delighted that Thomas will remain on the Board as a much-valued member of the team.\u201d Dr Annalisa Jenkins commented: \u201cThe cell-based immunotherapy industry has come of age in 2017 with the first marketing approvals and a growing pipeline of exciting products in late stage development that address current patient unmet needs and gaps with available therapeutics. With a portfolio of differentiated and powerful technology platforms, including both chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and engineered T cell receptors (TCRs), Cell Medica is very well positioned to address these unmet needs and make a significant impact for cancer patients globally. I look forward to assisting the Company in developing and delivering the potential of its transformative cell-based immunotherapies.\u201d \nAbout Cell Medica Cell Medica is committed to transforming patients\u2019 lives through developing the significant therapeutic potential of cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer. We are advancing innovative cell-based therapies using proprietary technology platforms incorporating chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and engineered T cell receptors (TCRs). Our CAR-modified T cell products are being developed in collaboration with Baylor College of Medicine and University of North Carolina. Cell Medica\u2019s differentiated approach utilises NKT cells (a subset of T cells) engineered to express IL-15 to maintain cytotoxic function within the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Our CAR pipeline includes a unique off-the-shelf allogeneic product aimed at CD19 B cell lymphomas. In the field of engineered TCRs, our Dominant TCR platform technology, developed at University College London, improves the potency of TCR-modified T cells while maintaining the safety profile. Other technologies in our portfolio include the utilisation of EBV-specific T cells for the treatment of lymphomas associated with the Epstein Barr virus. Cell Medica is headquartered in London with subsidiaries in Zurich and Houston. \nIssued for and on behalf of Cell Medica by Instinctif Partners.

According to some, that\u2019s what the holidays in December mean to them: a time to spend with family and friends. To celebrate the good. To reconcile the bad and make resolutions for the new year. Many of us take the time to count our blessings. While it\u2019s nice to buy gifts for family, one big way to \u201cgive\u201d this holiday season is to give to someone we might not know. Take the extra time to deliver some cans to your local food bank, or even Rowan\u2019s SHOP. For some, the end of the year is a huge time of budget crunching. Many families might be eating less. \u201cAdopt\u201d a child and buy them gifts. Many churches and non-profit organizations \u201cadopt\u201d children who are in hospitals over the holidays. Participate in this. The children usually create a wish list and a donor can buy them some gifts that create holiday cheer. There are also ways to help others even if you don\u2019t feel you have the financial means. Volunteer at a soup-kitchen that serves Christmas dinner. Bake some cookies for your local police force, EMS services or firefighters. Take it to their office as a way to say thank you for your service. Be kind! People get stressed during the holiday season. Even though you might be too, taking the extra time to smile at someone or ask them how they\u2019re doing goes a long way. Give a Christmas gift to your mail carrier. That individual manages to get your mail to you every day of the year \u2014 snow or shine. By simply giving them some tea or writing a card is a small gesture that can go a long way. Hold a charity event! If you sell t-shirts you design, vow to give 10 percent of your proceeds to a charity you care about. When you\u2019re shopping for your relatives, shop at stores that participate in free trade. Not only are these gifts generally masterfully crafted, but they also help support workers in developing nations. Donate your old coats to the Salvation Army or Goodwill. Winter is cold in New Jersey. By giving that coat that sits in the back of your closet to a local charity, this can help ensure someone else stays warm throughout the holiday. Regardless of the means, giving to others could be someone else\u2019s greatest Christmas or Hanukkah gift this season. Some are less fortunate. \nFor questions/comments about this story, email editor@thewhitonline.com or tweet @TheWhitOnline.

Booth, the only senior on the Rowan men\u2019s basketball team, is having a standout, all-star caliber (maybe even division MVP) year. The week ending Nov. 26, he was named the New Jersey Athletic Conference (NJAC) Men\u2019s Basketball Player of the week, as he averaged 18.5 points and 8.5 rebounds in the team\u2019s two games. Both were Rowan victories. During his four years at Rowan, he\u2019s been under the tutelage of two different head coaches and three winning teams. Joe Crispin is in his second year as head coach for the Profs, while Booth\u2019s coach for his rookie and sophomore seasons was Joe Cassidy, who now serves as the team\u2019s associate head coach. \u201cGoing from being coached by coach Cassidy and coach Crispin, it wasn\u2019t that big of a transition, since [Crispin] was still on our coaching staff the first two seasons,\u201d Booth said. \u201cI already knew who he was. Between the two, the style of the play became faster although the practices were similar.\u201d Among NJAC qualifiers, Booth ranks fourth best behind teammate Ramon Wright in defensive rebounds per game (7.0), sixth best in rebounds per game (8.3), 10th in shooting percentage (.509), and second best in three-point percentage (.500). He compares his style of play to Golden State Warriors\u2019 forward Draymond Green. According to Booth, Crispin assigns a staff member on a regular basis to watch NBA games and take notes, and Crispin noted similarities between the two players. \u201cWe\u2019re both role players who can drive to the basket, but also step outside and shoot threes if need be,\u201d Booth said in regards to his comparison of Green. Booth analyzed his four years as an athlete at Rowan by first delving into his frustrations throughout his first two seasons. \u201cOver the past four years, it\u2019s been very different, but more stable for me over the past two seasons,\u201d Booth said. \u201cMy first year we had a lot of guys that left prior to that, we had all new starters, and it was a new yet difficult start for me.\u201d As for being the lone senior on the team, Booth strives in the role and has been preparing himself for being a leader on and off the floor. \u201cBeing the only senior here, I don\u2019t find it to be difficult at all,\u201d Booth said. \u201cI like the role. I like giving the young guys some pointers, as the older guys did it for me when I was younger, so I like to give back.\u201d Along with brothers Rob and Nick DePersia, Booth is the co-captain of the team. The senior forward was honored as the Sam Cozen Player of the Week on Dec. 5, by the Philadelphia Area Small College Coaches Association. Booth grew up in nearby Williamstown, New Jersey, lettering in three sports and was named high school all-conference second-team honors for basketball. After he completes his college degree, he plans on going into medical school. \nFor comments/questions   sports@thewhitonline.com or tweet @TheWhitOnline .
