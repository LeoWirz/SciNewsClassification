Microsoft Expression Encoder was introduced at NAB 2007. Microsoft Expression Studio was released to manufacturing (RTM) on April 30, 2007. The RTM news was announced at Microsoft's MIX 07 conference for web developers and designers.\nMicrosoft Expression Studio 2 was released on May 1, 2008, which also included a graphical makeover for the suite to an inverse of the previous black-on-white theme. This release brings all products in the suite to version 2, and now also includes Visual Studio Standard 2008. Microsoft Expression Studio is also available to students as downloads via Microsoft's DreamSpark program.\nMicrosoft Expression Studio 3 was released on July 22, 2009, This release brings all products in the suite to version 3, with significant improvements especially targeting Silverlight 3. Expression Media is no longer a part of package, while all other products have been significantly improved and enriched.\nOn June 7, 2010, Expression Studio 4 was released. Expression Studio 4 is a free upgrade version for licensed Expression Studio 3 users, but only for retail copies.\nEnd of life On December 20, 2012, Microsoft announced that the Expression products would be discontinued, with Blend becoming a standalone tool with Visual Studio 2012 Update 2, Expression Studio 4 Ultimate and Expression Studio 4 Web Professional no longer available for sale but supported through their support lifecycle, Expression Design 4 and Expression Web 4 available as unsupported free editions, Expression Encoder 4 Pro available for purchase through 2013, Expression Encoder 4 remains available for download at no charge.\nEditions \n\nsource : Microsoft Expression Web 2 (PHP support) | Screenshots Archive \nAs of version 4, there are two editions of Expression Studio available to general public: Web Professional and Ultimate \nExpression Studio Web Professional consists of:\nExpression Web, HTML editor and web design program Expression Design, vector graphics editor Expression Encoder Pro, video editing tool for authoring VC-1 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC contents Expression Studio Ultimate consist of all previous components, as well as:\nExpression Blend, graphical user interface builder for XAML or HTML applications SuperPreview, complementary web design program for testing compatibility and performance SketchFlow, complementary user interface tool that facilitate workflow design Expression Encoder and SuperPreview are the only components that can be obtained individually. Expression Encoder consists of two editions: A freeware edition and a commercial Pro edition.\nPrior to version 3, the suite also consisted of Microsoft Expression Media, a digital asset management application sold to Phase One.\nFeatures \n\nsource : Microsoft Expression Web - latest version 2017 free download \nUntil version 2, Expression Web was the only application in the Expression Studio suite based on Microsoft Office code and dependencies. With version 3, Expression Web was rewritten in Windows Presentation Foundation, in line with the rest of the Expression Suite, without Microsoft Office dependencies, essentially making it a new managed code program. A result of the complete rewrite was features like customizable toolbars and menus, standard Windows color scheme, spell check, DLL addins, file menu export feature, drag-and-drop between remote sites, comparing sites by timestamp were removed in this version. Other features do not work reliably or are incomplete, like Undo for instance. Version 3 introduced Expression Web 3 SuperPreview tool for comparing and rendering webpage in various browsers. Also noted was the lack of support for root relative links, links that start with a \"/\" to refer to the root of a web server. This feature was added with Expression 3 Service Pack 1.\nThe version of Expression Encoder Pro 4 available as part of Expression Studio in programs like DreamSpark, BizSpark, WebsiteSpark and through MSDN Ultimate does not include royalty incurring codec and standards support for exporting in MP4 format (H.264 video and AAC audio). It also does not include import filters for TS, M2TS, AVCHD, MPEG-2, and AC-3 although if third party DirectShow filters are installed, it is able to import these formats as is the free version. Expression Encoder Pro version available in retail does not have these limitations. The free version available to everyone and included in MSDN Premium lacks IIS Live Smooth Streaming and unlimited screen capture.\nWith the release of Expression Studio 4, three editions of Expression Studio were introduced: Expression Studio 4 Web Professional (includes Expression Encoder, Design and Web), Expression Studio 4 Premium (adds Blend to the suite) and Expression Studio 4 Ultimate (adds SketchFlow). MSDN subscribers receive only the SKU of Expression Studio 4 that corresponds to their Visual Studio 2010 license. As such, MSDN Premium users do not get SketchFlow.\nSome editions of Expression Studio also include product activation.\nSee also \n\nsource : Microsoft Expression Web Alternatives and Similar Software ... \nRelatives Microsoft FrontPage, the predecessor to Expression Web Creature House Expression, the predecessor to Expression Design iView Media, the predecessor to Expression Media Lists List of vector graphics editors Comparison of vector graphics editors Comparison of office suites References \n\nsource : Image Gallery Microsoft Expression 4 \nExternal links \n\nsource : Setting Up Expression Web 4.0 \nOfficial website Expression Blend and Design on MSDN Blogs Expression Encoder on MSDN Blogs \n\nsource : Download Free Microsoft Expression Blend, Microsoft Expression ...

In the US, a nationwide science fair will tie in with the book\u2019s release. \n\u201cThese books are the most important work I\u2019ve ever done. They\u2019re an accessible, fun way to engage kids \u2014 particularly girls, who are too often dissuaded from pursuing their interest in science \u2014 in an adventure that weaves science, technology, and history,\u201d said the author in a statement quoted by the industry source. \nThe news follows a recent announcement from publishers of the Mr. Men and Little Miss book series that a new character, \u201cLittle Miss Inventor,\u201d will debut in March 2018 with a similar goal of encouraging girls\u2019 involvement in STEM subjects. \nBefore Patterson\u2019s as-yet-untitled book is published, he has another high-profile book hitting shelves: his joint thriller with former US president Bill Clinton, \u201cThe President is Missing,\u201d is due out in June, with a television adaptation already in the works from Showtime.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "james patterson", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "einstein", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "patterson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max einstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert einstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill clinton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "publishers weekly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "little miss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "showtime", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:15.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0cf245aa3394349781be398ab8e13fa67d6c26c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mtwpVP3F9EOzqP8qg136iZk", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp; Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "MEGA thread", "title_full": "/co/ - MEGA thread - Comics & Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T04:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 119, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "41241fce80702ca8a12629d8617491f6212a3dfc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mtwpVP3F9EOzklUTiR4XOCG5qpcqOhi7z8-", "ord_in_thread": 40, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-06T15:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>97310206\nso in the OP I say we give people the same instructions, throw the links behind links.snahp.it or further obfuscate them to prevent scraping", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:15.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd233414a131aaaf96f566a3d8f77f2b93cf57d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9rBLL4XXjNUD8HccsGlOCdJWXf9FXdCNQRzAMyXpR94ptkzT5iqX3QtBpQuCkgqVxa5FyHCa.2nUjaG0ccoYsyN8CbuAEER7tAgqYuQquWnjlyGjVCTUYA", "site_full": "www.audizine.com", "site": "audizine.com", "site_section": "http://www.audizine.com/forum/forumdisplay.php/163-B8-S4", "site_categories": ["auto_racing", "sports"], "section_title": "B8 S4", "title": "H&R Street Performance vs Bilstein b12", "title_full": "H&R Street Performance vs Bilstein b12", "published": "2017-12-07T01:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.025, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 30572, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "43ec4f1e83b94e973fb9fdd8e4a46c33b3ab323f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9rBLL4XXjNUD8HccsGlOCdJWXf9FXdCNQRzAMyXpR94ptkzT5iqX3QtBpQuCkgqVxa5FyHCa.2nUjaG0ccoYsyN8CbuAEER7tAgqYuQquWnuiWtJmeG4WgOwHRxHlwC79vxDij8jwwpw--", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "SteveYem", "published": "2017-12-07T05:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I like the idea and price of the B12 kit, but wish either the front was lower or the rear was higher to even out the tire-fender gap front and rear.

Photo: Reuters/Carl Recine \nMANCHESTER - Manchester United have refused a film crew behind-the-scenes access at Old Trafford in what could be construed as an act of derby-day point-scoring. \nManchester City are four months into a \u00a310million, season-long documentary series produced by Amazon Prime, charting their second campaign with Pep Guardiola in charge. \nBut in a serious blow, they will be unable to capture intimate moments before or after Sunday\u2019s clash. \nGuardiola\u2019s side can go 11 points clear at the top of the Premier League with victory, and exclusive clips of what could be a significant day would have been priceless. United sources last night said the rejection was a logistical decision. \nThey claim 23 rights-holders, 19 of which are foreign broadcasters, will already be in the tunnel area. It means the Amazon crew will not be allowed into Guardiola\u2019s dressing-room either. They are believed to have a station pitchside to shoot footage. \nGuardiola heads across town having led City to wins in all seven of their away matches so far, and 14 out of 15 in all, but United midfielder Paul Pogba believes their lead in the table is surmountable. \nThe Frenchman will miss the first of three matches after being suspended for stamping on Arsenal\u2019s Hector Bellerin last Saturday. However, Pogba is preparing to act as an extension of Jose Mourinho\u2019s backroom staff in the build-up. \n\"I will be there to help the team mentally. I need to be there to boost the team. I have complete trust in them. They need to win because they know that we are behind and we are closing,\" Pogba said. \nPogba added that United, who boast seven home league wins on the spin with a positive goal difference of 19, will go out to attack City. \n\"We need to,\" he said. \"To win those games you need to give everything. You need to be there offensively, defensively. Kill the game when you have one chance because they have quality as well in front and they can kill the game at any time.\" \nJuan Mata maintained anyone handing the title to City already is kidding themselves. \n\"If they say that I don\u2019t think they really believe it,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a crazy league and it\u2019s too early to think that it\u2019s finished. \n\"City will tell you the same.

Technically, a paragraph could be one sentence, but in an academic essay that rarely happens. But it could be any length you want, as long as you're still on that one topic, as long as you still have things to write and things to say about that topic, say it. If you have four sentences, fine; if you have 10 sentences, also okay. Again, for IELTS, TOEFL, SAT students: four, five sentences should be your limit. You can't be too long because you don't have time and you're going to start making mistakes. It also builds your confidence.

Photo: Reuters \nDONETSK, Ukraine - Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola showed no disappointment after a 2-1 Champions League defeat by Shakhtar Donetsk ended his team's unbeaten run in all competitions this season. \nThe result also spoiled Guardiola's milestone 100th appearance as a manager in Europe's premier club competition but the Spaniard was still delighted with the performances of second-string players in his makeshift side. \n\"I'm so pleased for Tosin (Adarabioyo), Phil (Foden) and Brahim (Diaz) and how well they played,\" he told BT Sport. \"We came here to win. We couldn't but we were trying until the end to do so. I'm happy for the performance.\" \nCity were already assured of finishing as Group F winners and with one eye on Sunday's Premier League Manchester derby against United, Guardiola rested his entire first-choice back four. \nThe shuffle played into Shakhtar's hands as they launched waves of attacks on City's rearguard, who looked completely at sea and rode their luck before Bernard fired the home side ahead with a superb shot from 15 metres. \nCity keeper Ederson gifted Shakhtar a second as Ismaily took advantage to tighten the Ukrainian champions' grip on a knockout-stage berth before Sergio Aguero blasted a late penalty for the visitors. \nShifting his attention to the United game, Guardiola refused to be drawn into billing City as Champions League favourites heading into Monday's last-16 draw in Nyon, Switzerland. \n\"Now we are going to rest, come back and prepare for the game (against Manchester United),\" he said. \"It always happens when the draw (is made) \u2013 they talk about it but it depends how the team arrives at that moment, on that day. \n\"Maybe you are good today but in February, you\u2019re a disaster.

To be clear this WOULD NOT FORCE you to play any hero nor would restrict your selection. It's just simply a way where the system can avoid having 3 player that chose \"I would prefer NOT to tank\"\n- This would presume a necessary composition in order to function\n- Would lengthen queue times for people selecting popular roles\n- People could just ignore or abuse this system for better queue times.\n- Skill in OW isn't about what you prefer to play, but what is needed to be played.\n12/06/2017 09:08 PM Posted by SilntSoldier * It seems the developers will live or die with the current MMR/SR ranking system: The community at large detests the current manipulation of the system and yet there is no transparency nor an indication that it will be changed or modified.\nThe groups that \"detests\" the MMR/SR system are just the subset of people wanting to blame something they refuse to understand no matter how many times the devs explain, re-explain, and explicitly tell them what is/isn't happening. There is no lack of transparency. Only willful ignorance.\nIf you don't have decay/penalties then your SR/MMR are effectively the same number. Matchmaking would be no different if it was a single rating system using just a visible MMR with the exception that decay/penalty systems would skew the accuracy of the system and would probably have to be remove.\n12/06/2017 09:08 PM Posted by SilntSoldier * HIGH Ranks should be attained by MORE than just SR: To qualify for Diamond, there should be more requirements such as \"at least two hours in each category class.\" For Masters, there should be even more requirements such as three or more hours in each category class, etc. The fact that SR is the one and EXCLUSIVE way to get to the higher levels is not what this game needs. A \"Master\" player should know when to flex, when to counter, and other details that would make him a true \"master\" of the game.\nAn interesting concept, but the requirements seem arbitrary and wouldn't have a lasting effect. It would just be a quota that everyone ignored once they fulfilled them.\n12/06/2017 09:08 PM Posted by SilntSoldier Lastly and equally important, the community (i.e. the players) really need to change. The lack of effort even at high diamond and masters games; the unwillingly to collaborate or play as a team; and the \"ego\" nature that I see in nearly all games is not conducive to a fun match. Many would say that the players are a product of the current system, maybe so, but man I just want to have fun and feel like I played in a fair match.\nPart of the problem is that one-tricking is a natural behavior in video games. It is a way people give their online persona an identity. You can look at any multiplier game with a class or role structure and there will be people who strive to specialize in a specific one and be known as a great player at X. So this isn't intrinsically poor behavior being exhibited.\nThe other part is that OW is a team co-op game where the individual offensively lacks power to contest enemy groups consistently, i.e. not going to ace the enemy team by yourself.

For other uses, see Summer Knight . \nSummer Knight is the fourth novel in The Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher , [1] published in 2002. It has thirty-four chapters. Contents [ show ] Plot \nIt's two years after the events in Storm Front . Harry Dresden , struggling with curing Susan Rodriguez of her vampirism infection, is approached by Mab , the Winter Queen . Mab purchased Dresden\u2019s debt from his fairy godmother, Leanansidhe . Queen Mab tells Dresden he can pay off his debt by doing three favors. The first favor is for him to find the murderer of the Summer Knight , Ronald Reuel , and recover his stolen mantle, declaring Dresden her chosen Emissary. Dresden refuses her request, but is forced by the White Council to accept as his Trial, else be stripped of his title of wizard and handed over to the Red Court vampires as a peace offering. \nAt his home, Dresden finds Elaine Mallory , his former fellow apprentice and lover, who is the Emissary of the Summer Court and heavily indebted to Aurora , the Summer Lady . Dresden goes to Reuel's funeral, looking for a group of teenage half-human/half-Fae changelings who were Reuel's friends, but they flee and attack, believing him to be in service to Winter. Dresden gets information and a guide to the Winter and Summer Ladies. Dresden\u2019s interview with the sadistic Winter Lady , Maeve , convinces him that she did not kill the Summer Knight. \nApproached by the changelings to find their friend Lily , after Dresden tells Meryl and Fix that he will look for Lily. Dresden discovers Elaine in the back seat of his car, dying of multiple stab wounds. He follows Elaine\u2019s delirious advice to take her to the Summer Lady, Aurora. Aurora heals Elaine, and briefly comforts Dresden. She is not forthcoming with any details on Reuel\u2019s murder or Lily\u2019s disappearance. Instead, she explains that the death of the Summer Knight and the theft of his mantle of power shifted the power balance in favor of Winter. Summer must now attack Winter at Midsummer to maintain control over their remaining power. \nDresden heads north to an isolated spot on Lake Michigan and summons his fairy godmother, Leanansidhe . Dresden tells his godmother that he needs to see the Faerie Queens and Mothers. Leanansidhe instead takes him transported to an ethereal Chicago-over-Chicago and a great Stone Table . This sacrificial stone that maintains the balance between the Winter and Summer Sidhe. The power of blood spilled upon that table will change the balance of power between the Courts. Leanansidhe says she can do no more for him and disappears. \nDresden still needs to speak with the Mothers of both Courts. He tracks Elaine to O'Hare International Airport and persuades her to call in some favors so he can get an invitation to see the Mothers. Rather than provide him with answers, they goad him into answering his own questions, that Aurora is the only Queen capable of stealing the Summer Knight's mantle, and therefore one of his killers. Lily captured the mantle, being the closest Summer fae at the time of his death, and was turned to stone by Aurora, which is why no one could find either Lily or the mantle. As a reward for his correct deductions, they give him a Cloth of Unraveling and their blessings. \nVictorious at last, Dresden returns to Elaine and is ambushed. When Dresden regains consciousness, he is the prisoner of Aurora, the Winter Knight Lloyd Slate \u2014and Elaine, who has been coerced into helping with the plot. Aurora explains that she plans to sacrifice Lily on the Table to give Winter the power of the Summer Knight, permanently destroying the balance and freeing humanity from the constant collateral damage of the eternal Faerie War. Elaine then binds Dresden and leaves him to drown. Recognizing the spell he and Elaine invented, Dresden easily escapes. Collecting his friends, they fight their way to the Stone Table and the Winter Queen, telling her of Aurora's plan. Dresden confronts Aurora and unleashes an army of pixies armed with steel-bladed box cutters--cold iron, which is deadly to the Fae. \nAfter the pixies kill Aurora, Queen Mab congratulates Dresden on his success, and offers Dresden the mantle of the Winter Knight, which he refuses. Queen Mab grants safe passage to the White Council. Having passed his Trial, he retains his wizard accolades, and protection from the Red Court. The new Summer Lady, Lily, and her new Summer Knight, Fix, pay Dresden a visit and grant him a favor of Summer in thanks for his services. Plot points introduced Elaine Mallory is still alive, having survived the fire that killed Justin DuMorne , and has been living under the protection of the Summer Court . Harry Dresden 's debt to Leanansidhe is sold to Mab , the Winter Queen, who says his debt will be repaid after he completes three favors for her; this book centers around the first favor, discovering the whereabouts of the mantle of the Summer Knight .

A positive Chaikin Money Flow indicates that the stock is strong while a negative CMF indicates that the stock is weak. The CMF indicator passing through the zero line (rising above or falling below) may indicate a shift in the overall trend for the equity. The indicator, created by Marc Chaikin, is based on the theory that the strength of the market can be determined by looking at where the price closes compared to its daily range and volume. If the market is strong you will see if closing in the upper half with a high volume. A weak market can be seen if it closes in the lower half of the range on high volume. \nChecking on current RSI levels on shares of Over The Wire Holdings Limited (OTW.AX), the 14-day RSI is currently standing at 67.59, the 7-day is at 72.33, and the 3-day is resting at 83.90. Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a frequently used technical analysis tool. RSI helps measure changes in price movement of a specific equity. RSI is a momentum oscillator that moves in a range from 0 to 100. RSI is generally used to interpret whether a stock is overbought or oversold. As a general rule, an RSI over 70 may indicate an overbought situation. On the other end of the spectrum, a reading under 30 may indicate an oversold situation. \nValue investors may be scanning the shelves for bargain stocks. They may be looking to spot those shares that haven\u2019t been doing a whole lot and are being generally overlooked by the investing world. Value investors may be searching for stocks with lower price to earnings ratios that possess higher dividend yields. Investors looking for growth stocks may be willing to shell out a little more for a stock that has the possibility of increasing EPS at a quicker pace. Some investors may favor one category of stocks over another, but they may need to find a combination at some point. As markets tend to move in cycles, it may be necessary to align the portfolio to the category that is best positioned to make consistent gains in the future. \nOver The Wire Holdings Limited (OTW.AX) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of 118.67. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. \nShares of Over The Wire Holdings Limited (OTW.AX) have a 200-day moving average of 2.24. The 50-day is 2.45, and the 7-day is sitting at 2.76. Using a bigger time frame to assess the moving average such as the 200-day, may help block out the noise and chaos that is often caused by daily price fluctuations. In some cases, MA\u2019s may be used as strong reference points for spotting support and resistance levels. \nThe Average Directional Index or ADX is technical analysis indicator used to describe if a market is trending or not trending. The ADX alone measures trend strength but not direction. Using the ADX with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) may help determine the direction of the trend as well as the overall momentum. Many traders will use the ADX alongside other indicators in order to help spot proper trading entry/exit points. Currently, the 14-day ADX for Over The Wire Holdings Limited (OTW.AX) is 30.24. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would signal a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would indicate an extremely strong trend. The Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is another technical indicator that may be useful for traders and investors. \nThe Williams %R is designed to provide a general sense of when the equity might have reached an extreme and be primed for a reversal.

(PA Graphics) \nA further 11 are in serviced apartments and four are staying with loved ones, meaning 118 remain in emergency accommodations. \nThe local authority was accused of making \u201cone broken promise after another\u201d, having previously expressed confidence every survivor would be out of emergency rooms by Christmas. \nMs Campbell said on Wednesday: \u201cAll of us sympathise with those who are still living in hotels with their children, especially at Christmas. \n\u201cI have always said we can only move at the pace at which victims and survivors feel comfortable: no-one should be rushed into making such an important decision about where they are going to live. \n\u201cHowever, I do accept, as we have heard tonight and last night at scrutiny, for some the pace is painfully slow.\u201d \nCllr Elizabeth Campbell: \u201cOur priority is to find permanent home for the 209 households from #Grenfell Tower & Walk who lost their homes. 42 households have moved in and 49 have accepted an offer\u201d #RBKCCouncilMtg \n\u2014 RBKC (@RBKC) December 6, 2017 \nSurvivors have expressed frustration at how regularly the rehousing deadline has shifted, stretching back to the immediate aftermath of the June 14 inferno. \nDays after the fire Theresa May initially appeared to pledge that everyone left destitute would be in temporary new homes within three weeks. \nSo far only 42 families have moved into permanent addresses, meaning the remaining 166, including 48 temporary places, could spend the festive period without a new home, survivors say. \nCurrently 29 of the families still in hotels have children, meaning many youngsters will likely wake up in hotel rooms on Christmas morning. \nCllr Elizabeth Campbell: \u201cNo-one should be rushed into making such an important decision about where they are going to live. However, I do accept for some the pace is painfully slow\u201d #RBKCCouncilMtg #Grenfell \n\u2014 RBKC (@RBKC) December 6, 2017 \nThere were 209 families in need of rehousing following the disaster, according to updated council figures released on Wednesday. \nShahin Sadafi, chairman of Grenfell United, an elected body set up by survivors and bereaved relatives, said: \u201cFirst it was three weeks, then six months now they are saying a year. \n\u201cFor the survivors and affected families it seems like one broken promise after another. \n\u201cAt this rate it could take the council almost two years to re-home people. \nThe Curve will be open on Christmas Day and Boxing Day, and we hope people from the North Kensington community will feel welcome there #RBKCCouncilMtg #Grenfell \n\u2014 RBKC (@RBKC) December 6, 2017 \n\u201cWe are talking about people who have been through the traumatic events and have lost so much, stuck in hotel rooms and make-do accommodation. \n\u201cNo one can even start to rebuild their lives until they are in a place they can call home. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been six months and we\u2019re now just a fortnight away from Christmas. It\u2019s not too late to put this right but it needs urgent action now.\u201d \nIn addition to those who have already moved into a permanent address, 49 have accepted permanent housing offers, making 91 accepted offers in total, Ms Campbell said on Wednesday. \nIt is hoped 300 houses will have been acquired by the council in time for Christmas, he added. \nWith the prospect of many survivors spending Christmas in hotels, festive events are being organised in the west London neighbourhood. \nThe Curve centre will be opened on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Years Day, Tuesday\u2019s meeting was told, and a communal Christmas meal is in the pipeline.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "elizabeth campbell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rick findler/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "campbell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cllr elizabeth campbell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shahin sadafi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip hammond", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "grenfell tower cash", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "grenfell tower grenfell tower", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "#grenfell tower & walk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ms campbell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pa graphics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grenfell united", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "grenfell tower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kensington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north kensington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:16.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c18f4b587ec39fc52db66c94235e3778cb33e8c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8zICCHuagPh1wT9kKcCj5RVWKPtyGNUm2AoofOplUyZXOIAiNJr3rSws6ruZND1izy005seCvq6JgNz1peXLswUiu18W6Vs.KdO6zUT7Ua78DpyjE_2Ip71ZSyePH681vkonrN0U6a7jAHpI1EPyGUWbZzcfK_PU_GTafiiE1Bug--", "site_full": "www.dailyecho.co.uk", "site": "dailyecho.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.thisishampshire.net/uk_national_news/rss/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Daily Echo | National News", "title": "Documents submitted by Brexit Secretary \u2018don\u2019t include impact assessment\u2019", "title_full": "Documents submitted by Brexit Secretary \u2018don\u2019t include impact assessment\u2019", "published": "2017-12-07T11:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/resources/images/7151372/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 47500, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c18f4b587ec39fc52db66c94235e3778cb33e8c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8zICCHuagPh1wT9kKcCj5RVWKPtyGNUm2AoofOplUyZXOIAiNJr3rSws6ruZND1izy005seCvq6JgNz1peXLswUiu18W6Vs.KdO6zUT7Ua78DpyjE_2Ip71ZSyePH681vkonrN0U6a7jAHpI1EPyGUWbZzcfK_PU_GTafiiE1Bug--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "Documents submitted by Brexit Secretary \u2018don\u2019t include impact assessment\u2019", "text": "Documents submitted by Brexit Secretary \u2018don\u2019t include impact assessment\u2019 Opposition MPs have called for David Davis to be sacked (Dominic Lipinski/PA) 1 comment \nThe documents handed over to Parliament by Brexit Secretary David Davis last month are \u201cunderwhelming\u201d and do not amount to an assessment of the likely impact on the UK economy of withdrawal from the EU, a senior peer has said. \nLord Jay of Ewelme, the acting chair of the House of Lords EU Committee and former senior civil servant, said that he would have expected a \u201cproper\u201d impact assessment to be conducted to inform the Government of the likely effect of Brexit on different sectors of industry. \nThere were calls from opposition MPs for Mr Davis to be sacked after he admitted to the Commons Exiting the EU Committee on Wednesday that his department had carried out no formal impact assessments for the Government\u2019s Brexit plans. \nDavid Davis has misled parliament.

David Davis gives evidence to the Commons Exiting the EU Committee (PA) \nThe 850-page cache of documents, handed to cross-party committees in the Commons and Lords but not yet published, are understood to describe existing conditions in various sectors of the economy, but not to forecast how they will be affected by Brexit. \nLord Jay told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that his committee was \u201cgoing through them pretty systematically now\u201d. \n\u201cThey are quite interesting but they are pretty underwhelming,\u201d said Lord Jay. \n\u201cThey don\u2019t really include an impact assessment, as far as I can tell. \n\u201cI would have thought there would have been a proper impact assessment, a proper assessment of what the impact of leaving the EU is going to be on different sectors of the economy. \n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got is interesting, and there\u2019s a lot of good information there, but I can\u2019t really say it\u2019s a real impact assessment. It\u2019s a fairly underwhelming report.\u201d \nUpdate: Earlier this afternoon I wrote to the Speaker of the House of Commons calling on him to initiate contempt of Parliament proceedings and bring forward a debate on a resolution of contempt of Parliament after @DavidDavisMP was shown to have misled and lied to Parliament. https://t.co/J63TewJzFU \n\u2014 David Lammy (@DavidLammy) December 6, 2017 \nTransport Secretary Chris Grayling said there had been a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d about the nature of the work being done within Government. \n\u201cWe have done extensive work on the impact of European law on different sectors of the UK economy,\u201d Mr Grayling told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \n\u201cWe have done it in my department on the different areas of transport, other departments have done the same, and there are 800 pages of analysis that have been prepared and supplied to the Brexit Committee. \n\u201cWhat we haven\u2019t done is rework all the arguments from the referendum campaign all over again. \n\u201cThere are people who believe we are doing the wrong thing\u2026 who want us to produce detailed analyses saying \u2018in this scenario, this situation will occur to this business\u2019. \n\u201cThe truth is that we have to approach the negotiations right now in the best possible way for Britain and the work we are doing is to prepare the UK for these negotiations, to understand all the areas affected by EU law.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jay of ewelme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominic lipinski/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grayling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris grayling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david lammy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of commons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc radio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc radio 4\u2019s today", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic unionist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of lords eu committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:16.031+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15158e58dfab1ec186e605312f08a69da4a74dc9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmlFZjq1fGur7M6YV8WYPXqcbrhKji3cTEGTeK.V1p.7eS1Mw1Kagp9a1ZOmfbQiCM6uAKzBSzmKqZZRNXFded6QQP0QlXbLAHa6wYDXEG3tzA--", "site_full": "returnlostlovers.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://returnlostlovers.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "@EXPERT SANGOMA TO BRING BACK LOST LOVER {+27768521739} TRADITIONAL HEALER IN JOHANNESBURG, PRETORIA", "title": "Love Spells in New York to bring back a lost lover +27768521739 voodoo priest in new york,Los Angels", "title_full": "Love Spells in New York to bring back a lost lover +27768521739 voodoo priest in new york,Los Angels", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "15158e58dfab1ec186e605312f08a69da4a74dc9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmlFZjq1fGur7M6YV8WYPXqcbrhKji3cTEGTeK.V1p.7eS1Mw1Kagp9a1ZOmfbQiCM6uAKzBSzmKqZZRNXFded6QQP0QlXbLAHa6wYDXEG3tzA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Chief Asaf Zain (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Love Spells in New York to bring back a lost lover +27768521739 voodoo priest in new york,Los Angels", "text": "Love Spells  in  New York  to bring back a lost lover & get your ex back.

While the other games had later entries in their series, they have both been dormant for the last two generations. While the game has been released on various platforms, it is now making its way to the Nintendo Switch. Will it fill the gap that Nintendo has created?\n\nThe short answer is, yes. While it eschews my childhood favorite dolphin mode, Riptide GP: Renegade drips personality and depth that the previously mentioned series never quite achieved.\n\n\nFirst of all, the game introduces us to a story through it's tutorial level. In it, your chosen racer is competing in an illegal hydro jet race against your nemesis, and while navigating the waters and learning how to control your craft, you get busted by the police and thrown in jail. Two years later, you're back on the scene and craving vengeance on the course.\n\nThe basic structure of the campaign is similar to most racing games- you compete in a series of tournaments, vying for the most wins in any given tournament so that you may progress.  As you go, you earn experience and cash that can be used to customize your hydro jet, make your racer better, and unlock new stunts to be performed. These stunts serve both the purpose of looking stylish and helping you get out of tight spots in the track and overtake your opponents. We are also presented early on with different types of races to add some variety to the game.\n\nIn addition, the game adds a customization feature to your hydro jet that is similar to one that you find in games like Need for Speed Underground to personalize your hydro jet to allow your own personality to shine through. You can change three different colors on your craft and racer, and add decals to your craft and uniform.\n\n\nRiptide GP: Renegade boasts both online multiplayer and local, split screen multiplayer up to 4 players. This doesn't hinder the silky smooth frame rate necessary for a successful 3D racer.\n\nThe courses are well designed, and offer some shortcuts and varying routes to get from start to finish. There is also a cool water splash effect when you land after a jump that made me chuckle the first couple of times that I saw it.\n\nVector Unit has done an excellent job bringing hydro craft racing to the Switch, and Riptide GP: Renegade is a great improvement on the formula it was inspired by. Must buy at $9,99\n\n8/10\n\nRiptide GP: Renegade on eShop \nNintendo Switch Holiday Buyer's Guide - 2017 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "nintendo switch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nintendo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vector unit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eshop  nintendo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:17.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "75b3a46ebea41b2e9fc6ddfaa47c5967a5de57cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6jsyG1oTKZYkcjk4xZhHMTVaojeDj_5b0jPnWE1345I.O3ezJ40So25lq6fXZrWGBPj9DaF.LpTShe4YxxsZybAeM7RjJ.2k-", "site_full": "www.johnnybet.com", "site": "johnnybet.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "", "title": "HC Yugra vs Yekaterinburg Betting Predictions, Tips, Odds, Previews - 2017-12-07 - by Arxondas", "title_full": "HC Yugra vs Yekaterinburg Betting Predictions, Tips, Odds, Previews - 2017-12-07 - by Arxondas", "published": "2017-12-07T09:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.215, "main_image": "https://static0.johnnybet.com/system/users/avatars/336676/profile/1509703815-tt.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "75b3a46ebea41b2e9fc6ddfaa47c5967a5de57cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6jsyG1oTKZYkcjk4xZhHMTVaojeDj_5b0jPnWE1345I.O3ezJ40So25lq6fXZrWGBPj9DaF.LpTShe4YxxsZybAeM7RjJ.2k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "HC Yugra vs Yekaterinburg Betting Predictions, Tips, Odds, Previews - 2017-12-07 - by Arxondas", "text": "Chicago Blackhawks win INCLUDED OVER TIME !Chicago Blackhawks wygrana \u0142\u0105cznie z dogrywk\u0105 !Chcicag... 2017-12-07 sisiak and levsky commented on post in Levsky bet group On Roma win that was 1.11 insane.

Photo: AP Photo/Dante Carrer \nTORONTO - The show that Tiger Woods put on last week in his latest comeback from injury was enough to convince a pair of major winners that he may still be able to triumph in golf's blue riband events. \nWoods swung freely and with no sign of back pain at the Hero World Challenge, finishing tied for ninth in the 18-man exhibition which featured eight of the world's top 10 golfers. \nMark Calcavecchia saw enough to know it would be foolish to write off the former world number one. \n\"His name is Tiger Woods after all. You don't just forget that he has won 14 majors and 79 (PGA Tour) tournaments,\" the former British Open winner told a conference call to promote the Diamond Resorts Invitational. \n\"I watched most of last week and I was very impressed with a lot of things. He's going at it full speed, he's certainly not holding back trying to protect what we all thought was still going to be a tender back.\" \nFollowing spinal fusion surgery and a lengthy layoff, Woods arrived at the Bahamas event ranked 1,199th but after posting a 31 on his opening nine holes, his odds to win the U.S. Masters in April dropped to 15-1, according to one Las Vegas bookmaker. \nIn August, he had opened at 100-1 odds to win the year's first major. \nCalcavecchia said Woods, who remains four majors behind Jack Nicklaus's record of 18, would be well served to play in more events than usual to get into a groove. \nWhile Woods drove the ball as well as he had in a decade, he was rusty when it came to chipping, but that was no concern for twice U.S. Open winner Lee Janzen. \n\"Tiger Woods has a variable that is unmeasurable that you can never count him out,\" said Janzen. \n\"He always has in his pocket somewhere the ability to do something dramatic and to pull off the right shot at the right time. \n\"His putting looked really good. But if he regains that touch with chipping I would be surprised if he wasn't in contention in a major.\" \nWoods will turn 42 on December 30 and the competition he faces from the game's younger players is deeper than in his prime. \nBut just as Nicklaus came out of nowhere to win the 1986 Masters at the age of 46, Janzen felt the same could be in store for Woods. \n\"That is the biggest question, can he win a major now because he is playing against a bunch of Tiger clones, basically,\" he said. \n\"All these young guys are playing like he used to play and it isn't just one of them. \n\"So he has to beat the younger version of himself now and there's a handful of them, at least. \n\"But just like Jack Nicklaus, when they tried to write him off he showed everybody that he wasn't done yet.\" Reuters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "frank ping", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "calcavecchia", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "janzen golf", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "janzen tiger", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "mark calcavecchia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicklaus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack nicklaus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woods", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tiger woods", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee janzen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janzen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bahamas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:17.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cfa98d995842e3635c1b294255fb21ef18b803c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS3Q9qWCzoUkA7QBY6WyP2Clcp4uDWXpAekwpmQUYVXQjeQJ7u5MWu7_0j.V8o8wDDm_AN73DSwY8_3H67YUQN8QStgR4fKGkmRwCDniNAmEId.D_Or1SpcJQwxjocesyI-", "site_full": "steverogersnotebook.tumblr.com", "site": "tumblr.com", "site_section": "http://whiteleander.tumblr.com/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Blue Light and Stardust.", "title": "steverogersnotebook: urulokid: can we also note that in the...", "title_full": "steverogersnotebook: urulokid: can we also note that in the...", "published": "2017-12-06T23:17:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://78.media.tumblr.com/89b225b171851b4a6b46a54c2fa90a2c/tumblr_n9si6wk8XC1sc6eqeo1_250.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cfa98d995842e3635c1b294255fb21ef18b803c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS3Q9qWCzoUkA7QBY6WyP2Clcp4uDWXpAekwpmQUYVXQjeQJ7u5MWu7_0j.V8o8wDDm_AN73DSwY8_3H67YUQN8QStgR4fKGkmRwCDniNAmEId.D_Or1SpcJQwxjocesyI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T23:17:00.000+02:00", "title": "steverogersnotebook: urulokid: can we also note that in the...", "text": "can we also note that in the middle gifs Bucky has proper trigger discipline and the fucking Winter Soldier has shitty TD so is it that Hydra made him give no fucks about gun safety because people are just collateral?

There is no public timeline for when it will be built. \nChina\u2019s most famous boxer, Zou Shiming, lost his WBO flyweight belt when he was knocked out by Japan\u2019s unfancied Sho Kimura in his first defence in July. \nWhen Pacquiao\u2019s plans for China were first announced in 2014, he said that he believed the partnership could help thaw frosty ties between the Philippines and China, who were engaged in a territorial maritime dispute in the South China Sea. \nRelations have since improved considerably under current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. \nAt the time, Pacquiao defended the decision to open a boxing academy in China instead of his own country. \n\u201cIn the Philippines we don\u2019t have a problem (producing good boxers),\u201d said Pacquiao, a hero in his home country and also a senator.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zhou wenxin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pacquiao", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jeff horn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sho kimura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zou shiming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manny pacquiao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodrigo duterte", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world boxing organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manny pacquiao international boxing academy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south china sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:17.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "055da8d71546f4dedeefc2a8beea16d69b8d3df3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmnnLY9AyCWjp1IzYiHvtp5CY4mR3vuQdFtwr5XgdyEu5pOwMgqzvuQfiOxpZ3cy9mSagnHxI9yFEw--", "site_full": "retrobustygirls.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://retrobustygirls.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Retro busty girls", "title": "Fawn Farote", "title_full": "Fawn Farote", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "055da8d71546f4dedeefc2a8beea16d69b8d3df3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmnnLY9AyCWjp1IzYiHvtp5CY4mR3vuQdFtwr5XgdyEu5pOwMgqzvuQfiOxpZ3cy9mSagnHxI9yFEw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alisher Navoi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Fawn Farote", "text": "\n\nPSYCHEDELICATESSEN - oldenskin: Fawn Farote ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fawn farote", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fawn farote   psychedelicatessen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:17.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d89ccf58f378ab732d67797581d3f17aa69475c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTsQCcpT2lUxdEv3VYIMJwC1VmaotmTKDjesqvFwO4fwsvnpLSUbr2axBFaZp_uIAmTrhhkEBcM15tp6RMEm6I2A4tPAJUVTy9kaa626k5Z_1YwukFjYqShDgnIPmNJxhgzQOKnH1p3uQ--", "site_full": "www.iol.co.za", "site": "iol.co.za", "site_section": "http://www.iol.co.za/cmlink/sport-extended-1.628987", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "IOL section Feed for Sport", "title": "Cobras' Duminy and City's Walters team up for a good cause", "title_full": "Cobras' Duminy and City's Walters team up for a good cause", "published": "2017-12-07T10:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://inm-baobab-prod-eu-west-1.s3.amazonaws.com/public/inm/media/2017/11/29/iol/134/B17KXCR2227.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5061, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 61, "comments": 0, "shares": 61}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d89ccf58f378ab732d67797581d3f17aa69475c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTsQCcpT2lUxdEv3VYIMJwC1VmaotmTKDjesqvFwO4fwsvnpLSUbr2axBFaZp_uIAmTrhhkEBcM15tp6RMEm6I2A4tPAJUVTy9kaa626k5Z_1YwukFjYqShDgnIPmNJxhgzQOKnH1p3uQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Zaahier Adams", "published": "2017-12-07T10:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "Cobras' Duminy and City's Walters team up for a good cause", "text": "Cobras' Duminy and City's Walters team up for a good cause Proteas / 7 December 2017, 10:50am / Zaahier Adams Walters ( left) and Duminy. Photo: Twitter \nCAPE TOWN - \u201cI remember when we were planning our parties after a day\u2019s play, there was JP and his dad taking down the video camera and getting ready to analyse his innings.\u201d \nThat is Cape Town City goalkeeper Shu-Aib Walters\u2019 earliest memory of Proteas batsman and Cape Cobras captain JP Duminy. Walters and Duminy share a long history, both Cape Town sports stars having attended Plumstead High School. \nDuminy and Walters, who is three years his senior, played together in the Plumstead High First XI cricket team, where they shared a dressing room with Rory Kleinveldt. \nBut even back then, Walters could see there was something different about the quiet, even shy, but seriously talented young left-hander who was already scoring the bulk of the team\u2019s runs. \n\u201cObviously football was my main focus but I enjoyed my cricket,\u201d Walters said after returning from Durban, where City lost a \u201chome\u201d game 4-2 to Maritzburg United. \n\u201cBut here was this little guy who just made the game look so easy. He was so focused. His dad would film all his innings. They would then go home and analyse every ball. It was immense dedication from both him and his dad. \n\u201cIt just shows the role parents play in a sportsman\u2019s development. Obviously you musn\u2019t push your child. It has to be mutual. But I am sure JP is thanking his dad now for all the hours he dedicated to JP\u2019s development.\u201d \nAfter all these years, the duo are teaming up again later this month. Walters is one of the \u201ccelebrity\u201d players assisting Duminy with his JP21 Super Eights Charity Cricket Day set for the exclusive Val de Vie Estate on the December 17. \nFellow Proteas AB de Villiers, Morne Morkel and captain Faf du Plessis will also be involved on the day, which will comprise of fun-filled and unique eight-over games. \nHowever, the day is about so much more than that. The JP21 Project, the brainchild of Duminy and his wife Sue and established in 2014, has made significant strides in reigniting enthusiasm for cricket and providing the platform to do so for underprivileged children, especially in the Western Cape outlying areas of Strandfontein and Mitchells Plain. JP21 Project uses sport as a tool for change in underprivileged communities. YOU can be a part of the change. @jpduminy21 invites you to help FUNdraise at the @JP21SuperEights Charity Cricket day.

We come from similar areas. He was raised in Strandfontein and I was reared in Grassy Park. It is a similar culture. \n\u201cWe know where we come from and we were taught by our parents to give back. That\u2019s what JP is doing and I am also busy with a football foundation at the moment where we\u2019re taking a group of underprivileged kids to Europe. \n\u201cThat is what the JP21 Project is holistically about because that is that we are trying to achieve. It is about broadening children\u2019s horizons that regardless of where you come from and what situation you find yourself in, that is not the end of your story. \n\u201cChildren\u2019s eyes must be opened so they know the world is so much bigger than just the narrow streets they live in. Once they are filled with that belief they can achieve anything.\u201d \nIndependent Media is the official media partner of the JP21 Super Eights. \nCape Times", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zaah", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "faf du plessis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morne morkel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rory kleinveldt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duminy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamaine cloete", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jp duminy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adams walters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shu-aib walters", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "city", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "proteas ab de villiers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cape times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plumstead high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "independent media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plumstead high", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maritzburg united", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "durban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grassy park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duminy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cape town", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "strandfontein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cape town city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western cape", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:17.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0cf245aa3394349781be398ab8e13fa67d6c26c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mtwpVP3F9EOzqP8qg136iZk", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp; Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "MEGA thread", "title_full": "/co/ - MEGA thread - Comics & Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T04:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 119, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "46fb3af11769d14a43ad68ff23ea4115f1623193", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mtwpVP3F9EOzklUTiR4XOCGz2BSeAGUxno-", "ord_in_thread": 45, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-06T17:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>97272175\nIs there a Hey Arnold!

(NYSE:AYX) are making a strong comeback as they have jumped 90.55% since bottoming out on Mar. 28, 2017. Thanks to a rise of almost 12.3% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 79.61% so far on the year \u2014 still in strong territory. In this case, shares are up 0.92% , the 52-week high touched on Dec. 06, 2017, but are collecting gains at 0% for the past 12 months. AYX Target Price Reaches $26.83 \nBrokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to buy Alteryx, Inc. (AYX)\u2019s shares projecting a $26.83 target price. Analysts\u201f target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock\u201fs future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period. How Quickly Alteryx, Inc. (AYX)\u2019s Sales Declined? \nAYX\u2019s revenue has declined at an average annualized rate of about 0% during the past five years. However, the company\u2019s most recent quarter increase of 52% looks attractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock\u2019s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio. CubeSmart Achieves Below-Average Profit Margin \nThe best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn\u2019t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders\u2019 equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company\u2019s ability to continue operating. Currently, Alteryx, Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -19.63%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 12.83%, and the sector\u2019s average is 14.47%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar\u2019s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company\u2019s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better. \nCubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -3.71% since hitting a peak level on Nov. 13, 2017. Thanks to an increase of almost 0.25% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 6.72% so far on the year \u2014 still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 25.14% higher, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Jul. 11, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 18.7% for the past six months. Analysts See CubeSmart 0.76% Above Current Levels \nThe good news is there\u2019s still room for CubeSmart (CUBE) to grow. At recent closing price of $28.57, CUBE has a chance to add $0.76 or 2.66% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($29.33) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.7 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 0.24 , so you might not be in for a bumpy ride. Are CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE) Earnings Growing Rapidly? \nFor the past 5 years, CubeSmart\u2019s EPS growth has been nearly 36.5%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 6%, annually. Is CUBE Turning Profits into Returns? \nCubeSmart (CUBE)\u2019s ROE is 7.02%, while industry\u2019s is 14.59%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 15.11%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity. \nCubeSmart\u2019s ROA is 3.5%, while industry\u2019s average is 7.2%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company\u2019s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 2.54. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

Reuters on Wednesday reported that Ford was planning to sign such a deal as it overhauls its China strategy to stimulate growth. \n\"The agreement aims to explore new ways to redefine how consumers purchase and own vehicles, as well as how to leverage digital channels to identify new retail opportunities,\" Alibaba said in its statement. \nThe Chinese e-commerce firm and U.S. automaker will initially \"explore a pilot study\" for new retail opportunities, Alibaba said. \nFord CEO Jim Hackett said in the statement that collaborating with technology firms builds on the automaker\u2019s vision to make \"smart vehicles.\" \nFord's China sales have been sluggish in recent months as it struggles to keep pace with rapidly changing trends, including increased demand for entry-level cars in smaller cities. \nMeanwhile Alibaba is increasing its presence in the automotive sector with Banma Technologies, a partnership with SAIC Motor developing Internet-connected cars.

A few months back an employee of a Japanese TV broadcaster suffered a heart attack and died at her workplace, she was 31 and had clocked in 159 hours of overtime in a month.

In a bid to overcome this issue a building maintenance company will be making use of an \u2018T-Friend\u2019 an ingenious service that offers the industry\u2019s first indoor drone that tracks overworking employees. The pizza box sized drone uses a series of markers that are placed in the room for guidance to fly over the office floor. The drone has a video camera that records the footage of the office which is later examined by a supervisor to find out over working employees. t can take off, land and fly without an operator, in the next stage it will be able to charge automatically as well. Safety tests are still underway and the service is scheduled into service by April next year.

So, what to do with this extra time? I went down to town, bought a Dovo and brought her home. Most of my homes are at home in CT, I have a norton 4K/8k, a generic Chinese \u009312k\u0094 and an old combination Belgian with a slurry stone. Did a pyramid with the Nortons and was not pleased at all. Whipped up a slurry on the Belgian, hit it for a while, then blue, then yellow without slurry. Still failed HHT, but was popping arm hairs nicely. About 30 passes on the Chinese, 40 trips down the strop, a nice shower, Mitchell\u0092s Wool fat, and damn...I\u0092ve missed this feeling.\nNow...i need to find some better razors in Europe...anybody still making customs over here? I just saw Mastro Livi\u0092s site is down, but as I\u0092m only a few hundred miles from him, I\u0092d love to go pay a visit.\nDamn, I just jumped right back in the deep end!!\nHope to see you all around!\nSL1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:19.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e2d05e1c030a9a0754a7f43e8111574365689433", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOo8phhHQimYknNB3g0NfE7aQwAbKn32bo1fsWE_PhRL3Uji.TKPjdj1Av9CT1nDgkrXAx4ymCgtLlOmzbeHOOcQHV8jAv3FwGqqMAEFLtCOgQ9GMG9wDifaZYuw0pfN7eE-", "site_full": "straightrazorplace.com", "site": "straightrazorplace.com", "site_section": "http://straightrazorplace.com/", "site_categories": ["mens_health", "health"], "section_title": "Straight Razor Place - Welcome", "title": "Welcome back!

The amount marked an annual growth rate of 5.3%. The \u201cother health, residential, and personal care\u201d category in the report includes spending for Medicaid home- and community-based waivers, care provided in residential care facilities, ambulance services, school health and worksite healthcare, CMS said.\nOverall, U.S. healthcare spending increased 4.3% and hit $3.3 trillion in 2016. Seventeen percent of that total, $565.5 billion, was spent by the Medicaid program at the federal, state and local level, according to the report.\nGrowth of Medicaid spending slowed in 2016, increasing by 3.9% compared with rates of 11.5% in 2014 and 9.5% in 2015 that were due in part to the initial effects of the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid enrollment during that time, CMS said. Federal Medicaid expenditures increased 4.4%, whereas at the state and local level, they grew 3.2% in 2016.\nHospital spending accounted for slightly more than one-third of all Medicaid spending in 2016, according to the report, but the second-largest category was \u201cother health, residential, and personal care,\u201d and spending in that category increased 5.7%, a slowdown from the 10.8% increase in 2015. The deceleration partly can be attributed to a slowdown in the growth of HCBS waivers, the authors stated.\nDecelerated growth was seen in 2016 for all Medicaid-related goods and services except for continuing care retirement communities and nursing homes, according to the report.\nTotal Medicare expenditures reached $672.1 billion in 2016, which was 20% of total healthcare spending, CMS said. Medicare spending grew 3.6% in 2016, slowing from a rate of 4.8% in 2015.\nTotal spending at CCRCs and skilled nursing facilities was $162.7 billion in 2016, CMS said.
