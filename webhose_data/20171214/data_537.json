When I told them I'd received these concerns they went up to the tarn that same evening. \n\"I think the police team we have in Keighley at the moment is the most proactive that I've ever come across. \n\"They've told me they will be patrolling at the tarn again, but they won't be saying exactly when. So anyone up there who's doing something they shouldn't be had better stop.\" \nPolice Community Support Officer James Butterfield confirmed via Twitter that officers had visited the site, after being contacted by the councillor. \nConcerns are shared by the Keighley town councillor for Laycock and Braithwaite, John Kirby. \nHe said problems with people using the tarn for criminal and anti-social behaviour dated back years. \n\"It's a lovely area and it is to be enjoyed not misused,\" he added. \n\"Plenty of people do use the tarn for completely innocent activities and go there to enjoy the view, but unfortunately it does also attract some of the wrong kinds of people as well. \n\"The police do send patrols up there, but they don't have the resources to have a van there all the time. \n\"Sometimes you do get drug dealers in the area, and also joyriders who go over the 'Yorkshire Bumps' then cut down into Laycock. \n\"I'm not sure what the answer is. It's a case of catching these people, but as soon as they see a police car approaching, they're off.\" \nKeighley MP John Grogan said the police were proving themselves to be effective at dealing with incidents of anti-social behaviour quickly. \nHe added: \"The best form of policing is nipping problems in the bud. \n\"Recently the police have taken action in both Holden Park at Oakworth and at Keighley Bus Station \u2013 and now at Keighley Tarn. \n\"The use of undercover police I think can make a particular difference.\" \nTown chaplain the Rev Dr Jonathan Pritchard, of United Keighley, said it was important for the community to keep restating its \"shared distress\" at any incidents of grooming. \n\"It is simply wrong for young people to be preyed upon,\" he said. \n\"As our communities and the police stand united together, there will be fewer and fewer places where this vile crime can take place. \n\"Together, let's make Keighley a place of hope for all of us. \n\"Let's make good on the promise of Christmas \u2013 good news, God's transforming light shining in the dark places, hope renewed.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cath bacon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james butterfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cllr bacon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan pritchard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john grogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "braithwaite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john kirby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laycock", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "keighley tarn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keighley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yorkshire bumps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united keighley", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "keighley tarn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keighley bus station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holden park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oakworth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keighley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "black hill lane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keighley west ward district", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:11.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6ea44e78a03a75b23b108b299f8f6696250a462", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1prUf3ZSQykc5i3inUk.NiYaP3VdWfBIbe", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/bant/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/bant/ -

As such, the index is market capitalization-weighted and free-float adjusted. FTSE 100 is operated by FTSE Group, a unit of London Stock Exchange Group.\nA large component of the index is made up of foreign companies listed on LSE. So while the index tracks the LSE\u2019s blue-chip stocks, it is considered a weak representation of the U.K.\u2019s economy because of its large foreign constituency.\nFor investors interested in tracking the health of the U.K. economy, the FTSE 250 is a better guide because it is dominated by domestic U.K. companies.\nComponents of FTSE 100 make up more than 80% of LSE\u2019s entire market capitalization and that partly explains why it is a widely used gauge of the U.K.\u2019s stock market. However, a more comprehensive indicator is the FTSE All-Share Index, which is broader as it aggregates FTSE 100, FTSE 250 and other small-cap stocks on the LSE.\nRebalancing of the index The FTSE 100 is reshuffled quarterly. The Rebalancing of the index takes into account the changes in the market capitalization of its constituents such as after a rights issue or a large debt-to-equity swap. Components of FTSE 100 represent a variety of sectors in the U.K. economy such as Financials, Industrials, Technology and Energy. UniVision Engineering Limited is a stock traded on the U.K\u2019s stock exchange.\nHistoric marks FTSE 100 Index dipped to a lifetime low of 427.50 points in February 1978, but steadily recovered from the trough. The index notched a lifetime high of 7103.98 points in April 2015 amid speculation that the Conservative Part would win the U.K. general election in May of the same year. The index\u2019s earlier record high was reached in 1999 during the so-called dot-com bubble. UniVision Engineering Limited has relatively good liquidity.\nThe stock market The LSE is the main stock exchange in the U.K. and one of the largest in the world. The exchange was established in 1801, making it one of the world\u2019s oldest stock markets. The LSE is also a platform for companies to raise capital for expansion.\nThe exchange has an SME focused platform called the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). It also operates the Depository Receipt (DR) platform for trading shares of foreign companies based outside the European Union.\nA variety of securities are traded on LSE. These include equities, bonds, ETFs and a broad line of other derivatives.\nOpening hours The LSE platform opens for trading at 8 a.m. and closes at 4 p.m. But there are pre-market and post-market sessions that open early and close late. The exchange operates all weekday except on holidays declared in advance. The market is closed on weekends.\nThe LSE is owned by the London Stock Exchange Group, which also owns several other exchanges across Europe and the FTSE 100 Index.\nU.K. stocks drawing more investors Though Brexit has shaken several businesses and economies in the Eurozone and beyond, U.K. companies continue to see investor interest in their stocks thanks in part to the country\u2019s strong regulations and corporate transparency.\nProspects of the U.K. avoiding hard Brexit are also strengthening retail investor hopes that the country\u2019s economy would escape recession after it leaves the European Union.

Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, speaks during the Geneva's Sporting Chance Forum in Geneva, Switzerland, on Nov. 30.

Alex Wong / Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 9:54 am \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Strzok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order. Copyright 2017 NPR.

Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. \nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up. \n\"A horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\" he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. \nSechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. \nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \"disappeared - what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\" \nUlyukaev went to Sechin's office in November last year to discuss Rosneft's affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. \nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher's shop. \nUlyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev's actions \"are undermining the authority of the government.\" \nUlyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \"those absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised. I was a hypocrite. I love taking gifts and giving gifts. When you're doing all right, you shamelessly turn your back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nUlyukayev asked for \"people's\" forgiveness and pledged to devote rest of his life to \"defending people's interests.\" \nThe court is expected to deliver the verdict next week.

Yes By Mabell, Dave   \nDave Mabell \nLethbridge Herald \nTwelve years ago, his neighbour died suddenly \u2013 leaving a southern Alberta family without a bread-winner and a father. \nDon Schan remembers it well. \n\u201cHis death just broke my heart,\u201d the Picture Butte farmer and businessman says. \nSo he decided to find a way to help the grieving family. He and a partner each agreed to sell a calf, with the proceeds helping the young daughter with her school books and fees. \nThat became the birth of the \u201cCalf for Kids\u201d project. Over its first year, Schan says, a total of 18 boys and girls were helped. Many more have followed. \nOn Friday, he and Calf for Kids board secretary Ty Cross will welcome area residents to their annual fundraising event at the Picture Butte auction mart. A \u201cAAA\u201d Angus calf will be up for sale, along with a list of merchandise and services donated by Lethbridge-area businesses and individuals. \nBidding will begin at 6:30 p.m. at the auction ring, about a half-mile north of town on Highway 25. Coffee and snacks will be available. \nSchan says the program continues to be supported by local people who know and care. \n\u201cIt\u2019s mainly local people,\u201d in Picture Butte and Lethbridge. \nBut he hopes to spread the word, so more families learn that it\u2019s there. And more people will step forward with support. \n\u201cIt gives the bereaving family one less thing to worry about,\u201d he says. \n\u201cIt provides hope for the future at a time when hope is most needed.\u201d \nThe Calf for Kids bursaries are designed to help with tuition and school supplies, up to Grade 12, where the loss of a parent or primary caregiver may put education in jeopardy \n\u201cThere may be lots of people who don\u2019t know about the organization and what (we) do,\u201d Schan says. \u201cFunds are desperately needed to help more families.\u201d \nFamilies who find themselves in that situation may contact the program at calfforkids.ca. \nThose who are able to help may call Cross at 403-795-4816 or make a donation at the Meyers Norris Penny accounting office in Lethbridge. \nFollow @DMabellHerald on Twitter You have 1 free stories left to read this month.

Yes By Shurtz, Delon   \nDelon Shurtz \nLethbridge Herald \nA Calgary man remains in custody in Lethbridge following what police are calling a brazen series of break-ins last month to car dealerships in the city. \nThe accused, Eric Christopher Smith, made a brief appearance in provincial court Wednesday, where he appeared by closed-circuit TV from the Lethbridge Correctional Centre. \nAlthough Smith was scheduled for a bail hearing, duty counsel told court the accused had only spoken to Legal Aid and didn\u2019t have a lawyer to represent him. The matter was adjourned for a week to provide time for Legal Aid to make the appointment. \nAt about 9:53 p.m. last Thursday police responded to a break-in at Dunlop Ford along the 1500 block of Mayor Magrath Drive South after a man driving a truck stolen from Calgary plowed into a garage door. The man took a set of keys and, after being confronted by an employee, fled to the parking lot where he used the keys to steal an F350 truck. \nWhile police investigated the theft, the suspect drove to Bridge City Chrysler in the 3200 block of 1 Avenue South and crashed the stolen F350 into a garage door. He again took keys and drove a Fiat Spyder down the street where, police believe, he intended to return later to pick up the vehicle. \nAs he attempted to move other vehicles from the lot, a security officer arrived and the suspect fled, this time in a Dodge Ram 1500. \nJust before 12:30 a.m. Friday a police officer saw the suspect in the stolen truck near the dealership and two other officers blocked the vehicle\u2019s path. The man rammed both police vehicles, however, and fled on Highway 3 where police pursued him as he left the city limits. \nRCMP deployed a spike belt, which disabled the truck, but not the driver, who fled on foot. He was later found in a shed and caught by Myke, a Lethbridge police dog. The man was treated by EMS and arrested. \nSmith, 22, is charged with single counts of dangerous driving, possession of stolen property over $5,000, mischief over $5,000, and resisting a peace officer.

This year, WannaCry shook the world as the cyber hi-jack accounted for more than 45% of all ransomware tracked, closely followed by Cerber at 44.2%, according to Sophos\u2019 most recent Malware Report .\nIn September alone, 30.4 percent of malicious Android malware processed by SophosLabs was ransomware. Sophos expects this to jump to approximately 45 percent in October. The majority of these attacks have targeted Windows users, but the number of attacks on other platforms is increasing, including those targeting Android, Macs and Linux.\nRansomware attacks have shifted in focus in the past two years, towards industries which are most likely to pay up, such as healthcare, government, critical infrastructure, and small businesses. Due to it being one of the most lucrative industries from ransomware payments or selling medical records, Healthcare has been a big target in 2017 and will without a doubt continue that way into 2018.\nMalware is hiding in Android Apps \nWhen reviewing Google Play, Sophos found that the number of different threats had doubled since last year. One type of malware, dubbed \u2018GhostClicker\u2019, sat in Google Play for almost a year, disguising itself as part of the service library. It then request device administration permission, and actively simulated click-on advertisements as it delivered to earn revenue.\nOne of the more sobering finds was Lipizzan, spyware that infected up to 100 devices. Although this doesn\u2019t sound like a large number, it seems this was a targeted, precision malware, which was designed to monitor phone activity and extracting data from popular apps including email, SMS, location, and voice calls, and media.\nMalware such as this is showing no sign of reducing in the future, as cybercriminals know it works. Therefore, in order to combat being a victim of Android malware, Sophos would suggest consumers:\nStick to Google Play \u2013 Although it isn\u2019t perfect, it puts plenty of effort into preventing malware arriving in the first place Avoid apps with a low reputation \u2013 Be especially wary of this when using a work phone Patch early, patch often \u2013 Check the vendors attitude to updates Online gaming is being used to spread Ransomware and Malware \nIn terms of online gaming, fake copies of the popular game, \u2018King of Glory\u2019 were used to spread ransomware this year. The warning screen used mimicked the one used during the WannaCry outbreak, directing individual to pay the ransom through the China-based Wechat, Alipay and QQ payment methods.\nThe number of malicious apps has risen steadily in the last four years, peaking at nearly 3.5 million in 2017, therefore we are likely to see this rise further in 2018, including more deceptive online gaming traps.\nData breaches\u2013 they are not going away \nThe downside of living in this hyper-connected society means that people are extremely vulnerable to cyber-attacks, as shown in the past few weeks with the Uber Hack , which affected 2.7 million riders and drivers. Sadly, we don\u2019t see these data breaches diminishing in 2018, and with GDPR coming into effect in May it will only continue to be a hot topic and something we are continuing to see.\n2018 and beyond \nIt\u2019s impossible to predict what will happen in 2018, however it\u2019s a fair bet that Android and Windows will continue to be heavily targeted with ransomware and other Malware. Email will also remain the primary attack vector threatening corporate cybersecurity, especially in the case of targeted attacks.\nFour trends that stood out in 2017, and will likely dominate 2018 are: \n1. A ransomware surge fueled by RaaS and amplified by the resurgence of worms;\n2. An explosion of Android malware on Google Play and elsewhere;\n3. Continued efforts to infect Mac computers; and\n4. Ongoing Windows threats, fueled by do-it-yourself exploit kits that make it easy to target Microsoft Office vulnerabilities.\nBy Harish Chib, vice president, Middle East & Africa \n", "highlightText":

Reynolds follows in the motion-captured footsteps of Andy Serkis , who pioneered motion-capture technology in his role as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings films, King Kong, and Caesar in the Planet of the Apes franchise.\nNow Playing: Watch this: Why Pokemon Go is so popular 2:28 Technically Incorrect : Bringing you a fresh and irreverent take on tech.\nSpecial Reports : CNET's in-depth features in one place.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ryan-reynolds-star-pokemon-movie-detective-pikachu-1065206", "https://en.rocketnews24.com/2016/01/27/nintendo-gives-pikachu-a-deep-manly-voice-for-the-newest-pokemon-game-%E3%80%90video%E3%80%91/", "https://twitter.com/broderick/status/930126330615730182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/_lk-IFPeOmq1VqigYeqvftWuKr0=/170x96/2016/07/29/267a5729-f499-4440-bc6b-4b3aea6644d6/pokemon-opinion.jpg", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/14/pokemon-fans-shock-pikachu-speaks-english-movie", "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/mq312OFYF0Ls82TpJY6_pZ0YPxw=/fit-in/970x0/2016/12/27/f782d529-5fd7-49e6-8ad0-c9d22b1cd4a1/pokemon.png"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pikachu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ryan reynolds", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ryan broderick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy serkis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reynolds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caesar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnet", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "ash ketchum", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gollum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niantic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:13.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "71b39055c57177c2d920f4b0e18a33816fc5e850", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_BJ8t6eOGZUjvg6XfjW0vBWAA7ddN35iesYrnoE2RICFQgMhmF_ykImnyAyDXlo0QfXkNccEXzyTgaCZKlpYtwRlWnrHS66Kw-", "site_full": "www.itnewsafrica.com", "site": "itnewsafrica.com", "site_section": "http://www.itnewsafrica.com", "site_categories": ["travel", "africa"], "section_title": "IT News Africa news alert", "title": "Sophos 2017 Malware trends and predictions", "title_full": "Sophos 2017 Malware trends and predictions", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "71b39055c57177c2d920f4b0e18a33816fc5e850", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_BJ8t6eOGZUjvg6XfjW0vBWAA7ddN35iesYrnoE2RICFQgMhmF_ykImnyAyDXlo0QfXkNccEXzyTgaCZKlpYtwRlWnrHS66Kw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Fundisiwe Maseko", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "Sophos 2017 Malware trends and predictions", "text": "Harish Chib, vice president, Middle East & Africa.\nRansomware is on every platform \u2013 don\u2019t assume your mobile and tablets are safe. This year, WannaCry shook the world as the cyber hi-jack accounted for more than 45% of all ransomware tracked, closely followed by Cerber at 44.2%, according to Sophos\u2019 most recent Malware Report .\nIn September alone, 30.4 percent of malicious Android malware processed by SophosLabs was ransomware. Sophos expects this to jump to approximately 45 percent in October. The majority of these attacks have targeted Windows users, but the number of attacks on other platforms is increasing, including those targeting Android, Macs and Linux.\nRansomware attacks have shifted in focus in the past two years, towards industries which are most likely to pay up, such as healthcare, government, critical infrastructure, and small businesses. Due to it being one of the most lucrative industries from ransomware payments or selling medical records, Healthcare has been a big target in 2017 and will without a doubt continue that way into 2018.\nMalware is hiding in Android Apps \nWhen reviewing Google Play, Sophos found that the number of different threats had doubled since last year. One type of malware, dubbed \u2018GhostClicker\u2019, sat in Google Play for almost a year, disguising itself as part of the service library. It then request device administration permission, and actively simulated click-on advertisements as it delivered to earn revenue.\nOne of the more sobering finds was Lipizzan, spyware that infected up to 100 devices. Although this doesn\u2019t sound like a large number, it seems this was a targeted, precision malware, which was designed to monitor phone activity and extracting data from popular apps including email, SMS, location, and voice calls, and media.\nMalware such as this is showing no sign of reducing in the future, as cybercriminals know it works. Therefore, in order to combat being a victim of Android malware, Sophos would suggest consumers:\nStick to Google Play \u2013 Although it isn\u2019t perfect, it puts plenty of effort into preventing malware arriving in the first place Avoid apps with a low reputation \u2013 Be especially wary of this when using a work phone Patch early, patch often \u2013 Check the vendors attitude to updates Online gaming is being used to spread Ransomware and Malware \nIn terms of online gaming, fake copies of the popular game, \u2018King of Glory\u2019 were used to spread ransomware this year. The warning screen used mimicked the one used during the WannaCry outbreak, directing individual to pay the ransom through the China-based Wechat, Alipay and QQ payment methods.\nThe number of malicious apps has risen steadily in the last four years, peaking at nearly 3.5 million in 2017, therefore we are likely to see this rise further in 2018, including more deceptive online gaming traps.\nData breaches\u2013 they are not going away \nThe downside of living in this hyper-connected society means that people are extremely vulnerable to cyber-attacks, as shown in the past few weeks with the Uber Hack , which affected 2.7 million riders and drivers. Sadly, we don\u2019t see these data breaches diminishing in 2018, and with GDPR coming into effect in May it will only continue to be a hot topic and something we are continuing to see.\n2018 and beyond \nIt\u2019s impossible to predict what will happen in 2018, however it\u2019s a fair bet that Android and Windows will continue to be heavily targeted with ransomware and other Malware. Email will also remain the primary attack vector threatening corporate cybersecurity, especially in the case of targeted attacks.\nFour trends that stood out in 2017, and will likely dominate 2018 are: \n1. A ransomware surge fueled by RaaS and amplified by the resurgence of worms;\n2. An explosion of Android malware on Google Play and elsewhere;\n3. Continued efforts to infect Mac computers; and\n4. Ongoing Windows threats, fueled by do-it-yourself exploit kits that make it easy to target Microsoft Office vulnerabilities.\nBy Harish Chib, vice president, Middle East & Africa \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harish chib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wannacry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sophoslabs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lipizzan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alipay", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "middle east & africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sophos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthcare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east & africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:13.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "839c6756a8f9234a988de3a69cba601bb42af1f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DH4fzRhcB2ytveYbtzUOdp5ejwDHkLXk11FBZMCIHEcybsYH58L4rZ8iHsGVDfHC9GKurfSHlcgGu_tkS06uNu9yDnDRzjn2PXgmDTqEh56xs-", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.co.uk", "site": "huffingtonpost.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/christmas/3/", "site_categories": ["politics", "financial_news", "law_government_and_politics", "finance"], "section_title": "Christmas | HuffPost UK", "title": "Amazon Responds To Claims Its Festive Advert 'Ruined Christmas' For Children By Not Featuring Santa", "title_full": "Amazon Responds To Claims Its Festive Advert 'Ruined Christmas' For Children By Not Featuring Santa", "published": "2017-11-14T12:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 23, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.huffingtonpost.com%2Fasset%2F1200_630%2F5a0ab9291c0000e62eb34aa8.png&amp;client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&amp;signature=c53801927d97010b9804826e58f80b2d41861c16", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3053, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ca78babce0798e70f8caccbe075581d0fe8b95d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DH4fzRhcB2ytveYbtzUOdp5ejwDHkLXk11FBZMCIHEcybsYH58L4rZ8iHsGVDfHC9GKurfSHlcgGu_tkS06uNu9yDnDRzjn2PXDMTGOEeH8Rt076Y0I49uEA--", "ord_in_thread": 23, "author": "Carole Mclean-Smith", "published": "2017-11-15T15:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Absolutely NOT.

This can have devastating health effects, including potentially putting their brain development at risk.\u201cNot only do pollutants harm babies\u2019 developing lungs \u2013 they can permanently damage their developing brains \u2013 and, thus, their futures,\u201d UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake said in a statement. \u201cProtecting children from air pollution not only benefits children. It is also benefits their societies \u2013 realized in reduced health care costs, increased productivity and a safer, cleaner environment for everyone.\u201d Damage to early brain development can result in lifelong setbacks. The brains of developing children are especially vulnerable because they can be harmed by smaller doses of toxic chemicals compared to adults\u2019 brains, the report states. Babies are also more susceptible to the effects of air pollution because they breathe more rapidly and their immune defenses are not fully developed. \nThe majority of the babies breathing toxic air \u2013 about 12 million \u2013 live in South Asia, the report found. The paper outlines how certain toxic pollution particles damage growing babies\u2019 brains. Ultrafine toxic particles can enter the body through the bloodstream and travel to the brain, damaging its barrier and causing neuro-inflammation. Some particles, such as ultrafine magnetite, can also enter through the olfactory nerve and the gut and can disrupt how the body metabolizes oxygen, which has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Other types of pollution particles, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, can damage parts of the brain that are responsible for helping neurons communicate, the foundation for babies\u2019 learning and development. The report urges steps be taken to reduce the impact of air pollution on babies\u2019 growing brains. These include: \nReduce air pollution by investing in cleaner, renewable sources of energy to replace fossil fuel combustion. Provide affordable access to public transportation and increase green spaces in urban areas. Provide better waste management options to prevent open burning of harmful chemicals. Create smart urban planning so that major sources of pollution are not located near schools, clinics or hospitals. Improve children\u2019s overall health to improve their resilience, including the prevention and treatment of pneumonia, as well as the promotion of breastfeeding and good nutrition. \nFor their part, parents can reduce children\u2019s exposure in the home to harmful fumes produced by tobacco products, cook stoves and heating fires. Finally, the paper says it\u2019s important to raise public awareness about the damaging effects of air pollution.\u201cNo child should have to breathe dangerously polluted air,\u201d Lake said, \u201cand no society can afford to ignore air pollution.\u201d \n\u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Williams has done a statistical analysis of the statewide distribution of polling places and voting machines. Listen / 2:00 \nHer study has shown, \"census tracts that have higher percentages of black residents have fewer polling places,\" she told the panel, adding that a \"census tract\" is an area of approximately 6x6 square miles. \n\"For a 10-percent increase in income per capita, there is nearly a one-percent increase in polling places within a census tract.

Dropped stocks can be readmitted to the index if they meet the requirements in the next rebalancing.\nOMXS30 is adjusted to reflect changes in the market cap of its components. Such changes can result from companies issuing new stock to raise capital or convertible notes converting to stock if such transactions affect the market capitalization of the component.\nOMXS30 was developed with a base value of 125 points in September 1986. The index went on to plunge to a record low of 98.86 points in November 1987, with the decline was linked to Black Monday rout that saw many stock markets shed huge value over a short time.

More > \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

He became prime minister for the second time in March 2009, and won the elections again in March 2015. In 2012, Time magazine dubbed Netanyahu \"the king of Israel\" because of his ability to dictate policy in the country's often fractious political climate. \nKnown informally as \"Bibi\", Netanyahu sees himself as the guarantor of Israel's security. He is said to believe that serious criticism of Israeli policies towards occupied Palestine is rooted in anti-Semitism, rather than in international law or morality. \nTo supporters, he is a strong spokesperson for Israel , willing to tell the public uncomfortable truths and able to stand up to enemies. \nTo critics such as Yuval Diskin, the former head of Israel's domestic intelligence organisation, Netanyahu holds an inflated sense of entitlement. Diskin once said: \"At play inside Netanyahu, in my opinion, is a mix of ideology, a deep sense that he is a prince of a 'royal family' from the Jerusalem elite, alongside insecurity and a deep fear of taking responsibility.\" Hardline policies \nBorn in Tel Aviv on October 21, 1949, Netanyahu grew up in Jerusalem but went to high school in the US, where his father taught history. His father, Benzion Netanyahu, was one of the original \"Revisionist Zionists\" who believed that Israel should exist on both sides of the Jordan River, rejecting compromises with neighbouring Arab states. \nOn his return to Israel in 1967, Benjamin Netanyahu enlisted in the Israeli army and soon became an elite commando; he served as a captain during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. \nHe then became a diplomat, and was appointed the deputy chief of mission at the Israeli embassy in Washington in 1982. In 1984 he was appointed Israel's ambassador to the United Nations. \n\"As long as I am prime minister, Iran will not have an atomic bomb... If there's no other way, Israel is ready to act [with force] .\" \n- Benjamin Netanyahu \nIn 1988, Netanyahu was elected to the 12th Knesset as a member of the right-wing Likud Party , and was appointed deputy foreign minister in the cabinet of then-prime minister Yitzhak Shamir. \nRising to the post of Likud Party chairman in 1993, Netanyahu orchestrated its return to political power after its defeat in the 1992 election. \nAn opponent of the Labour government's peace policies, many held Netanyahu responsible for cultivating Jewish right-wing support after the 1995 assassination of Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin. Netanyahu became prime minister for the first time after elections in March 1996. \nDespite opposing most peace deals with the Palestinians, Netanyahu signed the Wye River Accords in 1998 with Yasser Arafat, who was then the president of the Palestinian National Authority. \nNetanyahu later turned over most of the city of Hebron, the largest city in the West Bank, over to Palestinian jurisdiction. \nParties to the right of Likud accused Netanyahu of abandoning his initial promises of taking a hard line with the Palestinians, and threatened to walk out of a coalition government. \nForced to call elections 17 months early, Netanyahu lost to Ehud Barak, then the chairman of the Labour Party, in May 1999. \nThe embattled former prime minister would not return to government until 2002, when he was appointed foreign minister by Ariel Sharon, who became prime minister after winning in March 2001. \nThe two later competed for Likud's chairmanship, which Netanyahu lost. He regained his leadership of the party when Sharon left Likud to form Kadima in 2005, just before the 2006 elections. 'Existential' threat? \nDuring his first stint as prime minister, Netanyahu addressed the US Congress, telling legislators that \"time is running out\" to deal with Iran. \"The deadline for attaining this goal is extremely close,\" he said. \nBibi does not believe leaders of the Islamic Republic are necessarily rational actors, and has said Iran poses an \"existential threat\" to Israel. He has threatened unilateral military action against Iran on several occasions. \n\"As long as I am prime minister, Iran will not have an atomic bomb,\" he said in 2013. \"If there's no other way, Israel is ready to act [with force].\" \nHis relationship with former US President Barack Obama has been described as \"frosty\", as Obama has, on occasion, criticised the continued expansion of illegal Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land. \n\"We will carrying on building in Jerusalem and in all the places that are on the map of Israel's strategic interests,\" Netanyahu said. \nThe election of Donald Trump was eagerly greeted by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \nComing after a rocky eight years in US-Israel relations under President Barack Obama, their meeting in Washington, DC, was intended to signal a \"reset\" in relations between the two sides. \nTrump, who is relentlessly pro-Israel and has repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Palestinians has challenged the legitimacy of Palestinian demands for a state. \nOn December 6, Trump broke with decades of US policy and has announced that the US formally recognises Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and will begin the process of moving its embassy to the city. \nNetanyahu welcomed the decision, and said it was \" a historic day\" for Israel. Jerusalem \"has been the capital of Israel for nearly 70 years,\" he said in a statement. Why is Netanyahu trying to rewrite history? \nSOURCE: Al Jazeera and agencies", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "benjamin netanyahu benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "yuval diskin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benzion netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diskin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yitzhak rabin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ariel sharon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yitzhak shamir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bibi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ehud barak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yasser arafat", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "palestinian national authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "likud party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al jazeera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knesset", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "likud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kadima", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hebron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wye river accords", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington, dc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:16.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f2e789b312ee91bc98d8ede3bd16e80a1ac3a94d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog64RomttMIJpwnn3s_yzulDgcUrJftNfThmAfXqd8cxlxL3bXY390ecjZoMnSlWGUQTsUvmIqyIP0HrFBpvLQ2cZqjJDUpIanyGfuGIN603vca7ImEDVCUaWzJoKRBfsUPQ--", "site_full": "community.thomsonreuters.com", "site": "thomsonreuters.com", "site_section": "http://community.thomsonreuters.com/ts/rss/Community?interaction.style=group", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "rss.livelink.threads-in-node", "title": "+44-8081647818 Bittex Customer Help Number", "title_full": "+44-8081647818 Bittex Customer Help Number", "published": "2017-12-07T11:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2520, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f2e789b312ee91bc98d8ede3bd16e80a1ac3a94d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog64RomttMIJpwnn3s_yzulDgcUrJftNfThmAfXqd8cxlxL3bXY390ecjZoMnSlWGUQTsUvmIqyIP0HrFBpvLQ2cZqjJDUpIanyGfuGIN603vca7ImEDVCUaWzJoKRBfsUPQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoinsupport", "published": "2017-12-07T11:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "+44-8081647818 Bittex Customer Help Number", "text": "No Need To Worry , Simply call us for Bitcoin Support Number +44-8081647818Bittrex Wallet This Is very simple To Use \nWhen stumbling across new websites that trade crypto currencies, you would always ask yourself, are they legit?

It\u2019s fairly obvious we have a major failure in polling results if as the Ipsos/Mori Poll claims 84% of the country want a ban on hunting. This figure then appears a gross exaggeration if we then compare it to the Nation Trust vote. Just 60,000 could be bothered to cast a vote either way out of a possible 5 million in what was arguably the largest ever opinion poll ever conducted on hunting. Given the vote received nationwide coverage in the media a showing of less than 1% puts a mockery on the Ipsos/Mori poll result. And let\u2019s not forget a very important point here, The League Against cruel Sports have just 3,000 members.\nI took this up with the British Polling council as quite frankly it\u2019s a joke. They were very open and honest and this is what I found out \u2013 It\u2019s not their job so decide what is or isn\u2019t a bad or bent poll, they are their purely to make sure the information provided by the polling company on a particular poll is correct. For instance as long as they tell you they will fit the poll to suit your finances and objective then no rules are being broken, this is from Ipsos/Mori:\n\u201cOur aim when designing studies and responding to briefs is to put forward the approach that is most fit for purpose , taking account of clients\u2019 objectives and budget.\u201d \nThey are being honest as much as fulfilling the guideline\u2019s laid down by the British Polling Council, what they are saying is they will fit up a poll to fulfil your objective within budget, it doesn\u2019t matter how it is written that\u2019s what they are saying and putting themselves in the clear. So in the case of the League Against Cruel Sports their objective is to show the largest possible majority in favour of a hunting ban that also includes rural areas.\nTo show this large majority they will be advised by a polling company in this case Ipsos/Mori to use the quota sampling poll technique as opposed to the purest form of random probability sampling polling.\nWhy?\nA random probability sampling poll is far more accurate and will relay the information the 1,600 participants found and needed in the survey to represent the U.K. population was only reached after they had asked 30,000 meaning 28,400 were not interested enough to take part.\nThe quota sampling polling technique used by the League Against Cruel Sports does not report that figure of 30,000. Quite simply put, they don\u2019t want people knowing the vast majority are simply not interested enough to give time to answering questions on hunting.\nBut there are much greater failings in using quota sampling for an opinion poll, it wrongful assumes everyone in the country must have an opinion on the subject being asked. The fact 28,400 may have told them to get lost through lack of interest or not holding an opinion either way, the final sample they achieve of let\u2019s just say 1,600 respondents will then be answering on behalf of the 28,400 as well as the rest of the country. Now we can see how the National Trust vote materialised from just 60,000 voting out of a possible 5 million. Now we see how the ORB survey conducted during the election campaign found (0.39) of the respondents would list hunting in the top three to influence their vote.\nhttps://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2017/06/tom-hunt-fox-hunting-i-was-a-candidate-in-an-urban-seat-and-i-can-tell-you-that-it-did-no-real-damage-to-our-support.html \n\u2018In total, 2,038 were interviewed and each one was asked to spontaneously raise three issues that would influence their vote. Only eight mentioned hunting (0.39 per cent). Moreover, of these eight people, seven said they were unlikely, or would never, vote Conservative.\u2019 \nSo along with the already bias quota sampling technique Ipsos/Mori offer a choice of four rural/urban definitions. These definitions are on a sliding scale that will include more urban areas as rural, so now you can live on the outskirts of town next to a busy A-road and be classed as rural. Naturally as the ONS definition includes more urban areas this is the one advised for the League Against Cruel Sports. Again Ipsos/Mori cover themselves in their rurality guide, they do tell you to pick the definition that is most likely to give you the result you want, however dressed down they try and make it.\n\u201cIt is vital that if you wish to include a rurality analysis in your tables or a rurality definition into your sample design, you should understand what you are trying to achieve, and ensure that you use an appropriate definition.\u201d \nUnbelievable I am not yet finished on the bias, because as every opinion pollster will know the folk most likely to want to take part in their surveys are the most politically active and opinionated.\nSo now we end up with a well-known bias poll technique used in conjunction with a biased rurality technique giving them more coverage in urban areas asking folk most likely to be very politically opinionated, lefties in other words.\nThe view the Hunting opinion polls is rigged as are all the other animal rights related polls would strain ones credibility to breaking point to deny. As Hunting along with other animal rightists issues are elevated to a level of national importance through carefully targeted propaganda, and one where folk stand to lose their live hoods, then the government should seek to ban quota sampling or any other rigged polling method. The government use only the purest form of random probability sampling poll and should insist where a topic has been promoted to a state of national importance then only this method be used and results made available to the public. The failure by successive Conservative governments to recognise this rigging has led the country to be directed by tiny minority interest groups. \n \n \nTaken from ipsos Mori website \n\u201cIpsos MORI uses all major survey methods across our huge range of work. This runs from face-to-face in-home interviewer surveys using probability samples, through telephone surveys using quotas that are designed to reflect the population, to online studies using panels of people who have signed up to take part in surveys. \nOur aim when designing studies and responding to briefs is to put forward the approach that is most fit for purpose, taking account of clients\u2019 objectives and budget. Sometimes this will be a face-to-face or telephone methodology, sometimes internet or postal. \nWhere clients need a very high degree of accuracy or the assurance that all possible steps have been taken to remove any biases or distortions, only the purest forms of random probability sampling with face-to-face interviewing may be suitable, as is the case with many of the major government surveys that Ipsos MORI conducts.
