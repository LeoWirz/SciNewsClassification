It helps in making the costs of international calls minimum. It is important to make sure that your SIP dialer integrates with your existing phone and it does not require registration. To enjoy greater benefits, you should choose a dialer that works as a predictive dialer also. This may cause a certain degree of improvement in productivity and makes sure that the agents do not just waste time by calling bad numbers or make unsuccessful calls. Another add- on of the dialer is that it has an ability to broadcast messages that were recorded earlier to many calls. However, you should be sure that your SIP dialer allows you to control the system by switching to various modes. This way, you can choose what kind of setup is essential and which use.\nAnother benefit of the SIP Dialer is that it includes queuing and automatic initiation of call. This way you can make call back whenever necessary for monitoring and evaluating the performance of agents and the quality of calls. Recording feature can be very helpful in this case. If you want to have wallboard display then you should look for a predictive auto dialer as it is compatible with all types of web browsers. If you have SQL database or CRM software for monitoring, use SIP dialer and integrate it with your existing system. It is important to ensure your own safety by checking the dialer. You should see if it complies with basic security standards.\nIt is the responsibility of the SIP service provider to provide training on how the system is used. Some may turn on the video-based training for ensuring that proper procedure is followed. It is important to include service fee and maintain low setup fee. In addition, your service provider should not require you to invest in any type of hardware. You should also make sure that your service provider offers you unlimited technical support. This way you can get to know whom to call and how to contact for encountering all problems of the SIP auto dialer.

The U.S. Department of State stated this at the Global Forum on Asset Recovery at Washington, D.C , co-hosted with the UK Government in demonstration of continued commitment to preventing and combatting corruption globally. \n\nThe event is being attended by Nigerian Government officials led by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami and representatives of the Nigerian civil society organisations. \n\nThe department said since 2013, the U.S. government had provided foreign assistance to increase the Nigerian government\u2019s capacity to investigate and prosecute corruption and financial crime cases, including asset forfeiture and anti-money laundering. \n\nThe state department added that its programmes also sought to bolster Nigerian civil society\u2019s capacity to ensure transparency and accountability in government. \n\n\u201cOver the past three years, the United States has funded a project with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to mentor officials investigating and prosecuting money laundering crimes. \n\n\u201cThese include on asset forfeiture and counter financing of terrorism, in addition to providing technical assistance to the Nigerian judiciary. \n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with the EFCC to further strengthen EFCC institutional development, \u201d the state department said. \n\nThe U.S. government funds the Open Government Partnership\u2019s (OGP) Support Unit through a joint grant between the Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). \n\nThey work with civil society and governments to develop commitments aimed at countering corruption and promoting transparency. \n\nThe U.S. also funded a project which led to the drafting of Nigeria\u2019s OGP National Action Plan. \n\nThis was carried out through collaboration with EFCC, the ICPC, Nigeria Police Force, and several civil society organisations. \n\n\u201cThe U.S. foreign assistance also supported outreach efforts through infographics and social media on corruption-related issues. \n\n\u201cThese supports make public data from Nigerian anti-corruption agencies more accessible, and training Nigerian journalists on best investigative journalism practices,\u201d the state department said. \n\nAccording to the World Bank, over 20 billion dollars is stolen by corrupt officials annually. \n\nThe U.S. said: \u201cThis is money that should be used to ensure the sustainable development of these countries for essential services such as schools, hospitals, and roads. \n\n\u201cRather than lining the pockets of corrupt officials, these funds should help grow economies and improve the well-being of the people of these countries. \n\n\u201cTo help prevent and combat kleptocracy, U.S. assistance helps strengthen transparency and accountability within government institutions\u201d. \n\nSince 2016, the Department of State and USAID have dedicated more than 115 million dollars annually to a wide range of foreign assistance efforts to counter corruption.\n\nThese include capacity building of foreign governments to create stronger laws and more effective institutions; investigate, prosecute, and secure convictions for corruption offences.

Nigeria is my target and I will remain focused to move the country forward,\u201d Buhari said.\nHe said his administration would continue to accord priority attention to education so as to empower the youth, to enable them contribute their quota toward the development of the country.\n\u201cIf you educate people, you empower them. So we have to make sacrifice to prepare the youth for the future,\u201d Buhari said. \n\nHe expressed happiness over the wonderful reception accorded him and his entourage by the people of the state on their arrival in the state capital. \n\n\u201cI am overwhelmed by the massive turnout of people who left what they were doing to welcome me. This should be a clear message to the opposition. \n\n\u201cThe support has been consistent, so I don\u2019t have words to express my appreciation to the people of Kano state.\u201d \n\nThe President congratulated Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje for working very hard to improve the living standard of the people of the state through execution of projects that had direct bearing on them. He described Ganduje as a good politician who worked closely with all politicians, particularly representatives of the state, at the state and National Assemblies.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Ganduje said his administration had been able to execute a number of developmental projects, in addition to initiating various empowerment programmes for the women and youths.\nHe said as part of effort to address unemployment, the state government had awarded contract worth over N2 billion for the construction of a skills acquisition training centre, assuring that the centre would soon be completed and put to use.\n\n\u201cWe have a number of projects that are ongoing and we hope you will visit the state in near future in order to commission such projects,\u201d Ganduje said.

the minister has assured the council that there is enough products for the next one month even to end of January,\u2019\u2019 the minister stated. \n\nAccording to him, there is usually more demand for petrol product during the yuletide which explains the scarcity of the product during the period. \n\nMohammed said that the council had given a marching order to the Petroleum Minister (State) that the fuel crisis in the country should not last beyond the weekend. \n\nHe said that the minister had given assurance to ensure that the problem was contained. \n\nOn digitization, the minister said that the migration from analogue was on course. \n\nHe said that the digital switch over (DSO) platform in Ilorin would soon be inaugurated while those in Kaduna, Osogbo and Enugu were also ready for inauguration. \n\n\u201c\u201dWe hope that in the next couple of weeks we are going to inaugurate these DSOs. \n\n\u201c\u201cThe idea is that in the next few weeks we will inaugurate one DSO in one state in each of the regions of the country,\u2019\u2019 he said. \n\nMohammed observed that there were challenges the country was working on especially the issue of set up boxes as the government was not in a position to subsidise 40 million set up boxes. \n\n\u201c\u201dWe are looking at bringing down the cost of the boxes at the same time not lowering the quality of those boxes. \n\n\u201c\u201cI think the set up manufacturers are working very hard to bring the cost from 40 dollars to 20 dollars and we are also working with the governors and local government chairmen to see how we can collaborate. \u201c\u201dThey can buy more boxes while we use our technology to ensure efficient payment of television licenses,\u2019\u2019 the minister said ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lai mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alhaji lai mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibe kachikwu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemi osinbajo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "premium motor spirit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal executive council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "enugu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaduna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilorin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "osogbo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:58.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "430f72094b77f816763bfcdc58ca14f18828211d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju36NP1vGI3oiSHP7ZAFZy1o89X99frLzzyfokfJ1Zdppo3m07KU9jTrNDqCIhHW27E8-", "site_full": "www.ign.com", "site": "ign.com", "site_section": "http://www.ign.com/boards/forums/nintendo-lobby.80041/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Nintendo Lobby | IGN Boards", "title": "Nintendo 20 Questions - Round #162", "title_full": "Nintendo 20 Questions - Round #162 | IGN Boards", "published": "2017-12-06T11:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.ign.com/boards/styles/default/ign/ign-logo-100x100.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 383, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f87bbf762ddc790a52929b30572535eb64730d67", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju36NP1vGI3oiSHP7ZAFZy1o89X99frLzzyfokfJ1Zdppo3m07KU9jTrNT6FkurMtuX2SraiIDEAZ7g--", "ord_in_thread": 14, "author": "NardDog", "published": "2017-12-06T17:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Developer(s) id Software [a]\nPublisher(s) Bethesda Softworks\nDirector(s)\nMarty Stratton Hugo Martin Producer(s) Timothy Bell\nDesigner(s) Jason O'Connell\nProgrammer(s) Billy Ethan Khan\nArtist(s) Hugo Martin\nWriter(s) Adam Gascoine\nComposer(s) Mick Gordon\nSeries Doom\nEngine id Tech 6\nPlatform(s)\nMicrosoft Windows PlayStation 4 Xbox One Nintendo Switch Release Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 , Xbox One\nWW: May 13, 2016 Nintendo Switch\nWW: November 10, 2017 Genre(s) First-person shooter\nMode(s) Single-player , multiplayer\nPlayers take the role of an unnamed marine as he battles demonic forces from Hell that have been unleashed by the Union Aerospace Corporation on a future-set colonized planet Mars . The gameplay returns to a faster pace with more open-ended levels, closer to the first two games than the slower survival horror approach of Doom 3 . It also features environment traversal, character upgrades, and the ability to perform executions known as \"glory kills\". The game also supports an online multiplayer component and a level editor known as \"SnapMap\", co-developed with Certain Affinity and Escalation Studios respectively.\nDoom was announced as Doom 4 in 2008, but underwent an extensive development cycle with different builds and designs before being restarted in 2011, and revealed as simply Doom in 2014. It was tested by customers who pre-ordered the Bethesda game Wolfenstein: The New Order , and also by the general public. Mick Gordon composed the music for the game, with additional music contributed by Ben F. Carney, Chris Hite, and Chad Mossholder.\nDoom was well received by critics and players. The single-player campaign, graphics, and gameplay received considerable acclaim and praise, with reviewers crediting the game for recapturing the spirit of the classic Doom games and first-person shooters of the 1990s, whereas the multiplayer mode drew the most significant criticism. It was the second best-selling video game in North America and the UK a few weeks after its release, and sold over 500,000 copies for PCs within the same period.\nCongrats @Pup313 , I think this was the fastest round yet.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:58.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3b5e54c6bbc96190d8944a15e09a2b0f0229ebdc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG2yh5JWF23GprLgiQAey8OZsg9G3AO2RnhRbbY_tyTczgzboJ71H4atAYhtwcxeRPmBLBnx9aTI1CZQK6cEhUMnZI7piD2heTs8suBNeJB0xCBc9Gx49X3DLNnTy3K8SFORG79mICdUfDpkNEw3c6z15Z58lWSsCDsjdjKf2j2Wao-", "site_full": "www.mumsnet.com", "site": "mumsnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/antenatal_clubs", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Ante-natal clubs | Mumsnet Discussion ", "title": "November 2017 #5.

Mainly because I think we forget about the seriousness of a tattoo sometimes. Well, I know I do. \nLike I\u2019m absolutely fine with the fact that there\u2019s permanent ink on my body. What I didn\u2019t think was so serious back when I was planning all my embarrassing body art at the age of 14, was the aftercare. After all, you\u2019re getting poked with a needle injecting ink into your skin god knows how many times. It\u2019s not exactly natural. It\u2019s a pretty big deal. \nSo the first few months of care are so important. The artists that have tattooed me have both said it takes around 6 weeks to fully heal. But it obviously depends on the size and detail. My thumb tattoo healed in about a week because of it\u2019s simplicity. Well, the design is a little complex but ultimately, it\u2019s just a few lines, so not a lot of ink. \nEither way, I always keep up my aftercare routine for at least 2 weeks after I feel the tat has healed, just to be sure all is good. \nYou\u2019ve probably seen a fresh tattoo wrapped up in cling film. After a few hours, it\u2019s time to take off that first wrap. G ently cl ean the tat with warm water and a fragrance free soap (I use Imperial Leather) . Then cover it in cling film again overnight. After my second tattoo, I was told that there would be a strange \u201cgoo\u201d all over the tattoo when it\u2019s under the film for a while. This seems to be the part everyone hates, but me being gross, I actually enjoy it. \nUsually, I wet some kitchen roll with warm water (to save ruining a flannel, like I did the first time) and wipe over the tattoo to get all the excess junk off . I think it\u2019s strangely fun, to the point where I now get a little disappointed when there\u2019s no more goo. I have a feeling that\u2019s because the tattoo doesn\u2019t feel so new anymore though. \nAfter the tattoo is free of goo, I clean it with some soap again and dab it dry. When I got my arm tattooed, the artist gave me a new cream they were using, Fade the Itch. You rub a thin layer of this onto the artwork after you\u2019ve washed it. The cream speeds up healing time without the annoying itchiness so I\u2019d definitely recommend it if you\u2019re looking for something to use on a fresh tat! I\u2019m pretty sure you can get it on Amazon . \nI wait until the cream has air dried and then I wrap it up in cling film for the day again. I repeat all of that before I go to bed. I tend to repeat this whole routine for 2 \u2013 3 days. Then the only difference is that I don\u2019t use the film anymore as it\u2019s not needed. The Fade the Itch cream often lasts about a fortnight when I use it twice daily, so I keep using that until it runs out. \nThen I still keep cleaning the tattoo morning and night, but just replace the cream with cocoa butter . The artist recommended using it after I got my arm done and it\u2019s been my saviour since, for all my skin, not just the inked areas. \nI still moisturise my tattoos every day even though they\u2019ve healed. You can never be too smooth, right? \nMy calf healed a lot quicker than my arm did. Probably because it\u2019s a tad smaller, but I\u2019m certain it\u2019s because of this aftercare routine. I was more confident I knew what I was doing this time after how well my arm tat healed, so naturally it seemed to work better. \nLike I said, I\u2019m not a pro. I (currently) only have 3 tattoos. But this aftercare routine works really well for me, so hopefully it\u2019ll give at least one of you some ideas, whether you\u2019re new to tattoos or not!

The message will be given to EU negotiators Monday, and follows intense pressure from both European and UK-based airlines as well as from the US Federal Aviation Authority. The FAA recently informed Britain it only has a few weeks during which to provide a legal structure for aviation safety acceptable to US inspectors\u2019 checks. Reassurances have been given to aeronautical manufacturers and the international aviation industry by the British Department of Transport that Britain will be staying in the EASA. According to a senior source within the department, the UK\u2019s proposal will be in the form of an offer to the EU based on government calculations that 40 per cent of all aviation technical expertise originates from the UK\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority. Another source views the issue as being part and parcel with the second phase of negotiations, adding it would be \u2018bizarre\u2019 if the UK ware excluded from EASA. Brit expats in Spain condemned to longer, far more expensive flights home to see family might consider the outcome more than just \u2018bizarre\u2019. Meanwhile, Brexit is being blamed for a drop in the numbers of EU-based students applying to study at UK universities. Figures have fallen by around 4.5 per cent, representing some 2,375 fewer applicants than in 2016. The fall represents a reversal in the rising year-in-year trend since 2012. Acceptances of British students by EU universities have also dropped, but only by 2.1 per cent. University CEOs are suggesting uncertainty caused by Brexit is the reason for the drop in EU applicants, all of whom pay far more than their UK equivalents to study at British universities. It\u2019s not all bad news for British unis, however, as international, non-EU students are still flocking to the UK\u2019s top educational institutions. This year\u2019s numbers were the highest ever at 76,380, demonstrating that a British university degree is worth the time, effort and money it takes to achieve. Many international students go on to post-graduate qualifications, and often become long-stay expats in the UK once they\u2019ve found a suitable job.

Yet another hit at expat professionals living and working in Kuwait comes in the form of a proposal by the emirate\u2019s Real Estate Association that expats should be prohibited from renting private homes. The suggestion was met with strong criticism from real estate agents themselves, with one stating renting out private homes to expats is considered the norm by a good number of Kuwaitis. Apparently, a number of Kuwaiti property investors even have properties built with the sole intention of letting them to incoming expat professionals. According to one prominent real estate agent, plots are now being sold to locals whose intent is to build rental properties to be let out as an investment. The agent also stressed real estate professionals are pushing for expats to be allowed to own their own homes in the emirate. This, he says, will have a strong, positive effect on Kuwait\u2019s property sector. Another realtor believes renting out specially-converted apartments within large family homes should not pose problems for the home-owners themselves. However, Osama al Otaibi, a former member of the emirate\u2019s Municipal Council, disagrees and states a law exists which prevents Kuwaiti home owners from renting out to unmarried men, no matter whether they are expats or nationals. Another former council member, Meshal al Juwaisari, dismissed the Real Estate Association\u2019s request, saying the association should rather focus on enforcing the law against unmarried males by evacuating them from private residential districts. Dr Hassan Kamal agreed, but insisted alternative accommodation should be found for those who are evicted, adding that expatriate families should not face eviction. Meanwhile in Saudi Arabia, the row over the issuance of driving licenses to expats goes on. Recent reforms of the original statement suggest expats earning a low minimum wage should be prohibited from obtaining a driving license, excluding those who have a license to work as drivers. At present, expats earning more than 4,000 riyals are disallowed from getting driving licenses but, as discussions continue, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what will come next.

What apps? \n\n\nI figured I would have to justify my statement. The Shield has a big reputation and what seems like a lot of satisfied users. I am absolutely no expert on this, just an occasional hobbiest who wants to stream some TV. For me, the Shield has been a major disappointment. \n\nWhen I tried to install it, I immediately started encountering apps from the Play store that wouldn\u2019t work. I couldn\u2019t even get them to install. These were helper apps I had on my Chinese box for starting up Kodi and presenting a simple interface to non-technical users. One is called Launch on Boot, which auto-starts Kodi. Another is Simple TV Launcher, which presents a simplified Android interface. There were others along the way, but these are the ones I remember. \n\nThe one that really bugged me was Medici TV. This is a classical performance app that works fine on the Chinese box. I can\u2019t get it to work in any way on the Shield. To watch it I have been forced back to HTTP on my pc. For me, that was the deal breaker. But it turns out that the Shield also cannot see my LAN, or the Windows computers on it. Apparently I have to install Plex for that, but I don\u2019t want to have to install Plex on this system at this time. I just want to stream some IPTV sources (which the Shield also doesn\u2019t support, according to their technical help, but it does at least support Kodi). \n\nWhat all of this says to me is that the Shield is incredibly inflexible for something that costs so much. I run the SMPC version of Kodi and that is supposed to be optimised for the Shield, which is supposed to be faster and to have more memory than generic boxes. I thought this might be helpful because I have issues with buffering in Kodi, but so far I have noticed little if any difference. This is just my own personal experience. Others may have better luck. \nI reject your reality and substitute my own. - Adam Savage", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:01.035+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a3896e1d395c46873ab883e5916cf3a7d93534f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmDXH07A89hEVTCf3UlJZI8Y6Sh3uqlZ1kf_OGiHY2D4f0Ghm8zKAlWKjATNhWJSMcSZUF1PWZ5PLlUNSgwQY3puIe3YjrNAUg-", "site_full": "regencyfactors.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://regencyfactors.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Regency Factors News and Comment", "title": "Winning tactics for board game manufacturer", "title_full": "Winning tactics for board game manufacturer", "published": "2017-12-07T11:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0a3896e1d395c46873ab883e5916cf3a7d93534f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmDXH07A89hEVTCf3UlJZI8Y6Sh3uqlZ1kf_OGiHY2D4f0Ghm8zKAlWKjATNhWJSMcSZUF1PWZ5PLlUNSgwQY3puIe3YjrNAUg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Regency Factors (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "Winning tactics for board game manufacturer", "text": "Industry:   Board game manufacturer \nRegion:  Scotland \nProduct:   Invoice Finance \nFacility size:   \u00a31M  With experience of 20 years in business management and management consultancy.  In 2004 the directors felt they could use their experience to set up a business using board games as an educational/training tool for corporate clients.  The management team considered the funding options available to them and decided that a move from their current finance provider was needed.  They needed a finance facility that would enable them to purchase components from abroad, so they approached Regency for these facilities.   Laura Ramsden of Regency Factors said   \"Our new client is a well established provider and is a classic case of an incumbent lender not supporting its clients .  The business had a number of issues with the provider, which have now been resolved allowing for an increased in turnover in a short period of time.\" \nCommenting on their new finance arrangement, the MD commented \n \"Our previous lender restricted our growth and was somewhat risk averse, meaning we could not expand our offering by purchasing parts from abroad.  Since working with Regency, we have increased our turnover by being able to take on clients we had previously been unable to\"  Regency Factors PLC  \nFor more than 20 years we have been structuring innovative financial solutions for our clients, many of whom today trust us with their invoice finance, trade finance, asset finance and purchase finance needs.
