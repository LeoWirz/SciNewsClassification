While speaking through his media aide, Makarfi said the reports in some media that he has confirmed interest in flying the party's ticket in the 2019 presidential election was not the true reflection of what he said in the interview he granted newsmen. He said, \"The attention of Sen. Ahmed Mohammed Makarfi has been drawn to reports in some sections of the media, which seem to suggest that he has confirmed an interest in seeking to fly the flag of PDP in 2019. This is not a very true reflection of what the Distinguished Senator gave out in a chat with some newsmen couple of days ago.\"The fact is the senator was asked what threat the return of Atiku Abubakar to the party portended to the aspirations of others who had either made their intentions known or those, who, like him were rumoured to be nursing such ambition.\"His answer was that Atiku's return would not, in any way, adversely affect the rights of any member of the party to aspire to any position, adding that there was no preconditions to the return as Atiku Abubakar did not ask for, neither did the party offer any concessions to him beforehand.\"Sen. Ahmed Makarfi wishes to assure the teeming Members and supporters of the PDP and indeed the entire country that his own major preoccupation at the moment is to discharge the responsibility given to him to lead the process of repositioning the party, which he hopes will culminate in the conduct of a very credible and transparent convention this Saturday.

The Bible has and always will be nothing more than a description of how a person is suppose to act - not a group of people nor a government. For instance, the Ten Commandments are a set of laws on how one is suppose to act in order to be a Christian and not how you are suppose to FORCE someone to act.\nI posted this one another thread and this passage comes to mind when I think of the Far Right, Roy Moore and the so called evangelicals and this passage came about because one of Jesus' disciples asked Jesus which of the commandments was the greatest and Jesus answered him by saying to \"Love thy father with all thy heart and to love one another as I have loved you\" and for me, this is how a Christian should act. Not by condemning them or forcing them to switch to your religion, etc. but accept them as they are but at the same time, not becoming one of them. As an example of this, someone posted that God destroyed Gomorrah and yes, God did in fact destroy Gomorrah according to the Bible but Lot and his family escaped. Why? Because even though they were living in Gomorrah, they still followed God's laws. Did they try to force the other people in this city to change?

Sometimes we mix them with dub, sometimes we take it back to pure country.\" The album will also include new material that he's writing with longtime studio collaborator and keyboard player Simon Climie, once of the 1980s hitmakers Climie Fisher. \nWatching Life In 12 Bars for the second time at a screening in New York recently was \u201cnot as bad as the first time I saw it,\u201d he notes. The film describes how music came to Clapton's rescue at every crisis point in his life. \u201cListening to music became just as important as being able to play. During all of those periods of my life, I found new or old music that helped me, that got me through even when I wasn't playing well or I wasn't playing at all.\u201d \nThe guitar hero also says Sheeran, who has cited Clapton as a major influence, asked him for advice on how to handle his spectacular worldwide success. \u201cAnd what I've said to him is, 'Slow down. Don't burn it all up too fast.' But he seems to be committed to go as far as he can. He wants to conquer the globe. But what do you do then? Where do you go from there? It can't always be up \u2013 for anybody.\u201d \nClapton further reveals that he has largely recovered from the extensive skin inflammation he was suffering from. \u201cI had eczema from head to foot,\u201d he says. \u201cThe palms of my hand were coming off, and I had just started making this record [ I Still Do ] with [producer] Glyn Johns. It was a catastrophe. I had to wear mittens with Band-Aids around the hands and played a lot of slide [guitar] as a result.| \nNow, he says, \u201cMy hands are good. It hasn't gone completely, but I put ointment on. It's just getting old now.

For the past 10 years I have lived off the dividends and interest as well as a couple of pensions, and although my principal sum has not decreased at all, obviously if inflation were taken into consideration one can argue that it has. For my part I believe I can, in the main, overcome the effects of inflation here in Thailand by living and buying wisely. I can't see myself investing in anything else unless, as I said, a good bond issue becomes available in NZ, mainly because I don't need to and by my calculations I will need to live to well over a hundred to have used everything up, based on my current rate of spend and a small inflation calculation. PS. I too look at the global situation and cannot see the justification in share market valuations irrational exuberance comes to mind again.

President Michel Aoun to the office of President of the Lebanese Republic were revealed by LibanPost on Wednesday, December 6, 2017, during a ceremony at the Presidential Palace in Baabda.\nIn addition to the president himself, the unveiling was attended by Minister of Telecommunications Jamal Jarrah, General Director of Post in Lebanon Dr. Mohammed Youssef, and from LibanPost Chairman Khalil Daoud, senior marketing manager Ronnie Richa, and counselor Roni Alpha.\nChairman Khalil Daoud expressed to Aoun LibanPost\u2019s pride in producing the stamps that \u201ctell the story of a nation, the dignity of a state, living amid challenges and dangers, and uphold the right to exist, free and independent,\u201d adding that his election after more than two years of vacuum \u201chas restored hope to the citizens and renewed their dreams of a state of institutions and a reformist approach at all levels.\u201d\nThe new stamp releases follow the tradition by which the Council of Ministers commissions LibanPost, Lebanon\u2019s postal operator, to create a stamp celebrating the election of a new president of the republic.\nSpeaking at Baabda Palace, Minister of Telecommunications Jarrah told President Aoun during the ceremony that stamps are \u201ctoken gifts from the Ministry of Telecommunications, LibanPost and the Post Office of Lebanon, which is the least we can offer to your Excellency in recognition of your achievements.\u201d\nAoun, who was elected to office in October 2016, requested that in addition to a stamp bearing his likeness, two additional stamps be created to mark the occasion.\nThe first of two stamps honors \u201cThe Return of the People\u2019s Flag to the People\u2019s Home\u201d. In December 1989, a group of young people staging a sit-in at Baabda Presidential Palace in support of then-General Aoun undertook an initiative in which it asked citizens to add their signatures to a giant specially-created Lebanese flag. Under the slogan \u201cSign for your identity, sign your flag,\u201d the initiative garnered 126,549 signatures in total. The flag was later presented by demonstrators to General Aoun, who promised that \u201cthe national flag will continue to fly over all of Lebanon.\u201d\nFollowing the renewed violence in the country in 1989-90, the flag was smuggled out of the Presidential Palace by a female activist for safekeeping. On November 20, 2016, the first national Flag Day under the presidency of Aoun, the flag was returned to the palace. Upon being presented with the flag for the second time, President Aoun described the artifact as a representation of \u201cthe unity of Lebanon, the land of Lebanon, and the people of Lebanon who were imprisoned with us for 15 years.

But it seems the candidates on this year\u2019s The Apprentice missed the memo. \nAs I sat down to watch the show Wednesday night, still revelling from the fact #MeToo and \u2018The Silence Breakers\u2019 had been named Time \u2019s \u2018Person of the Year\u2019, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. \nFor those who missed the show, Lord Sugar tasked the candidates with organising a fashion show and contestants Michaela and Elizabeth were given the job of booking male models for the occasion. Both women were grossly inappropriate from the moment the men entered the room, giggling and joking about the task being \u201call business and no pleasure at all\u201d. \nMichaela demanded to check to see if one of the models had a six pack, which could be justified during a casting for an industry that is, after all, based on aesthetics. But it was the way she did it, mock flirting and biting on the end of her pen, that made it clear this was not a professional request. \nTo add insult to injury, Elizabeth made a joke about slipping with the tape measure while measuring a model\u2019s inside leg, touching his crotch in the process. Michaela found the whole thing hilarious and judging from the tweets posted by the BBC\u2019s official account for the show, the viewers were meant to, too. \u2014 The Apprentice (@bbcapprentice) December 6, 2017 \nHave I missed something, or is this not exactly the same behaviour we\u2019ve spent the last few months calling men out for? \nThe #MeToo movement provided a much-needed platform for women around the world to say sexual harassment is not a joke: it\u2019s vile, it\u2019s intimidating and it can have long-lasting traumatic effects. \nMichaela and Elizabeth\u2019s actions - and the BBC\u2019s contextualisation of them - risk undoing all the hard work the \u2018Silence Breakers\u2019 did to dispel the myth that this behaviour is tantamount to banter. \nIn my opinion, one if not both of the female candidates should have been fired on the spot for their behaviour, but the incident wasn\u2019t even mentioned in the boardroom. Instead Harrison - a male candidate on the opposing team - was ribbed by Karren Brady in the boardroom for \u201cenjoying\u201d hiring the female models when he did nothing except smile politely during the casting. The double standard is mind-boggling. \nThe Apprentice undoubtedly has elements of pantomime - with Karren and Claude pitted as the baddies against the candidates - but we can\u2019t ignore that much of the show is microcosmic of how businesses in the UK operate. \nThis saga is just the latest incident on the programme to show today\u2019s workplaces still peddle outdated gender stereotypes.

Franken\u2019s term. \nI don\u2019t see that happening because it\u2019s a risky move. If he picks his lieutenant governor to replace Sen. Franken, the President of the Senate would become his lieutenant governor for what\u2019s left of Gov. Dayton\u2019s term. The President of the Senate is Michelle Fischbach , a Republican from Paynesville. That\u2019s a totally safe district for Republicans so there\u2019s virtually no chance for the DFL to flip that Senate seat. \nThe downside of having a Republican as the lieutenant governor for a DFL governor is that she\u2019d be privy to Gov. Dayton\u2019s decisions. Theoretically, it\u2019s possible for the lieutenant governor to leak sensitive information to the Republicans. And once she\u2019s sworn in, there\u2019s no firing her. \nA special election would follow for voters to pick someone to serve for the remainder of Franken\u2019s term, which ends in January 2021. \nAnother reason why I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely Flint-Smith will be Gov. Dayton\u2019s pick is because Flint-Smith opted to not run for governor this time. \nAccording to this article , if Gov. Dayton picked her, she\u2019d likely be a caretaker senator: \nIf he taps Smith as a caretaker senator, Dayton would be giving the job to someone who apparently has no further political ambitions. Smith was Dayton\u2019s chief of staff in his first term, after which he chose her as his second-term running mate. She had previously decided not to run for governor to replace him. \nThe article names potential DFL candidates, too: \nMeanwhile, a variety of party big names would likely consider running for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Franken: U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, who would be the state\u2019s first black senator; two other U.S. representatives, Rep. Betty McCollum and Rep. Rick Nolan; or state Rep. Ilhan Omar, who would become the Senate\u2019s first Somali-American member. \nRepublicans couldn\u2019t get lucky enough to run against Ellison or Omar. They\u2019ve got more baggage than a DC-10. They\u2019d be fortunate to win 10% of the rural vote. Ditto with Betty McCollum. On the GOP side, people are talking about whether Tim Pawlenty or Norm Coleman would run.

He led an amazing life. Hammond was a laborer, a fur trapper (by dogsled), a World War II fighter pilot, an Alaskan bush pilot, a husband, a father of three, a wildlife biologist, a backwoods guide, a hunter, a fisher with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and a homesteader. Hammond was one of the last people to take advantage of the Civil-War-ear U.S. law giving away land. Other than a requirement to build a house and farm the land for five years, it was given away free\u2014no strings attached. \nHammond was also a hero to everyone who believes that no one should be barred from the resources they need to meet their basic needs\u2014no strings attached. \nHammond got the idea for a resource dividend when he was mayor of a small town on Bristol Bay, Alaska in the 1960s. He realized that salmon were being taken out of the area without necessarily helping the town\u2019s poor. He proposed a three percent tax on all fish caught in the area to be redistributed to all residents of the town. By an enormous stroke of luck, the man who had that idea (and saw it work in Bristol Bay) would be elected governor of Alaska just as the state was beginning construction of the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline. Oil companies stood to make billions of dollars, and of course, they argued that Alaskans would benefit through new job opportunities, but Hammond knew one way to make sure that every single Alaskan would benefit from the pipeline. \nAnd so the Alaskan Permanent Fund was born. For the last 20 years, every Alaskan has received income from state oil revenues. A portion of the state\u2019s taxes on Alaskan oil goes into an investment fund, which pays dividends from the interest on those investments\u2014hence the permanent fund. Dividends vary, but they are usually more than $1,000 per year for every man, woman, and child living in the state. \nThe system is not perfect. Hammond told Tim Bradner, of the Anchorage Daily News, that his biggest regret was to let the legislature eliminate the state\u2019s income tax. Without the citizens\u2019 responsibility to pay taxes to support state services the fund will be vulnerable, and the legislature has been trying to raid the fund ever since. So far, the enormous popularity of the fund has protected it fairly well. Hammond also regretted that the fund was too small. Only one-eighth of the state\u2019s oil tax revenues go into the fund. If half of oil tax revenues went into the fund, as Hammond envisioned, every Alaska family of four could expect to receive more than $16,000 this year. Hammond died campaigning to increase the size of the fund. \nBut the most important thing about the fund is that it exists. It\u2019s simple, it works, and everyone in the state benefits from it every year. How many elected officials can say they did that? According to Sean Butler in Dissent Magazine, Nobel Prize-winning economist Vernon Smith, called the Permanent Fund, \u201ca model governments all over the world would be wise to copy.\u201d It is a pilot program for resource taxes and basic income plans all over the world. Economists have recommended the Alaska solution for resource-rich, poverty-ridden countries from Nigeria to Iraq. Just this summer the government of Azerbaijan sent a delegation to Alaska to study the Permanent Fund. You can\u2019t keep a good idea down. \nJay Hammond spoke at the 2004 USBIG Congress in Washington, DC. Here is how Butler describes the event: \u201cThe father of the Brazilian basic income, Senator Eduardo Suplicy, also presented at the USBIG conference last year. During his speech, he noticed Jay Hammond sitting in the front row, and, to warm applause from the assembled crowd, descended from the stage to shake his hand. The two basic income pioneers had at last met. Hammond and Suplicy make an odd couple. The Republican Hammond, with his Hemingway-like white beard and grizzly build, wears his far north ethos of self-reliance with pride. Suplicy, a founding member of the left-wing Brazilian Workers Party and a U.S.-trained economist, has the dignified appearance of an intellectual and professional politician. Its tropical socialism meets arctic capitalism; yet somehow, when the two come together over basic income, they get along.\u201d \nI had the good fortune to attend that event and meet Governor Hammond. He was warm and engaging. He wasn\u2019t there to bask in the glory of people who admired his past achievements but to fight to keep improving the APF. He was a genuine hero. \nAn article on Hammond and basic income by Sean Butler, entitled, \u201cLife, Liberty, and a Little Bit of Cash,\u2019 appeared in Dissent Magazine just a few weeks before he died. \nThere have been many good tributes to Hammond in the news and on the internet since his death. Here are just a few: \nFrank Murkowski, current governor of Alaska, \u201cHammond\u2019s Legacy Will Stand Out,\u201d Alaska Daily News Tim Bradner, \u201cHammond has passed; his ideas must live on,\u201d Alaska Daily News Douglas Martin, \u201cGovernor of Alaska Who Paid Dividends,\u201d New York Times About Karl Widerquist Karl Widerquist has written 894 articles. \nKarl Widerquist is an Associate Professor of political philosophy at SFS-Qatar, Georgetown University, specializing in distributive justice\u2014the ethics of who has what.

I was fishing a simple pop-up presentation towards one of the remaining weed beds in the water quite simply because they still hold some heat. It was a supply braided rig, whipped to a size 8 hook completed with a CC Moore Northern Special and a few maggots on top. I spombed a gallon of maggots and 2kg CC Moore Live System crumb onto the spot.

Thankfully, she has her two best girls by her side.\nIt reads: \u201cJane is excited for her first book tour and brings Xo (Andrea Navedo) along for fun, but Alba (Ivonne Coll) decides last minute that she is going as well. Things take an unexpected turn at their first stop which makes all three ponder what they should do. Rafael (Justin Baldoni) and Rogelio\u2019s (Jaime Camil) attempts to take care of Mateo while Jane is away hits a bump, but ultimately might have made things better between them. Meanwhile, Petra (Yael Grobglas) thinks she has finally gotten a handle on the hotel, until a new problem arises.\u201d\nRafael already bonded with Alba when he moved into the Villanueva household, so bonding with Jane\u2019s dad is really going to help strengthen his relationship with Jane. Jane\u2019s mother and father both adore her late husband, Michael Cordero (Brett Dier), so having more of her family warm up to Rafael is a good sign that the two will get back together as the show progresses.\nBaldoni earlier told TV Guide that he is hopeful the two will rekindle their feelings for one another, but now is not the right time. Rafael has just lost his job and he even went on a downward spiral for a bit before Jane and Alba finally talked sense into him.\n\u201cI think at this snapshot in his life , he\u2019s not in a place to be a romantic partner to Jane, no. But again, this is a character that shows day in and day out that he can grow. I think she knows Rafael\u2019s heart and he made the right decision, but right now he\u2019s got to take care of himself and he\u2019s got to recover from what he did,\u201d he said.\n\u201cJane the Virgin\u201d Season 4 airs every Friday on The CW at 9 p.m. EDT. \nTwo unexpected people will join Jane (Gina Rodriguez) on her book tour.

Hopefully people will keep that in mind as we move into 2018.\u201d Bakk chimed in , saying \u201cI pretty strongly advised the governor the last night of the special session not to sign the tax bill because it wasn\u2019t sustainable. I\u2019m not happy I was right.\u201d \nTalk about a pair of DFL drama queens. Dave Orrick and Bill Salisbury co-wrote this article , which explains how little of a deal this is. First, they wrote \u201cthe federal government reauthorizes a health insurance program for children, which it very well might, the forecast shortfall would fall to about $10 million. There are other such variables that could make it rise or fall.\u201d It\u2019s virtually certain that they\u2019ll reauthorize the CHIP program. That eliminates all but $10,000,000 of the deficit forecast. Next, the model used anticipated only 2.2% growth. That\u2019s because this forecast model predicts that Congress won\u2019t pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \nIt\u2019s absurd to think that the economy will grow at only 2.2% since it\u2019s grown at 3.1% and 3.3% thus far this year. The third quarter would\u2019ve been better if not for 5 hurricanes hitting, virtually wiping out economic growth in Texas and Florida. \nEven Myron Frans, the state budget commissioner, downplayed the deficit, saying that the \u201cforecast deficit\u201d was \u201cmore of a mist than a downpour.\u201d \nThis video is part of the DFL\u2019s press conference: Sen. Cohen\u2019s statements are partisanship at its worst. The term sore loser leaps to mind, too. The DFL talks about the 2013-14 biennium as though it was the glory days. They weren\u2019t. Since the 2011 budget, spending increased by more than $15,000,000,000. That\u2019s fifteen billion dollars with a B. That\u2019s a spending increase of more than 33% in 2 biennium. Let\u2019s also remember that the surpluses following the 2013 budget session were the size of the tax increase. \nIt isn\u2019t that the economy grew by leaps and bounds. It\u2019s that the tax increase accounted for roughly 90% of the surpluses. Any budget that doesn\u2019t produce economic growth is worthless. That\u2019s what the nation rejected when they said no to a third Obama term. Meager growth isn\u2019t something to be praised. It\u2019s something to be criticized. \nThe Republicans wanted to pass a pro-growth budget. Gov. Dayton resisted that. For the third time in 4 budget sessions, we had a special session. Yes, unemployment is low but that\u2019s because we\u2019re spending like drunken sailors. There\u2019s a reason why people of all age groups are leaving Minnesota, especially for our neighboring states. \nIf Bakk, Cohen and Hortman don\u2019t ditch their socialist and/or crony capitalist policies, that outmigration will accelerate. Finally, if the DFL constantly stands in the way of pipeline and mining projects, we\u2019ll never see the good old days again.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bakk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill salisbury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave orrick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cohen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom bakk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa hortman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hortman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "myron frans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dayton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:13.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6d9254d7b78c7f71a66ba97d1cb89262b80d717e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9I0hiOGNPCkPHa_xS1WkofPvy_TDGrCCOJr5OrJ70o4s0QP9uyAUTeFXEeW5m68wCn7QhdNsj.z4yV8iIMF06F6UUrGdGnXv1OaT4Y87wDcMGocTnFrHvn", "site_full": "www.arhibook.ru", "site": "arhibook.ru", "site_section": "http://www.arhibook.ru/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Arhibook.ru - \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0438, \u0430\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043e\u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0438, \u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044b, \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u044b \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0441\u043c\u0441 \u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438", "title": "Hustler's Taboo \u21169-10 (September-October 2016) USA", "title_full": "Hustler's Taboo \u21169-10 (September-October 2016) USA", "published": "2017-12-07T08:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "RU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6d9254d7b78c7f71a66ba97d1cb89262b80d717e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9I0hiOGNPCkPHa_xS1WkofPvy_TDGrCCOJr5OrJ70o4s0QP9uyAUTeFXEeW5m68wCn7QhdNsj.z4yV8iIMF06F6UUrGdGnXv1OaT4Y87wDcMGocTnFrHvn", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "klot85", "published": "2017-12-07T08:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hustler's Taboo \u21169-10 (September-October 2016) USA", "text": "- Hustler's Taboo \u21167-8 (July-August 2016) USA Hustler's Taboo Magazine is for the extreme fetish, sadist, masochist, S&M, BDSM and kinky reader.

Mr Dayo Adeyeye, National Publicity Secretary of the National Caretaker Committee of the party made the allegation in a news briefing in Abuja. Adeyeye called on President Muhammadu Buhari to investigate and ensure that the convention was not disrupted. He said that the president was not involved in the plot but that some members of his party were out to cause confusion. \n\"We have credible information that some overzealous elements in the APC Government want to disrupt the PDP national convention. \n\"It is not from the very top; they know that if we have a hitch-free convention, it will mark the end of APC in power. \n\"We call on President Buhari to investigate and ensure that those who want to disrupt the convention refrain from doing so,\" he said. According to Adeyeye, disrupting the convention is tantamount to disrupting the country's democracy. He urged Buhari to go the extra mile to ensure that the PDP convention was successful by providing sufficient security in and around the arena. He stated that while PDP was in power, the party did not interrupt programmes of other political parties rather, it encouraged the growth of other parties. Adeyeye said that accreditation for the convention would be strictly monitored, and warned that persons not accredited would not be allowed within the vicinity of the Eagles Square. According to him, the list of accredited delegates will be made available to all aspirants at least 48 hours before the convention. According to him, this is to clear the air as it was rumoured that the list was altered to suit selected aspirants. Adeyeye said Osun would not participate in the national convention and that Anambra was still under consideration, following disagreements in the state. He said that former Vice President, Alhaji Abubakar Atiku, would deliver a speech the convention but may not be allowed to vote. He announced that the Chairman of the Convention Planning Committee, Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta, would meet with all chairmen of the party in the states on Friday. He said that the meeting would hold at the PDP National Secretariat in Abuja at 10 a.m. and that attendance was mandatory.

So this relationship I am speaking of here is on the verge of a break up and the perplex is \u201cHey, Why Is He Still Cheating? He has got it all in this lady\u2026 What Is His Stress or What More Is He Wanting?!!! And so many more questions rolling in the mind.\nThere are so many responses to give for the actions of cheating guys of which I\u2019d share a little from my knowledge. But of course can\u2019t be limited to these.\nSome guys can be silly confusing, unpredictable, immature and unstable as many ladies emotional state has been described as from sample conclusion. So with a level of certainty, I say some guys can pass for that qualification but it takes a partner with an opposite attitude to compliment such persons. This though, would depend on the partner\u2019s willingness to embark on such path with the guy.\n\nFrom personal experiences and of course from my counseling sessions with ladies with such experiences, I was able to draw up the following reasons which are open to debate from my dear readers.\nSome guys can be so discontent and insatiable. They just don\u2019t know what they want, they are neither here nor there and so you just expect those kind of people to keep jumping around and wanting to try out everything supposedly new that comes around. Some other guys just have the sheer desire to misbehave. Wanting their moves to be unpredictable. Wanting to be known as \u2019\u2019popular\u2019\u2019 (notorious), the badt guy gang thing. Sometimes, it is purely the ladies\u2019 nagging and annoying behavior that pushes the guy to cheat. Taking it as an escape route for peace. Not wanting to be deeply emotionally tied to someone for fear of heartbreak and other emotional issues sometimes makes guys want to cheat. Some guys just cheat for the fun of it! Amazing right? Yes, there are some like that. They feel it as moments of pleasure knowing well what effect it could be having on their partners, while sadly some don\u2019t even realize the hurt and pain and anger they are infusing on their partners. And I think I need to drop here also that cheating does not always necessarily mean with fellow humans but can come in where you deprive your partner of emotional contentment by doing as opposed to how/what you should be doing. This isn\u2019t popularly spoken on but i tell you, it comprises as an act of cheating. \nSurprisingly I thought to ask some of my male colleagues at work on some of their own reasons and mehn the spill was something else. A number of them were quick to defend the action as \u2018not-cheating\u2019 rather they say that since it is \u201cin a relationship\u201d, that implies that they are still single and have that level of entitlement of wanting to find the best out of the many ladies they come across, and so many other reasons they gave.\nAnyways, as always and as will continue to be on this platform for me\u2026 I\u2019m throwing it out to you guys and look forward to your amazing comments and insights on this question, \u201cWHY DO GUYS CHEAT\u201d? because of course your opinions means a lot plus a wider sample range of experiences would do more justice and also, from the perspective of those in question (the guys), it would be more reasonable to draw up conclusions as they are the ones doing the act/ probably know mates doing it. This would also serve as a source of answer and help to other people needing advices on how to reorganize and consciously work on their attitudes\u2026 for the ladies to stop pushing out their guys and guys to start comporting themselves in this aspect.\nSo yea, I am looking forward to this weekend\u2026 it is a steal-away from work even though it is for a short while *smiles. I hope you guys have fun too .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:14.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ddc183cfcb6f7181d4ae55e808bb91ca2cf631cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpBu27HLy1PJu_pxGoLIkUKEIe43edP1JjePsIWJJmeQsjxsGdiZr72X7dhD8FXIGv6_sMq8MqNQcxGSp4nlVFApSg4HNl1UjNb5jEMDWAw4A--", "site_full": "simplyjesme.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://simplyjesme.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "SimplyJesMe", "title": "4 different types of rice and which grains to choose - Short, medium or long grains?", "title_full": "4 different types of rice and which grains to choose - Short, medium or long grains?", "published": "2017-11-16T03:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f35838bcb593a774e1a926108360966883d5f48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpBu27HLy1PJu_pxGoLIkUKEIe43edP1JjePsIWJJmeQsjxsGdiZr72X7dhD8FXIGv6_sMq8MqNQcxGSp4nlVFApSg4HNl1UjOarhmTgLgdzw--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "sleepydevil", "published": "2017-12-05T12:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hi Jes,\n\nThis is something which I'm never aware of - about children.

Vice Mayor Planas only had the best interest of the city and nation in mind in all her endeavors as a city official and freedom fighter during the dark days of our nation\u2019s history.\u201d \nVice Mayor Planas\u2019 last public appearance was during Mayor Bautista\u2019s 8th State of the City Address in October.

InterAksyon \nPlanas was born April 28, 1931 in Tondo, Manila. Her sister, Carmen Planas, was the first woman city councilor of Manila. \nCharito Planas was a staunch opposition leader and led the campaign against the ratification of the 1973 Constitution. She was among the opposition leaders arrested after the declaration of Martial Law in 1972, according to a brief provided by QC Hall. \nPlanas was drafted in the Lakas ng Bayan slate led by former senator Ninoy Aquino in the 1978 interim Batasan elections. She slipped out of the country after the elections to join the anti-Marcos forces in the US. \nShe returned to the country after the 1986 People Power revolution and helped revive the Liberal Party. She ran for Mayor in the 1988 elections and lost to then incumbent officer-in-charge, Brigido \u201cJun\u201d Simon Jr. In the 1992 elections, she became the running mate of then congressman Ismael Mathay Jr. who won the mayoral race. \nPlanas served as Quezon City vice mayor from 1992 to 1995. She served as President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo\u2019s spokesperson with the rank of Undersecretary in the Office of the President in 2010-2011.

Earlier this year, coconut oil made headlines as the American Heart Association declared it unilaterally unhealthy ( mbg doctors largely disagree , with a few caveats). Now, a new saturated fat has fallen under the scrutiny of researchers: cheese. \nDairy has always been a dicey subject in the health food world. Many diets (paleo, vegan) tend to shun it, and some doctors point to it as the root of issues like inflammation, gut problems, and acne . The two primary exceptions are ayurveda, which embraces the milk by-product, and the of-the-moment keto diet , which relies on such a high-fat intake that cheese becomes practically a necessity. \nIn a new meta-analysis , researchers from China and the Netherlands analyzed 15 studies encompassing more than 200,000 people about the health effects of cheese. Thirteen of the studies analyzed went on for over 10 years. The findings? \nOverall, people who consumed high levels of cheese were 10 percent less likely to have a stroke and 14 percent less likely to develop coronary heart disease than participants who consumed no cheese. More isn't necessarily better, though. In the study, too much cheese was found to be as negative as too little, with the sweet spot hitting around 40 grams a day (about the size of a matchbook). Researchers didn't specify whether one type of cheese was better than the rest. \nBefore you go out and gobble down a slice of pizza, keep in mind that there may be more to the story. According to functional medicine practitioner Will Cole , D.C., there are many factors, such as the rest of a person's diet, that need to really be taken into consideration before making the claim that eating cheese every day is the key to minimizing heart disease. \"Cheese is a high-fat food that can be very popular in ketogenic diets, and these diets have been shown to actually decrease bad oxidated cholesterol and increase good HDL cholesterol and lower inflammation levels, all markers of higher heart disease risk,\" he says. \"The key is to really examine the context of the diet outside of cheese intake since eating extremely high levels of cheese was also correlated with increased heart disease risk. People may be eating more processed foods in addition to cheese, which can negate the benefits of these healthy fats.\" The take-away? Cheese is only one part of a diet, and while it may not be as harmful as previously thought, it's also not a panacea\u2014at least on its own. \nDr. Cole also notes the importance of the quality of said cheese. \"Focus on grass-fed, organic dairy,\" he says. \"It\u2019s also important to mention that not everyone tolerates dairy, even the grass-fed organic kind. We are all truly different, so listen to your own body.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cole", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new research says cheese is a health food", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "american heart association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:14.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50d6e2d84f2180426c307528e3d19524f39fb493", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_0zrWQjC3rcJ19KiQIiNXO64rVqjvI.i_BnvQh4h_WH63YcITNPymCRRkeWsBfc3CU36NJOcekCfvrlycoNgA0", "site_full": "www.productreview.com.au", "site": "productreview.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.productreview.com.au/c/home-builders.html", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Home Builders Reviews - ProductReview.com.au", "title": "Carlisle Homes", "title_full": "Carlisle Homes Reviews - ProductReview.com.au", "published": "2017-11-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.productreview.com.au/products/images/5e471751-24b9-4a34-85f7-cee17fce1ce8.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 14314, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ce58043fc211b8afcc4ce7e9eb7d1d1d9592a1c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_0zrWQjC3rcJ19KiQIiNXO64rVqjvI.i_BnvQh4h_WH63YcITNPymCRRkeWsBfc3CU36NJOcekCU.3NhUl56pWKWUvq7TGJmWxXvMLoSjhsQ--", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "Helena", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Excellent Customer Service", "text": "We have chosen the Carlisle to build our dream home as we love their home design after compared with many other building companies.
