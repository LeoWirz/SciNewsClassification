I found it absorbing, and I didn't want to stop reading it.\nBook Description: \nMy name is Becky. I arrived home to find my husband, Chris, stabbed to death and a gang of men ransacking our house. \n\nTurns out that Chris has something that belongs to them. And if I want to stay alive, I have to find it and return it. They have given me seven days. And a beating. \n\nThere is nowhere to hide and no time left to look. So I will stand my ground as the deadline approaches. All I have is a head full of lies and a very bad plan. \n\nThis is my story. \n\nAuthor Bio: \nAndrew Barrett has enjoyed variety in his professional life, from engine-builder to farmer, from Oilfield Service Technician in Kuwait, to his current role of Senior CSI in Yorkshire. \nHe\u2019s been a CSI since 1996, and has worked on all scene types from terrorism to murder, suicide to rape, drugs manufacture to bomb scenes. One way or another, Andrew\u2019s life revolves around crime.\nIn 1997 he finished his first crime thriller, A Long Time Dead, and it\u2019s still a readers\u2019 favourite today, some 120,000 copies later, topping the Amazon charts several times. Two more books featuring SOCO Roger Conniston completed the trilogy.\nToday, Andrew is still producing high-quality, authentic crime thrillers with a forensic flavour that attract attention from readers worldwide. He\u2019s also attracted attention from the Yorkshire media, having been featured in the Yorkshire Post, and twice interviewed on BBC Radio Leeds.\nHe\u2019s best known for his lead character, CSI Eddie Collins, and the acerbic way in which he roots out criminals and administers justice. Eddie\u2019s series is four books and two short stories in length, and there\u2019s still more to come.\nAndrew is a proud Yorkshireman and sets all of his novels there, using his home city of Leeds as another major, and complementary, character in each of the stories.\nYou can find out more about him and his writing at Andrew-barrett.co.uk \nLinks: \n\nContact: andrew@andrewbarrett.co.uk \nWebsite: http://www.andrewbarrett.co.uk/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ AndrewBarrettUK \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AndrewBarrett.author \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ andrewbarrettauthor / \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ andrewbarrettauthor \nAmazon.co.uk : https://www.amazon.co.uk/Andrew-Barrett/e/B0055888Q0/ \nAmazon.com: https://www.amazon.com/Andrew-Barrett/e/B0055888Q0/ \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew barrett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eddie collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eddie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "becky", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yorkshire post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oilfield service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc radio leeds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soco roger conniston", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "leeds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yorkshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuwait", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:37.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d946f56c3864347e2b18c1cf696462c3f8985e1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKw_qIK9JZxadI4sXLPksKhoXB_zIBr_7nBUQ6jTh9Lqoc4_qwDILD5atEFPb5zc_Hh6rBU0JCRD4KI6z0zBfKAlZjhMxGFNr1.EBz6L9VPQXw--", "site_full": "prostyporadnik.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://prostyporadnik.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Prosty Poradnik", "title": "Discount Coupon ($19.99) RIVERSONG Air X2 TWS Headset", "title_full": "Discount Coupon ($19.99) RIVERSONG Air X2 TWS Headset", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d946f56c3864347e2b18c1cf696462c3f8985e1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKw_qIK9JZxadI4sXLPksKhoXB_zIBr_7nBUQ6jTh9Lqoc4_qwDILD5atEFPb5zc_Hh6rBU0JCRD4KI6z0zBfKAlZjhMxGFNr1.EBz6L9VPQXw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "moot (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "Discount Coupon ($19.99) RIVERSONG Air X2 TWS Headset", "text": "Discount, Best Price, Active Coupon -

December 7, 2017 \nGoogle brings Two-wheeler mode to Maps in India, suggests fastest routes to bikers \nGoogle Maps previously displayed direction for only three kinds of people, one who are driving on their own, one who are travelling via train or bus, and lastly for people walking to reach their destination. But now, with the new update rolling in, Google brings a new category to the list \u2014 which is dedicated to the bikers, or in other words for the Two-wheeler owners. It is the Two-wheeler mode that Google Maps now gets. As the name suggests, this feature will show the fastest direction or route to the Two-wheeler riders to reach their entered destination. \nTrying to test the new Two wheeler feature, we discovered that it is currently available for Android users, while iOS users are yet to receive it. Well, if you are an Android user and haven\u2019t yet received the feature on your Maps, it is noteworthy that the new Motorcycle mode or Two-Wheeler mode comes with the latest version of Google Maps (v9.67.1) for Android. And in case you have the new version and still can\u2019t see the Two-wheeler option \u2014 go to settings to change it. \nThe Two-Wheeler mode is seen listed alongside the earlier alternatives \u2014 Car, Foot, and Train. Google believes that India is one of the major areas of focus for the company and latest feature in Google Maps is an indicator of the same. Considering the fact, a substantial chunk of the country\u2019s population travel on bikes or Two wheelers \u2014 the new Google Maps feature makes a lot of sense. \nBy introducing this feature, Google is possibly aiming at making traveling easier for the bikers out there. There are some unknown roads which are not wide enough for the big vehicles like trucks, buses or cars to pass through \u2014 however, motorbikes can easily swipe in. It is likely that Google may suggest such routes if you select the Two-wheeler mode available on Maps \u2014 which will be empty as well as will help you reach your destination much faster compared to the usual routes. \nWe tried testing the feature \u2014 and have seen that Google Maps informs the bikers about all the fastest routes possible to reach the entered destination. Apart from the direction, Google Maps like it shows for other modes also provides information about the parking situation at the destination, the traffic update and a few more features that come along with the other modes as well. \nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai recently said that India is playing an important role in improving Google Maps and other Google products. And it is likely that this new Two wheeler feature mode is an indicator of the same.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

Last yer Iowa won 78-64. Iowa Hawkeyes \nTo say the Iowa Hawkeyes have had a terrible season so far might be an understatement. Early in the year they lost to two mid major teams, both teams they were favored over. \nThey come into this game having lost three straight games, and although they were underdogs in all three games, they really didn\u2019t look good in any of the games. \nOn the road the Hawkeyes have had issues scoring points. Coming into this game they are only averaging only 59.5 points per game. \nIn this game if they want any chance to win, they are going to need to score more then 59 points. Iowa State Cyclones \nOn the other side of this match up is the Iowa State Cyclones who got off to a really bad start this year losing the first two games, but they have turned it around winning five straight games. \nIn their last game the offense really picked up and that led to a 94-80 victory. \nTo win this game the Cyclones need to push the tempo of the game, and try to make this high scoring. I don\u2019t think the Hawkeyes will be able to keep up if this is a high scoring game. CBB Betting Trends: Over is 9-3 in IOWA last 12 vs. Big 12. Under is 8-3 in IOWA last 11 non-conference games.

There are many things that one must look at to ensure that their business is well established. When it comes to the furniture industry, an entrepreneur must know the right things to do to overcome the ever-increasing competition. Vintage furnishings stores Fountain Hills AZ can be established well if one considers several things.\n\nHowever, the entrepreneur must build a good foundation for their business. Proper planning helps one to avoid or minimize the setbacks experienced when starting any business. The location plays an important role in the success of the business. It must thus be chosen carefully. Here are important things that people should check when selecting the position.\n\nA factor that usually determines where one will locate his or her shop is the kind of good that is going to be sold. In this case, where one will be selling vintage items, it can be convenient for an individual to open the establishment near other successful stores. It is necessary for an individual to understand the needs of the consumers. Opening in a residential area can also be a good idea.\n\nOpening a business in an area where there is less traffic of individuals can bring about great losses. Before one opens an establishment, it is imperative for the person to look at the human traffic within the area. When the store is in a place where there are many people, the number of potential clients will also increase. The entrepreneur should place the store conveniently for the passersby to take notice and decide to visit the premises.\n\nCompetition is another important factor that will determine the ideal location for business. It can be hard to establish a business in an area that has stiff competition. On the other hand, it is also not a good idea open the business in an area with no competition. Such areas may not be perfect for such businesses. Moderate competition is the way to go. Opening the store to other businesses that sell household items is a smart move.\n\nBusinesses should be accessible to people who need them and visible to every person even those who may not know about it. Accessibility makes it easy for people to work with it while visibility acts as a method of advertising it. The sign should be visible from the road. There should as well be adequate parking space.\n\nAnother factor that will determine the location is the cost of setting up the store in a specific location. Factors like security, rent, utility services and maintenance costs will contribute to the cost setting up the shop. Areas that are remote will require advisement for people to know the existence of the store. In addition, a second-hand shop will need extra money for renovation services. As such, one should take his or her time to see if the area is suitable for the opening of the store.\n\nOther small factors that affect the decision can be the distance that one requires traveling from their home among others. Many people want places near their residences for convenience. This improves the commitment that one has towards their business. This is because there is no need to travel for a long time to the shop. These are crucial things that play a major role in picking a business location.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nIf you are searching for information about vintage furnishings stores Fountain Hills AZ locals can come to our web pages today.

In spite of their popularity, MSE and RMSE lack an analytical framework allowing their calculation for known dynamic processes and cannot be reliably computed over short time series. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method to assess RMSE for autoregressive (AR) stochastic processes. The method makes use of linear state-space (SS) models to provide the multiscale parametric representation of an AR process observed at different time scales and exploits the SS parameters to quantify analytically the complexity of the process. The resulting linear MSE (LMSE) measure is first tested in simulations, both theoretically to relate the multiscale complexity of AR processes to their dynamical properties and over short process realizations to assess its computational reliability in comparison with RMSE. Then, it is applied to the time series of heart period, arterial pressure, and respiration measured for healthy subjects monitored in resting conditions and during physiological stress. This application to short-term cardiovascular variability documents that LMSE can describe better than RMSE the activity of physiological mechanisms producing biological oscillations at different temporal scales.\n\nfrom #AlexandrosSfakianakis via Alexandros G.Sfakianakis on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2AfMfrX\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandros g.sfakianakis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lmse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:39.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "82dc78714484de0979a9582a9758e71f7877688b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKw_qIK9JZxadI4sXLPksKhoXB_zIBr_7nBUQ6jTh9Lqoc4_qwDILD5atEFPb5zc_Hgw_i.09fOM1kA6wSFyS5LuAjNjhyXdYzJfUVTn9XqwmFtTA9PNntKu", "site_full": "prostyporadnik.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://prostyporadnik.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Prosty Poradnik", "title": "Discount Coupon ($35.99) Xiaomi Sneakers No Chip Black", "title_full": "Discount Coupon ($35.99) Xiaomi Sneakers No Chip Black", "published": "2017-12-07T11:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "82dc78714484de0979a9582a9758e71f7877688b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKw_qIK9JZxadI4sXLPksKhoXB_zIBr_7nBUQ6jTh9Lqoc4_qwDILD5atEFPb5zc_Hgw_i.09fOM1kA6wSFyS5LuAjNjhyXdYzJfUVTn9XqwmFtTA9PNntKu", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "moot (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Discount Coupon ($35.99) Xiaomi Sneakers No Chip Black", "text": "Discount, Best Price, Active Coupon - Xiaomi Sneakers No Chip Black \nBrief description: Color: Black, with intelligent chip, Integral knitted upper, Shock-resistant EVA midsole, With TPU balance patch and reflective stripe at heel\nPrice: $35.99\nLink: Xiaomi Sneakers No Chip Black \nCoupon: GBXMSHOES3599 \n(apply it in your cart)\nMore on Facebook: facebook.com/ \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "xiaomi sneakers no chip black discount", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:39.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7f1195ce7f017849581a1ef501bb2596dc5c9031", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5NnFEMSt4Y6qBNR06ZHCs9oFX5u1gh.TUSx1mOaRadGAXH724ifPHPZZEzs90Adl_j3PiRH.Xvx5z3kxCvDY6zdoQkSOhAR9Bbs2Cv55LBtvwlbSEu7U4", "site_full": "www.thecourier.com.au", "site": "thecourier.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.thecourier.com.au/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Courier - The Border Mail Local News", "title": "Pedalling team pride in fight against cancer", "title_full": "Pedalling team pride in fight against cancer", "published": "2017-12-07T09:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/XBHRDThPr8rZ8LC4FzPP7b/9cc98f47-9e0e-47be-b81a-c7e4a46e86c8.jpg/r0_283_5568_3429_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7f1195ce7f017849581a1ef501bb2596dc5c9031", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5NnFEMSt4Y6qBNR06ZHCs9oFX5u1gh.TUSx1mOaRadGAXH724ifPHPZZEzs90Adl_j3PiRH.Xvx5z3kxCvDY6zdoQkSOhAR9Bbs2Cv55LBtvwlbSEu7U4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Melanie Whelan", "published": "2017-12-07T09:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "Pedalling team pride in fight against cancer", "text": "READY: TMB vice-captains Don Stewart, Dean Wells, Rick Calvert say a team challenge is health competition for a good cause.

They say their team name has origins in all the contemplation they do over coffee. \nCycling teams have the chance to order custom-made jerseys and the largest team entered on the day will win a $500 voucher for post-ride drinks. \nCorporate teams can also enter the challenge. \nThe annual Cycle Classic is the major fundraiser for the city\u2019s homegrown Fiona Elsey Cancer Research Institute, which is capturing international attention in helping to unlock the riddles of cancer. \nAlex McCallum was a keen cyclist who died in may. Insurance group Protect, of which he was chief executive officer, is sponsoring the new event in his honour. \nClassic road rides start and finish in a Lake Wendouree village precinct and take in the famous Mount Buninyong climb that features in the national championship course. Events include a 50-kilometre, 60km, 85km and 100km road ride and mountain bike challenges of 25km, 33km, 40km and 50km circuits. \nPeople can also get pedalling in a lakeside family ride, pet walk and run. \nThe Cycle Classic is on February 18.

The layout of the AUV fleet is defined by two nondimensional parameters. Firstly, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed on the fleets with different layout parameters and detailed information on the hydrodynamic forces and flow structures around the AUVs is obtained. Then, based on the CFD data, a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) method is used to describe the relationship between the layout parameters and the drag of the fleet. Finally, a genetic algorithm (GA) is chosen to obtain the optimal layout parameters which correspond to the minimum drag. The optimization results show that the total drag of the AUV fleet can be reduced by 12% when the follower AUV is located directly behind the leader AUV and the drag of the follower AUV can be reduced by 66% when it is by the side of the leader AUV.\n\nfrom #AlexandrosSfakianakis via Alexandros G.Sfakianakis on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2BbdiVF\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandros g.sfakianakis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "neural network method this", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:40.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4e49b2be3c68d9ef660dc94ba8e4cd9437991452", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKw_qIK9JZxadI4sXLPksKhoXB_zIBr_7nBUQ6jTh9Lqoc4_qwDILD5atEFPb5zc_HiIWCDy_4vo_hKURyQa8dYLsPdvDEEF4Z8oLZKeIz9wxw--", "site_full": "prostyporadnik.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://prostyporadnik.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Prosty Poradnik", "title": "Discount Coupon ($7.99) Zanflare F3 CW Flashlight", "title_full": "Discount Coupon ($7.99) Zanflare F3 CW Flashlight", "published": "2017-12-07T10:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4e49b2be3c68d9ef660dc94ba8e4cd9437991452", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKw_qIK9JZxadI4sXLPksKhoXB_zIBr_7nBUQ6jTh9Lqoc4_qwDILD5atEFPb5zc_HiIWCDy_4vo_hKURyQa8dYLsPdvDEEF4Z8oLZKeIz9wxw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "moot (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "Discount Coupon ($7.99) Zanflare F3 CW Flashlight", "text": "Discount, Best Price, Active Coupon - Zanflare F3 CW Flashlight \nBrief description: CREE XP-G2, High: 150LM, Medium: 35LM, Low: 3LM, 6000 - 6500K, Battery Type: AAA, Waterproof Standard: IPX8, Mode Memory: Yes\nPrice: $7.99\nLink: Zanflare F3 CW Flashlight \nCoupon: F3AAA \n(apply it in your cart)\nMore on Facebook: facebook.com/ \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "low", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "aaa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:40.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4acc1b94e3f00170d0c6466f3fc42bba221449c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSQVqV6X.kFq58YFKFXEB714uIvMTgeXikIy6_jIexLqfOq4x8oOG3Hc5Wo_2rmAQFi_FBAKyDMc5Zz9TI7TRBHLwpZuanc15zq_SS0YZmKQIci0ix0EJIDTqRZAm2Od09kVAHDyUgr72d4gT7_9zcH", "site_full": "www.channelnewsasia.com", "site": "channelnewsasia.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tech", "social"], "section_title": "", "title": "George Town Festival\u2019s secret to success?

Penang first, tourism second \nJoe Sidek, director of Penang\u2019s popular annual performing arts festival, talks about transforming spaces and making locals the VIP audience for arts and culture. George Town Festival has become one of the key cultural events in Malaysia. (Photo: George Town Festival Facebook Page) Share via E-Mail Bookmark \nSINGAPORE: In 2012, a then-unknown Lithuanian street artist by the name of Ernest Zacharevic was commissioned to create large-scale murals by a relatively new festival in Penang. \nToday, Zacharevic\u2019s murals have become one of the city\u2019s most iconic draws \u2013 and just one of the examples of how George Town Festival (GTF) has been instrumental in livening up the Malaysian UNESCO World Heritage Site. \n\u201cWe had to go through weeks of fighting council offices and now everyone\u2019s doing it all over the place,\u201d quipped Joe Sidek, the festival\u2019s director and founder. \nThe 58-year-old Malaysian was in town as one of the guest speakers at this year\u2019s Culture Academy Singapore conference, which was held on Thursday (Dec 7) at the National Museum of Singapore. One of Penang street artist Ernest Zacharevic's iconic murals, many of which were commissioned by the George Town Festival in 2012. (Photo: Ernest Zacharevic) \nAt the event, Sidek talked about his experiences running the festival, which began in 2010 on a shoestring budget of 400,000 ringgit. The financial constraints \u2013 not to mention the lack of suitable venues \u2013 led to a lot of out-of-the-box thinking. Advertisement Advertisement \nIt resulted in the festival exploring more unconventional venues and programmes that would not only tap into George Town\u2019s unused spaces but also different ways of bringing the arts directly to Penangites. \nAside from Zacharevic\u2019s street murals, the festival has held through the years events in places that weren\u2019t normally associated with performances, such as the famous Blue Mansion, Fort Cornwallis and Armenian Park, which has since become a popular place for buskers. \nOne such event, which Sidek considers his \u201cpride and joy\u201d was a performance at Macallum Street two years ago. \nIt was a low-cost housing estate where around 8,000 people lived and the festival transformed a small plot of land in the area into a paddy field on which artists performed. George Town Festival director Joe Sidek (right) with Macallum Apartment residents. (Photo: George Town Festival Facebook Page) \n\u201cI thought, this is our VIP audience. I wanted them to have a taste of art or culture or performance that they (normally) would have never been able to see,\u201d he said. \nWhile the festival has been reshaping the entire George Town as one huge arts and culture venue that has been attracting international attention \u2013 not to mention 200,000 people attending annually \u2013 Sidek reckons the real success has been in how it has connected with locals. \n\u201cI always feel that arts and the festival should be for my people first, tourism second,\u201d he said, adding that one of the ways they\u2019ve made sure that locals are invested in the event is by making sure that 80 per cent of the programme is free to the public. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s very important for people to have access. If you have children, how many shows can you see a month? Culture has become very, very expensive all over the world,\u201d he told Channel NewsAsia. Penang's George Town Festival. (Photo: George Town Festival) \nThe way locals have been buying into the festival has ranged from people offering their houses as venues to small, thankful gestures. \nSidek recalled how during last year\u2019s Butterworth Fringe Festival \u2013 a spin-off street fest thanks to GTF\u2019s popularity \u2013 a family approached him asking if they could take a photograph with him. \n\u201cI felt like a rockstar,\u201d quipped Sidek, who now also runs the new Rainforest Fringe Festival in Kuching. \n\u201cThey had stumbled upon the event the previous year and decided to come and bring the whole family. It\u2019s a nice feeling when you know you\u2019ve made somebody\u2019s life meaningful.\u201d \nWhile GTF has undoubtedly played a huge role in putting the spotlight on Penang, Sidek, whose contract to run the festival ends next year, said: \u201cIt\u2019s just a piece of jigsaw to help paint the full picture. You\u2019ve also got the UNESCO listing, the people, the spaces themselves.\u201d \nAll these, he said, have made Penang attractive not just for tourists and locals \u2013 but artists, too. Penang's George Town Festival brings arts and culture out to the streets. (Photo: George Town Festival Facebook Page, Pek Min Han) \n\u201cYou\u2019ve got young artists from all over the world choosing to live in Penang because it\u2019s still an affordable place to live. And I think it\u2019s a good sign for creative cities when young artists come and brave it and spend two, three years here, exchanging ideas with other local artists. It\u2019s a good start for creativity.\u201d \nWhen asked if Singapore can learn anything from GTF, Sidek said: \u201cI think we have a lot to learn from Singapore instead of the other way around. A lot of Singaporeans complain but you have places like this (National Museum of Singapore), and archiving and resource centres for artists to work on. Ten years from now, it will be reaping the rewards of what it has invested (in the arts).\u201d \nHe added: \u201cThe only thing I can think of is look into the people who can\u2019t afford the arts, never been to the arts, don\u2019t understand it \u2013 and make them feel comfortable.\u201d Source: CNA/mm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "penang", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "zacharevic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pek min han", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe sidek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ernest zacharevic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george town", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "unesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sidek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unesco world heritage site", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national museum of singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "channel newsasia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "blue mansion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penangites", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macallum street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fort cornwallis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george town", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuching", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:40.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cbdeba6ca86dae7e1058dcbc54fbe4436a7460c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2Vi5PD8lronCZocdAt.2y8-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cbdeba6ca86dae7e1058dcbc54fbe4436a7460c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2Vi5PD8lronCZocdAt.2y8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "static void __near r_tau0_channel0_interrupt(void)\r\n{\r\n    /* Start user code.

We all know Killbeatz is the sole producer of Fuse ODG\u2026 Fuse used to struggle and was introduced to Killbeatz to help him. Killbeatz was not even giving him that much attention when he [Fuse] came to Ghana. It was a couple of friends around who spoke to Killbeatz before he accepted because Killbeatz was really busy with R2bees at that time. After agreeing to work with him, if this is how it\u2019s going to end, then I think it\u2019s very bad,\u201d Jeffery said. \nReacting to his submission, music producer, Wei Ye Oteng expressed disappointment in the management member. \n\u201cHe should not try to justify this on any radio again because he has goofed. Not everyone is a good communicator. He said so many things that if I am Fuse, I will be so pissed. First of all, he said he [Fuse] can\u2019t sack him [Killbeatz]. If I am Fuse, and I own my house, then I decide what happens. \n\u201cThis guy goofed so much by even saying people had to beg for Killbeatz to work with Fuse. When greatness is achieved, all these things are nothing to write home about. Some things should remain between you people\u2026 If you don\u2019t know how to talk, don\u2019t talk\u2026 He is rather creating a huge enmity between Killbeatz and Fuse\u201d Oteng noted. \nFuse ODG hanging out with his colleagues at the mansion two years ago \nWilli Roi, another renowned record producer also appeared to have been shocked to the bone by the utterances of Jeffery as he stated that, \u201cFor the manager to have said that the guy can\u2019t sack Killbeatz, he doesn\u2019t understand management. He is a \u2018damagement\u2019. What he has done is infuriating Fuse. Killbeatz has been so lucky that most of the people he makes beat for, get somewhere therefore raise his brand. And for goodness sake, I don\u2019t know anybody who could have taken Killbeatz that farther than what Fuse did for him. He should revise his notes and know how to present it.\u201d \nMeanwhile, Jeffery has said the blood in question was that of a ram which had been killed for a barbecue as Killbeatz was celebrating his birthday. \n\u201cA Muslim friend was invited over to do the slaughtering of the ram. And you know Muslims, before you slaughter an animal, you have to dig a hole to pour the blood in. It was just a normal slaughtering of a ram for a barbecue. It\u2019s not like anybody brought a juju man to the house. We are confused as to how this issue is going. If Fuse is claiming that he is taking Africa to the world, then he should learn our culture,\u201d he told host, Sammy Flex. \nHe alleged that \u201cSomebody in the house took a picture and sent to him [Fuse ODG] trying to frame up a story that we are doing rituals in the house.

There was no news to catalyse the move higher, although excitement and debate over the upcoming launch of Bitcoin futures on 10 December continues. One Bitcoin-related story did peak our interest, however. \nIt might be a sign that Bitcoin is becoming mainstream when blackmailers are prepared to accept the cryptocurrency as payment. \nGerman tabloid, Bild, is reporting that this has befallen logistics company, Deutsche Post DHL. However, the recipients of two deliveries containing explosive devices had a lucky escape, as Bloomberg explains. \nA criminal blackmailing Deutsche Post\u2019s DHL parcel service demands EU10m in the digital currency Bitcoin, German newspaper Bild reports, not saying where it got the information. Blackmailer placed two bombs in parcels delivered by DHL; bombs didn\u2019t detonate because of technical problems \nParcels included QR codes with links to extortion letter to DHL \nThreatened to send further bombs \nGerman Parcel Bomb Is Part of Extortion Plan Against DHL: Police \nHandelsblatt provided more details of one of the bombs found in the eastern German city of Potsdam. \nAuthorities confirmed Sunday the apparent bomb found near the Potsdam Christmas market on Friday was unrelated to terrorism but an attempt to blackmail delivery company DHL. The package resulted in a large-scale evacuation of the market in Potsdam, near Berlin. \n\u201cThe good news is that we can say, with all likelihood, the package was not aimed at the Christmas market,\u201d Karl-Heinz Schr\u00f6ter, Brandenburg\u2019s state interior minister, told reporters. \u201cThe bad news is that it was a blackmail attempt targeting DHL.\u201d \nThe Potsdam package, containing nails, an unidentified powder substance and a metal cylinder, was sent to a nearby pharmacy as a special delivery. The store\u2019s owner informed authorities after noticing unusual wires and hearing a hissing noise while opening the package. Police initially believed the package to be a fake bomb but, after forensic teams examined it, determined it was \u201ccapable of activation.\u201d \nThe other bomb was found in a similar package in another eastern city, Frankfurt/Oder,last month. German officials warned that the blackmailers would \u201clikely\u201d send more explosive devices in the run-up to Christmas. \nOf course, Bitcoin naysayers are likely to pounce on stories like this to dismiss Bitcoin as merely a mechanism for facilitating criminal activity .

Mediumship as a practice is said to involve mediating the communication between spirits of living humans and those who are already dead. There are a number of categories of mediumship including spirit channeling. Nevertheless, there are high cases of fraud pertaining to the practice making it lose credibility. This has resulted in the use of scientific researches to validate the practice of mediumship. Nonetheless, mediums Dallas tx still remains a common practice.\n\nThe main purpose of a medium is to be the connecting link between the dead and the living. They allow their bodies to be taken over by spirits and this enables them to listen to the spirits and communicate to the living by use of writings and drawings. They are grouped into either mental mediums or physical mediums whose only difference is the means by which they connect to the spirits and relay their messages to the clients.\n\nIn as much as mediumship gained popularity in the nineteenth century, it dates back to early human history. This went on regardless of fraud cases that came with the practice. There are certain aspects of the practice that vary in how the practice is carried out. Mental mediumship is where the medium communicates with the spirits through telepathy. The medium hears, feels and sees messages from spirits.\n\nPhysical mediumship, on the other hand, is characterized by the manifestations through noises and objects. There is also the channeling method that entails psychics speaking to the spirits and communicating messages received. Under spiritualism, psychic senses used by mental mediums is differently categorized from the other paranormal classes. The medium possesses psychic powers although not every psychic operates as a medium.\n\nAs mentioned before, mediumship attracted a lot of trickery and fraud. According to researchers, this was mostly because of darkness during the performance. During the recent years, there has been more research carried out to clarify whether what happens to an individual after death is enough to enable communication with the spirit world.\n\nThere are certain explanations that have been made to clarify on whether mediums really do what they claim to do. In paranormal beliefs, spiritualists believe that mediums manifest their abilities by use of external spiritual agencies. According to psychic researchers like Thomson Jay, all various types of mediumship can be explained by understanding suggestion and telepathy from the medium but not the spirit hypothesis.\n\nOn contrary, scientists specializing in anomalistic psychology hold that mediumship results from psychological factors and fraud. This implies that the evidence of fraud is lacking, hence spiritualism is understood through getting insights into magical thinking, hypnotism, and suggestion. In the instances of a trance, mediumship is said to be discarnate spirits that speak but may also be explained through Dissociative identity disorder.\n\nFinally, it is important to be keen when seeking the assistance of a medium. This is because these practices tend to affect an individual mental wellbeing. For instance, one may be blackmailed whereby information is withheld for more money.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are looking for information about mediums Dallas TX residents can come to our web pages online today.

She has used the same visa a few times to visit me while we were not married yet. We got married finally while I was still on my greencard, two years shy of applying for naturalization. She came with me back to the states to help me settle and was definitely planning coming back to our country because she was in her 3rd year of med school. At this time the F2A category became current,we applied for I-130, approved, and bulletin retrogressed. She also applied for B2 visa extension which was also approved. At a later point, circumstances changed, and it became difficult for us, especially for me that we separate so with uncertainty, we decided that she overstays. Now we are anticipating our AOS interview and we are getting ready to be questioned fully on her preconceived intent of overstaying when she back with me after our wedding. What will be the possible hurdles/questions/ that we should get ready for in this case? Is there anything we could do to improve the outcome? I ask that please don't pass any judgment on the decisions that we have made. We all come from different circumstances and I just want a rational and open minded input. Thank you in advance!\nMay i asked the reason given to get the b2 extension approval?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:43.080+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70225b06d28a719ae85650d8b538e24b4a5ab2ad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8vUdzJk69cXLbt6Og5ndAlgtfCJTNxg62rYaDUD89A9b0MkFR8J2RIjDg1d5p6HW0-", "site_full": "www.akfiles.com", "site": "akfiles.com", "site_section": "http://www.akfiles.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=5", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Marketplace -

However, that being said, there are sometimes when being frugal is not the answer - there are some things that it pays to invest in. The fact is that saving money in business is key, especially as the majority of all businesses that fail (50 percent within the first five years), do so because of a lack of funds. However, do not let that statistic drive you to cut corners where you shouldn\u2019t do, because, in the end, it is only yourself and your business that you will be hurting. \n\nOf course, there are some corners that it is perfectly fine to cut, it\u2019s just a case of determining what costs it is a good idea to cut and which ones it is better to ensure that you pay. As a business owner, naturally you want to give your business the best chance of success , which is why taking the time to determine which corners you should cut and which you shouldn\u2019t, is important. \nBearing all of that in mind, the question is: when is corner cutting bad and why? Read on for everything that you need to know about why corner cutting in business is not the answer to saving money, as well as the serious impact these steps can sometimes have. \nNot investing in adequate insurance \nOne of the most common mistakes that many business owners make when it comes to attempting to cut costs and save money is failing to invest in adequate insurance . The problem with not having insurance in place is that should something go wrong for your business, such as there being a problem with the premises or an employee gets hurt while at work, you may struggle to cover the costs that come with this. That is why taking out adequate business insurance, including cover for your employees, is so important. After all, the last thing that you want is to be taken to court because an employee injures themselves at work, and not be able to afford to pay the compensation because you don\u2019t have insurance cover in place. \nFailing to take training seriously \nFar too many business owners think that one of the answers to cutting costs in the workplace is cutting employee training . However, the fact is that employee training is vital for ensuring that your team are kept safe while at work, and understand how to effectively stay safe while using equipment and machinery. By not taking training seriously and failing to make it a priority, you will be putting your team members at risk, which is why training is not a corner you want to cut. The good news is that employee training does not have to be expensive, it can easily be done in-house and kept affordable, it\u2019s just a case of finding the right training option for your business and budget. \nNot making health and safety a priority \nWhen it comes to health and safety, it\u2019s important to ensure that you make health and safety a priority, and that you know how to keep your team members safe while they are at work. Because if you don\u2019t take health and safety seriously and ensure that your team members have what they need to stay safe, it can have a huge impact on your business. Particularly as there is more awareness now of health and safety in the workplace than ever before, which means that if an employee sees a health and safety breach, they can report it to a specialist health and safety company like Meissner Associates , and start proceedings against you and your business. That is why, when it comes to how you deal with health and safety at your business premises, it\u2019s so important to ensure that you deal with it in the right way. \nSkipping maintenance \nMaintenance costs might be extra things to pay, but the fact is they are crucial. When it comes to taking care of the machinery and equipment that you have at your business premises, it is vital that you don\u2019t skip maintenance costs. Because, the fact is, that skipping important maintenance tasks can not only make it more likely that your machinery will break down, but also that accidents will occur while the machinery is being used. That\u2019s why maintenance is so important, as are repairs. The fact is that many business owners who are trying to keep costs low, also choose to fail to schedule repairs as and when they are needed, to cut costs. However, this can have serious repercussions, particularly if broken equipment or machinery is being used. \nBuying cut-price equipment \nAnother faux pas that you do not want to make the mistake of making as a business owner is investing in cut-price equipment. The fact is that reduced price equipment might come cheaper than equipment that is full price, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it will work as well or will be as safe. It is important to understand that when it comes to buying equipment for your business, it\u2019s better to spend a little extra and get equipment that is safe to use, rather than spending less and getting second-rate equipment. If you are going to buy second hand equipment, make sure to ask to see the manufacturer's guidance on how to use it and how to maintain it. Want to check the quality of a piece of machinery? Contact the manufacturer and ask them any questions that you may have - you can also Google them and see what the internet says about them and their products. \nAs a business owner , you will often be under pressure to cut costs and keep things affordable, and while it is important to ensure that your spending stays on track, what you don\u2019t want to do is cut costs where you shouldn\u2019t do. The fact is cutting costs where you shouldn\u2019t can be detrimental to you and your business, and can have a huge impact on your success as a business owner. So it is important to ensure that you are wise about what you do and don\u2019t spend money on, and always put your employees and their health and safety before anything else, as that is what matters most.
