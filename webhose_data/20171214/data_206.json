Zaid also noted that the  gathering  was planned to demand action against him, in reaction to his tweeted remarks on Selangor ruler Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah\u2019s rebuke of former premier Dr Mahathir Mohamad. \u201cI would like to explain to Umno, the meaning of my tweet, the concept of constitutional monarchy means that a sultan cannot be partisan in matters of politics or administration, with any parties or individuals, what more in an election year,\u201d said Zaid in his police report sighted by  Malaysiakini . Yesterday Noh ( photo ) urged the people of Selangor to attend the gathering and express support for their ruler. \n\nSultan Sharafuddin, in an interview with  The Star  on Tuesday, said that Mahathir has not apologised for his \"Bugis pirate\" remark. The ruler also pointed out that Mahathir \"never apologises,\" and described the nonagenarian as someone with an inferiority complex who would not permit others to do better than him. \u201cHe (Mahathir) is an angry man and will burn the whole country with his anger,\u201d the sultan warned, adding that he does not wish to see politicians exploiting race and religious issues that could be detrimental to the nation. In an interview with  Utusan Malaysia  yesterday, the sultan also said Zaid should  go back  to Kelantan if he disagreed with his remarks. After tweeting a  Malaysiakini  report on the sultan's remarks, Zaid said: \"Selangor sultan should be careful with his words.

To be honest, I still can\u2019t say that I\u2019m fully adapted with the culture here now but, Alhamdulillah, I still can say \u201cso far, so good.\u201d\nMy life here in KSA is TOTALLY different from the environment I am accustomed to. The people I deal and work with, the culture, the weather, the language. I mean, of course, I knew it would be different but you know\u2026 not to this extent. Haha\nI\u2019m not very good in decision-making but I am pretty sure that coming here to work is one of the best ones I\u2019ve made so far. (I\u2019m so proud of myself. Lol.) However, The transition to this life might have been easier if I knew these things before coming here:\n1. How bad 49C weather is. \nBack home, I remember getting really irritated when it\u2019s hot outside (probably when it\u2019s around 35C) yep, I would even post a rant status on Facebook. \nWhen I experienced this 49C, my energy drains thrice as usual, I can\u2019t even bring myself to complain! It\u2019s too hot that I\u2019m already sweating just by walking out of our flat. Also, taking a bath is not always an option because the water is hot too. I usually leave a pail of water overnight so that I\u2019ll have cold water to use in the morning. Really, I couldn\u2019t be more thankful to whoever invented aircon. \n2. Getting drowned in paperworks. \nIt\u2019s one of the most unexpected things I encountered here. After completing all my requirements before leaving the country, I thought to myself, \u201cand yes, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m off to a new life.\u201d\nLittle did I know, all the hassles of applying to the job, completing requirements, securing visa, and obtaining clearance from POEA is nothing compared to what I\u2019d face when I land here. \nTo make it short, I HAD TO REDO EVERYTHING HERE while having  duty at work, dealing with people who can\u2019t speak english, and worst, receiving and signing papers I can\u2019t even understand. \n3. How important my Philippine roaming number is. \nI am pretty sure I activated my roaming services before I left. However for some unknowable reason, It didn\u2019t work here in KSA. I tried contacting globe but to my dismay, nothing worked from all the solutions they were telling me to do. \nI didn\u2019t feel the impact of losing my globe number so much as I am able to contact my family through facebook. It was not until my second month here that I went like \n\u201cWTH GLOBE !\u201d\nOkay. So apparently, most of my online accounts are registered with my mobile number. \nSounds so simple right?\nBut NO.\nNo. No. No.\nI can\u2019t open my email in other device, I can\u2019t use my credit cards and I can\u2019t open my online bank!!! \nTrying to retrieve my accounts had given me a year long of stress and headache.\nFyi, I gave up trying to access my online bank and had my mom open a new account. (Labyu, mom)\n4. Arabs spell words exactly how it is pronounced.  \nOkay. If I had only known this earlier, I should have just told everyone here that my name is \u201cKAZARMAYN.\u201d And they could call me \u201cKAZ\u201d for short. Lol\nI have never been this frustrated about my name. Here in KSA, my resident ID had to be changed because it was initially spelled as \u201cZARINI\u201d which prompt another problem: I can\u2019t open a bank account because the name in my visa is spelled as \u201cKAZARMAYN\u201d. My medical record in the hospital where i\u2019m working was also delayed because my blood sample is labeled with \u201cSHARMEN\u201d and the med technologist didn\u2019t process it because he told me how can \u201cSHARMEN\u201d be a \u201cKAZARMAYN?\u201d\nESH HADA.\nPs. Arabic letters don\u2019t have a \u201cC\u201dand a \u201cP.\u201d so a \u201cC\u201d will automatically be spelled as a \u201cK\u201d and  \u201cP\u201d as \u201cB\u201d. \nNow, I want an ice cold bebsi. \n5. \u201cFree Food, Free Lodging\u201d is not exactly free. \nWho am I to complain when my employer is generous enough to include to my contract free food and lodging?\nHowever, it\u2019s only now that I realize that \u201cfree\u201d things aren\u2019t exactly free.\nYou have to pay a nonmonetary fee: Your right to choose.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I am still thankful for this set-up. I mean, aside from my internet and other grocery items, I don\u2019t have any overhead expenses. They are also giving us free car service to send us to work. \nHowever, I live in the third floor of a building with no elevator, additionally, this building is the farthest one from the gate of our residential complex. \nMoreover, the free food they\u2019re giving can only be claimed at specific times and you have to get it from the canteen which is again very far from our flat. \n6. The schedule of malls and supermarket. \nIn Islam, it is our obligation to Allah to pray 5x a day. Here in KSA, all the shops close when it\u2019s prayer time. Grocery, fast food, boutique, literally all the establishments. And yes, you don\u2019t actually need to find a prayer room, one prayer mat and you\u2019re good to go. \nAlso, most shops are closed in the morning. Especially if it\u2019s Friday. Friday is like the Sunday here. \n7. Believing the stereotype against the Arabs is a No-no.  \nI hate to admit it, but I am guilty of having prejudice towards Arab People. I used to think that they are rude, arrogant, and lazy people. But who can blame me when it\u2019s what the media is showing?\nHowever, coming here, meeting, and befriending arabs made me realize that WE are all the same \u2014 inside. \nWe are all vulnerable creatures molded by the society, beliefs, and different circumstances. \nI am beyond amazed by how I can sometimes understand people here without even knowing the language they speak. \nAs what my friend (Hi Tina!) always says to me,\n\u201cBuild a bridge, not a wall.\u201d\nRight now, I am meeting good people, bad people, but hey isn\u2019t that the same everywhere?\nI know I still have a long long way to go to finally adjust here. But I am really thankful for all the things that are happening to my life right now. Alhamdulillah. Allahu Akbar.

Joan and I had the roof de-mossed today. It is actually a thing here. The roofs get the green stuff growing on it, and you have to take care of it eventually. So we did it today. Next Spring we paint the house. \nNot much news otherwise. Izzy's get downright lovable these days. When we got her she was afraid of us. No more. And she just loves to run. We went to the dog park yesterday, and the day before, and she got her yayas out today sprinting and wrestling with her friend Mickey. She always lets me know when she needs to go, so we've had no more accidents. And she loves me. \nBy the way, that's not a duck up there in the picture. It's a Halszkaraptor escuilliei which is a dinosaur. Inside its beak are lots of teeth, and the hooks on their feet were deadly. They mostly did their hunting in water, sort of like seagulls today. But they weren't that much bigger than a duck.

She wholly believes in Keeping Portland Weird, but wishes she didn\u2019t have to make the yearly pilgrimage up to Seattle to watch her Boston Red Sox play baseball. She\u2019s a fan of fandoms, and spends too much of her free time on tumblr. \nBeth has been writing practically since she learned the alphabet. Unfortunately, her first foray into novel writing, titled Big Bear with Sparkly Earrings , wasn\u2019t a bestseller, but hope springs eternal. She\u2019s published seven novels and two novellas, with her next novel, a m/m chef romance set in the Napa Valley, publishing in early 2018. \nWrapped With Love \nNFL player Jordan Christensen walks into Reed Ryan\u2019s restaurant without a reservation. It isn\u2019t the most serendipitous of meet-cute\u2019s and they certainly aren\u2019t the likeliest of romances, but over venison steaks and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, they fall in love anyway. \nFlash forward two years . . . \nJordan isn\u2019t a football player anymore. \nReed sold his restaurant. \nBut even more drastically, they\u2019ve lost each other. \nWhen Reed moves to Los Angeles take a new job, he doesn\u2019t realize Jordan now works at the same company. But Jordan definitely realizes how precious the second chance fate has bestowed on them is. He\u2019s determined to make up for everything that fell apart the first time around, and it turns out he\u2019s not the only one scheming to right old wrongs. \nStarting a new career is always difficult but sharing office space\u2014and big projects\u2014with an old lover is particularly rough. Between impromptu Secret Santa exchanges, Christmas light viewings, and more tacos than even Reed can eat, the two former lovers have an eventful holiday season to navigate. \nBuy Link \u2013 https://www.amazon.com/Wrapped-Love-Beth-Bolden-ebook/dp/B076YMPPYC/ \nS.L. (Stephanie) Danielson began writing at the tender age of five. She knew it was her calling from the moment she put pen to paper. In her teens she began writing alternative works and the genre stuck. She created ever more elaborate tales and finally in her early 20\u2019s years began to create works with her new love; male/male romance. She has since written more than 30 works (both solo and collaborations). \nStephanie is classically trained in business, accounting, and HR/training, possessing both an undergrad and graduate degree. She also owned and operated Romance First Publishing where the ultimate goal was to help other unknown, as well as known authors get their start in the publishing world. \nBeyond writing, her other hobbies include: painting, gaming, and spending time with her husband and two cherished cats. \nHer blog is www.ladyauthorsld.blogspot.com and email is \nIce Fairy \nSamuru (Sam) Ogawa is on track to be in his life\u2019s dream\u2026the Olympics as a figure-skater. All is gliding along smoothly until he literally bumps into one of the biggest bullies he\u2019s ever met; a hockey player named Brett Zephyr. He\u2019s well known for being a brash, hot-headed, caveman who thinks about nothing but hockey and his bimbo girlfriend. Things are tense and the walls between them build until unforeseen events begin to break the ice between them. But as the coolness melts away; other players come in to build them back as quickly as they fell. Family forces, friends, and secrets threaten to destroy all they\u2019ve created. Can Sam and Brett make things work or are they just too opposite?

https://youtu.be/g1rsomMFlgc The Ultimate Guide to Seeing the Northern Lights in Yellowknife, Canada written by Kat March 24, 2017 Interested in seeing the Northern Lights? I highly recommend going to Yellowknife! Why Choose Yellowknife? When people think of places where they can see the Northern Lights, they usually think of Norway , Sweden , Finland or Iceland . Not as many people think of going to Canada to see the Northern Lights! However, Yellowknife is one of the best places in the world to see the Northern Lights due to its northern latitude and high amount of clear dark nights! According to the Aurora Village website, the Northern Lights are visible around 240 nights per year. Yellowknife has been a very popular aurora hunting destination among Japanese tourists for many years and is now beginning to see an increase of tourists from other countries. I had never thought of Yellowknife as a tourist destination until one day when I was scrolling through my Facebook feed and saw a classmate\u2019s photos of the Northern Lights in Yellowknife. I was immediately intrigued and started researching the destination. A few days later, I booked a four night trip there for the end of January/early February. ...\" https:/\u2026 Fun Winter Activities in Yellowknife written by Kat October 7, 2017 https:/\u2026 Borealis Bike Tours Unlimited (BBTU), provides custom fat bike tours throughout all four seasons of the year, ranging from casual cyclist to the experienced.

We are. As nights grow longer, the green, red and mauve lights of aurora borealis, or northern lights, are absolutely brilliant as they dance across the sky. The aurora results from forms of electromagnetic energy which are drawn to the earth\u2019s poles, literally charging the atmosphere and causing it to glow. Why do you care? Because that charge and glow make a simply spectacular lights show right above your head. Despite the crisp -40, (at that temperature Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales are the same) which is not uncommon in the heart of a Yellowknife winter, we have thousands of visitors who come to be awe-inspired. Tours to view the aurora from outside the city limits are available starting in August and continue throughout the winter months until the end of March. https:/\u2026 \"...

And winter in the north is one of the best places to get a fantastic look at this awe-inspiring light show. But there\u2019s more to the northern lights than meets the eye.

Photo: Bloomberg Ko Tin-yau - Dec 7, 2017 4:35pm Why US tax reform could hurt tech stocks \nInternet stocks listed in Hong Kong and the US have suffered a heavy sell-off recently. Some analysts attributed the decline to US tax reform. Although the reform itself is actually good for tech firms, other sectors are expected to benefit more, thus the flow of funds from tech plays into other counters, such as old economy stocks. \nThe US Senate passed a bill to reduce the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from current 35 percent. And American corporates are allowed to bring home foreign profits at a 10 percent preferential tax rate. \nTech giants Apple and Amazon reported their effective tax rate at 24.6 percent and 36.6 percent, respectively, last year, for instance, so the new tax rate of 20 percent will be more favorable. \nMeanwhile, Moody\u2019s estimated that the amount of overseas cash held by US companies reached US$1.3 trillion, representing 70 percent of their cash pile. Most of the foreign profits come from US tech titans. Apple holds US$230 billion in profits offshore, Microsoft has US$113 billion, CISCO holds US$62 billion and Google has US$49 billion cash overseas. \nThese US tech giants have opted to leave their foreign profits offshore due to the hefty tax rate at home. However, the new tax reform will allow them to bring foreign profits home at a one-time tax rate of 10 percent. Tech giants will be the biggest winners as they can more flexibly deploy their funds or increase dividends. \nAlso, the tax reform may further stimulate US economic growth and boost consumption, which will also benefit US tech firms. \nAlthough tech firms stand to gain from the tax reform, traditional sectors like industrials, consumer goods and financials are expected to see a bigger boost from the tax bill. As investors flock to these counters, less capital would be chasing tech companies, and some investors might even dump tech stocks and switch to traditional sectors. \nEmerging markets may suffer. Generally speaking, the tax overhaul may benefit the US economy and subsequently emerging markets which have strong trade links with the US. \nHowever, if more smart money moves to the US market and US tech giants bring their foreign profits home, emerging markets might witness capital outflow, particularly if the Fed accelerates monetary normalization and the pace of rate hikes. \nThis article appeared in the Hong Kong Economic Journal on Dec. 7 \nTranslation by Julie Zhu \n\u2013   \nRT/RA", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "julie zhu     rt/ra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moody", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong economic journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us senate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:23.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df9824fc54e61e7b63b52b587c2b1f35aa38e08e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpS9tebi29siBkS87ACqutL3LMBFk5U9JIeB1H1xy63ZDhfplRG9HI3C9opFVRbF11TNyEJqbvXPMt5y.KQ3bMPb.LeR5lSTd2ITJbyz7sKGHu773uwoBkokJFqsfn9ebsUlw7FwL9TTATzFnu_7iOVYPonuvwOowOeZMgF4.2Rz5RBXRZ.zKG.3esspBfiso1U-", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "http://www.hotukdeals.com/rss/hot", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "HotUKDeals", "title": "144\u00b0 - Dell XPS 13 With 13.3 Inch Full HD InfinityEdge Display, Intel\u00ae Core \u2122 I5-8250U Quad-Core Processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD @ Very on BNPL", "title_full": "144\u00b0 - Dell XPS 13 With 13.3 Inch Full HD InfinityEdge Display, Intel\u00ae Core \u2122 I5-8250U Quad-Core Processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD @ Very on BNPL", "published": "2017-12-07T10:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2849363_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "df9824fc54e61e7b63b52b587c2b1f35aa38e08e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpS9tebi29siBkS87ACqutL3LMBFk5U9JIeB1H1xy63ZDhfplRG9HI3C9opFVRbF11TNyEJqbvXPMt5y.KQ3bMPb.LeR5lSTd2ITJbyz7sKGHu773uwoBkokJFqsfn9ebsUlw7FwL9TTATzFnu_7iOVYPonuvwOowOeZMgF4.2Rz5RBXRZ.zKG.3esspBfiso1U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "144\u00b0 - Dell XPS 13 With 13.3 Inch Full HD InfinityEdge Display, Intel\u00ae Core \u2122 I5-8250U Quad-Core Processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD @ Very on BNPL", "text": "6 Get deal Get deal Expires on 14/12/2017 Found 7 h, 19 m ago This won\u2019t be a deal for everyone but I\u2019ve been after a decent price for the XPS 13 base model with the matte screen.

Several NGOs and civil society groups, including the Anatolian Youth Association (AGD) and Turkish Youth Foundation (TUGVA), gathered city centers in every corner of the country to protest the move. Many NGOs led by the AGD Istanbul branch staged a demonstration at the U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul and chanted slogans against President Donald Trump and the U.S. and carried posters and banners supporting the Palestinians. The TUGVA also organized another protest at Fatih Mosque in Istanbul as they called on Muslims to unite against the decision. Another protest was held in Ankara in front of the U.S. Embassy building, where a statement was read stating the Palestinian crisis was a basic issue of all Muslims. Similar protests were also held in almost every Turkish province, including Konya, Bursa, Antalya, Mugla, Manisa, Adana, Bartin, Karabuk, Samsun, Yozgat, Malatya, Gaziantep, Kahramanmaras, Sanliurfa, Sirnak and Diyarbakir. On Wednesday, the U.S. president announced his decision -- despite widespread opposition across the Middle East -- to formally recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. The announcement sparked strong condemnation from around the world, including Turkey, the EU and the UN. Jerusalem remains at the core of the Israel-Palestine conflict, with Palestinians hoping that East Jerusalem -- now occupied by Israel -- might eventually serve as the capital of a future Palestinian state.

Add to wishlist, play later.\nI mean, this seems overly optimistic about my financial situation and ability to upgrade my PC.\nNot overly. I mean, how long do computers usually last you? Because I think 6 years has been the longest a computer has lasted me. And then you kinda gotta scrounge or knock over a convenience store or rob a bank or something to get a new one.\nAnd at that point, the game's what, 20 bucks? I mean, unless it's Activision, then it's what, 50 bucks?\nIf you two want to post some specs in the PC Build Thread, we can give you some ideas. While technology marches ever forward, relatively recent components have aged quite well. For example, the i7 2600 from 2011 is only just now bottlenecking recent games. The GPUs are doing *that much* of the heavy lifting. And in regards to GPUs, you can get a GTX 1050 for right around $100 US (or less, if you hunt for sales) that will run most games on moderate settings.\nAlso, despite the fact many people approach their PCs like a console (i.e. replace it whole cloth), certain components age quite well. For example, the PSU I bought for my first major build in 2007 is powering my current rig (i5 4th gen; GTX 1080 that I bought after saving up birthday and Christmas gift cards) without a hiccup.\nCaveat: prices are shitty right now because RAM is currently a significant portion of a build budget (but this is expected to fix itself within the next year), and there are new gens of both Intel and AMD CPUs with high demand.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://alabasterslim.com/76561197996867274/steam_sig.png", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/888/nPLJAVPO1655M.png", "http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197996867274", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/342/nBJLWH0IHC27F.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:24.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "48bcb322d9a7cc8dccc72197ae71d85342bddc54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl84_CVYRfttwAZIZZmM.cRBLhzaylCNGhe4GQj2GnLjCDT97g12Sx6IUqJl24zDeNaHQTRVcSo_Y", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "Put your fate in the hands of [Steam]! 19", "title_full": "Put your fate in the hands of [Steam]! - Page 19 \u2014 Penny Arcade", "published": "2017-12-06T13:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 24, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/8DDBNVR065TV.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8253, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "96f9cc5f59b53a8e5367e21670b67bde3778fe84", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl84_CVYRfttwAZIZZmM.cRBLhzaylCNGhe4GQj2GnLjCDT97g12Sx6IUqJl24zDeNY21kwpy2iSkFuqBOQpKwfU-", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "KoopahTroopah", "published": "2017-12-07T03:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "HiT Quote: : \u00bb\nSo, apparently this is the closest thing we are getting to a new Valve game.\nValve, fuck.

I'm a berzerking, flail-weilding clergy man. Each time I resist damage (with my holy pecs, looking at the card art), my next attack gets +2 damage, which can be stacked 3 times per round for a total of +6. If I chance upon the \"Inner Rage\" card that's another +2 damage and puts me into berzerker mode where all my attacks do +2.\nStacking all this together onto the only card I have in my deck that attacks all enemies very weakly now suddenly does an absolutely humongous 12 damage to everyone just ANNIHILATES the AI. It's uncommon to have more than two enemies out of a possible eight having more than 12 health so it's an absolute monster of a combo.\nFucking top game. Really snuck under the radar there with it's completely low-rent graphical aesthetic, but damn if the gameplay loop isn't completely on point\nJust poking through its Steam page, this game seems like Risk of Rain and Card Hunter had a baby. Is it single character or party combat?\n@mugsley ahh I'm not too sure where the Risk of Rain comparison is coming from, it's a bit more like this -\nYou have a choice of 4 different kinds of characters, each with their unique equipment. Equipment and items are unlocked permanently once you've gotten one in a run so you've got plenty to mix and match with.\nThere are three campaigns but I've only played one so far so I can't speak for the others. You play an introductory mission and after that it branches off to two and eventually a mix between two and three mission choices as you progress to the end of a 7-misson long campaign. So of the 7 you play, there are something like 8 or 9 missons that you didn't. Each mission completion has a unique unlock per character so the focus squarely on replay value. Once you've finished all three 3rd mission options you can start the campaign from there too to avoid the easy bits.\nThe game also provides you a small preview of the kind of unique monsters found in a given mission (something I would KILL for in Darkest Dungeon) so you can spec your build beforehand. A neat twist on this is that when you unlock an item after finishing a mission, you can choose to equip it there and then. So if one item is good for early stages but another good for latter ones, route your campaign through a mission to unlock it and you're free to equip it over your initial choice.\nCombat is turn-based with cards. The key thing is that you don't want to spend all your resources attacking as this'll leave you short for defending and will therefore be walloped. There's also a combo system and a few other things and so far I've found it to be like a backyard pool - shallow where you hop in and deeper the further you go.\nI've barely scratched the surface of character and item combinations for even one of the campaigns. I reckon there's a good 100 hours of lunch break gaming to be found here, it's really good. My only bugbear is that I wish they either spent a lot more or a lot less on the game art. I wonder how easy it'd be to go in and edit it... no workshop support either (yet?)\nPixel graphics, roguelike, and class choice gave me a Risk of Rain vibe (prior to experiencing gameplay); then I saw a gameplay vid.

For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.\nHistorically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days. This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn\u2019t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.\nThe normal resolution for this is to either refund the original payment to the user, or ask the user to transfer additional funds to cover the remaining balance. In both these cases, the user is hit with the Bitcoin network transaction fee again. This year, we\u2019ve seen increasing number of customers get into this state. With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer).\nAt this point, it has become untenable to support Bitcoin as a payment option. We may re-evaluate whether Bitcoin makes sense for us and for the Steam community at a later date.\nWe will continue working to resolve any pending issues for customers who are impacted by existing underpayments or transaction fees.\nShocking.\nHeh.\nIsorn on December 6", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/674/nKINKIQQAQP3F.jpg", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/568/nUGNHA065WXGA.gif", "http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041487164", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/657/nIHDGRAF65HZL.jpg", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/834/nUMHLWV2Q073G.gif", "http://alabasterslim.com/76561198041487164/steam_sig.png", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/752/nKRW43NRIDT4K.jpg", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/997/nQP3F431MY7LE.jpg", "http://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:24.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "48bcb322d9a7cc8dccc72197ae71d85342bddc54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl84_CVYRfttwAZIZZmM.cRBLhzaylCNGhe4GQj2GnLjCDT97g12Sx6IUqJl24zDeNaHQTRVcSo_Y", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "Put your fate in the hands of [Steam]! 19", "title_full": "Put your fate in the hands of [Steam]! - Page 19 \u2014 Penny Arcade", "published": "2017-12-06T13:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 24, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/8DDBNVR065TV.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8253, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4c0a4e64146fad427015d1ca3ad2eaabbfe14c75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl84_CVYRfttwAZIZZmM.cRBLhzaylCNGhe4GQj2GnLjCDT97g12Sx6IUqJl24zDeNQI_4kfdhEl3g_GE0mUNXDM-", "ord_in_thread": 24, "author": "Jazz", "published": "2017-12-07T06:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Steel Quote: : \u00bb Quote: : \u00bb Quote: : \u00bb Quote: : \u00bb Quote: : \u00bb Quote: : \u00bb Quote: : \u00bb Quote: : \u00bb Man, I wish I could just, like, put my computer's specs into Steam so it would stop recommending games that I cannot run at all.\nEspecially since they all look so good. Add to wishlist, play later.\nI mean, this seems overly optimistic about my financial situation and ability to upgrade my PC.\nNot overly. I mean, how long do computers usually last you? Because I think 6 years has been the longest a computer has lasted me. And then you kinda gotta scrounge or knock over a convenience store or rob a bank or something to get a new one.\nAnd at that point, the game's what, 20 bucks? I mean, unless it's Activision, then it's what, 50 bucks?\nIf you two want to post some specs in the PC Build Thread, we can give you some ideas. While technology marches ever forward, relatively recent components have aged quite well. For example, the i7 2600 from 2011 is only just now bottlenecking recent games. The GPUs are doing *that much* of the heavy lifting. And in regards to GPUs, you can get a GTX 1050 for right around $100 US (or less, if you hunt for sales) that will run most games on moderate settings.\nAlso, despite the fact many people approach their PCs like a console (i.e. replace it whole cloth), certain components age quite well. For example, the PSU I bought for my first major build in 2007 is powering my current rig (i5 4th gen; GTX 1080 that I bought after saving up birthday and Christmas gift cards) without a hiccup.\nCaveat: prices are shitty right now because RAM is currently a significant portion of a build budget (but this is expected to fix itself within the next year), and there are new gens of both Intel and AMD CPUs with high demand.\nGenerally, I treat my PC as a console because I need it to be portable, so I get the larger laptops, the 17.3-inch ones, usually. Big enough for a full keyboard, but compact enough to pop into a case and take somewhere, with a screen big enough to see mostly what I'm doing, most of the time.\nEventually I'd be interested in a desktop, I'm sure, but only if it's super portable, which then, why have a desktop PC?\nThough I also don't know the first thing about building a computer, and find even the notion of it daunting in the extreme.\nIt\u2019s really not that bad. You set a budget, pick a cpu, then play match the numbers/hardware sockets until you use up your budget. And omg it\u2019s so fun to put a new pc together. Most of the installing driver pains are a thing of the past... mostly. Now it\u2019s just figuring out how to get windows 10 on a clean disk if you did the free upgrade.\nLaptops are definitely great for portability but being able to upgrade a single part or small subset of parts to improve performance is always great. Plus no bloatware!\nHow fun it is really depends on how good you are with your hands. Sometimes snaking wires into parts of the case to get them out of the way of fans and whatnot makes me glad I'm as dextrous as I am as someone with fatter fingers would pinch or cut something.\nIt's not hard IMO and akin to putting together a larger LEGO set or a Gundam model but some people can find that tough. And wire management and the connectors between the motherboard and case buttons/LEDs can be a bit bewildering for a first time builder.\nI'd peg it as an afternoon into evening project for most people.\nI would like to have a punt at building a PC one of these days. I've owned a fair few desktop systems and done basic upgrades to several of them, mostly RAM, HDDs etc although I did upgrade the CPU in my old 486 from an SX-25 to a DX2-66 (awesome!) and popped a couple of video cards in in the 3Dfx era but that's all.\nRight now I'm in a similar situation to Kal's case, which is why I'm also living on big laptops, but while my previous one was bought used and thus had a limited lifespan until new games outpaced its GPU (always the bit that \"ages\" the fastest; to be fair it punched above its weight a good number of times), my current one was new this summer and pretty high-end so I'm hoping I can get a good few years out of it. It'll need moar RAM (as the old spelling would have it) at some point but I'm hoping I can wait until prices drop a bit from where they are now... which feels like a vain hope as they still seem to be creeping up (and UK sterling volatility with Brexit etc isn't helping). \u00a383 (US$111) for just another 8GB seems a bit over the top to me, so I hope Mugsley's prediction about RAM pricing is right. But for the moment its 8GB seems enough to get by on, and that is at least a bit I can upgrade which is why I didn't mind skimping on it slightly.\nEdit: *has lightbulb moment... starts looking for RAM on Fleabay...*\nJazz on December 6\nSteam: JazzMX5", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://steamcommunity.com/id/jazzmx5", "http://i.imgur.com/ABqjEVo.jpg", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/190/nSEEMP0DLELI2.gif"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:24.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "48bcb322d9a7cc8dccc72197ae71d85342bddc54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl84_CVYRfttwAZIZZmM.cRBLhzaylCNGhe4GQj2GnLjCDT97g12Sx6IUqJl24zDeNaHQTRVcSo_Y", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "Put your fate in the hands of [Steam]! 19", "title_full": "Put your fate in the hands of [Steam]! - Page 19 \u2014 Penny Arcade", "published": "2017-12-06T13:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 24, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/8DDBNVR065TV.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8253, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b93fb8df92af70fb3ba7d29c2d653c71d17e1769", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl84_CVYRfttwAZIZZmM.cRBLhzaylCNGhe4GQj2GnLjCDT97g12Sx6IUqJl24zDeNWkLBPPDXuyyAJf1OHmeCc0-", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "heenato", "published": "2017-12-07T02:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hell yeah.

Add to wishlist, play later.\nI mean, this seems overly optimistic about my financial situation and ability to upgrade my PC.\nNot overly. I mean, how long do computers usually last you? Because I think 6 years has been the longest a computer has lasted me. And then you kinda gotta scrounge or knock over a convenience store or rob a bank or something to get a new one.\nAnd at that point, the game's what, 20 bucks? I mean, unless it's Activision, then it's what, 50 bucks?\nIf you two want to post some specs in the PC Build Thread, we can give you some ideas. While technology marches ever forward, relatively recent components have aged quite well. For example, the i7 2600 from 2011 is only just now bottlenecking recent games. The GPUs are doing *that much* of the heavy lifting. And in regards to GPUs, you can get a GTX 1050 for right around $100 US (or less, if you hunt for sales) that will run most games on moderate settings.\nAlso, despite the fact many people approach their PCs like a console (i.e. replace it whole cloth), certain components age quite well. For example, the PSU I bought for my first major build in 2007 is powering my current rig (i5 4th gen; GTX 1080 that I bought after saving up birthday and Christmas gift cards) without a hiccup.\nCaveat: prices are shitty right now because RAM is currently a significant portion of a build budget (but this is expected to fix itself within the next year), and there are new gens of both Intel and AMD CPUs with high demand.\nGenerally, I treat my PC as a console because I need it to be portable, so I get the larger laptops, the 17.3-inch ones, usually. Big enough for a full keyboard, but compact enough to pop into a case and take somewhere, with a screen big enough to see mostly what I'm doing, most of the time.\nEventually I'd be interested in a desktop, I'm sure, but only if it's super portable, which then, why have a desktop PC?\nThough I also don't know the first thing about building a computer, and find even the notion of it daunting in the extreme.\nI make art things!

Add to wishlist, play later.\nI mean, this seems overly optimistic about my financial situation and ability to upgrade my PC.\nNot overly. I mean, how long do computers usually last you? Because I think 6 years has been the longest a computer has lasted me. And then you kinda gotta scrounge or knock over a convenience store or rob a bank or something to get a new one.\nAnd at that point, the game's what, 20 bucks? I mean, unless it's Activision, then it's what, 50 bucks?\nIf you two want to post some specs in the PC Build Thread, we can give you some ideas. While technology marches ever forward, relatively recent components have aged quite well. For example, the i7 2600 from 2011 is only just now bottlenecking recent games. The GPUs are doing *that much* of the heavy lifting. And in regards to GPUs, you can get a GTX 1050 for right around $100 US (or less, if you hunt for sales) that will run most games on moderate settings.\nAlso, despite the fact many people approach their PCs like a console (i.e. replace it whole cloth), certain components age quite well. For example, the PSU I bought for my first major build in 2007 is powering my current rig (i5 4th gen; GTX 1080 that I bought after saving up birthday and Christmas gift cards) without a hiccup.\nCaveat: prices are shitty right now because RAM is currently a significant portion of a build budget (but this is expected to fix itself within the next year), and there are new gens of both Intel and AMD CPUs with high demand.\nGenerally, I treat my PC as a console because I need it to be portable, so I get the larger laptops, the 17.3-inch ones, usually. Big enough for a full keyboard, but compact enough to pop into a case and take somewhere, with a screen big enough to see mostly what I'm doing, most of the time.\nEventually I'd be interested in a desktop, I'm sure, but only if it's super portable, which then, why have a desktop PC?\nThough I also don't know the first thing about building a computer, and find even the notion of it daunting in the extreme.\nIt\u2019s really not that bad. You set a budget, pick a cpu, then play match the numbers/hardware sockets until you use up your budget. And omg it\u2019s so fun to put a new pc together. Most of the installing driver pains are a thing of the past... mostly. Now it\u2019s just figuring out how to get windows 10 on a clean disk if you did the free upgrade.\nLaptops are definitely great for portability but being able to upgrade a single part or small subset of parts to improve performance is always great. Plus no bloatware!\nHow fun it is really depends on how good you are with your hands. Sometimes snaking wires into parts of the case to get them out of the way of fans and whatnot makes me glad I'm as dextrous as I am as someone with fatter fingers would pinch or cut something.\nIt's not hard IMO and akin to putting together a larger LEGO set or a Gundam model but some people can find that tough. And wire management and the connectors between the motherboard and case buttons/LEDs can be a bit bewildering for a first time builder.\nI'd peg it as an afternoon into evening project for most people.\nBig Quote: : \u00bb I found that tilting it doesn't work very well, and once I started jerking it, I got much better results.\nSteam Profile\n3DS: 3454-0268-5595 Battle.net: SteelAngel#1772", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/888/nPLJAVPO1655M.png", "http://steamcommunity.com/id/syu6/", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/538/nJTBAPIARGIVS.gif", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/657/n0DC9OJDSF6RP.png", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/997/nQP3F431MY7LE.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:24.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "48bcb322d9a7cc8dccc72197ae71d85342bddc54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl84_CVYRfttwAZIZZmM.cRBLhzaylCNGhe4GQj2GnLjCDT97g12Sx6IUqJl24zDeNaHQTRVcSo_Y", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "Put your fate in the hands of [Steam]! 19", "title_full": "Put your fate in the hands of [Steam]! - Page 19 \u2014 Penny Arcade", "published": "2017-12-06T13:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 24, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/8DDBNVR065TV.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8253, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a440bf14c92c42abd141ee4e82d847eeff457ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl84_CVYRfttwAZIZZmM.cRBLhzaylCNGhe4GQj2GnLjCDT97g12Sx6IUqJl24zDeNSV1fwBzbjvVvSUjsbsPiSQ-", "ord_in_thread": 26, "author": "Kalnaur", "published": "2017-12-07T07:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "If there's really anything that I need upgraded, it's my GPU.

Motherboards and fans aren't really much different from drives, they just have more screws and things to plug in.\nBig Quote: : \u00bb I found that tilting it doesn't work very well, and once I started jerking it, I got much better results.\nSteam Profile\n3DS: 3454-0268-5595 Battle.net: SteelAngel#1772", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://steamcommunity.com/id/syu6/", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/848/nOX5VFTKU3REP.jpg", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/997/nQP3F431MY7LE.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:24.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "48bcb322d9a7cc8dccc72197ae71d85342bddc54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl84_CVYRfttwAZIZZmM.cRBLhzaylCNGhe4GQj2GnLjCDT97g12Sx6IUqJl24zDeNaHQTRVcSo_Y", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "Put your fate in the hands of [Steam]! 19", "title_full": "Put your fate in the hands of [Steam]! - Page 19 \u2014 Penny Arcade", "published": "2017-12-06T13:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 24, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/8DDBNVR065TV.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8253, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aeaa66698e10cac1cdc4a92b7bde3e5a12fc69c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl84_CVYRfttwAZIZZmM.cRBLhzaylCNGhe4GQj2GnLjCDT97g12Sx6IUqJl24zDeNWAG8Gg8okYm32LQzMZn7zE-", "ord_in_thread": 33, "author": "Pixelated Pixie", "published": "2017-12-07T08:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Look, you fiends, \"Gift Pixie\" is NOT the GOTY.
