Abstainers included former prime minister Tony Abbott, whose government had promised to let the country decide the issue. Scott Barbour/Getty Images \nThe vote overturned legislation passed 13 years ago, under the premiership of John Howard, that explicitly defined marriage as \u201cthe union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others.\u201d \n\nAccording to The Sydney Morning Herald , MPs crossed the chamber after the vote to embrace one another, while the public galleries \u201csustained rapturous applause for several minutes and eventually burst into a rendition of I Am, You Are, We Are Australian .\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\u201d said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. \nThe parliamentary vote came a couple days after one member, Tim Wilson, became the first person to propose to someone in the legislative chamber\u2014his long-term partner, Ryan Bolger, who said yes .

President Rodrigo Duterte brought back the Philippine National Police (PNP) to the drug war, Ozamiz City police did not waste time as it reported the recovery of P112 million worth of \u201cshabu\u201d allegedly from the family of the late mayor Reynaldo Parojinog Sr. \nChief Inspector Jovie Espenido of the Ozamiz City police said the seized drugs were old and unsold items that were stored by the Parojinogs to sell for future financial gain now that their patriarch was dead. \n\u201cThat was an old supply. When I went to Ozamiz, they hid it. They only brought it out now that they are looking for money considering their father is dead,\u201d Espenido said in a radio interview. \nOn Wednesday, Espenido claimed that around P32 million worth of drugs were confiscated from three suspects linked to the Parojinog family in Ozamiz City on Tuesday. \nEspenido identified the suspects as Butch Merino, Melden Rabanes, and Rosielyn Walohan who were arrested from a series of operations in Misamis Occidental. \nPolice said Rabanes was a first cousin of detained Ozamiz City vice mayor Nova Parojinog while Merino was a former driver of the vice mayor. \nThe suspects faced charges of illegal possession of firearms and illegal drugs. \nIn a follow-up operation, around 10 kilos of shabu worth P80 million were allegedly recovered from Melodina and Gaudencio Malingin, and Michelle Gumapac. The Malingins were identified as the parents of Merino. \nEspenido said that \u201cshabu\u201d runners were deployed in different cities in Mindanao and transported their \u201ccargo\u201d through ships. \n\u201cYung transaksyon nila, \u2018yung taga-Cebu, magpupunta sa Ozamiz, sakay lang ng barko.

Examine the following guidelines for procuring patio pavers Ocean County .\n\nLicensing and documentation. This entails all sets of documentation that will approve an expert to give services to the general public. Permits must be obtained from relevant departments governing operations within a given state. Clients are highly advised to work with experts having the right papers as they can be held liable in the case of crisis and can add credibility to the workforce.\n\nLevel of experience. It should be high to outshine that of fellow competitors. Normally, a good contractor will be having a good combination of years of expertise and regarded by clients. They have a wide exposure to many issues thus enabling them to be well qualified and have technical skills and approaches to handle solutions at faster rates. They deliver quality and competent outputs as well.\n\nHire communicative professionals. Best and excellent communication is a stake in good performance regardless of whether a project process will take long or short. Proponents are entitled to establishing a very strong relationship and enabling the environment to all stakeholders. This aids into a good relation and interaction which translates to uninterrupted performances in the long run.\n\nGet ample recommendations. You can obtain and seek consultations from reliable sources such as friends and business associates. Additionally, there is dire need to have a list of names and phone numbers, so that information helpful in deciding the fate of prospective candidates is determined easily. You have to ask why candidates left their past stations, what they intend to add to their new positions once hired and if they are well qualified.\n\nSeek for affordable charges. It is good to start by asking the possible cost approximations before embarking on the tasks. Having a staff able to give a rough figure of the amount to be used will enable proponents to plan well financially and determine what allocations to set aside to cater for all expenses and overlays. Good and experienced workers will help in preparations of inventories and relevant prices of items to be utilized.\n\nCheck on insurances and bonding. They have to be availed to technicians by the host agencies to protect against injuries and damages likely to come up in the course of duty. To be certain, ask for a proof of worker compensation insurance as it plays a vital role in guaranteeing compensation in case of property getting damaging and also in facilitating legal assistance if uncertainties come up.\n\nThe schedule. Normally, best technicians can be able to tell the exact time frame that a given project will take even before starting the tasks. This has to be communicated beforehand to allow enough planning and in coming up with a written contract. Working with specialists with the ability to make such accurate estimations will be significant in helping to consider the budgetary requirements.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are searching for information about patio pavers Ocean County locals can visit our web pages today.

McMaster Approved NSA Spy Job On Trump Family", "text": "Retired CIA Agent Working With Blackwater Founder Claims H.R. McMaster Approved NSA Spy Job On Trump Family   December 7, 2017 \n\nA retired CIA officer reportedly working with Blackwater founder Erik Prince to pitch the White House on a global, private spy network which as we reported yesterday would allow the White House to circumvent and counter \u201cdeep state enemies\u201d within U.S. intelligence agencies, is said to have made the stunning claim that National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster worked with the NSA to perform surveillance on Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump, Steve Bannon and others, according to a report in The Intercept . \nThe former CIA agent, John R. Maguire \u2013 a Trump transition team member who works for intelligence contractor Amyntor Group, spent over two decades as a paramilitary officer \u2013 including tours in Central America working with the Contras. After retiring, Maguire hooked up with Blackwater founder Erik Prince in what has been a long and fruitful professional relationship. \nWhile Maguire and Prince deny they are working together on the White House\u2019s \u201cprivate spy network,\u201d current and former U.S. officials as well as Trump donors say otherwise, as The Intercept reports: The former senior intelligence official with direct knowledge of the efforts scoffed at Prince\u2019s denials. \u201cErik\u2019s proposal had no company names on the slides,\u201d this person said, \u201c but there is no doubt that Prince and Maguire were working together. \u201d \nPrince is reported to have told a top Trump fundraiser that he and Maguire are working together, and the two had been going around to Trump fundraisers to generate support for private military contracting efforts in Afghanistan until a CIA contract materialized for the project. \nDuring these conversations, Maguire told donors that Obama administration holdovers were withholding information from President Trump , and H.R. McMaster \u2013 a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former CIA director David Petraeus \u2013 authorized a spying operation on members of the Trump family as well as Steve Bannon, and then sent the gathered intel to an international facility owned by George Soros. Via The Intercept : \u201c [Maguire] said there were people inside the CIA who joined in the previous eight years [under Obama] and inside the government, and they were failing to give the president the intelligence he needed , \u201d said a person who was pitched by Maguire and other Amyntor personnel. To support his claim, Maguire told at least two people that National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, in coordination with a top official at the National Security Agency, authorized surveillance of Steven Bannon and Trump family members, including Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. Adding to these unsubstantiated claims, Maguire told the potential donors he also had evidence McMaster used a burner phone to send information gathered through the surveillance to a facility in Cyprus owned by George Soros . \nA potential Donor Maguire spoke with said \u201c John [Maguire] was certain that the deep state was going to kick the president out of office within a year ,\u201d adding \u201c These guys said they were protecting the president .\u201d \nGiven the frequent and ongoing \u201cdeep-state\u201d leaks to the MSM designed to undermine Trump, reports of Obama holdovers keeping dozens of national security positions \u2013 some say thanks to H.R. McMaster , and advisory team whittled down to Stephen Miller, Jared and Ivanka, it\u2019s no secret that at least some, if not all of what is known as the \u201cdeep state\u201d has been after Trump since he became a serious threat to Hillary Clinton during the election. \nNote: For archiving purposes, a full version of the article will remain here.

Alex Wong / Getty Images \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Stzrok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order. Copyright 2017 NPR.

What would you like to do [with this step], Mr Trump? What kind of stance is it?\" Erdogan said on Thursday, at Esenboga Airport in the capital Ankara, before leaving for a visit to Greece. Breaking with decades of US policy, Trump on Wednesday announced the transfer of American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, formally recognising the contested city as the capital of Israel despite widespread international opposition . \n\"I have determined that it is time to officially recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,\" he said in a speech in Washington. Ignite a 'powder keg' \nUS analysts say Trump's announcement might risk igniting a \"powder keg\" at the heart of the Israel-Palestine conflict. \n\"Jerusalem has a tendency to explode when you fool around with the status quo,\" said Aaron David Miller, vice president at the Woodrow Wilson Center and a former Middle East adviser to the Clinton and Bush administrations. \nThe Turkish president, who had earlier warned that the status of Jerusalem was a red line for Muslims , said that the US decision disregarded a 1980 United Nations resolution regarding the status of the city. \nHe added that political leaders should work to bring peace, not stir things up. \nCalling Jerusalem \"also a sanctuary for Christians\", Erdogan added that he would speak to Pope Francis about Trump's decision this evening or on Friday. \nTurkey will host an extraordinary meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) on December 13 to discuss the US move. Jerusalem at the core of the conflict \nJerusalem remains at the core of the Israel-Palestine conflict, with Palestinians hoping that East Jerusalem might eventually serve as the capital of a future Palestinian state. \nIsrael illegally occupied Palestinian territories in the 1967 war , including East Jerusalem in defiance of the international community, and wasted no time in declaring the city as its \"eternal, undivided\" capital. \nTrump had promised to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem during his election campaign. \nSaeb Erekat , the chief Palestinian negotiator, said Trump \"destroyed any possibility of peace\" and was \"pushing this region towards chaos [and] violence\". \n\"He is destroying all moderates in the region and giving power to extremists,\" Erekat told Al Jazeera.\"This is the most dangerous decision that any US president has ever taken.\" \nErekat said it is \"meaningless\" to have a Palestinian state without Jerusalem as its capital. \nSOURCE: Al Jazeera News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "al jazeera erdogan", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "erekat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pope francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saeb erekat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "organisation of islamic countries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al jazeera news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al jazeera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the woodrow wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "esenboga airport", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:15.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "61992883f38b84b12b1733665a16e203eb46f437", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9paEhkHBi2cipvvWPF6FgWEIdpfH8EYRWI2rQwCdW9Zcde9Pfis_R.sgTNXTKOk130Kmc4G3BYbOBU7kukqgRFEdMssj18htzNtfXFbFGnXb7BixH2Uovc.3J5gS0F.ZfhsXnuTO.WlPS2wkUtpUkVsKO6ZTT5Z2Uy9D1zEINm3KMS7VR_WvUPfSF5tHxitlpkC98qeEChTLuGxosbFqGD.qHrgYY_9Y0-", "site_full": "www.pcdistrict.com", "site": "pcdistrict.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/PCDistrictNews", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "PC District  News", "title": "Excalibur Websites, Santa Cruz Internet Marketing Consultant, launches products to grow profits -- Excalibur Websites | PRLog", "title_full": "Excalibur Websites, Santa Cruz Internet Marketing Consultant, launches products to grow profits -- Excalibur Websites | PRLog", "published": "2017-12-07T01:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "61992883f38b84b12b1733665a16e203eb46f437", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9paEhkHBi2cipvvWPF6FgWEIdpfH8EYRWI2rQwCdW9Zcde9Pfis_R.sgTNXTKOk130Kmc4G3BYbOBU7kukqgRFEdMssj18htzNtfXFbFGnXb7BixH2Uovc.3J5gS0F.ZfhsXnuTO.WlPS2wkUtpUkVsKO6ZTT5Z2Uy9D1zEINm3KMS7VR_WvUPfSF5tHxitlpkC98qeEChTLuGxosbFqGD.qHrgYY_9Y0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T01:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "Excalibur Websites, Santa Cruz Internet Marketing Consultant, launches products to grow profits -- Excalibur Websites | PRLog", "text": "  Internet \u00bb Excalibur Websites, Santa Cruz Internet Marketing Consultant, launches products to grow profits -- Excalibur Websites | PRLog 1 vote Excalibur Websites, Santa Cruz Internet Marketing Consultant, launches products to grow profits -- Excalibur Websites | PRLog \u00bb read source Excalibur Websites, Santa Cruz Internet Marketing Consultant, launches products to grow profits.

International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde makes remarks during the Plenary Session of the IMF and World Bank's 2017 Annual Fall Meetings, in Washington, U.S., October 13, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Theiler/File Photo The two banks are among the largest financial contributors to a $40 billion bailout package given to Ukraine to shore up and reform its economy after the 2014 Maidan protests ousted the Kremlin-backed president, Viktor Yanukovich. But perceived backsliding on reform commitments has delayed billions of dollars in IMF loans and tested the patience of foreign allies, even as Kiev pushes for closer EU integration and increased foreign investment. \u201cWe are deeply concerned by recent events in Ukraine that could roll back progress that has been made in setting up independent institutions to tackle high-level corruption,\u201d IMF chief Christine Lagarde said in a statement. Ukraine\u2019s backers are particularly concerned about recent actions by prosecutors that they say threaten the independence of the anti-corruption bureau known as NABU, which was set up after the Maidan protests and has been at loggerheads with other law enforcement bodies. \u201cWe urge the Ukrainian authorities and parliament to safeguard the independence of NABU and SAPO (anti-corruption prosecutor),\u201d Lagarde said. In one recent episode, the General Prosecutor\u2019s office unmasked an alleged sting operation being carried out by NABU against suspected corruption in the migration service. It said NABU had overstepped the law. In a separate statement, the World Bank\u2019s office in Ukraine also expressed its concern and said attacks on NABU and on SAPO \u201cthreaten their ability to fight corruption and recover stolen assets.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s critical they have the legislative framework & resources to fulfil their mandate,\u201d it said. The comments add to a chorus of criticism from Ukraine\u2019s backers this week. Earlier, the U.S. State Department and European Union said the attacks on NABU risked eroding international support for Ukraine.

Driving to Aeon, you could see it from the highway. In the daylight, it looked abandoned and near-derelict, a collection of small-time amusement park fare. A merry-go-round, bumper cars, and a bunch of those games of skill that tempted you with stuffed animal prizes. Nothing permanent, but a collection of the kind of amusements you might find at the show of a small, regional town. Which made sense, this being Sitiawan and all. \nThe sign on the front said Happy Fun Park, but I wasn\u2019t so sure. \nWe went back when it was actually open, at night. While it looked abandoned during the day, that changed completely at night. Flashing neon lights and fluorescent lighting lit up the rides and small booths, and some generic dance/electronic music added an almost cool vibe. My cousins weren\u2019t too interested in any of the rides \u2014 they seemed mostly designed to entertain teenagers, not semi-independent twenty-somethings \u2014 but we went on the Ferris wheel anyway, in the hopes that it would give us a decent view. \nOne of the rides was the swinging-hammer type that did a fulled 360-degree rotation around its centre. I had ridden one of those in Hong Kong in what would have been nearly a decade ago, so I wasn\u2019t really interested in riding it again, and especially not alone. Eventually, I convinced one of my younger cousins to ride the swinging ship with me. You know the type; it\u2019s a gentler ride, but can still make you feel a little funny. Unfortunately, the novelty wore off after about 30 seconds, but the ride seemed to go on forever, or at least entirely too long. I thought my cousin was going to throw up, but she just looked mildly sick \u2014 this was after we just had a massive banquet dinner, so I\u2019m not sure I blame her. \nI tried my hand at a game of skill with another cousin. I didn\u2019t completely understand the rules, but the idea was that you had to pop balloons with darts. Having played electronic darts at a bar a few nights prior, we gave it a half-decent go and got pretty within one or two balloons of a prize, but we ended up missing the last one and ended up winning a absolutely nothing. \nThe way you paid for rides and amusements was with these small purple tokens, and I ended up keeping one of the tokens as a memento. \nA reminder of simpler times, perhaps. Or maybe to just have fun every now and again. Search for: Hey there! For more info, hit up the very first post to see what this is all about .

(Photo: Shuttterstock) \nIt seems like every week, another retailer announces store closings. This trend is not just affecting the retail industry, it's also affecting real estate \u2014 specifically, mall operators who have long partnered with retailers to create what once defined the American shopping experience. \nMore and more of today's traditional shopping malls are struggling with vacancies. In Q3 2017, the vacancy rate for regional malls was 8.3 percent, up from 7.8 percent for the same period in 2016 . Part of the decline is due to the higher closure rates of stores that have historically served as anchor tenants \u2014 the largest retailers, usually located at the ends of the malls' wings. \nThis reflects a larger trend. So far in 2017, there have been 6,691 store location closures announced among major U.S. stores (as of November), representing a 230 percent increase over 2016, according to Fung Global Retail & Technology. \nE-commerce is perhaps the biggest culprit in the changing fortunes of the traditional shopping mall: Fifty-one percent of Americans prefer to shop online , and 80 percent of Americans with internet access make an online purchase every month, according to Big Commerce. New reality, new risks \n\"Mall operators are catching on to this new reality,\" says Mark Morneau, division underwriting manager, National Insurance Casualty, Liberty Mutual Insurance, \"and many view it as a new opportunity.\" In addition to potentially charging higher rental rates than those charged to previous long-term tenants, mall operators can reinvent themselves to better meet the needs of modern consumers. \nToday's consumers want to do more than just shop; they want experiences like dining, entertainments centers and outdoor events like concerts and festivals. These add-ons help improve the mix of options available to customers, which mall operators hope translates into more frequent and longer visits, higher spend and greater loyalty. \nThese changes, however, can also introduce new risks that require an operator to reassess both the mall\u2019s safety and insurance coverage. \n\"For example, with a restaurant, you're introducing more significant fire exposure,\" says Morneau. \"The current location might be designed with limited fire protection. Therefore, the space may need different types of sprinkler or ventilations systems.\" \nOther attractions, such as a trampoline park, carry much more complex risks. It is essential in all cases to get to know the tenant, their experience and the potential risks associated with the new exposure. \n\"What is their reputation?\" he says. \"What equipment will be installed, and how often does it need to be serviced? Who's installing it, and what are their qualifications? The tenant\u2019s employees may also need special training. Oftentimes, we find the contractual obligations of that tenant need to be much more stringent.\" \nIn addition, tenants offering higher-risk attractions may only able to obtain general liability coverage from the excess and surplus (E&S) market. This can addcomplexity for the mall operator, as E&S policies are non-admitted. \"It's important to understand the tenant's policy and to make sure there are no odd exclusions that could put the facility at risk in the event of a large loss,\" says Morneau. Special steps for outdoor events \nOutdoor venues like concerts or festivals present their own challenges. A mall operator should vet all vendors to ensure they understand how to manage event activities. How, for example, will food be prepared? Will the vendor adhere to local and state health and safety codes? How will event staff manage injuries, first aid and other emergencies? Will the setup crew follow electrical and fire safety guidelines for all temporary lighting, wiring and equipment? \nThe mall operator may also need to consider special events coverage, which names the city or town as an additional insured. Special events coverage can also provide important protection for event-related exposures that the mall operator\u2019s standard insurance might not consider. \nSecurity can also be a major concern at outdoor venues. While organizers have historically focused on the venue itself, they must also consider the surrounding real estate today, as reflected by the recent mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas, where the assailant attacked from the window of his hotel room. This might involve working closely with separately managed properties nearby and coordinating with municipalities. Mitigating the new mall's risk \nMall operators certainly face a greater range of risks than ever before as former retail meccas begin serving a new purpose, but they can prepare and protect themselves by understanding the risks and implementing mitigation programs. Review protocols \nA new mix of tenants may mean new protocols. Increased foot traffic, for example, may require adjustments to maintenance schedules to minimize risks from slippery floors. Parking lot safety, fire safety and general security must all be re-evaluated as a mall transforms. Mall operators should also ensure that tenants have adequate crisis management plans that reflect the actual risks of their operations. Contracts and coverage \nContracts and insurance coverage must also be examined \u2014 and perhaps altered. Standard contractual requirements like hold-harmless indemnity and additional-insured status are critical, says Morneau. In addition, contracts should be clear and unambiguous, use appropriate risk-transfer language and clearly allocate responsibilities, specifying that tenants are responsible for maintenance, inspections and equipment repairs. \nEach tenant\u2019s insurance needs should also be evaluated. At a minimum, tenants' general liability policies should contain limits of $1 million with a $5 million umbrella; higher-risk tenants should have higher limits. Construction considerations \nFinally, as malls accommodate a new range of attractions, operators must be mindful of their current coverage, their spaces' physical changes and how any work is performed. The mall operator's policy may have construction exclusions, so he or she may need to obtain additional coverage before starting work. In addition, changes to older buildings may require that the structure be brought up to current building codes. It is also important to carefully evaluate the general contractor's reputation and insurance coverage. Finally, adequate security during construction \u2014 such as lighting, cameras and frequent checks by security personnel \u2014 is key to limiting the risk of theft or property damage. Partnering with insurance experts \nOne way that mall operators can stay ahead of new risks is by collaborating with insurance brokers and carriers that understand their specific challenges and can help them protect their properties, finances and reputations. Today's mall operators face a new reality thanks to e-commerce and changing consumer tastes. It is important to adapt to new realities as they seek to modernize their malls \u2014 but it is equally important that they understand, evaluate and address the new risks they may be taking on in this modern era.

They are a great way to work on words and learning the number of events. \nChristmas and winter are almost here. I have some sequencing set for Christmas and almost some that work for winter as well. \nThe set is a mix of clip cards, 3 part cards, writing and easy reader printables! These are a   Christmas printables on the site. \nI love having these sets of cards with different word orders and styles for kids to learn about. You can always mix up what you want to do with the sets. You can use the different wording each time. \nPlus all the sets have the same pages so you know what you getting every time. \nThere are several different clip cards to pick from. You have the same above with the 1, 2, 3, & 4; first, second, third, & fourth or first, then, next, & last. You can see the different types here. I love to mix up how we use them and use paper clips or cover with glass gems. I don\u2019t always use clothespins . \nThere is also a set of task cards where they can write in the number on the cards or place a number on the circles. We have used number magnets for this. But stamping in playdough is also fun to do. \nThere are three part cards for each of the sets for word orders. They have a picture with the word and one where the picture and word can be cut apart. You can also leave them together to see the order the sequencing for younger kids. \nYou also have three options for the cut and paste activities. You have the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 or first, second, third, fourth. There is also a set with 1, 2, 3, 4 that has sentences with the pictures. \nThere are also additional writing pages that match up to the cards with different words. One has a word bank and another does not. In the Winter Sequencing Clip Cards Selling Set there is also a word bank bookmarks you can use. The bookmarks come in color and black & white. \nThe final printable is an easy reader book for each set. The book has the four steps in a 6-page book. Plus there is a writing or tracing page that matches up to the book. The tracing pages have been added to all the sets. It was a request. What You Will Find in the Sequencing Cards Set for Winter \nIt has 4 full sets of Winter Themed Sequencing cards, worksheets and easy reader books for the following themes: Decorating a Christmas Tree, Making Hot Chocolate, Making Cookies, Wrapping A Gift \u2013 and more coming soon! This is a growing bundle.

During the drills, citizens will practice evacuating their homes, offices, and public transit and heading to underground shelters upon the signal from government warning sirens. \nJapan\u2019s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had avoided conducting these drills in major cities because he didn\u2019t want to incite panic. Smaller towns and villages have already been conducting the drills in preparation for a possible attack from North Korea. \nMost Japanese now firmly believe war with the Hermit Kingdom could break out at any moment. Not only does the Kim regime harbor a great deal of pent up animus toward Korea\u2019s World War II occupiers, but the country is also home to many U.S. military bases that would likely be the staging grounds for an attack or invasion. \n\u2026 \nLast Friday, Hawaii began testing its nuclear attack warning system, which is expected to provide about 20 minutes\u2019 notice to residents and visitors. The minute-long test was integrated with the monthly testing of other warning signals.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shinzo abe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong-un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hermit kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:16.004+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15137292, "moreResultsAvailable": 15137192, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512638176004&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 833}
