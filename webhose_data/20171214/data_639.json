Raise your hand if this sounds familiar. Been there, done that and I found something I didn\u2019t like and I obsessed over it for days wondering whether that LOL was really just a friendly laugh. \nIn the world of smartphones, dating is a whole new game. We text instead of call. We find perfect matches with the swipe of our thumbs. We start (and end) relationships by pressing \u201csend\u201d. With the simple press of a button, you have access to everything your loved one does on their phone\u2013every tweet, text, email, and phone call. \nSure, you\u2019re curious. I was really really curious when I did at first. Needing to have his passwords and creep on his messages when he leaves the room is a huge red flag. I know! If you are currently fighting the \u2018snooping disease\u2019, you need to ask yourself these questions to see if it\u2019s indicative of a much bigger issue: \nIs your relationship healthy? If you\u2019re being totally honest with yourself, is your relationship with this guy a healthy one? Does he give you love and loyalty and do you give it back? My guess is there are some unresolved issues under there if you are paranoid about his phone and what he is doing. Maybe those issues are within yourself, or maybe they need to be worked out as a couple but don\u2019t sweep them under the rug. Does he respect YOU? He does have a right to his own life and privacy, you also have a right to respect. If he is intentionally hiding things from you or being disrespectful to your relationship, don\u2019t put up with that. At that point, is it really even worth stalking his messages? Just save yourself the time and dump him\u2014use that energy for something meaningful and don\u2019t waste it on a guy who sucks anyway. Has he ever cheated? Does this guy have a past? Obviously, if he\u2019s cheated on you (or anyone else for that matter) you\u2019re going to have some trust issues. Maybe you\u2019re reaching for your phone because you think he hasn\u2019t changed . On the other hand, maybe you\u2019re struggling to let go of the past and give him the chance to redeem himself. Is your gut trying to tell you something? Yes, we overreact sometimes, but women are also amazing at reading people. If you\u2019re sure you\u2019re not just overreacting to whatever he said or did, maybe your gut is trying to tell you something is off. You\u2019re sitting here trying to figure out what really is going on and things just aren\u2019t adding up, listen to that voice and get rid of him. Always try to use reason first , but if reason fails, your gut is always spot on. \nIf you\u2019re worrying so much, have you consider maybe you\u2019re in the wrong relationship? When it comes down to it, no matter why you\u2019re feeling insecure about what your guy is doing, you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about your relationship. If he truly loves you and is someone you should be with, he will prove it to you. You won\u2019t worry about that girl co-worker or childhood friend and you\u2019ll be okay when he goes out with the boys. Healthy relationships just aren\u2019t high maintenance. \n\n#LiveandLearn ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:49.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "607ff9b005b0c491f185ba9a5490b7bcf00dd2b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzqEVdnq1krjlli40NPRtUK8nl2YZ1QXjSQkuNXCoVSngQ--", "site_full": "www.booking.com", "site": "booking.com", "site_section": "https://www.booking.com/hotel/pt/sao-paulo-5.en-gb.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Apartment Prime Lisbon - Sao Paulo 5, Portugal - Booking.com ", "title": "107 Verified Apartment Reviews of Prime Lisbon - Sao Paulo 5 | Booking.com", "title_full": "107 Verified Apartment Reviews of Prime Lisbon - Sao Paulo 5 | Booking.com", "published": "2017-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 29, "participants_count": 26, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.107, "main_image": "https://t-ec.bstatic.com/static/img/facebook-image-else/566c7081f1deeaca39957e96365c3908f83b95af.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 105, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ef7c5deec8e15073f58ac3ef6d913e5e99f6d2f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzqEVdnq1krjlli40NPRtUK8nl2YZ1QXjSSIVgpOpbw2LIiMh0R2pWzyrIiXAEDJX7AJFZUfHh5caqKxa.8cvzpw.g_DyEAkg8Q-", "ord_in_thread": 29, "author": "Gevorg Harutyunyan", "published": "2017-12-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\"Theft from the room, stolen notebook and phone\"", "text": "\ub209 Due to mass theft in the hotel, I've got my MacBook stolen from the room.

Real estate consultant Peter Zalewski once led a tour of 20 possible buyers on December 2. During his trip, Zalewski was conversing to the buyers regarding maintenance fees, property taxes, and market conditions, yet the issues concerning sea level rise and possible increased flooding in Miami were not dealt with at that time.\nMicheal Montalvan, a consultant who manages properties for foreign investors, mentioned that sea level rise and increased flooding are topics that his clients never ever thought of bringing up since they care less about these factors. He was among the 20 potential buyers in that bus ride.\nZalewski mentioned that Miami's recent condo boom is going downhill because these few projects are either not breaking ground or canceled and he pointed that President Trump's immigration policies, which have engineered uncertainty among foreign investors, are some of the factors behind the latest decline.\nHowever, the market is still hot with Miami's urban core boasting some 20,000 condominium units that are in different stages of completion.\nNPR mentioned that the end of the Ice Age saw the rise in sea levels, and scientists mentioned that rate of the rise is sure to increase as climate change makes its presence felt. Zalewski observed that the majority of investors are not considering, at the present, Miami's appearance four decades from now.\nHe mentioned that most of the buyers will not stay in Miami forever since they are basically looking to invest their money, yet South Florida residents deal with the sea level rise issue very seriously.\n\ud574\uc218\uba74 \uc0c1\uc2b9\uc5d0\ub3c4

Abstract \nOrganometal halide perovskite as a promising absorber in solar cells has caught tremendous attention in the past few years. Herein, a hydrophobic PCBM layer was introduced into planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells to form the TiO 2 /PCBM double blocking layer. The bilayer structure assures the formation of a dense, smooth, and pinhole-free blocking layer. And the PCBM layer can also be in favor of larger grain size perovskite film and further passivate the TiO 2 blocking layer. Scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscope, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results suggest the formation of a uniform and compact CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x perovskite layer on the PCBM-modified TiO 2 blocking layer. The solar cell has reached a PCE up to 16.37%, which is greatly larger than the control device with a PCE of 10.81%. 1. Introduction \nSolar cells as an economic approach to utilize solar energy have been developed for over six decades, and the most pivotal part of a solar cell is the absorber [ 1 \u2013 6 ]. Recently, one material named organometal halide perovskite has caught tremendous attention in solar cell society [ 7 \u2013 10 ]. Solar cells employing this kind of material have reached stunning power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of over 20% in only 6 years [ 11 ]. The organometal halide perovskite in the form of ABX 3 (A\u2009=\u2009CH 3 NH 3 + ; B\u2009=\u2009Pb 2+ or Sn 2+ ; and X\u2009=\u2009Cl \u2212 , Br \u2212 , or I \u2212 ) is a kind of promising material to absorb sunlight owning to its suitable band structure and convenient deposition process. For example, a 1.55\u2009eV direct bandgap of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 is approaching the optimal bandgap for a single junction solar cell under the prediction of Shockley\u2013Queisser limit [ 12 ]. Moreover, the solution process of organometal halide perovskite enables the use of large-scale low-cost deposition method which will further lower the cost of organometal halide perovskite solar cells [ 13 \u2013 15 ]. \nDue to the obvious advantages, great research interests have been attracted in organometal halide perovskite solar cells in recent years [ 16 \u2013 21 ]. For the record efficiency of perovskite solar cells, a mesoporous n-i-p structure was employed where n, i, and p indicate the majority carrier type in each layer of a perovskite solar cell. Compared with the mesoporous structure device, a planar heterojunction solar cell may be in more favor due to its simple device structure. The mesoporous TiO 2 high temperature (>450\u00b0C) sintering process will inevitably increase the cost of perovskite solar cells. However, for a planar n-i-p-structured organometal halide perovskite solar cell, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) still lags far behind that of mesoporous solar cells even though experiment has proved that mesoporous TiO 2 is not necessary for the electron transportation [ 17 ]. Achieving a high PCE in a planar n-i-p-structured organometal halide perovskite solar cell is not only beneficial to lower the cost of organometal halide perovskite solar cell but is also beneficial for understanding the interface properties between organometal halide perovskite solar cell and hole blocking layer. \nBy omitting the mesoporous TiO 2 , the planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell based on the TiO 2 blocking layer has attracted much research interest. In order to achieve a better device performance, the TiO 2 blocking layer should be smooth, dense, and pinhole-free. However, when the TiO 2 is thin, pinholes usually form and when the TiO 2 is thick, a large series resistance is introduced. Both of them will decrease the device performance. Herein, we report a solution-processed TiO 2 /PCBM double blocking layer to improve the device performance. It is also shown that the double blocking layer can improve the quality of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x perovskite thin films. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) photographs suggest that a dense and uniform TiO 2 /PCBM blocking layer is obtained. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra suggest that the introduction of the PCBM layer and the following annealing process does not influence the underlying TiO 2 . The as-fabricated planar heterojunction organometal halide perovskite solar cell has achieved a PCE of 16.37% with a V OC of 1.05\u2009V, a J SC of 21.96\u2009mA/cm 2 , and a FF of 0.71, which is greatly larger than the control device with a PCE of 10.81%. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials \nIf not otherwise stated, all the materials are used as received. The materials include MAI (99.8%, Dyesol), FK-102 Cobalt salt (99.8%, Dyesol), PbI 2 (99.999%, ultra dry, Alfa), PbCl 2 (99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich), dimethyl sulphoxide (99.8%, anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich), chlorobenzene (99.8%, anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich), Li-TFSI (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), Toluene (99.8%, anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich), \u03b3 -butyrolactone (99.8%, anhydrous, Aladdin), titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75\u2009wt. % in isopropanol, Sigma-Aldrich), and 1-butanol (99.8%,Sigma-Aldrich). 2.2. Device Fabrication \nFluorine doped tin oxide (FTO, Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co. Ltd., 14 ohm/sq) glass was cleaned via sequentially in 5% Decon-90 solution, deionized water, acetone, and ethanol under ultrasonication for 15\u2009min, respectively, and then treated with O 2 plasma for 15\u2009min. A compact TiO 2 layer on the FTO glass was prepared by spin coating a 0.15\u2009M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution in 1-butanol at 2000, 4000, and 6000\u2009rpm for 30\u2009s, respectively, dried at 125\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, and then repeated twice with 0.3\u2009M of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution, and finally, the as-prepared thin film was sintered at 500\u00b0C for 15\u2009min. After that, the resultant TiO 2 film was immersed into a 40\u2009mM TiCl 4 aqueous solution at 70\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, washed with deionized water, and then heated at 500\u00b0C for 15\u2009min. A 10\u2009mg/mL PCBM solution in chlorobenzene was spin coated onto the TiO 2 film at 2000, 4000, and 6000\u2009rpm for 45\u2009s, respectively, and the resulted thin films were annealed at 100\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. A CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x perovskite photoactive layer was deposited by dynamically spin coating a solution containing 0.14\u2009M (39\u2009mg) PbCl 2 , 1.26\u2009M (581\u2009mg) PbI 2 , and 1.3\u2009M (209\u2009mg) MAI in 1\u2009mL cosolvent of DMSO:GBL (3\u2009:\u20097 vol. ratio). It should be noted that the dynamically spin coating is used here so that the underlying PCBM can be avoided to be damaged when the perovskite precursor is deposited. The perovskite precursor solution was preheated at 80\u00b0C before spin coating. The spin coating was programmed to run at 1000\u2009rpm for 40\u2009s and then 4000\u2009rpm for 60\u2009s. At 20\u2009s after the start of spin coating process, 240\u2009 \u03bc L hot CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x solutions was injected onto the TiO 2 /PCBM blocking layer; at 60\u2009s after the start of spin coating process, 500\u2009 \u03bc L anhydrous toluene was injected onto the spinning film to quench it. The transparent as-cast films were subsequently annealed at 100\u00b0C for 12\u2009min. Then a spiro-MeOTAD solution containing 90\u2009mg spiro-MeOTAD, 1\u2009mL chlorobenzene, 45\u2009 \u03bc L LiTFSI/acetonitrile (170\u2009mg/mL) solution, 75\u2009 \u03bc L tris (2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tertbutylpyridine) cobalt(III) bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl) imide acetonitrile solution (100\u2009mg/mL), and 10\u2009 \u03bc L tBP was spin coated on the substrates. Finally, a 100\u2009nm Ag film was thermally evaporated as the anode. 2.3. Measurements \nThe morphology measurement of the perovskite layers were measured by SEM (Quanta x50 FEG) and AFM (Bruker Dimension Icon). XRD test was conducted on Bruker D8 advanced, and the samples were prepared as the same process of device fabrication. The UV-visible absorption spectra of TiO 2 , TiO 2 /PCBM, and CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x were recorded with UV-visible spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950) using the precleaned FTO glass as the blank signal. Photovoltaic performances were measured by using Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated sunlight from XES-70S1 solar simulator matching the AM 1.5G standard. The system was calibrated against a NREL-certified reference solar cell. All the measurements of the solar cells were performed with the active area of 0.07\u2009cm 2 under ambient atmosphere at room temperature without encapsulation. 3. Results and Discussion \nThe planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell in this study is structured as FTO/TiO 2 (with or without PCBM)/CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x /spiro-MeOTAD/Ag as shown in Figure 1 , where the TiO 2 and spiro-MeOTAD act as hole and electron blocking layers, respectively. Figure 2(a) shows the photocurrent-voltage (J-V) curves of TiO 2 hole blocking layer with different spin coating speed. Table 1 summarizes the device performance of these perovskite solar cells. When the TiO 2 spin coating speed is 2000\u2009rpm, the device achieves a PCE of 7.90% with J SC of 17.09\u2009mA/cm 2 , V OC of 0.81\u2009V, and FF of 0.57. In increasing the spin coating speed from 2000\u2009rpm to 4000\u2009rpm, the PCE increases from 7.90 to 10.81%. However, when the spin coating speed of TiO 2 is further increased to 6000\u2009rpm, a decrease in PCE along and a poor reproductivity are observed. Figure 1: (a) The device structure of the planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell. (b) The corresponding energy level diagram. The energy levels of FTO, TiO 2 , PCBM, perovskite, and spiro-MeOTAD were referenced from the previous report [ 22 , 23 ]. Figure 2: (a) Photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells prepared at different TiO 2 spin coating speed. (b) Photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells prepared at different PCBM spin coating speed (the TiO 2 spin coating speed was fixed at 4000\u2009rpm). (c) The device performance fabricated by the static coating method and the dynamic coating method. The TiO 2 spin coating speed was fixed at 4000\u2009rpm, and the PCBM spin coating speed was fixed at 6000\u2009rpm. Table 1: Photovoltaic performance of different blocking layer. \nBy increasing the spin coating speed of TiO 2 from 2000\u2009rpm to 4000\u2009rpm, the V OC increased from 0.81\u2009V to 0.98\u2009V with the J SC increased from 17.09\u2009mA/cm 2 to 19.07\u2009mA/cm 2 and the fill factor does not change much. This indicates that a thicker TiO 2 blocking layer caused a large series resistance and this series resistance leads to the V OC and J SC losses. While further increasing the spin coating speed does not improve the device performance, at a TiO 2 spin coating speed of 6000 rpm, the corresponding devices show a lower FF which may correspond to the increase of current leakage. It is worth to notice that optimizing the spin coating speed of TiO 2 does not yield a FF over 70% which can be easily obtained in a mesoporous n-i-p-structured perovskite solar cell. Here, PCBM is introduced to modify the TiO 2 layer and PCBM in this structure is expected to perform threefold functions: firstly, PCBM can reduce the energy mismatch between TiO 2 and the perovskite film and facilitate the electron transport from the perovskite film to the TiO 2 layer; secondly, PCBM can improve the compactness of the electron transporting layer and avoid the direct contact between perovskite film and the FTO electrode; thirdly, PCBM is expected to have a passivation effect in the devices, which has been proved by recent studies [ 19 , 20 ]. The photocurrent-voltage (J-V) curves with PCBM-modified TiO 2 layer are shown in Figure 2(b) . \nFrom Figure 2(b) , it could be seen that the insertion of PCBM is mainly in favor of the increase of FF and V OC . As it is known, the V OC of a solar cell corresponds to the splitting of quasi-fermi level and the insertion of PCBM could reduce the trap state density which can further increase the splitting [ 20 ]. Hence compared with TiO 2 only device, PCBM-modified device has reached a V OC of 1.05\u2009V and the FF enhancement may owe the suitable band structure of PCBM which may reduce the energy offset between perovskite and TiO 2 . With the help of PCBM layer, the device achieved a PCE of 16.37% with a J SC of 21.96\u2009mA/cm 2 , V OC of 1.05\u2009V, and FF of 0.71 when the PCBM spin coating speed is 6000\u2009rpm. When the PCBM layer is thick, the series resistance is large. Then with the increasing PCBM spin coating speed, the device PCE is improved. However, a too high PCBM spin coating speed will make it difficult to form a continuous and full coverage PCBM layer as shown in the formation of TiO 2 layer. In fact, a PCBM spin coating speed more than 6000\u2009rpm will lead to the decreased device performance and the 6000\u2009rpm for PCBM solution is optimal. \nIt should be noted that all the devices above are fabricated by the dynamic coating method when depositing the perovskite precursor on top of the underlying PCBM layer. It was found that the coating method could greatly affect the final device performance. Figure 1 shows the performance difference between the two devices fabricated by the different coating methods. For both the devices, the PCBM layer is formed by spin coating a 10\u2009mg/mL PCBM solution in chlorobenzene onto the TiO 2 film at 6000\u2009rpm for 45\u2009s. The difference between them is that one device is fabricated by coating the following perovskite precursor with the dynamic method (labeled as \u201cdynamic coating\u201d) and another one is fabricated by coating the following perovskite precursor with the static method (labeled as \u201cstatic coating\u201d). The corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 2 . For the device with the static coating method, it achieved a PCE of 12.3% with a J SC of 19.10\u2009mA/cm 2 , V OC of 1.04\u2009V, and FF of 0.62, which is greatly inferior to the device with the dynamic coating method. It could be clearly obtained that the dynamic coating method could greatly improve the device performance. We believe that the reason is that the dynamically spin coating could avoid the serious damage of the underlying PCBM when the perovskite precursor is deposited. The PCBM layer plays an important role to improve the device performance. Xing et al. [ 24 ] showed that there are high density hole-deficient traps located at the TiO 2 surface, which leads to an electron transfer potential barrier between CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 and TiO 2 . This potential barrier is absent between the perovskite layer and the PCBM layer, and then the PCBM layer has a faster charge extraction compared to TiO 2 [ 24 , 25 ]. In order to ensure the function of PCBM, the PCBM layer should be avoided from the damage when the perovskite precursor is deposited. This is why the device with the dynamic coating method has a better device performance. Table 2: Photovoltaic performance of different coating methods. \nIn order to achieve a good performance, the TiO 2 layer in the planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell should be compact and pinhole-free. If there are pinholes in the TiO 2 layer, it is possible that the perovskite film can direct contact with the FTO electrode, which will lead to severe recombination at the FTO and perovskite film interface and result in a low short-circuit current density ( J SC ) and a low open-circuit voltage ( V OC ). It is possible to achieve a pinhole-free TiO 2 layer by increasing the TiO 2 film thickness. However, a too thick TiO 2 blocking layer corresponds to a large series resistance and low fill factor as shown in the previous work [ 22 ]. To investigate the influence of spin coating speed on the morphology of TiO 2 thin film, SEM photographs were taken on TiO 2 thin films prepared at 2000, 4000, and 6000\u2009rpm, corresponding to Figures 3(a) \u2013 3(c) , respectively (the SEM photographs in large scale in Supplementary Figure S 1 ). Pinholes are observed on the TiO 2 thin film which is prepared at a spin coating speed of 6000\u2009rpm. And no pinholes are found on TiO 2 thin films at the spin coating speed of 2000 and 4000\u2009rpm. Figure 3: SEM photographs of TiO 2 thin films prepared at (a) 2000\u2009rpm, (b) 4000\u2009rpm, and (c) 6000\u2009rpm, respectively. And SEM photographs of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x on TiO 2 /PCBM thin films, with TiO2 prepared at 4000\u2009rpm and PCBM at (d) 2000\u2009rpm, (e) 4000\u2009rpm, and (f) 6000 rpm. \nFigures 4(a) \u2013 4(c) show the corresponding AFM images. The root mean square roughness (RMS) value of TiO 2 thin films prepared at 2000, 4000, and 6000\u2009rpm is 10.4\u2009nm, 13.2\u2009nm, and 18.4\u2009nm, respectively. It could be seen that the film roughness is improved with the increase of the spin coating speed. When there are no pinholes, the roughness increasing is small. However, when the pinholes appear, the roughness increasing is severe. Thus, when the TiO 2 thin film is prepared at a spin coating speed of 4000\u2009rpm, the film is pinhole-free and at the same time, the thickness is low and relative smooth. This TiO 2 thin film would be used for the following discussion. Figure 4: AFM photographs of TiO 2 thin films prepared at (a) 2000\u2009rpm, (b) 4000\u2009rpm, and (c) 6000\u2009rpm, respectively. The root mean square roughness (RMS) value of TiO 2 thin films prepared at 2000, 4000, and 6000\u2009rpm was 10.4\u2009nm, 13.2\u2009nm, and 18.4\u2009nm, respectively. AFM photograph of TiO2/PCBM thin films with TiO 2 prepared at 4000\u2009rpm and PCBM at (d) 2000\u2009rpm, (e) 4000\u2009rpm, and (f) 6000\u2009rpm, respectively. RMS roughness for (d) is 15.6\u2009nm, (e) is 15.3\u2009nm, and (f) is 16.0\u2009nm. AFM photographs of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x organometal halide perovskite material, with a constant spin coating speed of TiO 2 at 4000\u2009rpm and PCBM at (g) 2000\u2009rpm, (h) 4000\u2009rpm, and (i) 6000\u2009rpm, respectively. RMS roughness for (g) is 15.6\u2009nm, (h) is 13.8\u2009nm, and (i) is 12.2\u2009nm. \nBy introducing PCBM into the blocking layer, the blocking layer is improved which will be in favor for the electron extraction as the electrical measurements shown in Figure 2(b) . Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S 1 present the AFM and SEM photographs of PCBM/TiO 2 blocking layer, the spin coating speed of TiO 2 is fixed to 4000\u2009rpm, and the spin coating speed of PCBM varied from 2000\u2009rpm to 6000\u2009rpm at a 2000 interval. As the Supplementary Figure S 1 (d), (e), and (f) depicted, when PCBM was introduced, no pinholes are observed, and the spin coating speed could hardly affect the morphology of TiO 2 /PCBM thin films. As shown in the AFM photographs, the roughness of TiO 2 /PCBM thin films could be deduced. As Figures 4(d) \u2013 4(f) illustrated, the RMS value of TiO 2 /PCBM thin films prepared at 2000, 4000, and 6000\u2009rpm is almost the same and in the range from 15\u2009nm to 16\u2009nm. By increasing the spin coating speed, negligible variances in RMS values are observed. It is shown that the RMS values are mainly determined by the underlying TiO 2 layer. \nTo further investigate the morphology of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x organometal halide perovskite material deposited on TiO 2 /PCBM thin films, SEM and AFM photographs of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x are taken on TiO 2 /PCBM thin films, with TiO 2 spin coating speed fixed at 4000\u2009rpm and the PCBM spin coating speed varied from 2000\u2009rpm to 6000\u2009rpm at a 2000 interval. It could be found that dense and uniform CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x organometal halide perovskite thin film is obtained on the TiO 2 /PCBM thin film. SEM photographs in Figures 3(d) \u2013 3(f) (the SEM photographs in large scale in Supplementary Figure S 1 ) suggest that the grain sizes of the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x film are in a range of 450\u2013550\u2009nm, which is almost double the size of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x directly on the TiO 2 layer as shown in our previous work [ 22 ]. This is because that the PCBM layer is more hydrophobic than the TiO 2 layer, and a hydrophobic PCBM layer can help increase the perovskite crystal size [ 26 ]. This grain size value is slightly larger than the film thickness (about 300\u2009nm from the XRD measurement and also could be seen from the Figure 5 ), which implies that it is great possible that the carrier could pass the perovskite film without encountering any grain boundaries. The granular particle between CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x grain boundaries is PbI 2 as in the previous report [ 19 ], which might passivate CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x material. This result also coincidences with our following XRD analysis. Figures 4(g) \u2013 4(i) show the AFM photographs of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x organometal halide perovskite materials. With a constant spin coating speed of TiO 2 at 4000\u2009rpm, the spin coating speed and RMS roughness of PCBM are (Figure 4(g) ) 2000\u2009rpm with a 15.6\u2009nm RMS roughness, (Figure 4(h) ) 4000\u2009rpm with a 13.8\u2009nm RMS roughness, and (Figure 4(i) ) 6000\u2009rpm with a 12.2\u2009nm RMS roughness. It suggests that increasing the spin coating speed results in a decrease of RMS roughness. Figure 5: Cross-section image of the complete device with the structure of FTO/TiO 2 /PCBM/CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x /spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. The TiO 2 spin coating speed was fixed at 4000\u2009rpm, and the PCBM spin coating speed was fixed at 6000\u2009rpm. Because the PCBM layer is thin, the separate TiO 2 layer and the PCBM layer cannot be distinguished. This TiO 2 /PCBM bilayer is denoted as compact TiO 2 in this image. \nAfter the above discussion on morphology, X-ray diffraction measurement is carried out to investigate the crystallization of the thin films. As shown in Figure 6 , the peaks at 37.74\u00b0 and 51.50\u00b0 belongs to FTO and the peaks at 26.52\u00b0 and 36.71\u00b0 belongs to TiO 2 suggesting an anatase crystal structure. As shown in Supplementary Figure S 2 , the TiO 2 films prepared at 2000\u2009rpm, 4000\u2009rpm, and 6000\u2009rpm show the similar XRD spectra and this means that the spin coating speed does not change the underlying layer. By analyzing the XRD spectra of TiO 2 and TiO 2 /PCBM thin films, it is found that the introduction of PCBM at various spin coating speeds and the consequence annealing process does not influence the crystallization of TiO 2 and CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x as shown in Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure S 3 . For the TiO 2 /PCBM/CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x XRD spectra, the weak peak at 12.72\u00b0 corresponds to PbI 2 and this coincides with the SEM photograph. Different from the spectra of TiO 2 and TiO 2 /PCBM thin films, three strong peaks appeared at 14.17\u00b0, 28.51\u00b0, and 31.95\u00b0, which correspond to <110>, <220>, and <310> lattice planes of the tetragonal perovskite structure, respectively. Figure 6: XRD spectra of TiO 2 , TiO 2 /PCBM, and CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x . \nTo further illustrate the optical characteristics of TiO 2 /PCBM thin films, UV-vis spectra are carried out. Figure 7(a) depicts the UV-vis spectra of TiO 2 thin films, and Figure 7(b) depicts the UV-vis spectra TiO 2 /PCBM thin films. As it could be seen from Figure 7 , increasing the spin coating speed of TiO 2 leads to a decrease in transmittance. On the contrary, increasing the spin coating speed of PCBM leads to an increase in transmittance. The conflict lies in the morphology and optical absorption of TiO 2 and PCBM. As AFM photographs demonstrate, when spin coated at 6000\u2009rpm, pinholes are observed on TiO 2 surface along with an increase in RMS roughness. In agreement with our previous report [ 22 ], this roughness causes the scattering of incident light hence leads to the decrease in transmittance. While PCBM is a commonly used material in organic solar cell, a thicker PCBM layer absorbs more incident light, which leads to the decrease in transmittance. Figure 7: (a) UV-vis spectra of TiO 2 thin films with spin coating speed at 2000, 4000, and 6000\u2009rpm, respectively. (b) UV-vis spectra of TiO 2 /PCBM thin films with spin coating speed at 2000, 4000, and 6000\u2009rpm, respectively. \nThis decrease in PCE is attributed to the pinholes in TiO 2 prepared at 6000\u2009rpm spin coating speed that has been supported by the SEM photograph. In Figure S 4 , PL spectra of TiO 2 thin film have suggested a peak at 518.4\u2009nm corresponding to the thickness of TiO 2 thin film. Since our exciton wavelength is 515\u2009nm, which could not satisfy the excitation requirement of bulk TiO 2 , the peak corresponds to the surface trap of TiO 2 thin film which may greatly influence the photovoltaic performance of solar cells [ 27 , 28 ]. After spin coated a thin PCBM layer as shown in Figure 8 , the PL peak at 518.4\u2009nm could hardly be observed, which further proves the suggestion that the peak corresponds to the surface trap of TiO 2 thin film and the PCBM could passivate the traps. Figure 8: PL spectra of the TiO 2 films with/without the PCBM layer. 4. Conclusions \nHerein, a versatile TiO 2 /PCBM double blocking layer was introduced into the planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell. The PCBM layer has faster charge extraction compared to TiO 2 . At the same time, by employing PCBM, the TiO 2 thin film was efficiently passivated and the hydrophobic PCBM also yields a large grain size pinhole-free CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x thin film. Utilizing the as-prepared thin film, the planar heterojunction organometal halide perovskite solar cell has shown improved performance compared to the control device, achieving a PCE of 16.37%, a V OC of 1.05\u2009V, a J SC of 21.96\u2009mA/cm 2 , and an FF of 0.71.

tax bill hits interest deduction, PEs, transfer pricing New Zealand tax bill hits interest deduction, PEs, transfer pricing   \nWELLINGTON: A tax bill to counter tax avoidance by multinational companies was introduced into New Zealand\u2019s Parliament today. The government also released its commentary on the bill, prepared by Stuart Nash, New Zealand\u2019s Minister of Revenue. \nThe bill includes measures to prevent multinationals from using artificially high interest rates on loans from related parties to shift profits out of New Zealand.It also contains hybrid mismatch previsions to stop MNEs from exploiting differences between countries\u2019 tax rules to avoid tax. \nFurther, provisions applicable to groups with over EUR \u20ac750m of consolidated global turnover would prevent avoidance of permanent establishment rules.

The Board is composed of Governor Larry Hogan, Treasurer Nancy K. Kopp and Comptroller Peter Franchot. \n\u201cThese are smart investments to protect public health and prevent water pollution in Maryland communities and the Chesapeake Bay,\u201d said Maryland Environment Secretary Ben Grumbles. \u201cImproving a sewage treatment plant, reducing pollution from septic systems and upgrading a drinking water system will help us to green and grow the state\u2019s economy and lead in the race to protect and restore Chesapeake Bay watersheds.\u201d \nThe following projects were approved today: \n\nWilliamsport Phase II Water Improvements project \u2013 Washington County \nFunding of $1.5 million \u2013 a $750,000 grant in the form of forgiveness of a Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund loan to the Town of Williamsport, along with a second $750,000 Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund loan \u2013 will fund the Williamsport Phase II Water Improvements project. The project includes replacement of portions of the water main, water meters, fire hydrants and valves. The water lines are subject to repeated breakages. The project will help prevent severe drops in water pressure, improve meter readings and avoid water loss. \n\nUpgrade Septic Systems \u2013 Statewide \nGrants from the Bay Restoration Fund totaling $1.095 million will provide funding for counties to upgrade on-site sewage disposal (septic) systems to significantly reduce the discharge of nitrogen, one of the most serious pollutants in the Chesapeake Bay. Counties will focus on upgrading septic systems located within the critical area. Sixteen Maryland counties will benefit from this round of grants. \n\nDenton Wastewater Treatment Plant Enhanced Nutrient Removal Refinement project \u2013Caroline County \nA $57,294 Bay Restoration Fund grant to the Town of Denton will help fund the planning, design and construction of improvements to the 800,000 gallons-per-day Denton Wastewater Treatment Plant, which is an Enhanced Nutrient Removal (ENR) facility.

Lawyers - Mueller - Team - Democrats - Obama \u201cAt least eight of the 16 lawyers that Mueller appointed to his team donated to Democrats like Obama and Clinton, including thousands of dollars to these campaigns. Not a single attorney Mueller appointed or hired donated to the Trump campaign or any other Republican presidential campaign,\u201d Mr. Hannity said.\u201cAll told, Mueller\u2019s corrupt band of Clinton lovers, they\u2019ve...

You can either give someone else access to your computer to get remote assistance, or connect to someone else\u2019s computer. They will have to set up remote access and give you a PIN, just like the way it works now. \nThe official Help Center article for remote access is yet to be updated.

Remote Access on Chromebooks \nBased on these screenshots, you will be able to use this service on phones and tablets as well. I am yet to test this. You should be able to use this on Chromebooks too. Chrome Remote Desktop already works on Chromebooks.

Abstract \nTo optimize delivery of health care services in clinical practice, the use of unnecessary interventions should be reduced. Although recommendations for this reduction have been accepted worldwide, recent studies have revealed that the use of such procedures continues to increase. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a nationwide claim-based database to evaluate factors influencing preoperative blood testing prior to low-risk surgery, via a Bayesian generalized linear mixed approach. The study period was set from April 1, 2012, to March 31, 2016, and 69,252 surgeries performed at 9,922 institutions were included in the analysis. Mean patient age was 44.3 \u00b1 11.3 years (57% female). Preoperative blood tests were performed for 59.0% of procedures. Among institutional factors, the number of beds was strongly associated with preoperative blood testing (odds ratio [95% highest posterior density interval (HPD interval)], 2.64 [2.53 to 2.75]). The difference (95% credible interval) in the rate of preoperative blood testing between institutions with <100 beds and \u2265100 beds was 0.315 [0.309 to 0.322], and the Bayesian index was 1.00. This indicated that preoperative blood tests are strongly influenced by institutional factors, suggesting that specific guidelines should be developed to avoid excessive preoperative testing for low-risk surgery. 1. Introduction \nTo optimize the delivery of health care services in clinical practice, the use of unnecessary and/or non-evidence-based tests, treatments, and procedures should be reduced [ 1 , 2 ]. In addition to incurring unnecessary costs, previous studies have revealed that routine preoperative tests neither decrease adverse events nor improve surgical outcomes [ 3 \u2013 6 ]. In 2012, the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation (ABIMF) launched the Choosing Wisely campaign, which encourages physicians and patients to communicate regarding the most appropriate tests and treatments for each patient [ 1 , 7 ]. Since then, various countries including Japan have adopted similar campaigns [ 7 , 8 ], and many specialty societies have recommended that routine preoperative testing be avoided for patients undergoing low-risk surgery [ 9 \u2013 11 ]. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK also discourages excessive preoperative testing unless such testing yields clinical information that cannot be obtained from a patient\u2019s history and physical examination [ 12 ]. \nAlthough these campaigns and recommendations have been accepted worldwide, recent studies have revealed that the use of unnecessary tests continues to increase [ 13 ]. Previous studies have conceptualized the problem using worldwide system-level metrics to examine factors influencing the real-world situation in each country. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using a nationwide claim-based database to evaluate factors influencing the use of preoperative blood tests prior to low-risk surgery. Specifically, we evaluated the fixed effects of the Bayesian generalized linear mixed model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods when examining the influence of institutional factors [ 14 ]. We also performed Bayesian conjugate analysis to compare the rate of preoperative blood testing among groups, allowing us to calculate the Bayesian index , which can be used to determine the probability that the hypothesis is true and the credible intervals (CrIs) contain the true parameter [ 15 ]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Overview \nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using an insurance claim-based database covering approximately five million insured individuals in Japan since 2005. Individuals who had undergone low-risk surgery were included in the analysis. Factors influencing the use of preoperative blood tests were explored, following which institutions were divided into two groups based on the number of beds. The differences between the two groups and the probability of hypothesis truth were then evaluated. 2.2. Study Population \nThe insurance claim-based database was provided by the Japan Medical Data Center Co., Ltd. (JMDC; Tokyo, Japan), and the study period was set from April 1, 2012, to March 31, 2016. The database included the following information: sex, age, medical and pharmacy claim data (outpatient as well as inpatient data), clinical diagnostic codes (International Classification of Disease 10th revision [ICD-10]), drug prescription information codes (World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification codes [ATC codes]), and standardized procedure codes (Japan-specific standardized procedure codes [K codes]). \nLow-risk surgery was defined according to K codes for ophthalmologic, superficial, breast, thyroid, minor gynecological, orthopedic [arthroscopy], and minor urological procedures, based on the findings of previous studies [ 9 , 16 ]. Patients aged 20\u201364 years with at least 12 months of insurance data prior to undergoing low-risk surgery during the study period were included. Individuals without any required clinical data and those who had undergone low-risk procedures in an inpatient setting in conjunction with additional/emergency procedures were excluded. 2.3. Outcomes \nThe primary outcome measure of the present study was the presence or absence of preoperative blood tests prior to low-risk surgery. We used a Bayesian generalized linear mixed approach to estimate the coefficients of each variable (patient variables and institutional factors) for preoperative blood tests. Preoperative tests were defined as those ordered within 60 days of the index procedure [ 17 ] and included the following: complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel, coagulation tests, and liver function tests (LFTs). In Japan, health insurance coverage of these preoperative tests does not differ based on the patient\u2019s health insurance status. Institutional differences in preoperative testing rates were regarded as the secondary outcome measure. 2.4. Statistical Analysis \nContinuous variables are summarized as mean and standard deviations (SD), while categorical variables are summarized as frequencies and proportions (%). \nIn the present study, we evaluated differences in preoperative testing among institutions using a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model [ 14 , 18 ]. Institutions were regarded as random effects, and the model contained two levels of hierarchical structure. \nIn this model, th institution had undergone preoperative blood testing. Thus, represents the Bernoulli distribution of parameter . The rate represents the rate of preoperative blood testing at each institution. We assumed that the random effect had a mean of 0 and a normal distribution for variance . The hyperparameter was assumed to follow a gamma distribution, which does not take negative values, as it represents the variance. The shape and scale parameters of the gamma distribution were each set to 0.001, assuming a fixed effect with a mean of 0 and a normally distributed variance of 10,000. Using these parameters, the model can be expressed as follows: where represents the fixed-effect parameter and represents the th individual in the th institution. All patient variables (age [reference: <25 years], sex [reference: male], Charlson comorbidity index [CCI; reference: 0-1], antiplatelet use [reference: nonuse], anticoagulant use [reference: nonuse], angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-receptor blocker use [reference: nonuse], diuretic use [reference: nonuse], chemotherapy [reference: nonchemotherapy], type of anesthesia [reference: local anesthesia], ophthalmologic procedure [reference: nonophthalmologic procedure], and surgical setting [reference: inpatient setting]) and institutional factors (number of beds [reference: <100], hospital status [reference: nonteaching hospital], and number of operations [reference: Q1 ]) were included as predictors in the Bayesian generalized linear mixed model. We used the aforementioned expression to calculate the posterior mean and the standard error of each parameter as well as the 95% highest posterior density (95% HPD) interval. We calculated the posterior distribution using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods by applying the Metropolis-Hastings method to the calculation algorithm. A total of 20,000 samples were calculated, and the first 500 samples were discarded as burn-in. We used graphical plots to interpret the convergence of the MCMC results [ 19 ]. The posterior mean of each parameter was used as the model coefficient, and these values were expressed as odds ratios ( = odds ratio). \nWe calculated the number of preoperative blood tests and compared the rate of testing between institutions with <100 beds and \u2265100 beds. We calculated the 95% credible interval (CrI) of the difference in the rate of preoperative blood testing using an exact method. We then compared rates of preoperative blood testing between the two institution groups using the Bayesian index proposed by Kawasaki and Miyaoka [ 15 ]. The threshold of 100 beds has previously been used as an institutional criterion for categorizing general hospitals in Japan, and a recent survey in Japan has also demonstrated the medical relevance of this threshold [ 20 ]. Therefore, we chose to use a threshold of 100 beds. \nIn the present study, we set as the number of preoperative blood tests at institutions with <100 beds and as that for institutions with \u2265100 beds. We regarded and as binomial random variables for preoperative blood tests and preoperative blood tests and parameters and , respectively. The conjugate prior density for is the beta distribution with parameters and . The prior distribution was regarded as noninformative and defined as beta . The posterior pdf for is the proposed beta distribution with parameters and . Using the posterior pdf, we calculated the exact Bayesian index . The accurate expression of probability for Bayesian index is proposed as follows: , represent hypergeometric series and is the Pochhammer symbol. \nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). When performing the analysis using the Bayesian generalized linear mixed model, we used the MCMC procedure of SAS. A general SAS code for this analysis is included in Appendix 2 . 2.5. Ethical Considerations \nThe present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kyoto University Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine (number R0800, September 8, 2016). This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects in Japan [ 21 , 22 ]. Additional informed consent was not required based on these guidelines. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) criteria were applied in the reporting of the present study [ 23 ]. 3. Results 3.1. Clinical Characteristics of Participants \nThe flow diagram for the present study is shown in Figure 1 , and patient characteristics are presented in Table 1 . Table 1: Patient characteristics. Figure 1: Study flow diagram. \nDuring the study period, 3,543,575 individuals from 65,371 institutions were included in the JMDC database. Among them, 70,244 individuals had undergone a total of 87,858 low-risk surgical procedures. Following the exclusion of 18,606 cases that met exclusion criteria, 69,252 surgeries performed at 9,922 institutions were included in the final analysis. Mean age (SD) in this cohort was 44.3 years (11.3 years), and 57.0% of patients were female. Local anesthesia was most frequently performed. Inpatient procedures accounted for 31.0% of surgical cases, and 40.6% of institutions had \u2265100 beds. 3.2. Rate of Preoperative Blood Testing and Bayesian Generalized Linear Mixed Approach \nPreoperative blood tests were performed for 59.0% of procedures. The prevalence of each preoperative blood test was as follows: CBC, 57.8%; basic metabolic panel, 49.6%; LFTs, 48.0%; coagulation test, 35.6%. The odds ratio of each variable (patient variables and institutional factors) with 95% HPD intervals for preoperative blood testing is presented in Table 2 . Among patient variables, general anesthesia (5.42 [4.85 to 6.03]), anticoagulant use (3.57 [2.22 to 5.61]), and regional anesthesia (3.14 [2.89 to 3.44]) were relatively associated with preoperative blood testing. Among institutional factors, the number of beds within an institution was strongly associated with preoperative blood testing (odds ratio [95% HPD interval], 2.64 [2.53 to 2.75]). The graphical plots used to interpret the convergence of the MCMC results are included in Appendix 1 . Table 2: Odds ratio for patient and institutional factors. 3.3. Differences in Preoperative Blood Testing and Bayesian Index \nThe posterior beta distribution parameters were and for institutions with \u2265100 beds and and for institutions with <100 beds. The difference [95% CrI] in the rate of preoperative blood testing between institutions with <100 beds and \u2265100 beds was 0.315 [0.309 to 0.322], and the Bayesian index was 1.00 (Table 3 ). These findings indicate a point estimate of a 31.5% difference in preoperative blood testing, with a true difference between 30.9% and 32.2%. Based on the value of the Bayesian index , this difference can be observed as 100%. Table 3: Differences in the rate of preoperative blood testing based on institution size. 4. Discussion \nThe present study aimed to evaluate factors influencing preoperative blood testing prior to low-risk surgery among individuals in a nationwide claim-based database using Bayesian approaches. Our results indicated that the rate of preoperative blood testing is strongly influenced by institutional factors, such as institution size. Furthermore, our results suggested that patient factors were also associated with preoperative blood tests. However, the influence of institutional factors remained after adjusting for these variables, indicating that modification of practices at the institutional level is necessary to reduce unnecessary preoperative blood testing. \nIn this study, we utilized a nationwide claim-based database covering 4.7 million insured individuals treated at more than 9,000 institutions in Japan [ 24 ], suggesting that our results may be highly generalizable. As we adopted a Bayesian approach with the institutions set as random effects, our results regarding the dispersion of this parameter can also be extrapolated to real-world settings. Our Bayesian generalized linear mixed model approach indicated that the adjusted odds ratio for institutions with \u2265100 beds was >2.5 and that the number of beds was the most influential of the institutional factors investigated. The convergence of the MCMC results is slightly challenging because of strong autocorrelation. Thinning, or other such techniques (e.g., extension of the chain) with at least two or three parallel chains per parameter, can improve the accuracy of the analysis [ 25 ]. However, these results were consistent with those of an additional univariate model analysis (OR [95% HPD interval], 4.06 [3.93 to 4.21]), highlighting the robustness of our finding (univariate model analysis for other predictors are included in Appendix 3 ). Furthermore, a Bayesian association analysis among predictors which was not planned for our current study may be able to improve the impact of our analysis [ 26 , 27 ]. \nThe 95% CrI for differences between institutions with <100 beds and \u2265100 beds was very narrow (approximately 1%). The use of Bayesian approaches for the calculation of the CrI is advantageous in that the true parameter is contained within the interval [ 28 , 29 ]. Thus, our findings strongly suggest that institutional factors influence that rate of preoperative blood testing, consistent with the findings of previous Canadian studies [ 9 , 17 ]. Institutions with a large number of beds frequently performed preoperative blood tests, which may have been due to the following reasons: (1) institutions with a large number of beds have enough resources to perform routine laboratory tests regardless of patient status and (2) such testing may be routine at larger institutions. Our findings suggest that clear guidelines for preoperative blood testing are required to avoid unnecessary laboratory tests. \nThe present study possesses several limitations of note. The main limitation of this study was the use of a database with limited information, as the database did not include information regarding symptoms or physical examination results. In addition, the number of operations could be only analyzed as quantile-categories. Therefore, we were unable to strictly evaluate the suitability of preoperative blood tests for each patient in the present study. In addition, the database contained information from a limited population of participants. Because the database contained only insurance claim-based data accumulated from medium-to-large scale companies in Japan, it only included data for employees under the age of 75 and their families. Therefore, we were unable to examine the influence of patient age on preoperative blood testing. Indeed, previous studies have reported that advanced age is a risk factor for perioperative events and complications, even in low-risk surgeries [ 30 ]. Additional investigations involving older adults are thus required to more fully elucidate the influence of patient-based and/or institutional-based factors on the rate of preoperative blood testing. 5. Conclusion \nIn conclusion, our findings indicate that preoperative blood testing prior to low-risk surgery is influenced by institutional factors, such as institution size, suggesting that Bayesian approaches can be used to develop guidelines aimed at reducing excessive preoperative testing. Future studies should investigate the influence of additional patient characteristics (e.g., age) in a more varied population in order to establish the most appropriate guidelines.

Apparently, James Earl Jones had been originally approached to perform the role in Jonathan Miller\u2019s 1981 production, but Equity insisted that all roles in this BBC Shakespeare series be performed by British actors. Shamefully, it was determined that there were no black actors in Britain in 1981 with sufficient stature to play the role \u2013 and so it was given to Anthony Hopkins.\nIn his own defense, Jonathan Miller was able to reference the fact that there is legitimate disagreement regarding the scope of meanings that the word \u201cmoor\u201d could accommodate in the early modern period. An English audience in the first decade of the seventeenth-century might use the word to describe someone from sub-Saharan Africa or someone from the near east. There were no rigid nineteenth-century pseudo-scientific racial categories to refer to -and instead there was a promiscuous collection of broadly phobic adjectives attached to different degrees of \u201cdarkness\u201d.\nAnd so Anthony Hopkins becomes a bit darker \u2013 without \u201cblacking up\u201d like Larry Olivier\u2019s notorious 1960s Othello. But is he meant to be representing someone from the Arabian peninsula? Or North Africa? Or further east\u2026 ?\nIt seems not.\nFor Anthony Hopkins looks like the thing that he surely is \u2013 a Welshman who has overslept in a tanning salon. There are pasty faced families from Swansea who have spent two weeks in Cyprus and come home darker than Anthony Hopkins\u2019 Othello. Tom Jones on stage in Vegas looks darker than Anthony Hopkins in Othello . And our sense of Othello being in any sense racially \u201cdifferent\u201d from his Venetian companions is communicated less by his vaguely swarthy appearance than his own rich Welsh accent, an accent shared by nobody else on stage.\nIn other words, this is not a \u201cblackface\u201d performance, because it\u2019s not clear that Hopkins is trying to impersonate any \u201crace\u201d other than his own.\nHopkins\u2019 own Welsh accent serves Othello\u2019s most poetic speeches very well. This performance evokes a sense of the Stratford man interbreeding with Dylan Thomas. Hopkins lingers over certain words and phrases in quite original ways that revivify some of the more stale and oft quoted fragments of verse. And so, far from attempting a racial impersonation, Hopkins uses Othello as an opportunity to come home as an actor.\nHowever, I think a larger opportunity was lost here. The play could have been mounted without shoving Hopkins under a sun lamp at all but by replacing every instance of the word \u201cblack\u201d with the word \u201cWelsh\u201d. Let Hopkins\u2019 play himself and let the self that he plays illustrate the bigotry that poisons the unequal relations between the nations of North West Europe. He\u2019s a Welshman that the Anglos find useful, but who will be made to feel foreign as soon as he outlives is usefulness.\nAs Othello descends into madness, his appearance becomes more ludicrous \u2013 his hair madder. And this is fine. Sexual jealousy is, after all, a state bereft of any dignity \u2013 a condition that is all the more agonising for being absurd. Hopkins is never too proud or too stuffy to smudge the utter degradation that Othello undergoes. The play is, after all, all the more tragic for being \u2013 simultaneously \u2013 a bedroom farce.\nMeanwhile, it is an observation trite but true to declare that everything is better with Bob Hoskins in it. I saw this production when it was first broadcast and it was Hoskins not Hopkins who lodged in my memory, though Hoskins and Hopkins play well off each other. (They share some great scenes in Oliver Stone\u2019s Nixon where Hoskins is a Iagoish J .Edgar Hoover to Hopins\u2019 fragile and tragic Nixon.) Hoskins\u2019 Iago is funny and engaging and projects a superficial yet compelling innocence. The skill with which this Iago \u201cforces\u201d Othello to extort Iago\u2019s suspicions from him is largely a consequence of a kind of naive charisma, dare I say \u201ccuteness\u201d that Hoskins discovers and exploits in the role. And when Hoskins\u2019 exclaims \u201cI hate the moor\u201d when completely alone, the intensity of this emotion is both obtrusive and completely convincing.\nPenelope Wilton\u2019s Desdemona seems very very English and prim, which may represent an attempt to illustrate quite how strange mixed-race (Anglo-Welsh) marriages appear within a casually phobic imagination. If her Desdemona is eclipsed by Rosemary Leach\u2019s spirited Emilia, then this eclipse reflects every single production of Othello I\u2019ve ever seen. Emilia is, quite simply, a much better role than Desdemona.\nJohn Barron (forever frozen in the collective consciousness of a generation as \u201cCJ\u201d from The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin ) plays the Duke of Venice \u2013 a Doge who didn\u2019t get where he is today without knowing how to patronise talented Welshmen in an absolute emergency.\nAlso look out for Tony Steedman as Montano whom you\u2019ll struggle to place for a while before triumphantly remembering that he played So-Crates in Bill and Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventure . Joseph O\u2019Conor is awkwardly cast as Lodovico, despite being of an age which makes nonsense of many of the references to him made by other characters.\nThere are some nicely innovative bits of filmed staging. Desdemona\u2019s final dying words to Emilia are seen in a mirror while the camera focuses on Othello standing aghast and staring at the bed. Earlier in the play, a dialogue between Iago and Cassio regarding Bianca is almost inaudible to the audience, reflecting Othello\u2019s own inability to gather the exchange with any accuracy. Costumes are fairly austere, in defiance of the vague but prevalent assumption that Venetians are supposed to be colourful bunch.\nThe play ends with Bob Hoskins\u2019 maniacal laughter as he is dragged away. Whatever punishment is inflicted upon this Iago, he clearly thinks it was all worth while.\nI\u2019ve some thoughts about some of the other 1978-1985 BBC Shakespeares\u2026.\nLike Measure for Measure:\nhttps://conradbrunstrom.wordpress.com/2017/11/21/what-are-you-laughing-at-the-1978-bbc-measure-for-measure/ \nHenry VIII\nhttps://conradbrunstrom.wordpress.com/2017/10/20/its-not-really-about-henry-the-1979-bbc-henry-viii/ \n \nLove\u2019s Labours Lost:\nhttps://conradbrunstrom.wordpress.com/2017/10/15/holofernes-goodman-dull-thou-hast-spoken-no-word-all-this-while-dull-nor-understood-none-neither-sir-the-1985-bbc-loves-labours-lost/ \nRomeo and Juliet:\nhttps://conradbrunstrom.wordpress.com/2017/10/05/well-susan-is-with-god-the-1978-bbc-romeo-and-juliet/ \nThe Scottish One:\nhttps://conradbrunstrom.wordpress.com/2017/09/27/the-1983-bbc-scottish-play-much-thats-wrong-much-thats-interesting/ \nMuch Ado About Nothing:\nhttps://conradbrunstrom.wordpress.com/2017/09/19/hello-darkness-my-old-friend-the-1984-bbc-much-ado-about-nothing-also-the-origins-of-dads-army/ \nKing Lear:\nhttps://conradbrunstrom.wordpress.com/2017/08/31/bring-your-daughter-to-the-slaughter-the-1982-bbc-king-lear/ \nHere is Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream:\nhttps://conradbrunstrom.wordpress.com/2017/08/17/the-drugs-do-work-the-1981-bbc-a-midsummer-nights-dream/ \nHere\u2019s Julius Caesar:\nhttps://conradbrunstrom.wordpress.com/2017/06/29/unkind-cuts-richard-pasco-the-1979-bbc-shakespeare-version-of-julius-caesar/ \nKing John:\nhttps://conradbrunstrom.wordpress.com/2017/06/18/come-hither-hubert-the-1984-bbc-production-of-king-john/ \nHere\u2019s Richard II:\nhttps://conradbrunstrom.wordpress.com/2017/06/15/telling-sad-stories-of-the-death-of-kings-the-1978-bbc-richard-ii/ \nThe BBC Richard III could not be more unlike the BBC Richard II\u2026\nhttps://conradbrunstrom.wordpress.com/2017/06/02/all-this-and-no-horses-either-the-1980s-bbc-richard-iii/ \nHere is Henry VI Part III\nhttps://conradbrunstrom.wordpress.com/2017/05/20/it-just-gets-worse-or-better-the-1980s-bbc-henry-vi-part-iii/ \nHenry VI.

Dezember 2017 - Unter dem Motto \"30 Jahre Freude schenken\" beging Toys\"R\"Us in Deutschland seinen diesj\u00e4hrigen runden Geburtstag. In \u00d6sterreich und der Schweiz feierte der Spielwarenh\u00e4ndler 2017 sein bereits 25-j\u00e4hriges Bestehen. Im Zentrum der Feierlichkeiten stand das tierische Maskottchen des amerikanischen Unternehmens: Giraffe \"Geoffrey\". Diese lud Gro\u00df wie Klein im rheinl\u00e4ndischen K\u00f6ln - dem Hauptsitz von Toys\"R\"Us in Zentraleuropa - von Ende August bis Anfang Oktober zur \"Gro\u00dfstadtsafari\" ein. Insgesamt 30 lebensgro\u00dfe und von Prominenten gestaltete Figuren von Geoffrey und seinen Freunden galt es, im Stadtgebiet zu suchen. Wer einen gemeinsamen Schnappschuss mit einer oder auch mehreren der Giraffen postete, hatte die Chance auf zahlreiche Aktionsgewinne wie beispielsweise eine Toys\"R\"Us Spielzeug-Jahresflatrate. \"\u00dcber die Resonanz der Teilnehmer unserer Gro\u00dfstadtsafari haben wir uns sehr gefreut. Unz\u00e4hlige Selfies mit unserem Maskottchen haben uns erreicht, was nicht nur f\u00fcr unser Team bei Toys\"R\"Us, sondern auch f\u00fcr alle beteiligten Giraffen-Designer, Produzenten, Organisatoren und Helfer ein toller Erfolg war\", berichtet Marie-Charlotte von Heyking, PR-Managerin bei Toys\"R\"Us Zentraleuropa. \"Mit dieser positiven Stimmung feierten wir dann auch am 7. Oktober in \u00fcber 80 M\u00e4rkten in Deutschland, \u00d6sterreich und der Schweiz mit unseren Kunden die \"Geburtstagssafari\". Kinder, Familien und Spielwarenfans konnten bei diesem Event noch einmal ins Safari-Feeling eintauchen und an mehreren Spielstationen in den M\u00e4rkten spielen, experimentieren und mit uns und unseren Mitarbeitern Geburtstag feiern.\" Freude zu schenken ist f\u00fcr Toys\"R\"Us nicht nur die Kernidee des Jubil\u00e4umsjahres und der Antrieb der Gesch\u00e4ftst\u00e4tigkeit, sondern auch ein fester Bestandteil der Unternehmensphilosophie. Ganz in diesem Sinn versteigerte der Spielwarenh\u00e4ndler alle Figuren der Gro\u00dfstadtsafari f\u00fcr den guten Zweck. Die Erl\u00f6se rundete Toys\"R\"Us nochmals auf und \u00fcbergab sie zusammen mit den Einnahmen aller vom 13. Oktober bis 23. November 2017 in Deutschland und \u00d6sterreich verkauften Pl\u00fcsch-Giraffen \"Geoffrey\" an die Stiftung RTL - Wir helfen Kindern e.V. Insgesamt konnten f\u00fcr den Spendenmarathon des TV-Senders so 71.600 Euro zugunsten der zahlreichen Kinderhilfsprojekte gespendet werden.\"Mit unseren Jubil\u00e4umsaktionen rund um Giraffe Geoffrey und die Geburtstagssafari konnten wir \u00fcber 24 Millionen Menschen erreichen, was uns sehr bewegt hat\", berichtet Susanne Moormann, Marketing & E-Commerce Director bei Toys\"R\"Us Zentraleuropa. \"Nur durch die vernetzte und gemeinschaftliche Projektarbeit und die Mithilfe so vieler engagierter Menschen ist unser diesj\u00e4hriges Jubil\u00e4umsjahr zu einem ganz besonderen geworden.

This was also when the term \u2018Three-Dimensional Printing\u2019 was trademarked. It is a process that creates final products, spare parts or prototypes with the help of inkjet printing into a raw material powder bed. Binder jetting uses two materials \u2013 a powder material and a binder. The binder is usually a liquid while the building material is a powder. At each layer, the binder droplets fuse raw material particulates and create a cross-section 2D image made of powder-binder granules. Binder jetting uses fast and cheap technology and works with a wide array of materials like metal, sandstone and ceramic. Even full-colour 3D printing is possible now. The binder jetting market has maximum relevance in interior design and furniture manufacturing. It can also be used for making various types of industrial parts. The binder jetting market uses versatile technology that can be utilised in almost any application. Request for Report Sample @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/19687 Binder Jetting Market Drivers There are several drivers for the growth of the binder jetting market. Even though there are various forms of 3D printing in existence, binder jetting is widely considered to the best form. A critical advantage is that it does not employ heat in the manufacturing process. Other additive techniques use a heat source which can create some residual stress in the parts. These must then be dealt with in another secondary post-processing operation. Binder jetting can have great application in the construction and interior designing industry. It can be used to print very large objects and architectural objects even occupying an entire room have been created with this technology. The binder jetting market is relevant in areas as diverse as shop fitting, exhibitions and furniture development. A second driver is a gradual move towards eco-friendly methods of production and consumer products in order to reduce one\u2019s carbon footprint. A few companies have begun to make scalable and ecological materials to be used in binder jetting 3D printers that are recyclable, sustainable and perfect for the modern interior design. Request for Report TOC @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/19687 Binder Jetting Market Restraints Cost is a very large constraint in the binder jetting market. These machines are much more expensive than regular 3D printers with prices in the range of $50,000 to $2 million for high-grade enterprise machines. This makes it a very difficult investment for fledgling start-ups. The second challenge is the structural weakness due to the use of binder material. Binder jetting does not have too many materials to work with at present and it creates microscopic air pockets in parts, which can cause structural concerns in fields like furniture or interior design. The third restraint in the binder jetting market is the time required due to additional post-processing. Binder jetting uses a variety of materials like metal, sands and different ceramics. Some like sand do not require any additional processing but the rest are cured, sintered and infiltrated with other materials, depending on the requirement. This can be an issue in industries which serve customers with fickle tastes and require companies to be fast movers or followers. Binder Jetting Market Key Regions The main regions served by the binder jetting market are the U.S, European Union and Asia Pacific in that order. The U.S is the largest market at present and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. 3D printing finds the application there in industries like aerospace, defence, automobile, retail and construction which have all begun to use robotic parts and prototypes to maximise functional integration while also driving down manufacturing costs.

The tariff free quota had already been exceeded in October.December the quota-free amount of 150 million liters quarter restarts from zero. \nEstimates from Kingsman, the agricultural analysis unit of S&P Global Platts, is that through the end of the year a total of just over 1.8 billion liters will be imported by Brazil in 2017.For next year Kingsman expects the flow of imports to continue as Brazil is estimated to remain in an ethanol deficit 2017-12-07", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kingsman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "home / international customs / brazil / brazil nov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p global platts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center-south", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "itaqui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northeast", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:52.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1340e51e5f892eb28ddf37cfd4c6efb5027acd18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ6m5_DJ5Wv6RdXp9Qi0xfHiKw0L.4vQqDpuU6KK_G12Gvw9O70HvWrugznw7HUKwsTYQ7NNpdallENQ0gb3Ab6KTr0gUTHVyMGvSVpyxJ8qW9SmIbP.y8Ox0BASqqDgQy96V2fKECraQ--", "site_full": "www.longroom.com", "site": "longroom.com", "site_section": "https://longroom.com/discussions/feed.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Long Room", "title": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thanks President Donald Trump\u2026", "title_full": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thanks President Donald Trump\u2026", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/NkHehbRHPQI/0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1340e51e5f892eb28ddf37cfd4c6efb5027acd18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ6m5_DJ5Wv6RdXp9Qi0xfHiKw0L.4vQqDpuU6KK_G12Gvw9O70HvWrugznw7HUKwsTYQ7NNpdallENQ0gb3Ab6KTr0gUTHVyMGvSVpyxJ8qW9SmIbP.y8Ox0BASqqDgQy96V2fKECraQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "hey13", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thanks President Donald Trump\u2026", "text": "\u2014 TRUMP News 24/7 (@MichaelDelauzon) December 6, 2017 Responding to the historic announcement that U.S. President Donald J Trump has officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of the nation state of Israel, Prime...

Abstract \nIn the new context of Next Generation Networks, Aerial Ad Hoc Networks, also known as FANET (Flying Ad Hoc Network), are being used to monitor areas of difficult access. Owing to the dynamism and autoconfiguration of this type of network, a strategy is needed to position its devices (drones) to ensure it can achieve good performance. In light of this, this paper proposes a flight path planning model, which involves a metaheuristic optimization-based approach. The proposal relied on the artificial neural networks to optimize the positioning of the relay device, so that the throughput between the other devices could be increased; the benefits of the proposal were demonstrated through simulations. 1. Introduction \nIn recent years, as a result of technological advances in areas such as robotics, telecommunications, and computer networks, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as an alternative means of providing diverse applications in both civilian and military areas. These UAVs aim to improve or create a network infrastructure in places that are difficult to access, such as areas of natural disasters or enemy territory. In this area, an Air Ad Hoc Network has emerged as an acceptable solution since it enables information to be collected in a more flexible, fast, and reliable way [ 1 ]. \nIn [ 2 ], the authors state that the main challenge of FANET is to perform cooperative detection using multiple UAVs to cover an area that cannot be covered by a single UAV. In this way, it can create an overhead network in which its devices (drones) communicate by transmitting information to each other. Thus, it is necessary to have reliable and stable communication between the devices to maintain good levels of QoS (Quality of Service) and QoE (Quality of Experience). \nIn most FANET applications, the objective is to collect data from the environment and relay them to a ground base station. The topology of a FANET network consists of several UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and a UAV relay, which is responsible for receiving information from the other UAVs and transmitting it to a base station on the ground. Establishing the position of the UAV relay in relation to the other UAVs is of paramount importance to ensure the satisfactory performance of the network since it must be accessible directly or indirectly (i.e., communication via intermediary devices) to all the other elements of the network. This has led to an increase in the number of studies on UAV relay positioning in the academic community. \nThis paper proposes a model that can establish the best real time positioning of a UAV relay among multiple UAVs used for flight missions in scenarios such as those shown in Figure 1 . The objective is to fly the drone in real time to its optimal placement based on a knowledge of the position required for flight missions or the location of the optimal placement. Thus, the proposal aims to conduct the relay in real time to an \u201cideal\u201d location (where a good level of communication can be maintained with all the other devices). This positioning will be determined by the location of the other multiple UAVs of the network and the proposal outlined in this article will calculate/optimize the new UAV relay location. Figure 1: FANET scenario. \nThe proposal is divided into two key phases, which involve activating the mobility of the UAVs through the Network Simulator (NS-2) and using the mobility data of the UAVs in an Artificial Neural Network (AAN) in MatLab (the position and traffic of the UAVs with the relay were used for the training of the neural network), which will indicate the position of the UAV relay. \nThis article is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses reviews from related works; Section 3 describes the proposed optimizer in detail; the results obtained from the simulation are shown in Section 4 ; and Section 5 summarizes the conclusions and makes suggestions for future work. 2. Related Works \nThis section discusses the related work and examines the Aerial Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs). In addition, it calculates the positioning of the UAV relay with the aim of improving network performance. \nIn [ 4 ], UAVs are used for locating forest fires. Their approach leads to an improvement in the localization mission through a decision-making strategy, resulting from a temperature-based probabilistic model that is designed to estimate the distance to the forest fire. The UAV adjusts its trajectory according to the state of the knowledge of the fire, using a map to represent its knowledge, which is updated at each stage of its exploration. \nIn [ 5 ], an accurate analytical model is set out to reduce signal interference between the UAVs and the base station. The algorithm performs uniform frequency hopping within the bandwidth channel itself and has achieved service quality gains in overload or \u201cinterrupt cells.\u201d However, in the article, there is no applied artificial intelligence technique that can make the task of optimization more efficient and faster, and in most situations, only a new relay UAV positioning would be able to achieve gains. \nReference [ 6 ] suggests forming a set of Aerial Ad Hoc Networks, including several backbones of FANETs that communicate with each other and also communicate with a base station. This composition of several backbones increases the coverage area of the monitored region, but there has been no study on the proper way to position the devices to ensure that the network can perform in the best possible way. \nThe article of [ 7 ] includes a control scheme for the movement of the UAVs within a particular coverage area. The motion control scheme is based on the distance between the UAVs and their signal strength and allows them to have good communication, thus having good transmission rates. However, controlling the movement is not the most viable solution because certain areas of the coverage area are not sufficiently monitored. \nThe authors in [ 8 ] aim to minimize the number of MBSs needed to provide wireless coverage for a group of distributed ground terminals (GTs), ensuring that each GT is within the communication range of at least one MBS. A polynomial time algorithm with successive MBS placement is used, where the MBSs are placed sequentially starting on the area perimeter of the uncovered GTs along a spiral path toward the center, until all GTs are covered. \nAn efficient algorithm is necessary to maneuver each UAV so that the whole system can produce complex, adaptable, and flexible team behavior. The task-planning problem for UAV networks with connectivity constraint involves a number of parameters and interaction of dynamic variables. An algorithm has been proposed for such a situation [ 9 ]. There is also an algorithm for distributed intelligent agent systems in which agents autonomously coordinate, cooperate, negotiate, make decisions, and take actions to meet the objectives of a particular task. The connectivity constrained problem is NP-hard and a polynomial time heuristic has been proposed in the literature [ 10 ]. Reference [ 10 ] is the closest related work by also having proposed a heuristic algorithm, but without any evaluation of Quality of Service and Quality of Experience. \nThe articles cited in this section have led to several improvements being made within the context of FANET applications. However, no techniques were employed that aimed at maintaining high performance in the data transfer, which is achieved through the positioning of the UAVs. None of the papers cited used hybrid networks to manage the decision-making required for the best positioning between the mission-based UAVs and UAV relay. In light of this, this work employs techniques that allow the use of these networks both in ad hoc applications and in other wireless technologies. 3. FANET Application Features \nThe main feature of the Ad Hoc Networks, referred to by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) as MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network), is that they do not have an infrastructure, and as a result, all network\u2019s functions must be carried out by the nodes themselves. This means that the nodes that make up an Ad Hoc Network must be able to communicate with each other as routers. \nAd hoc Networks are generally used in scenarios where there is a need to quickly deploy a network and usually where there is no proper infrastructure. Nodes can move arbitrarily within them and change the network topology in an unpredictable way, which requires the constant adaptation and reconfiguration of routes so that the nodes can still communicate with each other. \nIn the new context of Next Generation Networks (NGNs), a derivation of Ad Hoc Networks called FANET (Flying Ad Hoc Network) arises. FANETs are Ad Hoc Networks consisting of remotely controlled flying elements (UAVs: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) that communicate with each other [ 11 ], and because FANETs have flexibility, versatility, and even ease of operability, they are used for both military and civilian applications, such as border control in risk zones, deforestation monitoring, and traffic flow control (Figure 2 ). Figure 2: Urban FANET application. \nIn FANET networks, the mobility index is much higher than in a traditional Ad Hoc Network; thus changes in topology are more frequent and even the coverage area is larger (depending on the type of hardware and technology used). That is why FANET networks have to be self-configuring and self-organizing; a FANET network must be prepared for sudden changes in its topology, in organization, and even in its communications systems. \nThe mobility of mobile units and their spatial arrangement are also very important in determining the communication routes. As a result of the movement, these routes are usually replanned to allow continuous interconnection of the nodes. For this reason, routing must be carried out dynamically and the activities involved in the routing protocol must be effective and simple, so as to give greater autonomy to the nodes and reduce the delay in the delivery of data from a sender node to a destination node. \nThe communication between the UAVs largely depends on their location, since all the information collected from the environment is concentrated in a UAV relay node (which is responsible for relaying the data to a control center). Hence, its positioning in relation to the other nodes must be strategic enough to ensure that the network maintains a good performance. It is not an ideal situation if the UAV relay has an excellent communication with some UAVs while at the same time having poor communications with the other UAVs in the network [ 12 ]. \nThe UAVs are responsible for flying over the environment; they have sensors to collect information and a higher energy load than traditional sensor networks that means they can communicate with each other more easily by finding fewer obstacles in their line of sight. This should reduce the number of nodes needed to cover a given area, although climatic conditions can impair communication (wind, rain, etc.) [ 13 ]. \nIt should be noted that the computational power of FANETs networks means that they have a greater capacity to transmit information, since in many cases they are responsible for transmitting information in real time (with videos from the monitored environment). There have been no specific routing protocols for FANETs so far, and the traditional protocols used in Ad Hoc Networks (e.g., AODV, OLSR) are also used in FANET. \nOwing to the high mobility rate of UAVs in a FANET, updating the location of all the nodes in the network is a critical feature. The devices in the network must know the location of the other elements in real time, so in addition to the use of GPS (which, on average, sends information about the location every second), the UAVs have an Inertial Measurement Unit (UMI) capable of sending their location at a shorter interval than GPS at any time [ 14 ]. \nTherefore, the arrangement of the devices within a coverage area has a direct impact on the performance of the network and can either improve or worsen in accordance with their mobility. This is one of the main challenges to be solved in this type of network. 4. FANET Model for Optmization Position \nAs previously mentioned in the case of FANET, the position of the relay should be regarded as a problem to solve or as a means of improving the network performance. This work proposes a novel method for the establishment of communication between one UAV relay and other UAVs in mission flights. The proposal is largely based on the information that can be found in most of the FANET applications, and the aim is to collect data from the environment and to transmit this data to a ground base. \nThe objective is to drive the UAV relay in real time to the optimal placement with the knowledge of the UAVs positions and maximize the data traffic collection of the UAVs. For this optimization, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used, the training phase estimates the best transmission rate considering the positions of the devices, and the bat algorithm based on the output of the ANN determines the new position for relay UAV through the objective function. \nIn the creation of the model of the proposal, this paper considers the following information that must be collected (by simulations) for the training of the Artificial Neural Network: (1) position of the UAV relay; (2) position of the UAVs in flight mission; (3) the throughput of each UAV in flight mission with the UAV relay; and (4) the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) of each UAV in flight mission with the UAV relay. \nIn a multi-UAV system that comprises all the drones arranged in the FANET, has been established as a set of UAVs, the number of UAVs in is denoted by , and the UAV relay is denoted by . Each ) that define its positions as and is defined as the traffic between and is defined as the RSSI between and . \nIn [ 10 ], it was established that, at any moment, the distance between is no closer to a certain threshold and, in this way, the UAVs can avoid collisions. Using the coordinates () and the traffic as the database for this work, it was found that each moved in a plane of \u2009m in a random manner to generate traffic with . \nThe heuristic algorithm for the traffic problem was used to solve the optimization problem (see Figure 3 ). This algorithm starts by selecting the positions of the UAVs and relay (and the traffic between them); after this, we look for a new relay positioning that is determined by the Artificial Neural Network. The output of the network will be the traffic that corresponds to positions and , and with these results, it is possible to reallocate the position of the relay to a position where the traffic is better than in the previous position. Figure 3: FANET model. 5. Proposed Heuristics \nIn light of the scenario described in the previous section, this section focuses on machine learning, in particular on how the neural network works and the bat algorithm (bat) that was used as an optimization algorithm. In the case of the artificial neural networks, we used the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), the architecture of which is shown in Figure 4 , and the data of , (UAV position, UAV relay position, and UAV traffic to UAV relay, respectively). Figure 4: The typical architecture of a Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) [ 3 ]. \nThe GRNNs have four layers: the input layer (in this work, and are used as inputs for the model), the intermediate layer, sum layer, and output layer (which is for the model). The number of units in the input layer depends on the total number of variables. The neurons in the input layer transmit the information to the intermediate layer, and each neuron in the intermediate layer corresponds to a training pair. Thus, the number of neurons in the intermediate layer is equal to the number of training pairs. The third layer is the summation layer; there are only two neurons in this layer: the so-called -sum and the second neuron, commonly called neuron -sum. For an input vector , the output of the GRNN is calculated by the following equation: \nThe bat algorithm simulates the prey detection instinct of micro bats and was created by Yang et al. [ 15 ]. The basic rules of the bat algorithm are as follows: (i) All bats use the echo location to sense the distance and also \u201cknow\u201d the difference between food/prey and the obstacles surrounding them. (ii) Bats randomly fly with velocity at position and varied wavelength and intensity to search for prey. Additionally, they automatically adjust the wavelength (or frequency) of their emitted pulses and adjust the pulse emission rate , depending on the proximity of their target. (iii) Although the loudness may vary in many ways, it has been established that the degree of intensity ranges from a large (positive) to a constant minimum value . \nThe bat algorithm yields a combination of UAV and relay positions and evaluates the positioning using the Artificial Neural Network already described. Afterwards, it continuously repeats these steps in order to find a solution that maximizes the throughput. \nThe optimization loop is in the focus of this work. It is assumed that each of the neighboring UAVs in mission is in the range of the UAV relay. An initial population of relay positions is randomly created and is the basis for further optimization; hence, the genome with = relay position. The algorithm makes use of the model described in Section 4 and illustrated in Figure 3 . When the optimization starts, an initial population is generated and evaluated using the fitness function (GRNN) described along with the selection process. Each iteration of the bat algorithm works in the pseudocode in Algorithm 1 . Algorithm 1: Bat algorithm. \nis a random vector defined from a uniform distribution. In general, and are defined according to the domain size of the problem of interest; at this work it was used for and for . Pulse rate was defined initially as 0.7 and loudness as 0.5. \nThe loudness and pulse emission rates are regulated by the following equations: being constants. \nIn bat algorithm, frequency tuning essentially acts as mutation, while selection pressure is relative constant via the use of current best solution , found so far. There is no explicit crossover; however, mutation varies based on the variations of loudness and pulse emission. In addition, the variations of loudness and pulse emission rates also provide an auto-zooming ability so that exploitation becomes intensive as the search is approaching global optimality [ 16 ]. \nAfter the training phase in ANN, a new positioning of the UAVs was found, which formed a new scenario in which it would be necessary to adjust the position of the relay to achieve the best performance of the network. The bat algorithm finds the optimum position, between the UAVs and relay. By minimizing the objective function, called , it will be possible to adjust the position of the relay to obtain a better estimate of the traffic. This optimization heuristic can be seen in Algorithm 2 . Algorithm 2: Objective function with GRNN. \nFigure 5 shows the flowchart that illustrates the operation of the initial proposal where the bat optimizer algorithm is used to adjust the positioning of the relay in real time in search of the best traffic. Figure 5: Flowchart of the initial proposal. 6. Performance Evaluation of FANET Simulations \nThis section analyzes the results of the computational experiments to prove the efficiency of the optimization algorithm. The proposed method is perturbation-free, does not require time separation between plant dynamics and the optimal placement-seeking loop, and does not require (for a while) knowledge of the propagation model. \nThe simulations were performed in the NS-2. The NS-2 simulator, like the other simulators in the network, does not provide support to three-dimensional simulations, and for this reason, the simulations carried out in this paper assume that the drones fly over at a similar height, similar as [ 8 ] that assumes the UAVs are flying at fixed altitude with LOS (line-of-sight) links. In the simulations, all the UAVs (multiple and relay) had random mobility within an area of \u2009m. Multiple UAVs performed 500\u2009kbps transmissions for the UAV relay. The simulation parameters used in the simulations are described in Table 1 . Table 1: NS-2 configuration parameters. \nThe data obtained from the simulations were drawn for the training of the neural network and also for the configuration of the bat algorithm. The parameters contained in Table 2 correspond to the best results for the configuration of the neural network topologies and the bat algorithm. Table 2: Main topology features. \nThe evaluation was divided into three parts: (1) Computational Intelligence Results; (2) Quality of Service Results; and (3) Quality of Experience Results. 6.1. Computational Intelligence Results \nThe first stage entails training the neural network to learn how to relate the positioning of the UAVs and the relay to their respective network traffic. Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show the performance and training regression, respectively. In Figure 6(a) , it can be observed that, through the use of cross-validation, a Mean Squared Error of 0.00072 was obtained. Figure 6: Performance and training regression. \nAfter the neural network training, the bat algorithm was used by following the pseudocode shown in Figure 4 , to obtain the minimization objective function. Thus, the smaller the result of , the greater the . Figure 7 shows the evolutionary pattern of in 1000 generations of bats. In this way, each generation seeks to maintain or improve the existing population in order to find the best positioning between and . Figure 7: Evolutionary pattern. \nThe proposed model of this paper turned the complexity problem of relay positioning in a linear problem as showed in Figure 8 . The number of iterations (10) versus increasing the number of UAVs was tested. Figure 8: Linear problem. 6.2. Quality of Service Results \nThis section makes an assessment of the performance of the network before the optimization and then with the optimization. The first evaluated result was the average throughput. As discussed earlier, the positioning of the relay in relation to the other UAVs has a direct impact on the application. It can be seen in Figure 9 that the average throughput with the optimization was higher than the average throughput without the optimization and that there was an improvement of 135% in an area of \u2009m. Figure 9: Throughput performance. \nIn the case of optimization, whenever the multiple UAVs are moved, a new position is found for the UAV relay and usually in a centralized position in relation to the other relays. In this way the optimizer prevents the UAV relay from being far away from the other UAVs during the movement. This optimization is possible because aside from knowing its own position, the UAV relay is given the location of the others and there is an estimation of the new position to which it must move so that it can maintain a good connection with all the multiple UAVs of the network. \nFigure 10 shows the behavior of delays without optimization and after optimization. It can be concluded that without the optimization algorithm, the traffic between the UAVs and relay is subject to higher and more unstable delays (an average delay of 0.0512\u2009ms). Owing to the mobility of the devices, there are occasions when the relay can be more distant from other devices, thus degrading the quality of communication. Therefore, a better result can be found through the optimizer, since there is not much delay variation (an average delay of 0.0034\u2009ms), which makes it more reliable because the relay node is closer and more centralized in relation to the other nodes. Figure 10: Delay performance. \nBased on the results obtained so far, Figure 11 shows the scenario for one of the samples used in the experiment in which the positioning of the relay can be seen before the optimization and its respective displacement to an optimal position. In view of the random nature of the mobility, it is not possible to determine how far away the relay will be from the other relays, and this highlights the importance of the optimizer, which is able to estimate a new position that will allow suitable communication. Thus, after going through all the stages of the optimizer, the relay was moved to a new position so that there could be an improvement of the performance of the traffic between the UAVs. Figure 11: Positioning of the relay in multiple UAVs. 6.3. Quality of Experience Results \nThis paper also analyzes the simulations with video applications. The video results are evaluated with the aid of the following objective QoE metrics: Peak Signal to Noise Radio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Metric (SSIM), and Video Quality Metric (VQM). They are collected by means of the MSU Video Quality Measurement Tool (VQMT). \nThe PSNR is the most traditional objective metric and compares the quality of video received by the user with that of the original video. The PSNR is derived from another metric called the Mean Squared Error (MSE). The MSE calculates the average variation error of an actual attribute with which this same attribute was estimated. In other words, it compares the quality of the frame received by the user with regard to the original frame. \nFigure 12 compares the PSNR of video transmitted both without and with the optimizer. The video streamed without the optimizer had a PSNR average of 10.7\u2009dB; thus, it was rated as a poor quality video, while the video streamed with the optimizer had a PSNR average of 42.9\u2009dB and was rated as an excellent quality video. Figure 12: PSNR performance. \nUnlike the PSNR that only analyzes the error rate of the video received in relation to the original video, the SSIM evaluates the received video with regard to features such as color, brightness, and structure. The SSIM index is a decimal value between 0 and 1, where 0 means zero correlation with the original image and 1 means exactly the same image. \nThe video streamed without the optimizer obtained an average SSIM of 0.57, while the video transmitted with the optimizer obtained an average SSIM of 0.96. Figure 13 shows the SSIM performance during the transmission. Figure 13: SSIM performance. \nThe VQM is more complete than PSNR and SSIM because it evaluates the color, pixel, and noise distortion if the video is \u201cerased.\u201d The VQM determines the level of multimedia quality based on human eye perception and subjective factors, including blurring, global noise, block distortion, and color distortion. In the evaluation of the VQM results, zero is the best possible score. In the simulations, the video stream without optimization had a mean VQM of 11.1 while the video transmitted with the optimizer had a mean VQM of 0.4 (Figure 14 ). Figure 14: VQM performance. \nThe efficiency of the optimizer can be proved by comparing a frame of the video transmitted without an optimizer with a frame of the video transmitted with the optimizer. In Figure 15 , the superior quality of the video transmitted with the optimizer is evident, because it has moved the relay to a suitable position in relation to the other UAVs and it is able to improve the quality of the communication between them. Figure 15: Comparison between frames without optimization and frames with optimization. 7. Final Considerations \nWith the creation of Ad Hoc Networks, a new challenge has emerged of improving their performance. One of the main problems to be solved is the positioning of UAV relay in relation to the other relays to improve communication in a FANET scenario. The results obtained by simulations underline the importance of combining areas such as telecommunications and computational intelligence, by means of a metaheuristic model, thus obtaining a better result and a better performance of the network as a whole. The use of the proposed model can meet the future needs that may arise in a FANET scenario by improving the communication system, both in civil and in military applications, and obtain satisfactory and more precise results in relation to the above-mentioned related works. \nOther metaheuristic optimizers need to be tested to validate the method and confirm the best execution time for performance such as a genetic algorithm, Cuckoo search, and particle swarm. In addition, other scenarios can be tested such as an example of a performance evaluation of traffic caused by large crowds such as football matches, shows, and processions. The bat algorithm is part of a set of metaheuristic optimization algorithms with different applications that has demonstrated its applicability in computer networks as well as in this work. \nIn future work, the proposal could include a larger number of samples for optimization. This will involve expanding the FANET scenarios with communication to a 4G backbone network and carrying out simulations with other resolutions (High Definition) video traffic to evaluate network performance in terms of Quality of Experience and the impact of different propagation mechanisms on the type of signal used.

But there are good reasons beyond the patriotic for so doing. These reasons lie in both admiration for the recent campaign and a sincere feeling that Paisley so richly deserves the renewal that could result from being chosen. \nThe campaign was so high-energy and positive, with huge community involvement at the grassroots, that it was inspiring even to non-Buddies across the UK. Just as the UK City of Culture would confer benefits on Paisley, Paisley\u2019s campaign has exemplified all that is good about the concept of having a UK City of Culture. All five places shortlisted before today\u2019s decision have seen hard times and deserve support. Few will be unaware of how badly Paisley has suffered from unemployment and deprivation but the Buddies have shown a desire for change and a willingness to put the shoulder to the wheel. \nPaisley\u2019s great past is seen all around in its magnificent buildings. Its present sees an engaged grassroots and a thriving cultural community. Its future could be bright, and the boost from becoming UK City of Culture (an estimated \u00a3172 million in investment and nearly 5,000 jobs over 10 years) would do such a lot to take it forward. \n \nWe wish the other contenders well but we are backing Paisley.

He recalled that he is only delivering on a campaign promise, that the decision was nothing more than the recognition of \u201creality,\u201d and that it was \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d\nIsrael regards Jerusalem as is indivisible capital. However, the international community views Jerusalem as an occupied territory captured in 1967 whose final status would be the final chapter of a two-state solution. In previous stages of the negotiation, there had been consensus that Palestine and Israel would share Jerusalem as a capital.\nThe US passed a law in 1995 that requires moving its Embassy to Jerusalem. However, it\u2019s implementation has been suspended by every US President, including George W. Bush . With Wednesday\u2019s decision, Washington alienated most of its allies.\nIn a statement issued in Brussels, the EU calls for a resumption of negotiations calling Jerusalem the future capital of both Israel and Palestine. The UK followed the same diplomatic line, calling Jerusalem\u2019s status the subject of negotiation in a final peace process.\nThe Arab League issued a common statement warning of \u201crepercussions\u201d for the region, while King Salman of Saudi Arabia personally called President Trump to dissuade him from this decision. Iran expressed \u201cdespair\u201d with the decision.\nThe immediate response of the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is that Washington is no longer regarded a peace broker. The Pope called for respect of the status quo in the Middle East, while both Russian and China expressed concerns for the stability of the region.

PHOTO: REUTERS Published Claire Huang \nSINGAPORE - Singapore's bourse operator has zoomed in on the weak points in disclosure requirements under listing rules and proposed refinements that could improve transparency and accountability of companies. \nThe Singapore Exchange (SGX) has suggested three areas in which the tweaks will be made - secondary fund-raising, interested person transactions as well as significant transactions and loans. \nUnder secondary fundraising, the SGX has proposed that listed companies provide additional upfront and prominent report on the discount, ratio and other principal terms for rights issues. \nListed entities should also issue a directors' statement on why the rights issue is in the best interest of the issuer and the basis for it. \nThey should also declare the use of proceeds and intended use of unutilised amount if a rights issue takes place within a year of another fundraising, suggested the SGX. \nThe SGX has recommended that interested person transactions (IPT) that are under S$100,000 to no longer be exempted from announcements or shareholder vote, in addition to greater notice on the nature of the relationship with the interested person. \nThe bourse operator is also suggesting that the relevant director, chief executive or controlling shareholder of the issuer who will be covered by the IPT mandate, be identified. \nIn terms of significant transactions and loans, the SGX is proposing additional disclosures for loans that are not part of the issuer's ordinary course of business. \nIt wants companies to explain why no valuation was done for an acquisition or disposal of assets that is a major transaction. The exception will be if the transaction involved shares. \nThe SGX is also suggesting the appointment of a competent and independent valuer for significant asset disposals. \nTan Boon Gin, CEO of Singapore Exchange Regulation, said: \"We are proposing to recalibrate the disclosure regime using a risk-based approach following extensive engagements with investors, companies, and other stakeholders. The additional disclosures we are proposing address key areas of concern of the market and the exchange.\" \nThe public can submit feedback on the proposed listing rule changes till Jan 12, 2018. \nIf adopted, the SGX said that it expects to implement the changes in 2018.

It\u2019s the premium chipset for most flagship phones due in 2018. We\u2019re expecting OEMs to announce their products in the coming weeks. First to make their plans known is Xiaomi with the Mi 7. The next-gen Mi will be powered by the new Snapdragon. This isn\u2019t a big surprise because the past years and since the first Mi flagship was introduced, Xiaomi has relied on Qualcomm and has been using the top Snapdragon processor. \nDefinitely, the Xiaomi Mi 7 is just the first. As early as August, we said the Samsung Galaxy S9 will also be powered by the Snapdragon 845. It\u2019s also the same with LG who is also expected to release the LG G7 . Based on the past traditions, the next top-tier flagships from OnePlus, Google, Nokia, ASUS, and Motorola may also be powered by the new premium Snapdragon SoC. \nQualcomm is considered as the top chipmaker in the world today, providing processors for some of the tech giants such as Google, Samsung, and Apple. Problem is, the company has been facing some challenges like fighting Broadcom bid and a legal battle against Samsung and Apple. So much is going on with Qualcomm we\u2019re curious how the company will face 2018.

Drawn against 2010 World Champions and the reigning European Champions put the North African side outside the knockout qualification slots. It is true Morocco has seen improvements in recent years after a prolonged string of subpar success with Wydad Casablanca clinching the African Champions League and the national team making a return to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\n\nHowever, Morocco\u2019s level of success pales in comparison to what outright favorites in Group B Portugal and Spain, have accomplished lately. The Iberian nations have won the last three European Championships between them and head to Russia in fine form. Looking at the numbers, Appiah\u2019s assertion is wrong considering Morocco secured qualification to the World Cup after scoring 11 combined goals against Ivory Coast, Mali and Gabon without conceding a goal. Herve Renard\u2019s teams have a strong disciplinary trait and very difficult to beat but thus far, his strength has been tested successfully in Africa. Outside the continent, his style hasn\u2019t proved much successful as his time at Lille proved.\n\nAs such, the Atlas Lions need a lot of firepower to counter the efforts of Cristiano Ronaldo and Alvaro Morata. Like most members of the team, Renard will have to choose players who are citizens of European countries with Moroccan roots to shore up his attack. The team is heavy on diaspora players so much so the Lions final game against Ivory Coast had four players born in the Netherlands, four in France, two in Spain with one born in Morocco but raised in Belgium. These players from foreign lands can help Renard team in Russia:\n\nMunir El Hadaddi \u2013 Alaves\nThe former Barcelona academy product has already featured for Spain\u2019s National Team but his drop in form coupled with abundant talent oozing out of the country means his chances of getting a second call up is highly unlikely. The situation has opened up the opportunity to represent the country of his father at the World Cup. Had El Hadaddi maintained the kind of play that caught the eye of the Blaugrana, he would be in line to face Morocco mirroring the spectacle that took place at the 2010 edition in South Africa where Jerome Boateng played for Germany against the country of his father, Ghana.\nDespite failing to impress since breaking through at Barca and a loan spell at Valencia, Munir has the skill set to thrive for Herve Renard\u2019s side once paperwork on his nationality switch is completed. His speed and dribbling ability should suit the team\u2019s counter attack fine since Morocco relies heavily on it after lengthy spells sitting deep.\n\nAdam Masina Bologna\nMasina is a defender who has caught the eye of some of Europe\u2019s top teams including Tottenham Hotspurs who are rumored to be admirers of the Italian born Moroccan. The left full back was born in the North African country but raised in Italy and has represented the country at the Under 21 level but with no call up to the Azzuri, Renard can reel him into the side. Masina\u2019s combination of power, speed and height (stands 6 foot 3 inches) makes him a modern day marauding full back capable of playing as a wing back. Tottenham need him as a possible replacement for Danny Rose who is likely to leave the club soon; the Atlas Lions need Masina\u2019s powerful runs to catch teams on the counter.\nUnlike El Haddadi, Moroccan authorities have a clear run at Mesina ; the only stumbling block is the player\u2019s attitude which has been questioned by Bologna Coach Roberto Donadoni. Donadoni has stated Masina\u2019s attitude on putting in work \u201cmakes him angry\u201d. For Renard, a Coach who is keen on a high work rate, this could be a thorny issue.\n\nHachim Mastour AC Milan\nYou must have heard; no seen this youngster in the famous YouTube video outdueling Neymar in a free style ball juggling contest. Fast forward three years and the talented midfielder is on the verge of becoming the latest perhaps the biggest flash in the pan talent in world football. After representing for Morocco once in 2015, a quick turnaround in fortune could be the key to unlock opportunities in the team representing the country of his parents. Immensely talented with creativity, Mastour is yet to put it together to become a reliable creator of goals and not another Denilson.

Simulating the rise of a high-frequency component in the presence of a stable low-frequency stochastic oscillation (Figure 1(c) , where , , and increases with fixed ) determines an increase of MSE that is revealed across multiple temporal scales. Simulating the progressive separation of stochastic oscillations within a process (Figure 1(d) , where , , and increases with fixed ) determines again an increase of MSE across multiple scales. These results suggest that the simultaneous presence of multiple oscillatory mechanisms tends to produce more complex dynamics than in the case of single mechanisms, with a complexity degree that increases with the strength of the stochastic oscillations and with the mismatch of their frequency. These findings are supported by the results of recent studies [ 32 , 33 ] and are observed over a range of time scales that comprises the characteristic periods of all oscillations. 3.3. Estimation Performance \nFigure 2 reports the results of the practical estimation of complexity over short realizations of the simulations, performed using the refined approach and the linear approach to MSE computation. For both the parameter settings chosen to simulate an individual stochastic oscillation (Figures 2(a) and 2(b) ; , ) and a pair of stochastic oscillations (Figures 2(c) and 2(d) ; , ; , ), it is evident that the LMSE estimator proposed in this study outperforms the RMSE estimator. In fact, LMSE estimates are substantially unbiased, since the median estimated profile of multiscale complexity overlaps with the true profile, and exhibit a low variability around their median value, particularly at high time scales where they converge to the expected value (Figures 2(a) and 2(c) ). On the contrary, RMSE estimates are strongly biased at all time scales and also exhibit a substantial variance that increases dramatically with the time scale (Figures 2(b) and 2(d) ); note that RMSE could not be computed at the higher time scales , due to the limited number of data points. The poor performance of RMSE confirms the known difficulty of yielding accurate model-free complexity estimates using the SampEn estimator applied to short time series [ 33 , 34 ]. Figure 2: Estimation of multiscale entropy (MSE) over finite-length realizations of simulated AR processes. Plots depict the exact values (red lines) and the distributions (median and 10th\u201390th percentiles) of the MSE estimates () computed as a function of the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter used to eliminate the fast temporal scales of the process for representative parameter settings of Type 1 simulation (a, b) and of Type 2 simulation (c, d). Estimates are obtained using the linear MSE (LMSE) method proposed in this study (a, c) and using the refined MSE (RMSE) method proposed in [ 11 ] (b, d). In simulated AR processes, RMSE estimates exhibit high bias and a variance increasing with the time scale, while LMSE estimates display high computational reliability at all time scales. 4. Application to Short-Term Cardiovascular Variability Series \nTo illustrate the application of the proposed approach for the computation of MSE over short biomedical time series, this section reports the analysis of cardiovascular and respiratory variability series. Specifically, we compare the abilities of LMSE and RMSE in detecting the multiscale complexity of heart period (HP), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), and respiration (RESP) time series measured from a large group of healthy subjects in a resting state condition as well as during two types of physiological stress, that is, postural stress and mental stress [ 35 ]. 4.1. Experimental Protocol and Data Analysis \nThe analyzed time series belong to a database collected to assess the dynamics of HP, SAP, and RESP during two types of physiological stress commonly studied in cardiovascular variability, that is, postural stress induced by head-up tilt (HUT) and mental stress induced by mental arithmetics (MA); we refer to [ 35 , 36 ] for a detailed description of the population and the experimental setup. Briefly, a group of 61 young healthy subjects (37 females, years old) were monitored in a relaxed state in the resting supine position (SU), in the upright position during HUT, and in the supine position during MA, measuring the surface electrocardiogram (ECG), the finger arterial blood pressure collected noninvasively by the photoplethysmographic method, and the respiration signal measured through respiratory inductive plethysmography. From these signals, the beat-to-beat time series of HP, SAP, and RESP were measured, respectively, as the sequences of the temporal distances between consecutive R peaks of the ECG, the maximum values of the arterial pressure waveform measured inside the consecutively detected heart periods, and the values of the respiratory signal sampled at the onset of the consecutively detected heart periods. \nThe analysis was performed on segments of 300 consecutive points, free of artifacts and satisfying stationarity requirements, extracted from the three time series for each subject and condition. The preprocessing steps consisted in removing the linear trend from each sequence and in reducing the series to zero mean. Then, for each individual time series, a linear AR model was identified using the standard least squares method and using the Bayesian Information Criterion to set the model order within the range [ 37 ]. From the estimated AR parameters, LMSE was computed by means of the procedure described in Section 2.3 , using a low-pass FIR filter of order . The computation of RMSE was performed as described in Section 2.2 , using a sixth-order Butterworth low-pass filter before resampling and computing SampEn with parameters and equal to 20% of the variance of the resampled signal. As for simulations, in the computation of both LMSE and RMSE, the parameters and determining the time scale were set to obtain the following values for the cutoff frequency of the resampling filter: , 0.444, 0.4, 0.35, 0.3, 0.278, 0.25, 0.222, 0.2, 0.175, 0.15, 0.125, 0.1, 0.075, 0.05, . \nStatistically significant differences among the MSE profiles obtained in the three conditions (i.e., SU, HUT, and MA) were first assessed by means of the multivariate ANOVA. Then, if the null hypothesis that the means of MSE computed across time scales for each condition are the same multivariate vector was rejected, the univariate ANOVA was applied to the three distributions of MSE obtained during SU, HUT, and MA at any assigned time scale. Furthermore, if at a given time scale the null hypothesis that the means of MSE computed in the three conditions are the same number was rejected, a post hoc pairwise test (i.e., the Student -test for paired data) was performed to assess the statistical significance of the differences between rest and stress conditions (i.e., HUT versus. REST, or MA versus. REST). A value < 0.05 was always assumed as statistically significant; both in the univariate ANOVA and in the pairwise tests, a Bonferroni-Holm correction for multiple comparisons was employed. 4.2. Results and Discussion \nThe results of multiscale complexity analysis of HP, SAP, and RESP are depicted, respectively, in Figures 3 , 4 , and 5 ; results are presented as median and interquartile range of the distributions of LMSE and RMSE computed for the 61 subjects during the three considered experimental conditions (SU, HUT, and MA). As a general result, we find that LMSE estimates exhibit lower intersubject variability than RMSE estimates, especially when increasing the scale factor (i.e., when reducing the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter). This result holds for all time series and experimental conditions, likely reflecting the problems associated with the computation of RMSE for short time series and at long time scales. On the contrary, the variability of LMSE estimates decreases when increasing the scale factor, allowing eliciting statistically significant differences that in RMSE are masked by the larger intersubject variability. Figure 3: Estimation of multiscale entropy (MSE) for the time series of the heart period. Plots depict the distributions (median and 25th\u201375th percentiles) of the MSE estimates computed as a function of the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter used to eliminate the fast temporal scales of the process in the resting supine position (SU, diamonds), during postural stress induced by head-up tilt (HUT, squares), and during mental stress induced by mental arithmetics (MA, circles). While MA does not induce changes, HUT evokes a significant reduction of the complexity of heart period variability, which is observed using LMSE across a wide range of time scales including both low- and high-frequency oscillations. Statistically significant difference, HUT versus SU or MA versus SU. Figure 4: Estimation of multiscale entropy (MSE) for the time series of the systolic arterial pressure. Plots depict the distributions (median and 25th\u201375th percentiles) of the MSE estimates ) computed as a function of the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter used to eliminate the fast temporal scales of the process in the resting supine position (SU, diamonds), during postural stress induced by head-up tilt (HUT, squares), and during mental stress induced by mental arithmetics (MA, circles). The multiscale complexity of systolic pressure dynamics increases consistently across multiple time scales during MA and increases for time scales associated with low-frequency oscillations during HUT. Statistically significant difference, HUT versus SU or MA versus SU. Figure 5: Estimation of multiscale entropy (MSE) for the time series of respiration. Plots depict the distributions (median and 25th\u201375th percentiles) of the MSE estimates computed as a function of the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter used to eliminate the fast temporal scales of the process in the resting supine position (SU, diamonds), during postural stress induced by head-up tilt (HUT, squares), and during mental stress induced by mental arithmetics (MA, circles). The multiscale complexity of respiratory dynamics increases consistently across multiple time scales during MA and decreases for time scales associated with high-frequency oscillations during HUT. Statistically significant difference, HUT versus SU or MA versus SU. \nThe analysis of LMSE and RMSE computed for the HP time series, reported in Figure 3 , documents that the complexity of HP is significantly lower during HUT than during REST, while no significant differences are observed between REST and MA. The lower complexity during HUT is detected up to \u2009Hz using RMSE (Figure 3(b) ) and up to \u2009Hz using LMSE (Figure 3(a) ). At scale 1 , these results confirm a number of previous investigations documenting the decreased complexity of heart rate variability during postural stress and its unaltered complexity during mental stress [ 36 , 38 \u2013 40 ]. Here we extend these findings showing that during MA the complexity of HP is left unchanged at any time scale and during HUT it is kept at lower levels until both the high-frequency (HF, >0.15\u2009Hz) and the low-frequency (LF, ~0.1\u2009Hz) oscillations are removed by filtering. This latter result, which is documented only using the LSME estimator, is in agreement with a recent study showing that the reduction in complexity induced by HUT is a result of the presence of more regular HP oscillations in the LF band rather than in the HF band and is thus associated more to an enriched sympathetic modulation than to a vagal withdrawal [ 32 ]. \nThe MSE analysis performed for the SAP time series, reported in Figure 4 , evidences a clear increase in the MSE computed during MA. This result, which is again more evident using LMSE than RMSE, has been previously observed at scale 1 [ 36 ] and is possibly related to complex patterns of autonomic activation following cognitive load [ 41 , 42 ]; our results, showing the persistence of higher MSE values up to long time scales , point to an involvement of LF oscillations in the generation of higher complexity during mental stress. The multiscale pattern of complexity induced by postural stress is more complicated, indicating lower MSE during HUT than during REST for short time scales (\u2009Hz), no significant alterations for intermediate time scales (up to \u2009Hz), and higher MSE during HUT than during REST for longer time scales ( between 0.275 Hz and 0.15 Hz). The emergence of a significantly higher complexity of SAP during HUT when HF fluctuations are filtered out is a novel finding, suggesting that the postural stress decreases the regularity of LF arterial pressure oscillations, while HF oscillations display similar or even increased regularity. \nThe multiscale complexity analysis of respiration variability, reported in Figure 5 , documents that MSE is significantly decreased during HUT and significantly increased during MA. These variations are consistently observed across multiple scales, going up to \u2009Hz for the lower LMSE and RMSE during HUT and up to \u2009Hz for the higher LMSE during MA. The higher regularity of the respiratory dynamics during postural stress, which seems to be confined to the HF band where respiration usually occurs, may be related to an increased tidal volume during this condition. On the other hand, the lower regularity of respiration during mental stress might be explained by the appearance of long pauses or sighs in the respiration pattern while performing mental arithmetics [ 43 ], making it more erratic and thus complex. The existence of more erratic patterns, which likely span a broad band of the frequency spectrum, may also explain the fact that we observe higher complexity of respiration up to long time scales, going beyond the common frequency bands at which respiratory activity is observed. 5. Conclusions and Future Developments \nThe present study introduces for the first time a multiscale entropy measure that is based on theoretical rather than empirical grounds and can thus be analytically computed from the parametric representation of an observed stochastic process. As a matter of fact, the proposed LMSE method is highly data-efficient because it stems from simple linear parametric modeling and is thus much more reliable than MSE or its modifications [ 6 ], including RMSE, in assessing the complexity of short time series at long time scales. Compared with another recently proposed method to assess multiscale complexity from short data sequences [ 32 ], LMSE shares the philosophy of being derived for linear AR processes, but differs in the fact that it is designed closely following the two algorithmic steps of MSE computation, that is, low-pass filtering and downsampling. The high computational reliability of LMSE comes from the fact that filtering and downsampling are not actually implemented on the measured time series, but result from the analytical quantification of the impact that they have on the state-space parameters of the observed AR process. \nOur approach can be fruitfully exploited, as done in the present study, to relate the multiscale complexity of a stochastic process to the parameters that establish its dynamical features, or to estimate patterns of multiscale complexity from short process realizations. In this work, we have formalized the dependence of the multiscale complexity of an AR process on the amplitude and frequency of its stochastic oscillatory components and have assessed multiscale patterns of short-term cardiovascular complexity which cannot be fully retrieved using standard MSE methods. Our results emphasize the role of the sympathetic control in driving the increased regularity of low-frequency heart rate oscillations and the increased complexity of low-frequency arterial pressure oscillations during postural stress. LMSE analysis stresses also the importance of dynamics occurring within the low-frequency band in determining the increased complexity of arterial pressure, and even that of respiration, during mental stress. \nThe main strength of the proposed approach, that is, the linear parametric formulation, constitutes also one of its major limitations. In fact, the computation of LMSE holds exactly only if the observed process has a Gaussian distribution; in such a case, the linear AR description fully captures all of the variability in the process that determines the measured entropy rates, and model-free formulations as the one implemented by SampEn have no additional utility [ 25 ]. On the contrary, departures from linearity leading to non-Gaussian distributions may generate dynamics which are captured only partially by LMSE, and thus important features of multiscale complexity may be missed in this case. The suitability of LMSE for the applicative context of this study is supported by the fact that linear methods are ubiquitously exploited in short-term cardiovascular variability studies (e.g., performing parametric spectral analysis [ 17 , 44 ] or parametric coupling and causality analysis [ 37 , 45 ]). Nevertheless, future studies should deepen the comparison of LMSE with RMSE or other nonparametric MSE techniques in order to clarify the importance of accounting for nonlinear dynamics in the multiscale analysis of biomedical time series. On the other hand, keeping the linear analysis framework, a desirable extension of the present study would be to integrate the standard AR representation with fractionally integrated (FI) innovation modeling [ 46 ]; this would allow the computation of multiscale complexity for ARFI processes, thus incorporating in the approach the ability to describe long-range correlations phenomena which are typically assessed in long-term multiscale analyses [ 47 ].

The rate on individuals earning more than 500 million won will rise to 42 per cent from 40 per cent. \nWhile those tax increases count as a modest victory for Mr Moon in his Budget battle with opposition parties, he had hoped to apply the new corporate rate at a lower income threshold of 200 billion won. \nRaising corporate taxes runs counter to the global trend.

And \u201cunprecedented action\u201d was exactly what Barack Obama engaged in last year with one foot out the White House door. Taking advantage of the Antiquities Act (which Teddy Roosevelt signed into law in 1906 to help prevent the looting of archaeological and Native American structures and objects) to cater to special interest groups, he arbitrarily grabbed nearly 2 million acres in Utah to create Bears Ears National Monument. (His Democrat predecessor, Bill Clinton, did the same in 1996 with the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.) \u2013 like communists the world over \u2013 would own every acre of the country. \n\u2019s action is based on Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke\u2019s recommendation to give most of the land back to Utahans ~ \nWith typical progressive hyperbole, Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the president\u2019s action was a disgrace ~ \nSuh called it \u201ca travesty\u201d that Trump was \u201ctrying to unravel a century\u2019s worth of conservation history \u2014 all behind closed doors,\u201d adding: \u201cThe American people want these special places protected.\u201d \n\u201cbehind closed doors.\u201d The Interior Secretary spent months visiting various national monuments, getting input from those directly impacted by the land designations. Further, while the American people do want these places protected, there\u2019s no reason that can\u2019t be accomplished at the local level. \nThe Administration was very, very intent on listening to local voices when talking about the Monument. I couldn\u2019t more happy than to hear those words from the Administration, that they were wanting to listen to the local voices\u2026 There were so many NGO\u2019s and so many organizations that have big money from all over the United States that wanted to influence the designation of that monument, that it just blew it completely out of proportion. \n\nOnce again, its been the people vs. the propaganda. As Marjorie Haun at Free Range Report explained ~ \nTrump\u2019s decision comes after about eight months of careful consideration by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who was tasked with reviewing all national monuments created by presidents using the Antiquities Act since 1996. on acres), created by Clinton in a nod to green donors and Indonesian friends with clean coal interests in 1996, have been by far the most controversial and bitterly disputed. \nis certainly grateful for the president\u2019s reversal of the monument designation ~ \n\u201cWhen Bears Ears was designated, it was disheartening for my community. It was insulting that bureaucrats thousands of miles away didn\u2019t believe we were capable of protecting our land.\u201d \n\nThere is no compelling reason why the federal government should control so much land in Utah (- or any other western state for that matter. Look at that map again!). President Trump did the right thing in returning this land to Utahans. Conservation, and responsible stewardship of the area can and should be done at a state and local level.

A just law is a man made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an \"I it\" relationship for an \"I thou\" relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. Hence segregation is not only politically, economically and sociologically unsound, it is morally wrong and sinful.\"\n--\nPoint of Fact: we must keep in mind that this guy spent his cash on shiatty Budweiser, so I do think he should be prosecuted on the grounds of ass-taste in beer.\n/I might be drunk\nBudweiser does seem like a shiatty hill to die on.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:55.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3160f17f64857fad9cf26d4675b375c77afebbf6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTc3Wt6gO_FFgzQWAyb8M2u5KzVGUzGpWPskoM8Z1ie_5OAjpZ_46m9Mtrrj2rFIqhRiJj9HOy5Ro1Os49iklWh.hIr3JZ7qKvHlcEZ5byLwEEnMiyJ.Fe.axYucrO5kBODcqwwIsmYK1XYLyg8uSXYXg--", "site_full": "www.heraldscotland.com", "site": "heraldscotland.com", "site_section": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/herald_view/rss/", "site_categories": ["media", "climbing", "sports"], "section_title": "HeraldScotland | Herald View", "title": "The fatal flaws at the heart of the Brexit agreement", "title_full": "Herald View: The fatal flaws at the heart of the Brexit agreement | HeraldScotland", "published": "2017-12-06T07:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7142320/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31684, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ef6033ad8ae8e820f49659ba854511d7130e120", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTc3Wt6gO_FFgzQWAyb8M2u5KzVGUzGpWPskoM8Z1ie_5OAjpZ_46m9Mtrrj2rFIqhRiJj9HOy5Ro1Os49iklWh.hIr3JZ7qKvHlcEZ5byLwEEnMiyJ.Fe.axYucrO5kBODcqwwIsmYK1V2lOHsMoDHoKaOCUnJvqw4", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Michael Lloyd", "published": "2017-12-07T00:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The Herald showing its colours here.

They have emphatically held that the said Directorate does not have powers to exercise or invoke section 25 or section 32 (mis-declaration) of Customs Act, 1969. [Refer The Honorable High Court Judgments 2005 P T D 23 (Annex- B) and 2004 P T D 2994 (Annex \u2013 C)]. \nSources added that the Honorable Superior Courts have repeatedly held that the domain of Customs Directorate of Intelligence is to stop smuggling. But when it\u2019s certain staffers are busy in their illegal activities of examination and assessments of already cleared goods then they lose their focus on stopping smuggling rather even allow smuggled goods to transfer from place to place in lieu of bribes. Thus our country suffers trillions of rupees losses in smuggling and corruption at the hands of such few notorious staff of the Customs Directorate of Intelligence. \nSources revealed that DIT Sukkur recently seized the goods which were lawfully cleared from port by appraisement staff and one notorious Inspector of DIT Liaqat Ali stopped on road a truck and on refusal to fulfill his illegal demands by importer, he made out the case of mis-declaration and goods along with vehicle were seized unlawfully. \nGenuine importers are disturbed on routine basis by such few officers of the DIT and they have finally approached the FBR chairman Tariq Pasha for redressal of their issues. They demanded of the FBR Chairman to take necessary action against the notorious officers for the eradication of corrupt practice and gross misconduct. 2017-12-07", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "liaqat ali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tariq pasha", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "customs intelligence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal board of revenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "customs directorate general of intelligence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dit sukkur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "customs directorate of intelligence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "customs act", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "karachi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faisalabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "multan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lahore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "punjab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamabad", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:55.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f110a8fcdee9b5837e2753f5b1ce2a58acfe2bad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rZxEMSci6mQbElRh1OAqI5f9vsssiCtxpmuCmrM6.xjd_DpZEIqQXrJG2qMX6UOTMJbWfw3Wwx9Psu88KhCxLMqpdJh81dfEhUR4y0DBHnj2REllt6U6U", "site_full": "www.stockhouse.com", "site": "stockhouse.com", "site_section": "http://www.stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard/v.nmx/nemaska-exploration-inc", "site_categories": ["religion", "sports", "football", "catholicism"], "section_title": "NEMASKA LITHIUM INC ( V.NMX ) stock message board and forum - Bullboard Discussion - Stockhouse Community ", "title": "NEMASKA LITHIUM INC ( V.NMX ) stock message board and forum - Bullboard Discussion - Stockhouse Community", "title_full": "NEMASKA LITHIUM INC ( V.NMX ) stock message board and forum - Bullboard Discussion - Stockhouse Community", "published": "2017-12-06T21:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.stockhouse.com/stockhouse/images/stockhouse-logo-og.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21479, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f110a8fcdee9b5837e2753f5b1ce2a58acfe2bad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rZxEMSci6mQbElRh1OAqI5f9vsssiCtxpmuCmrM6.xjd_DpZEIqQXrJG2qMX6UOTMJbWfw3Wwx9Psu88KhCxLMqpdJh81dfEhUR4y0DBHnj2REllt6U6U", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "electriqueman", "published": "2017-12-06T21:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "NEMASKA LITHIUM INC ( V.NMX ) stock message board and forum - Bullboard Discussion - Stockhouse Community", "text": "target price at 7$ to 8$ for a takeover minimum Nemaska Lithium (NMX.TO) themoneynarrative Company recommendations & reviews November 2, 2017 1 Minute NMX.TO is a Quebec-based miner and chemical company that is set to enter the big leagues. The company is already a small-scale lithium salts producer and, over the next year or two, will be building both a full-scale mine and a processing plant. Lithium is a key component in the production of batteries (among other things), which are the critical element of the transportation and energy storage revolution that is in its early days. This situation mirrors the revolutionary changes that occurred a century ago when transportation evolved from horses to internal combustion engines. While there are quite a number of small-cap lithium plays entering the market right now (and with good reason), NMX.TO is the best of the bunch, and an important component of any portfolio seeking reliable alpha over the next few years. Themoneynarrative has a 36-month target share price range of $9.73 \u2013 $14.59, subject always to the possibility of a takeover (not in the next year), which would be unlikely, in our opinion, at anything less than $7.00 \u2013 $8.00.\nExpected short term stock performance notes : Over the years, NMX.TO has experienced fairly dramatic stock price swings. This is to be expected with a small-cap mining and industrial play, which by its very nature has a long development timeframe. Investors today (November 2, 2017) may be anxious about the timing of full financing for the mine and processing plant, but any retracement of the share price should be short-lived. CEO Guy Bourassa and his team are justifiably cautious about getting the right deal, since it will be transformative of the company.
