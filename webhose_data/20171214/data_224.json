Around 252km in diameter, the metallic \u201cM-class\u201d asteroid 16 Psyche is the target of NASA\u2019s next mission to the belt of giant rocks that encircles the inner solar system. And the space agency now plans to visit it  much sooner  than originally planned.\nNot only has the launch has been brought forward one year to the summer of 2022, but NASA\u2019s scientists have also found a way to get to Psyche (pronounced SYKe-ee) much faster by taking a more efficient trajectory. The new route means the Psyche spacecraft won\u2019t have to swing around the Earth to build up speed and won\u2019t pass as close to the sun, so it needs less heat protection. It is now due to arrive in 2026, four years earlier than the original timeline.\nThe main aim of the journey to Psyshe is to gather more information about our own solar system. Psyche is one of many wandering members of the asteroid belt. Unlike the rest of its rocky neighbours, Psyche appears to be entirely made of nickel and iron, just like the Earth\u2019s core. This, together with its size, has led to the theory that it might be the remains of the inside of a planet.\nAsteroids are made up of  primitive materials , leftovers from the dust cloud from which our solar system originated. Different types of asteroids resemble the various steps it took to form planets from this dust cloud. This means they reveal a lot about the  origin and evolution of our solar system .  Scientists think  Psyche could be what\u2019s left of an exposed metal core of a planet very similar to Earth.\nWe actually derive much of our knowledge about asteroids and the evolution of planets from the  study of meteorites . Many asteroids and comets are primitive  protoplanetary bodies  accumulated from the same dust cloud our solar system originates from. As these protoplanetary bodies collide, gravity pulls them together into ever-larger bodies. Eventually these bodies become big and hot enough to partially melt, allowing heavy materials such as iron to sink to the core \u2013 and lighter material such as silicon to rise to the surface.\nThis process, known as  differentiation , explains why Earth and other planets such as Mercury, Venus or Mars have an iron core and silicon-rich mantle and crust. The 16 Psyche asteroid is thought to be the leftover iron core of a planet stripped of its mantle in a giant collision.\nBut many questions regarding the formation of Psyche remain. How do you strip a planet of its mantle only leaving the core? Perhaps there is an alternative formation mechanism of an iron-rich body that does not involve differentiation? Psyche may once have been molten and, if so, did it cool from the inside out or from its surface to the core?\nAlso,  Earth\u2019s magnetic field  comes from a liquid outer core circling around a solid inner core. Did these processes occur on Psyche and create a magnetic field? What elements other than iron accumulate in a core? And how does the surface geology of an iron body look compared to a rocky or icy body?\nAvoiding Collisions There are other reasons for visiting asteroids. For one thing, possible collisions with Earth can have devastating effects. The impact of a 15km-wide  asteroid approximately  65m years ago is linked to the  extinction of the dinosaurs . And the explosion of the 30m diameter  Chelyabinsk asteroid  over Russia in 2013 led to injuries and damage on the ground. We need to know as much as possible about the composition and physical make-up of asteroids to devise the best ways to defend our planet.\nAsteroids also provide resources. Those containing water or other valuable materials may act as stepping stones for human exploration of the solar system. And asteroids crossing Earth\u2019s orbit may become convenient targets for mining operations, providing materials that are running out on Earth and potentially taking environmentally detrimental extraction methods off Earth. Companies including  Planetary Resources  and countries like  Luxembourg  have already started to pursue these ideas in earnest.\nThe Psyche spacecraft will carry four instruments to gather as much information about the asteroid as it can: a camera, a  gamma-ray spectrometer  to record what chemical elements are there, a magnetometer, and a radio gravity experiment. The data these devices collect should help us work out if Psyche is the frozen core of a former planet or simply a lump of unmelted metal. If it is a core, then it might help us determine exactly what\u2019s at the centre of our own planet.\nLindy Elkins-Tanton, the lead scientist of the mission, probably summarised it best:  \u201cWe learn about inner space by visiting outer space\u201d .\nChristian Schroeder is Senior Lecturer in Environmental Science and Planetary Exploration at University of Stirling. \nThis article was originally published in The Conversation .

It was the Lord\u2019s own house, planned, directed, and modeled by him. King Solomon built this first earthly building for God, totally dedicated and devoted to his honor. Which granted it a special sort of beauty. \nHarsh and violent sounds were out-of-place in this divine building, so the workers formed each piece at separate preparation sites. Yet when brought together at the building site, they fit with perfect precision. A feat unparalleled in architectural history. And it was done without noise. The temple was erected in silence \u2014 and that silence that speaks loudly. \u201cSolomon\u2019s temple is the most wonderful and interesting building in the world\u2019s history. It was \u2018the mysterious centre of Israel.\u2019 It was far more to Israel than the Vatican is to Rome. It was, so long as it stood, God\u2019s only earthly palace and temple. The Pyramids of Egypt were old when it was built, and they show no signs of decay. Solomon\u2019s temple utterly perished after four centuries. Greek and Roman artists have given the laws of beautiful and stately architecture to the world, but no one has ever dreamed of copying, in any respect, the sacred building at Jerusalem. Brunelleschi\u2019s dome at Florence, St. Peter\u2019s at Rome, the Milan Cathedral are almost miracles of daring genius and patient toil. The temple was in comparison a homely and plain building in its style. Its size was, as compared with these, small and insignificant. Yet God in a peculiar sense was its architect. He filled it with His glory. \u2018His eyes and His heart were there\u2019.\u201d ( Biblical Illustrator by Monday Club Sermons; CC0 .) \nGod\u2019s presence there was palpable and tangible. As though his heart and his eyes were looking into and out through it. God often works his wonders and marvels in holy silence. \nHe created the heavens, the earth, and all that is in them without a lot of noise and clamor. And he still works, in nature and in the spirit, so silently that we sometimes scarcely realize he is at work. \nEnemies later destroyed the temple with axes, hammers, and a roar, ( Psalm 74:4-6 ). For \u201cclamor and violence often hinder the word of God, but never further it. Quietness and stillness both become and befriend it.\u201d The temple was built in silence. ( Matthew Henry\u2019s Full Commentary ; CC0 ). And God is still building in quiet stillness today. He comes softly. \nHe\u2019s changing us quietly on the inside. So that, just as with the temple, others may sense his presence. And his glory and goodness will shine out from our lives. \nAnd this we can do without a lot of noise and clamor. Without shouting, \u201cLook at me! I\u2019m a Christian!\u201d For it will show by the way we treat others. Through our attitude toward money and things. And in the words we say or don\u2019t say. Can others sense God\u2019s quiet presence in us? Do they see God? \n[Image by Lumo Project via FreeBibleImages.org ; All rights reserved, For educational purposes only.

You hear a lot about labors of love, but this is the real thing \nSpring is their first runway collection after several warm-up seasons during which they re-established their fashion bonafides; the Colovoses were creative directors at Helmut Lang for eight years (a label that is also getting a runway rebirth today at the hands of Hood By Air founder, Shayne Oliver). Those who\u2019ve been watching and wearing the Colovoses\u2019 new collection know it to be minimal with an arty streak, very much in Nicole\u2019s own image. They make relatable clothes, not runway statements: leather sweatshirts, dark-rinse jeans, asymmetric shirtdresses\u2014the kinds of things a busy downtown mom who\u2019s spent her adult life in fashion needs on a regular basis. \n So how did they respond to the pressure of the runway? Quite gracefully. The show-opening loose-fit trench set an easeful silhouette, one which extended to their tailoring: Jacket volumes were lightly gathered in back. Dresses layered over pants, a look that can tend to feel contrived, conjured instead a nonchalant can-do quality. Webbed nylon shoulder straps on dresses were likewise evocative of utility. You\u2019ll never sell this mom on the needfulness of a corselet worn on top of a button-down, but that was their only obvious nod to trendiness. The Colovoses are jean experts from the early days; Habitual denim was their first love child. They showed their denim head to toe today, and the jeans had a baggy-but-tapered fit that looked current. \n\n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael colovos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicole", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helmut lang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shayne oliver", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fow24news.com nicole", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tribeca", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:53.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8006d1c1cb2e20e1519e1e1533d2f4e39d519261", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9rBLL4XXjNUD8HccsGlOCdJWXf9FXdCNQRzAMyXpR94ptkzT5iqX3QHYOFblJ0Tuizyz9.DRueDviqAIesDw.WUWvZat1U6MtEkUNASUaWulVjZXcq3rqj", "site_full": "www.audizine.com", "site": "audizine.com", "site_section": "http://www.audizine.com/forum/forumdisplay.php/60-B7-A4", "site_categories": ["auto_racing", "sports"], "section_title": "B7 A4", "title": "Brembo 18z Budget BBK Rotor question", "title_full": "Brembo 18z Budget BBK Rotor question", "published": "2017-12-07T07:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 30572, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "042ed409b3cd235ebc6e282706161f478bb870d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9rBLL4XXjNUD8HccsGlOCdJWXf9FXdCNQRzAMyXpR94ptkzT5iqX3QHYOFblJ0Tuizyz9.DRueDviqAIesDw.WUWvZat1U6MtEkUNASUaWuh6niIDXtnqnSNa1BcS6tZM-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "smot4200", "published": "2017-12-07T07:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I have some 345mm not drilled and slotted for sale.

I am over weight but all tests done come back saying everythings in working order. No pos, my thyroids good, the whole 9 yards. I know this doesn't mean I should stay overweight I am trying to eat better and I'm gonna start small exercises to lessen the anxiety. Alright so around thanksgiving, about a week before I started my period I began having severe anxiety and panic attacks like back to back. I felt awful like the world was about to end. I'm such a baby with feeling sick and stuff I just wanted to lay down and cry. I don't wanna die but i was definitely thinking that if I had to feel this way my whole life I definitely don't wanna be here. But while on my period things were for the most part okay, small jolts of anxiety here and there but definitely nothing like the week prior. I was so grateful but honestly feeling a bit embarrased cause i acted like a complete child in front of my family. Hell, I even slept next to my mother for a week cause it was almost calming. It helped me get about 2 hours of sleep at night when the anxiety was so bad. Sorry, anyways I went to my doctor yesterday (dec 6th) for a physical and she recommended larin fe 1.5/30 to try and regulate my period. I took 2 around 9pm as she said to try and get back the days I missed for not starting on sunday, if that makes sense. I also got a shot for meningitis and I'm not very fond of shots so that did give me a little anxiety but not enough to make me unable to sleep. it's now 3am and I haven't been able to sleep since 12 cause I'm just feeling pretty anxious. Not as bad as before but it's still very unpleasant. I'm just wondering if the Larin fe 1.5/30 could be causing my anxiety to act up?

Funding Circle, the world's leading lending platform for small businesses, today announced that investors have lent more than $5 billion globally to small businesses through the Funding Circle platform. This has supported a network of 40,000 businesses across the UK, USA , Germany and the Netherlands and helped to create more than 100,000 new jobs.*\nToday's news follows a record November for Funding Circle globally with the business facilitating more than $260 million of lending, including $175 million in the UK (\u00a3130m), $70 million in the US and $15 million in Continental Europe (\u20ac14.5m). Together this has helped thousands of business owners to access fast, transparent finance to grow their businesses, and will lead to an estimated 7,500 new jobs.\nWith US businesses now having accessed more than $1 billion in funding through the platform, Funding Circle becomes the first lending platform anywhere in the world to have facilitated more than $1 billion across two markets. Since 2014, Funding Circle has helped approximately 6,700 US businesses access financing. In a recent survey of US business owners who have borrowed through Funding Circle, 92% said they would come back to Funding Circle for their future business financing needs,** 85% said their experience was faster than their previous borrowing experience, and 73% said it was more transparent.\nSamir Desai , CEO and co-founder of Funding Circle said: \"Today's milestones now make Funding Circle the world's largest small business lending platform by loans outstanding and new monthly originations. We are proud to see that Funding Circle is quickly becoming the first choice for finance for small businesses globally. With revenues growing 80% in 2017 and our UK business cashflow positive, we look forward to continuing to build on the strong foundations we have put in place this year and helping many more thousands of businesses in 2018.\"\nSpeaking about the success of the US business, Sam Hodges , co-founder and US managing director of Funding Circle said: \"Small businesses are responsible for most net new jobs in America***. Yet too many of them can't expand because of difficulty obtaining an affordable loan. Our platform enables growth in the real economy, by more efficiently connecting this unmet credit demand to credit supply in the form of fixed-income investors.\"\nLaunched in 2010, the Funding Circle model has opened up small business lending to a wide range of investors, including 70,000 individuals, local and national government, the European Investment Bank and financial institutions such as pension funds. By improving competition in the market and reducing dependency on bank lending, Funding Circle is helping small businesses to boost their local economies and communities through much-needed job creation.\nBy bringing together industry-leading risk management and cutting-edge technology, creditworthy businesses typically access the capital they need in days rather than months.\nAbout Funding Circle\nFunding Circle ( www.fundingcircle.com ) is the world's leading lending platform for small businesses, matching investors to businesses who want to grow in the UK, U.S. and Europe . Since launching in 2010, investors at Funding Circle \u2013 including 70,000 individuals, local and national government and financial institutions \u2013 have now lent $5 billion to more than 40,000 businesses globally. Approximately 10% of investor money now comes from government sources, including the British Business Bank, European Investment Bank, KfW, the German government-owned development bank, and local councils across the UK. The business has raised \u00a3250m in equity capital from the same investors that backed Facebook, Twitter and Airbnb.\n* ' Small Business, Big Impact ' research commissioned by Funding Circle from the Centre for Economics and Business Research, August 2016 .\n** Based on an online survey of US Funding Circle borrowers.
