Akshardham Temple - This modern Hindu temple located on the outskirts of Delhi literally made my jaw drop, it\\'s that amazing.

People on Medicaid are prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But a new survey says that\u2019... \nBy RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVARAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - People on Medicaid are more prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.

He urged Arab countries with diplomatic relations with Israel to recall their ambassadors and to expel Israeli diplomats from their countries. He also called on the Palestine Liberation Organization to rescind its recognition of Israel and the Oslo Accords and for \"increased resistance throughout Palestine including the West Bank.\"\nFollowing a situation assessment, the Israeli army has decided to reinforce its presence in the West Bank with several additional battalions as well as other steps there. Forces were also placed on alert for possible additional developments.\nJack Khoury\nHaaretz Correspondent \nJack Khoury   Jack Khoury   Jack Khoury\n  Want  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald   jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ismail haniyeh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "haaretz", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:45.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fca23cb05e69801ce852064702533196ce40d118", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc6Br82HxGUakIm5Fd_iFVAHdXMNsmP2Upy7ywDX4jQYX1exHUGOcZU05yLOB5XEswukKrfgE3YYeKbmgeUCowt411mizDC0_E-", "site_full": "creativeworksofallabhyaghosh.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://creativeworksofallabhyaghosh.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "\u0985\u09b2\u09ad\u09cd\u09af \u09b0\u099a\u09a8\u09be \u09b8\u09ae\u0997\u09cd\u09b0", "title": "\u0986\u09ae\u09be\u09b0 \u09b0\u09ac\u09c0\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09cd\u09b0\u09a8\u09be\u09a5(\u0995\u09ac\u09bf\u09a4\u09be \u09aa\u09be\u09a0)\u09b0\u09ac\u09c0\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09cd\u09b0\u09a8\u09be\u09a5\u09c7\u09b0 \u09b8\u09be\u09a5\u09c7 \u0985\u09ae\u09bf\u09b2 \u0986\u09ae\u09be\u09b0 \u09b6\u09b0\u09c0\u09b0\u09c7; \u09ae\u09bf\u09b2 \u0986\u09a4\u09cd\u09ae\u09be\u09df\u0964", "title_full": "\u0986\u09ae\u09be\u09b0 \u09b0\u09ac\u09c0\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09cd\u09b0\u09a8\u09be\u09a5(\u0995\u09ac\u09bf\u09a4\u09be \u09aa\u09be\u09a0)\u09b0\u09ac\u09c0\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09cd\u09b0\u09a8\u09be\u09a5\u09c7\u09b0 \u09b8\u09be\u09a5\u09c7 \u0985\u09ae\u09bf\u09b2 \u0986\u09ae\u09be\u09b0 \u09b6\u09b0\u09c0\u09b0\u09c7; \u09ae\u09bf\u09b2 \u0986\u09a4\u09cd\u09ae\u09be\u09df\u0964", "published": "2017-12-07T11:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "BD", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fca23cb05e69801ce852064702533196ce40d118", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc6Br82HxGUakIm5Fd_iFVAHdXMNsmP2Upy7ywDX4jQYX1exHUGOcZU05yLOB5XEswukKrfgE3YYeKbmgeUCowt411mizDC0_E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Allabhya Ghosh (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u0986\u09ae\u09be\u09b0 \u09b0\u09ac\u09c0\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09cd\u09b0\u09a8\u09be\u09a5(\u0995\u09ac\u09bf\u09a4\u09be \u09aa\u09be\u09a0)\u09b0\u09ac\u09c0\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09cd\u09b0\u09a8\u09be\u09a5\u09c7\u09b0 \u09b8\u09be\u09a5\u09c7 \u0985\u09ae\u09bf\u09b2 \u0986\u09ae\u09be\u09b0 \u09b6\u09b0\u09c0\u09b0\u09c7; \u09ae\u09bf\u09b2 \u0986\u09a4\u09cd\u09ae\u09be\u09df\u0964", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:45.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a67ee36556ed7f51858dec8104b5594038e3f89b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzGJEXxCmydAynOA_IX9MEz.c7fO4Oeen.YDscLi0sd.kkbQgwcLxGFpFzpO2bmKQBj9oZScZV_Acm78ZfJoamikRVDAqX_1_TZXtxlGZVc9A--", "site_full": "finance2tips.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://finance2tips.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Finance", "title": "How Pet Owners Can Cut Costs, With Bob Jain", "title_full": "How Pet Owners Can Cut Costs, With Bob Jain", "published": "2017-12-07T11:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a67ee36556ed7f51858dec8104b5594038e3f89b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzGJEXxCmydAynOA_IX9MEz.c7fO4Oeen.YDscLi0sd.kkbQgwcLxGFpFzpO2bmKQBj9oZScZV_Acm78ZfJoamikRVDAqX_1_TZXtxlGZVc9A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "SURESH DORNALA (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "How Pet Owners Can Cut Costs, With Bob Jain", "text": "By Jason McDonald \n\nPet owners understand the importance of responsibility, which is a topic that's nothing short of diverse. Not only must these men and women be able to keep up with food costs, but medical expenses as well; these are just a few areas to cover. These cost money, though, so it's in every pet owner's best interest to know how to manage costs. The following financial tips, provided by Bob Jain , will go a long way in this respect.\n\nOne of the best ways for pet owners to cut costs is by shopping online. After all, there exists a bevy of deals and coupons that can be found online that may not be available at retail. It's in your best interest to take advantage of these opportunities so that you can save money on everything your pet needs, food included. The Internet is an invaluable money-saving tool and names such as Robert Jain would be hard-pressed to disagree.\n\nMedical bills can be costly, but you can reduce these by ensuring your pet gets the most exercise possible. For example, if the weather is supposed to be nice during the weekend, perhaps you can set time aside for a walk during the morning or afternoon. Not only will you be able to get your pet the exercise they need, but it can bring you closer together as well. In addition, and this goes without saying, this can help save money on medical bills in the future.\n\nYou should also consider toys and how many your pet actually needs. While you may think that more is better, your animal friend doesn't need more than a few, especially since pets are known to gravitate toward certain ones. With this in mind, make sure that you rotate your pet's toys on a routine basis. Not only will this keep them in good condition, but you won't have to spend more on them than what's absolutely necessary.\n\nAnother way to keep costs low is by assessing the need for pet clothing. While it might be cute to dress your dog or cat up, the truth is that they aren't necessary for comfort or health reasons. For example, if you live in a relatively warm area of the world, your pet may not need the small hoodie as much as you think. Every situation is different, but you shouldn't assume that your pet needs clothes right off the bat.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about finance in general, kindly contact Bob Jain . \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jason mcdonald   pet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob jain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert jain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:45.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f870d8a4f78a535564f6c668371c2e0affc04d40", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9tBJn2N3S4qh_usT_FlqKIHSI7B_XQWT4luH2shR1AsolMIPrfCucRWjBP1f1IjAO50QT8_WxbdZ27.BoLIYLUKhBrDVjgXvMaAf236X1PkA--", "site_full": "www.worldanimals2014.tk", "site": "worldanimals2014.tk", "site_section": "http://www.worldanimals2014.tk/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "world animals", "title": "Money-Saving Tips For Pet Owners, From Bob Jain", "title_full": "Money-Saving Tips For Pet Owners, From Bob Jain", "published": "2017-12-07T11:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "TK", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f870d8a4f78a535564f6c668371c2e0affc04d40", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9tBJn2N3S4qh_usT_FlqKIHSI7B_XQWT4luH2shR1AsolMIPrfCucRWjBP1f1IjAO50QT8_WxbdZ27.BoLIYLUKhBrDVjgXvMaAf236X1PkA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Android Games (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "Money-Saving Tips For Pet Owners, From Bob Jain", "text": "By Jason McDonald \n\nAnyone that has a pet will tell you that this costs money. Not only do the costs in question apply to the adoption process, but spending related to food, medical care, and the like must be taken into account as well. Even though costs can rack up in a hurry, these can be cut to certain degrees if you know how to save money. These are just a few ways that it can be done, courtesy of financial minds along the lines of Bob Jain .\n\nAccording to authorities on finance like Robert Jain , pet owners can save money by going online. While it may be difficult to find the food your pet needs in an instant, it's still possible to uncover coupons. These can help you save tremendous amounts of money in the long term, meaning that you should go online often to see what deals are available. You'll be amazed by how far you can go by going online for a few minutes each day.\n\nWhat about the high costs associated with medical bills? These can be reduced if you make it a point to get your dog the exercise they need. For dogs, this is relatively easy, as walks can be taken during days with nice weather. Cats aren't as likely to play outside, but they can still exercise indoors with the use of balls of yarn, feather wands, and the like. The more active your pets are, the less they will cost you when it comes to medical visits and procedures.\n\nYou can save even more money when shopping for toys, too. Make sure that you shop online, as mentioned earlier, and go only for toys that have been said to last longest. Furthermore, rotate your pet's toys around so that they aren't fixated on certain ones. This is a great way to keep them from breaking or tearing sooner than expected. You won't have to continually buy more toys, which goes a long way in cutting costs as well.\n\nClothes might be cute for your pet, but you have to consider if they really need them. This is heavily dependent on where you live; if you reside in an area that becomes extremely cold during the winter months, you'd be wise to invest in a sweater. Pets that have short or thin fur will be in greater need of clothing. Otherwise, you may want to keep pet clothes out of the equation, as this will save you even more money.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nIf you'd care to discover more regarding finance in general, kindly contact Bob Jain . \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob jain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason mcdonald   anyone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert jain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:45.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6d724678e128671ede68cecaa2149f21bea6cf30", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLs7ViL0YLlc0RLmbwXfWbmrWH_0pqC1ISane_8tAvMI1DaYfpVpkvFqumhLB4y.IQ_SF3W06UGmP5U4DgI8Uo_tZKvs7s.MduTL9IyLyOAajg--", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/json?page=26&sort=newest&pagesize=30&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'json' Questions - Page 26 - Stack Overflow", "title": "websocket - How can I get JSON data from the server by using Autobhan(Crossbar)", "title_full": "websocket - How can I get JSON data from the server by using Autobhan(Crossbar) - Stack Overflow", "published": "2017-12-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ac5f47d89f8f5af78928af2bb5efbcd57f4f3f4e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLs7ViL0YLlc0RLmbwXfWbmrWH_0pqC1ISane_8tAvMI1DaYfpVpkvFqumhLB4y.IQ_SF3W06UGmP5U4DgI8Uo_tZKvs7s.MduST4apCT1IWOkVm04O5EZar", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Gil", "published": "2017-12-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I find a way to get data from the crossbar.\nI was supposed to use autobahn library.\nThis is my solution:\nvar connection = new autobahn.Connection({ url : 'server url', realm: 'realm1'\n});\nconnection.onopen = function (session) {\nconsole.log('websocket is connected ...') session.subscribe('com.example.example', function(message) { console.log(message); }\n}\nconnection.open();\nI hope this answer will be helpful to someone.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:45.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a0b23a4fff0d56a307d6c1bc6c6181af1b03c3b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaUuykzeLb6_.7x6yAu5i4LSEDt.SE88RPJRtgOWDU5oQaruf8RVOnVZJ.W9NKyXSklCQsDb18IJYILiW6Od_cFzkkjoTVgeP_", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/Nassau-Hoteis.d601784.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Nassau: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "Bay View Suites Paradise Island:", "title_full": "Bay View Suites Paradise Island: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-06-29T07:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ca160992d1b798ed24ba81a535717ed9f083876", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaUuykzeLb6_.7x6yAu5i4LSEDt.SE88RPJRtgOWDU5oQaruf8RVOnVZJ.W9NKyXSklCQsDb18IJYILiW6Od_cFy6O412iD8Gx1XK_79O0uYjFDSqF.duqm_xE3.OfZvMw", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-29T04:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "We went to Bay View after we stayed at Atlantis Beach tower.

However, those close to Abbas say the long era of stop-and-go negotiations and Washington's monopoly as mediator is now over.\nHere is a look at what could come next.\nWHY JERUSALEM MATTERS\nTrump's recognition Wednesday of Jerusalem as Israel's capital contradicts longstanding international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the holy city will be determined in negotiations. With Trump's sharp pivot, the U.S. is seen as siding with Israel, which claims all of Jerusalem, including the Israeli-annexed eastern sector the Palestinians seek as a future capital.\nThe dispute over Jerusalem forms the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but transcends a mere real estate argument. The city, home to Judaism's holiest site, is also sacred to billions of Muslims and Christians worldwide, and perceived slights to their claims have triggered major protests or violence in the past.\nABBAS' RESPONSE SO FAR\nAbbas has been trying to rally international support, reaching out to leaders from Pope Francis to the EU foreign policy chief and Arab leaders. He warned Trump in a phone call that the U.S. shift will rock the region and threaten Washington's plans for a Mideast peace deal.\nIn a speech after Trump's announcement, Abbas said the U.S. has effectively removed itself from any role as a Mideast broker, but he did not say what immediate steps, if any, the Palestinians plan to take.\nAbbas is to hold internal consultations with officials from the Palestine Liberation Organization and his Fatah party. On Thursday, he met with his closest Arab ally, King Abdullah II of Jordan.\nA MOMENT OF TRUTH?\nThe crisis over Jerusalem may push Abbas, the most steadfast Palestinian champion of seeking statehood through negotiations, to a point he avoided for so long \u2014 acknowledgment that the \"peace process\" isn't working, at least in its current format.\nCritics have argued that endless negotiations mainly serve Israel by providing diplomatic cover for its expansion of settlements on war-won lands. Abbas also derived some political legitimacy from the process, positioning himself as the only leader with a shot at delivering statehood.\nTrump says he remains committed to brokering a Mideast deal, despite the Jerusalem pivot. However, those close to Abbas say it's time to look for alternatives.\nAny talks with U.S. officials are now \"superfluous and irrelevant,\" said Hanan Ashrawi, a senior PLO official. \"The peace process is finished.\"\nAbbas has warned in the past that a failure to achieve a so-called two-state solution could prompt Palestinians to pursue a single state for two peoples, a prospect most Israelis reject.\nThe Palestinian leader may be reluctant to break away from his longstanding policies or lack the political courage to do so, but not shifting course now would be worse, said analyst Bassem Zbaidi.\n\"It's time for the Palestinians to say no before coming under pressure to accept\" future U.S. proposals that could fall far short of their minimal demands, he said.\nOTHER OPTIONS?\nSome PLO and Fatah officials suggested shifting from cooperation with the U.S. and avoidance of conflict with Israel to a more confrontational approach.\nFatah supports halting contacts with the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, closing the PLO office in Washington and filing a complaint against the U.S. at the U.N. Security Council over plans to start a multi-year process of moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, said senior Fatah official Nasser al-Kidwa.\nThe Palestinians could also try to press prosecutors at the International Criminal Court to charge Israeli leaders with war crimes, including over settlement building, others said.\nAbbas has refrained from such a step until now, under apparent U.S. pressure.\nThe International Criminal Court prosecutor is currently conducting a preliminary examination of the situation in the Palestinian territories, but this is a more open-ended review and could take years. The probe was triggered by \"Palestine\" becoming a member state of the court. The status change, in turn, was made possible by the 2012 U.N. General Assembly recognition of a state of Palestine in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, the lands Israel captured in 1967.\nHELP FROM EUROPE?\nThe Palestinians are increasingly looking to Europe for help, encouraged by the harsh criticism of Trump's Jerusalem policy by European leaders.\nEuropean states in the past were relegated by Washington to the role of paymaster, sending hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to support the Palestinian self-rule government and help manage the long-running conflict.\nEuropean states often take a more critical view of Israeli policies than the U.S, especially on settlements, but have failed to challenge Washington's monopoly as mediator.\nPalestinians now hope the growing rift between European leaders and the U.S. over Jerusalem will earn them diplomatic points. An immediate goal is to persuade influential Western European countries to recognize a state of Palestine.\nRISK OR OPPORTUNITY?\nFor Palestinians, Trump's policy shift offers both risk and opportunity.\nJerusalem has repeatedly been a flashpoint for violence, and Palestinian protest marches planned later this week could lead to clashes with Israeli troops.\nSuch confrontations can spin out of control, as they did more than a decade ago when they escalated into an armed uprising. Abbas staunchly opposes violence as counterproductive, but he may not be able to contain widespread public anger.\nSome say Trump's policy shift may create a moment of clarity and help end years of paralysis \u2014 by making it impossible to perpetuate the idea that statehood is possible under the old paradigm.\n\"That option is now off the table and that's a good thing,\" said Diana Buttu, a former legal adviser of the Palestinian self-rule government. \"This had really held us up for so many years.\"\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAssociated Press writer Mohammed Daraghmeh in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, contributed to this report.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nLaub, the AP bureau chief for Jordan, has covered the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since 1987.\nThis is an Associated Press analysis on what's next for the Palestinians following President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n0 Shares Email Star Comments Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

Before that I had never had such problems. I was really shocked and scared as I though that could be first signs of some serious sexually transmitted disease. I was scared even in spite of the fact that I have never had anything like chaotic sexual relations or sex with unknown people. I had sex with stable boyfriends only and I trusted them just like they trusted me. However recently I had my skin damaged in the vagina area when I developed something like allergy to metal parts of my new swimming suit. The doctor made some tests and told me that the warts developed with the skin infection. He prescribed me with Podofilox and this medication helped me get rid of the warts in less than three weeks. Now there is no single sign of the warts and I am happy there were no more serious problems or complications. And I would definitely recommend this medication to others with similar problems. Best Pharmacy - Buy Podophyllotoxin (Podofilox) Online And Save Up To 70% Last month I discovered what genital warts are - very nasty pimples that can spoil your whole sexual life for a while. Until you start using Podofilox - this medication is really very effective when it comes to genital warts treatment. In my case 3 days were enough for Podofilox to help me get rid of the warts completely. At first it was a shock for me as I though it was some serious sexually transmitted disease that will affect my life and will require serious and long-term treatment. But then my sister explained me that the problem can be easily solved, I just had to visit my doctor and ask him for a prescription medication. The warts were around my anus and vagina. They caused only minor itching but I felt like a pornofilm actress. I don't know why I developed the warts, I have sex with my boyfriend only and before there were no problems. But I am happy that with the help of Podofilox I was able to easily solve this little but very unpleasant issue. buy podophyllotoxin online singapore cheapest podophyllotoxin purchase shopping europe podophyllotoxin order now shopping Also discounts are available for our second-time customers. cheap podophyllotoxin quick delivery if bags podowarts medicine unfortunate cytotoxic agent podophyllotoxin and cost brand podophyllotoxin 20 month mg order murderers some podophyllotoxin marry medicine nonsense cytotoxic agent how much teach does owner podowarts visit at walmart buy warticon cure genital warts hong kong price wonderful condyline crack cure genital warts buy buy podophyllotoxin wants with credit fulfill card two are semisynthetic derivatives of podophyllotoxin cheap condylox forum cost according of podophyllotoxin formula cream buy surely podophyllotoxin over counter podophyllotoxin cure genital doesn warts get matt you high how much does surgery 100mg locate podofilox mean medicine advise genital warts generic podophyllotoxin with prescription podofilox either canada suffer pharmacy online The principal reason for the reduced price of generic medicines is that the creation of the generic drug runs up less cost and therefore a lower price can be offered and still maintain profitability.

He is a leading strategy consultant advising big businesses. Source: Getty Atif Sheikh \nOn the face of it, those who know me will be thinking this is a weird choice. Why? Because I have a full-blown fear of flying. \nBut those who share my irrational phobia might understand. When you fear flying \u2013 and it is an inevitable part of your business life \u2013 you tend to develop a deep fascination for airlines. \nOf all the airlines, there is only one I would want to run. The grand dame of flying. A classic. Our national carrier. A symbol of British pride. Or at least it used to be. \nDigital disruption has taken off \nIt is no secret that aviation has long been disrupted. \nThere have been huge increases in the cost of fuel, a rapid expansion of no frills carriers, and of course digital has had an impact on everything \u2013 from pricing to customer experience. \nThese forces have made it a tough place to be for the once dominant national airline. \nThe subsequent pressures on cabin crew pay and conditions, the raft of strikes, and the diminishing reputation of British Airways have only made things tougher. \nTransporting British values around the world \nSo why on earth would I want to step into this lion\u2019s den? Because, as a national carrier with the kind of heritage British Airways has, there is a massive opportunity. \nAnd I believe that opportunity is going untapped. \nIn the age of disruption, British Airways has a uniquely important role to play. \nIt quite literally transports British values all over the world. Modesty. Pride. Fairness. Ingenuity. Professionalism. At our best, this is still who we are in this country. \nAnd this is what British Airways ought to be at its best. But how clear are the airline\u2019s values? \nHaving a good altitude \nAs we exit the European Union, BA\u2019s role takes on an even sharper practical significance. Britain\u2019s businesspeople will need more than ever to strike out globally and serve the world entire. \nBritish Airways could put itself at the heart of that national effort. It could even set that as its mission. \nIt could perhaps create new services to help those businesspeople thrive and succeed as they go out to trade and grow the British economy. What opportunities could lie in really being a champion of British aspirations? \nThe competitive cousin \nReturning to my fear of flying, there is a final more selfish reason for my desire to supplant Alex Cruz. \nAt a pure brand level, I have always thought BA should, if anything, relish the difference between itself and Virgin. It can feel a little like BA looks in the mirror and frets and worries that it is indeed Virgin\u2019s frumpier cousin. \nIt is estimated that over 30 per cent of people have a fear of flying. You know what we, in that 30 per cent really value and are prepared to pay more for? Not sexy uniforms and funny pilots. \nNo. We want to feel safe. We want British competence and understated warmth. Be that, BA. Be that with pride. \nCity A.M.'s opinion pages are a place for thought-provoking views and debate. These views are not necessarily shared by City A.M.
