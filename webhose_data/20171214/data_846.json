The Silence Breakers. Several women were featured on the magazine's cover, including Ashley Judd, Susan Fowler, Taylor Swift, Isabel Pascual, Adama Iwu, and a sixth woman who chose to remain anonymous. This year's six runners-up included President Donald Trump, China's President Xi Jinping, Ruber Mueller, Kim Jong-un, Colin Kaepernick and Patty Jenkins. Rape is rarely committed by strangers: Utah's intimate partner sexual abuse problem Each year, the designation is awarded to a person, group, idea, or object that has had the most influence on worldly events, \"for better or for worse.\" The focus on breaking the silence and offering support to sexual assault survivors has increased in recent years, particularly in 2017 after a slew of women and men have come forward with allegations against their assailants. Namely, Harvey Weinstein, the man who re-ignited the #MeToo social media campaign , inspiring millions of sexual assault survivors to speak up and share their stories of trauma, pain, survival, and healing. Several other high-profile individuals in Hollywood, politics, and more have been accused, including: Kevin Spacey, Louis CK, Matt Lauer, Jeffrey Tambor, George Takei, Roy Moore, Al Franken and more. For many years, Utah has had high instances of sexual assault and rape. A number of factors are believed to contribute to that problem. Here's a breakdown of several women and agencies who are working to resolve Utah's 1 in 3. Susan Madsen, Robbyn Scribner and the Utah Women and Leadership Project researchers \nAn infographic from the Utah Women and Leadership Project shows factors specific to Utah that may contribute to its high rate of depression among women. (Photo: Utah Women and Leadership Project) The UWLP is not a new organization; however, its recent, poignant research and expert recommendations for change in women's issues in Utah has brought forward several items of concern for the overall well-being of the state. Madsen, Scribner, and the researchers at UWLP have tackled complex issues such as women in education, the gender pay gap, women in politics, entrepreneurship participation among Utah women, women in STEM, poverty among Utah women, women and mental health, and much more. Not only does the UWLP research these specific problems that plague the modern-day Utahn, it also identifies where the research is lacking and assembles a call to action for civilians, legislators and business women in the Beehive State.

It's a problem handfuls of women in Short Creek \u2014 the community of dual cities Hildale and Colorado City, Arizona \u2014 have experienced simply because they were born into the patriarchal and more-often-than-not abusive nature of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. More: Rachel Jeffs, daughter of Warren Jeffs, describes abuse she endured in FLDS church According to Leona Bateman, founder of the Creekers Foundation , \"keeping sweet\" is expected of the wives involved in plural marriage arrangements, meaning there's no room for women to speak up unless they want to be ostracized by their husbands or exiled from their families and community. More: Meet the first-ever female candidate for Hildale mayor Short Creek has seen vast changes in recent years, though. The groundbreaking election in Hildale this year that will name Donia Jessop its first-ever female, non-FLDS mayor come January is all part of the town's move toward positive change. Jessop's big pushes include bringing infrastructure, recreational activities, an economic boost, and a revitalization of the community's rich history of a tight-knit tribe to the area. and other university women Buy Photo \nVictoria Willard, a former DSU student, is taking legal action against Dixie State University, alleging it is not in compliance with Title IX regulation. (Photo: Chris Caldwell / The Spectrum & Daily News) In June, Victoria Willard, a former undergraduate art student at Dixie State University, became the reason for an Office for Civil Rights investigation into DSU. She alleged the university not only committed a Title IX violation but that she was also denied due process along the way. More: Title IX: What is it and how does it impact you? The federal investigation was opened based on just one aspect of her multi-faceted case: When the school expelled Willard based on allegations set forth against her, did it fail to respond to her appeal after a resolution was made? And while former student Alannah Hall has not yet sought an additional appeal or investigation, she says the Title IX office actively chose to ignore significant pieces of evidence in her case, which changed its overall outcome dramatically. More: Title IX protections for Utah students may be falling short In particular, she alleges the office did not follow through with evidence that supported allegations against another student who was positively identified in her sexual assault examination kit. Several other universities in Utah are being looked into by the OCR, including Brigham Young University, the University of Utah, Utah Valley University and Weber State University. Many students who have incited OCR investigations believe and have built cases based on proof that school administrators did not follow Title IX guidelines in one way or another, therefore denying them access to due process in their cases. The OCR closed its investigation into DSU on Dec. 5, but legal proceedings in both cases are still in the works. Rep. Angela Romero for House Bill 200 Buy Photo \nUtah House of Representatives Rep. Angela Romero speaks at the annual SL.UT Walk of No Shame in Salt Lake City on Saturday, Sept. 30, 2017. (Photo: Chris Caldwell / The Spectrum & Daily News) During this year's legislative session, Utah House of Representatives Rep. Angela Romero sponsored HB 200, which requires law enforcement agencies to submit sexual assault evidence kits to state forensic testing labs within 30 days of retrieval. At the beginning of 2017, Utah had an estimated backlog of 2,700 untested kits across the state. Romero's bill was signed by Gov. Gary Herbert on March 22, appropriating $1.2 million to fund these reforms. According to a 2015 study from BYU, Washington County only submitted about 18 percent of its rape kits to its lab, while Salt Lake and Iron Counties sent about 40 percent. More: 4 things I learned at Utah's Slut Walk In October, Romero spoke at Utah's Slut Walk of No Shame, an annual event in Salt Lake City advocating and showing support for survivors of sexual assault. During her speech, Romero spoke of the difficulties of representing her district, saying \"there was really no voice for women\" at the time. \"The legislation that I passed last session, I was told over and over again by different people in the executive branch that, 'We just don't have the money,' or 'We don't have the funds for it,'\" Romero said. \"They kept putting me off and putting me off. This is a people's issue. it's not just about women. It's not just a women's issue.\" Follow reporter Emily Havens on Twitter, @ EmilyJHavens , and find her on Facebook at facebook.com/emilyjhavens .

about video games for the video gamer in your life Nathan Snow, Gamers Guide Published 9:57   A scene from 'Game Dev Tycoon' (Photo: Greenheart Games)   A few years ago I had the opportunity to teach a course in Video Game History at a University in Florida. I eagerly accepted the position, and for many semesters thoroughly enjoyed getting lost in the history of this fantastic medium with hundreds of students. While I obviously learned many things in those years, one thing still sticks out in my mind- video games had a tumultuous, exciting, wild-west style beginning. Greenheart Games, in their economic simulation \u201cGame Dev Tycoon,\u201d have managed to capture a large part of the freewheeling, creative spirit of those early years. The Game \u201cGame Dev Tycoon\u201d begins in a garage where you, a single developer, work alone to develop a game. Creating games is a matter of stages. First, you choose a genre and a type of game (a werewolf-themed action experience or a space-themed RPG) along with the platform you want to release it on and the game engine it will operate with. Right at the beginning the game already calls for strategy, because finding the right genre/type combination on the right platform is tricky enough. In the next three stages, you choose different aspects of the game you want to highlight: story, engine, gameplay, dialogue, level design, graphics, sound, and so on. It is in choosing which aspects to highlight that the game derives most of its challenge. Certain game types call for more emphasis on certain aspects over others. In an RPG, for instance, you want to focus more on story and dialogues while action games focus more on engine and artificial intelligence. Finding the right combinations for a hit game, researching new technologies, and growing your development company give \u201cGame Dev Tycoon\u201d nearly unlimited replay value. \nA scene from 'Game Dev Tycoon' (Photo: Greenheart Games) The Experience The overall premise does seem to speak more to video game lovers, though the strategy behind such a complex simulation should be a satisfying puzzle for anyone to figure out. The real joy of this game came after about half an hour of playing it. I was scratching my head wondering why my past three games had all met with mediocre reviews until I remembered my video game history and remade, as best as I could figure out, a duplicate of an early success from history. Unsurprisingly, the positive reviews came pouring in and soon I was out of the garage, researching new game technologies and hiring other designers. Any game that can approximate actual history with similar outcomes deserves time and attention. \nA scene from 'Game Dev Tycoon' (Photo: Greenheart Games)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nathan snow", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:51.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "94b70acdb557401cb888020b0bed2887c65543b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqb2fOxsoDj4KOC6wnpYD0iqYz5G0rz.hiFtzQZXmy8mIMrAV3F3xQLzYfR5I2ByOCvazlT5QbTpHjrfMhBoDql00_JVBnePr4YKsOFSyBj5A--", "site_full": "bostonherald.com", "site": "bostonherald.com", "site_section": "http://bostonherald.com/opinion/editorials", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Editorials | Boston Herald", "title": "Bright spot for Mass.

GOP Herald Staff Thursday, December 07, 2017 comments We\u2019re now up to four state senators who are likely to seek the Senate presidency, should Stan Rosenberg not survive the investigation into his husband\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct. But while Rosenberg is dealing with the personal and professional fallout of that situation and Democratic senators are jockeying internally for position, they might find themselves with an unfamiliar challenge on their hands \u2014 from Republicans.\nYes, the Worcester-Middlesex state Senate seat may just be the first casualty of the Bryon Hefner messiness. Surely some voters in Fitchburg, Leominster and surrounding communities who went to the polls in a special election Tuesday had the latest Beacon Hill scandal on their minds when they decided to flip a Democratic seat to a Republican, Dean Tran.\nWell, that and a slew of other issues that have not reflected well on Democratic leadership on Beacon Hill of late \u2014 the massive pay raise lawmakers voted for themselves to begin this session, for starters. The Senate Ethics Committee\u2019s mealy-mouthedness on whether a special investigator\u2019s report will be made public (that is the \u201cintention,\u201d they insist) is another cause for concern.\nOf course Republicans are still decidedly in the minority; once Tran is sworn in there will be only seven in the 40-member Senate. And the Republicans who have served in that chamber for years are very much creatures of the institution.\nBut the day will eventually come when voters realize that a single-party stranglehold on power on Beacon Hill is not in the best interest of the commonwealth.

Also, my air conditioner had a dehumidify setting that I used during transition that pulled 963-1008 watt... Keystone coolant based system is so much more efficient while also keeping the basement around 50% humidity no problem. It has a sensor that activates when needed to keep humidity levels within the set limits. I've setup my Keystone with a half-inch tubing to route water directly to the sewer to eliminate any maintenance need of dumping the water. Note: There isn't any pump involved, so will need gravity to prevent the water from backing up by placing the Keystone on a high point above a drain allowing gravity to take care of managing the water on its own.

(AP Photo/Sakchai Lalit) \nBangkok (AP) \u2013 A Bangkok court has sentenced a man to 27 years in prison for bombing a military hospital in what he said was an act of resistance to the country\u2019s government. \nThe Criminal Court on Wednesday found Wattana Pumret guilty of attempted premeditated murder, detonating a bomb and other charges linked to the blast that wounded 21 people at the Bangkok hospital. The attack took place on May 22, the third anniversary of the military coup that ousted the country\u2019s elected government. \nWattana pleaded guilty to the charges. \nWattana said at a police news conference in June that he bombed the hospital to defy military rule but didn\u2019t intend to harm anyone. \n\u201cI was inspired by my hatred for governments that come from military coups. Each coup has caused an economic disaster and restricted people\u2019s rights,\u201d he told reporters at the time. \nWattana has previously denied belonging to any specific political faction and insisting he acted alone.

The emulator is enhanced to simulate more than 20,000 subscribers to easily stress or load test 3G network. Additionally, along with various other call scenarios, the application also supports SMS over active Mobile-Mobile Voice Call, and Handover (Relocation) procedures. \nSpeaking to the press, Mr. Karthik Ramalingam, a Senior Manager for product development of the company said, \u201cMAPS\u2122 UMTS IuCS can simulate the IuCS interface between the RNC (Radio Network Controller) and the MSC (Mobile Switching Centre) nodes, and MAPS\u2122 UMTS IuH interface can simulate IuH interface between the Femto Home Node B (HnB), and a Femto Home Node Gateway (HnB-GW) by generating RANAP and DTAP signalling messages over SCTP.\u201d \nHe added, \u201cMAPS\u2122 UMTS IuCS also supports Iu-UP (Iu User Plane Interface) protocol with additional licensing to carry RTP traffic (AMR payload part) over Iu interface. Both applications support almost all standard protocols required for the accurate UMTS interfaces emulation.\u201d \nOn latest enhancements introduced, Mr.Ramalignam explained, \u201cIn real time scenario, there exists huge number of subscribers with unique UE parameters. GL\u2019s MAPS\u2122 tool supports bulk call generation to stress and load test the network with number of subscriber profiles. Each profile can have unique parameters to simulate different real-time scenarios. However, creating and maintaining massive number of XML based subscriber profiles with unique mobile identifiers such as IMSI, TMSI, MSISDN and traffic parameters is not feasible. \nHe further added, \u201cMAPS\u2122 also includes option to configure the ratio of SMS and Voice calls out of Total number of Calls. Considering 100% Total Calls, MAPS\u2122 will generate SMS calls and MO Voice calls as per the defined ratio. For example, if the configured SMS call Ratio = 30% in Testbed, then during bulk call simulation, MAPS\u2122 generates 30% SMS calls and remaining 70% of total calls generated will be MO Voice calls. \nThe enhanced emulator allows you to simulate a simultaneous SMS call while an UE is on active mobile-to-mobile voice call with another UE. Additionally, both Source RNC and Target RNC can be simulated within single testbed demonstrating Handover (Relocation) procedure for a UE in CONNECTED state carrying both the control signalling and the user data. \nThe application handles Handover (Relocation) Procedures for a UE in CONNECTED state carrying both the control signalling and the user data. Both Source RNC and Target RNC are simulated within single testbed demonstrating Relocation procedure to move the connection between the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the Core Network (CN) for the source RNC to the RAN for the target RNC\u201d \nImportant Features\u2022Simulates RNC, MSC, Home HnB and Home HN GW entities\u2022User controlled access to Mobility Management, Session Management, RANAP, and DTAP messages\u2022Supports RAB Assignment, Authentication, TMSI Reallocation, Encryption, and other procedures\u2022Ready scripts for Mobile Originating Voice/SMS Call, Mobile Terminating Voice/SMS Call, Location Updating, and Handover procedures for quick testing\u2022Supports sending SMS over an ongoing voice call\u2022Automated call generation and call reception\u2022Massive UE simulation with related information access directly from Database, or CSV files\u2022RTP traffic simulation supports the following actions for almost all Standard Codec. \n-Transmitting Voice Files-Transmitting DTMF, MF Digits, and Single and Dual Tones-Recording Voice Files-Monitoring Single and Dual Tones, DTMF, and MF digits-Loopback, Talk using Microphone, Play to Speaker \n\u2022Provides fault insertion, and erroneous call flows testing capability\u2022Impairments can be applied to messages to simulate error conditions\u2022Supports RTP traffic over Iu-UP protocol and also over normal RTP sessions (requires additional licenses)\u2022Supported Codecs: AMR & AMR-WB\u2022Supports customization of call flows and message templates using Script editor and Message editor\u2022Provides protocol trace with full message decoding, and graphical ladder diagrams of call flow with time stamp\u2022Protocol independent software architecture\u2022Provides call statistics and associated captured events and error events during call simulation \nAbout GL Communications Inc.,GL Communications Inc, is a global provider of test and measurement solutions and has over the years worked with major telecom equipment vendors, service providers, and system integrators to meet the testing requirements arising at various stages of telecom products development life cycle. \nGL offers a broad set of test solutions that help perform all types of testing on networks, from initial system design, to fine-tuning, troubleshooting, live deployment, and monitoring.

I told stories to my friends and family, and for a while I did not really understand how writing might be useful for something other than storytelling or making a list of Christmas presents I wanted. My relationship to storytelling was entirely intuitive, and as such my growth as a storyteller was no more noticeable to me than my body\u2019s growth. It just happened. \nWhich is why I am so grateful for the clients I work with now who are learning about storytelling as adults. It is as if I am being reacquainted with this essential art form. For instance, I did not understand until recently how stories require us to surrender to the artificial concept of time. Whether we perceive it or not, every one of us is always living in the Right Now. That\u2019s when everything is happening. As such, everything that\u2019s happening in the Right Now matters because it\u2019s reality and reality is all that ever matters. Time, meanwhile, is nothing but a dream of the past and future, which by definition are never reality. \nHave I lost you little? If so, this is why we have stories. The storyteller must ignore the reality of timelessness and say, \u201cThis happened and then that happened and then this and that happened, and then, finally, this really interesting and surprising and meaningful thing happened because of all the other things that happened before it.\u201d In this way, the storyteller reduces reality to a few manageable bits, organizing these bits in such a way that life seems to make sense. \nI suppose I was drawn to stories when I was a boy for this very reason. Kids live much more in the Right Now than adults. Play, a child\u2019s most important pursuit, is very much a Right Now activity. But every child knows he will become an adult, and I could sense that something other than play would be required of me then. I was not really happy about this, but I could not stop what we called time, but was actually just change, which was just growth, which was just learning \u2013 and so I told stories to remember what I might forget if I got lost in what I learned. \nIf you like the ideas and perspectives expressed here, feel free to me about individual and group coaching. \n\nYou can find William at : williamkenower.com Posted on", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "william", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:54.031+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3ece0c9ef070b7d37137aa9559927a6101dfed44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pnGWPqpHOtEFhiqOW0p9QQTQd1TJ.1jkn", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/trv/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/trv/ - Travel - 4chan", "title": "What bars are hipster/indie etc in LA?

Lexington Herald-Leader via AP Bill Estep Bookmobile delivers books to rural communities in Kentucky By BILL ESTEP Lexington Herald-Leader December 07, 2017 03:37 AM UPDATED 3 MINUTES AGO WHITLEY CITY, Ky. \nKaylee Lay, who is 5, was so happy to see the bookmobile pull up in front of her house in McCreary County recently that she ran outside with no shoes, then reached up for her mother to carry her over the rough ground. \n\"She got so excited,\" said her mother, Katie Lay. \"She said, 'The bookmobile's here!'\" \nThat kind of enthusiasm that has helped keep the largest fleet of bookmobiles in the nation operating in rural Kentucky, delivering books to people who often can't get to county-seat libraries. \nSupporters say bookmobiles play an important role in promoting reading at all ages, but especially among children, helping them do better in school.

SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"We just think having books in the hands of kids is really, really important, and it sets them up for life-long learning,\" said Rhonda Kendziorski, bookmobile and outreach librarian for the McCreary County Public Library. \nIn the most recent national count in 2014, 75 Kentucky counties had traditional bookmobiles, said Michael Swendrowski, a board member with the Association of Bookmobiles & Outreach Services. \nThe next closest states were Ohio and California with just over 50 each, he said. \nSeveral states reported having only a handful of bookmobiles \u2014 six in Texas, for instance, three in Kansas and two in Oklahoma. \n\"Kentucky definitely leads the way in the number of bookmobiles nationwide,\" Swendrowski said. \nThere are several reasons for that, including a history of efforts to get books to people in the farthest corners of the state, where libraries once were scarce and literacy needed all the help it could get. \nIn 1887, a literary club in Louisville started a project to send crates of books to rural areas with no libraries, which people sent back after they'd read them, according to the Kentucky Encyclopedia. \nDuring the Depression on the 1930s, women delivered books by horse to areas of Kentucky that would have been relatively isolated in those days. \nThe federal Works Progress Administration backed the Pack Horse Library program in Eastern Kentucky. \nThe program helped lay the groundwork for efforts to put vehicles into service. \nThe first bookmobiles in the state were an ambulance, a hearse, a Jeep and some panel trucks, according to the encyclopedia. \nSupporters raised money to buy dozens of bookmobiles in 1954 and gave them to the state, the encyclopedia said. \nNearly every Kentucky county ultimately set up bookmobile service, but the number later dropped because of funding cutbacks. \nThe state once provided bookmobiles to counties, but stopped in 2008, said Terry Manuel, commissioner of the state Department for Libraries and Archives. \nSome counties switched to smaller, less expensive vans to deliver books to places such as nursing homes, though the number of counties with traditional bookmobile service has remained fairly constant in recent years, Manuel said. \n\"Libraries have stepped up and bought their own bookmobiles,\" he said. \nManuel said he thought every county has either a bookmobile or a van delivery service. \nAnother reason so many counties have continued traditional bookmobile programs is that they see a continued need for the service, even in a digital age. \nMany rural places in the state do not have good internet service, and some residents can't afford the service when it is available. \nHealth problems keep people homebound. Many people don't have a car to get to public library 20 miles away, and there is little public transportation in much of the state. Work schedules don't match library hours. \nKendziorski said one man who gets books from the McCreary County bookmobile has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly called Lou Gerhig's disease. He can no longer speak, but writes notes and she pulls western novels for him. \nAt another stop, the father works out of town and the mother doesn't drive, so it would be hard for their children to get to the library. \n\"For a lot of people, the bookmobile is their library,\" Kenziorski said. \"For some it's the only access they have to books.\" \nThe last bookmobile the state provided to McCreary County was in 2002, said Kay Morrow, director of the McCreary County library. \nThe county is among the bottom 10 of more than 3,100 nationally in an index of economic measures such as poverty rate and per capita market income, according to the Appalachian Regional Commission. \nMost land in the county is owned by the federal government, which erodes the local tax base. It's an understatement to say money is tight for local services. \nBut taxpayers have supported the library, and when the last bookmobile the state provided started showing its age, there was no consideration of joining the list of counties without a bookmobile, Morrow said. \n\"I felt the need was still there,\" Morrow said. \nThe library bought a 2017 Ford Transit cargo van and had it modified to carry books at a total cost of $59,000. \nThe county's old bookmobile was like a bread truck, with wooden shelves. \nKendziorski hit a bump with it once and hundreds of books fell out into the floor, and she had become afraid to turn it off at stops for fear it wouldn't start. \nThe new one is outfitted with metal shelves tilted up at the front to keep the books secure and a backup camera that comes in handy in tight spaces. \nIt can carry about 1,000 books. \nKendziorski has other duties with the library, but four days a week, she travels the the county's hilly, winding roads to take the library to residents. \nShe has regular routes, returning to patrons once every three weeks except in the summer, when the library shortens the rotation to two weeks. \nThat helps keep kids reading while school is out, countering the \"summer slide\" in reading skills. \nThe bookmobile does not stop at every house, but rather where people have requested service. Residents can contact the library to be added to the route. \nKendziorski asks people if a parcel-delivery truck can get to their house. If so, she can get in with the bookmobile, which is about 16 feet long. \nShe's only gotten stuck in the mud one time in seven years, while backing out of a house. \nKendziorski has been operating the bookmobile long enough to know which books to put on the shelves \u2014 everything from young adult books, fiction and romance novels to westerns and lots of books for very young readers. \nShe recommends books she thinks patrons will like, based on their favorites. \nKids like to pick their own, though. \n\"They like to look at them and touch them and see what appeals to them,\" she said. \nPeggy Rector drove the bookmobile in McCreary County for more than 34 years before she retired in 2010. \nHalf the roads in the county were unpaved when she started, Rector said. \nThe bookmobile broke down several times, but somebody always stopped to help her, she said. \nKendziorski had nine stops scheduled after school on Nov. 21. \nThe first was at Studio 92 Hair Salon in Pine Knot, operated by Hazel Gilreath, where Kendziorski delivered a bag of 25 books for Gilreath and her 9-year-old son Aaron. \nGilreath said that between work and school activities, it's hard to set aside time to go to the library in downtown Whitley City. \n\"It's a great service,\" Gilreath said of the bookmobile. \"I love to read but I don't have time to go to the library.\" \nGetting books delivered has helped Aaron academically, Gilreath said. \nAt the second stop, Kendziorski parked the bookmobile just off a narrow paved road at the top of a long gravel drive. \nTommie Burchfield walked from her house in the woods down the hill, where there wasn't room to turn the cargo van. \nKendziorski petted Burchfield's dog, a tiny Chihuahua-poodle mix named Tinkertoy, who got on the van while Burchfield browsed for books and talked with Kendziorski about Thanksgiving. \n\"You do get attached to a lot of customers,\" Kendziorski said. \"I think if you talked to a lot of bookmobile people, they'd say my kids, my people.\" \nAt the third stop, a quiet 8th-grader named Karen Spradlin who is an avid reader boarded the bookmobile. \nKendziorski had already picked out two books from a series Karen had been reading, as well as some others Kendziorski thought she might like in the young adult supernatural genre. \n\"I'll take'm all,\" Karen said with a smile. \nShe got eight books altogether. She'll have them all read before the bookmobile returns, Kendziorski said. \nAt one stop, four adults and half a dozen kids spilled out of two or three mobile homes to pick out books. \nAll told, the route covered 2 1/2 hours, 44 miles and nearly 20 readers. \nMorrow thinks bookmobiles will remain a relevant, valuable service in McCreary and many other counties for years to come. \nShe can foresee adding an internet hotspot to the bookmobile to serve people who don't have or can't afford service. \n\"We'll evolve,\" she said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kaylee lay", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kinley lay", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kendziorski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terry manuel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katie lay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccreary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hazel gilreath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael swendrowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karen spradlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rector", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manuel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rhonda kendziorski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tommie burchfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lou gerhig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenziorski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peggy rector", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swendrowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kay morrow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gilreath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morrow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burchfield", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kentucky mobile & apps in", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ap bill estep in", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "appalachian regional commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "association of bookmobiles & outreach services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department for libraries and archives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky encyclopedia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap bill estep bookmobile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "works progress administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccreary county public library", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ford transit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eastern kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "whitley city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccreary county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lexington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "whitley city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:55.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b4b45c2a984d2dd2ec4bebd57f946003d2feec8e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhTWGG_22SOIVUMcjV.1C_yUijLHiOrGBmy0Ew6uozoOWw6E8q2zfEUVOBTkwLJdUcNyV5o7c6sxzri0EsL039aMR7ELi1D3PdSDBrRnpHJE7N3sgxERGwc6XzGp36twXJec6_KRUR_UcvW1TuZ28FWYw5VECImYUD4O__YWRuozBoweiQevnW_ai_.gB8FOfIu_Ds.r7gpG7A--", "site_full": "www.chennaiclassic.com", "site": "chennaiclassic.com", "site_section": "http://www.chennaiclassic.com/feed/1/posts", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "Chennai  -

comebacks.\nTake, for example, his return to U.S.-based World Wrestling Entertainment in 2007 after a years-long absence : preceded by weeks of cryptic promotional videos challenging fans to \"crack the code,\" he arrived to a thunderous applause, wearing a ludicrously ostentatious sequined silver vest.\nHis return to filming a show may be slightly less raucous than that night, but it's no less exciting, especially for Jericho himself.\nThe second season of But I'm Chris Jericho! , a six-episode comedy series streaming on CBC.ca, comes nearly five years after he shot the first season. Originally produced in 2013 by Insight Productions, it debuted on CBC last year.\n\"I got this call about a year ago that CBC was interested in doing a second season. I was super, like, blown away and excited, but also, what a surprise,\" Jericho told CBC News.\n\"It was one of those things that I thought was never going to happen again, so when it did, it was a real blessing and a bonus.\"\nJericho and his co-star Michelle (Mayko Nguyen) pose on the set of a low-tier sci-fi show called Star Crusaders in a scene from But I'm Chris Jericho! (Steve Wilkie)\nDespite the show's long hiatus, it wasn't hard getting back into the character \u2013 after all, it's an exaggerated version of Jericho himself, not entirely unlike his personas in the wrestling ring.\nIn the first season, Jericho found himself on the outs of the wrestling business and struggling to find his footing in the film and television industry. In the second season, he's a few ladder rungs higher, having landed a supporting gig on a third-tier sci-fi show called Star Crusaders .\nThis role has Jericho taking himself just a little too seriously, and comedy naturally ensues from thinking he's too big of a star to deal with the indignities that befall him.\nThe heart of the story is informed by Jericho's own experience trying to kickstart his acting career.\nJericho is also a musician and the frontman of the heavy metal band Fozzy, seen here in Los Angeles in 2010. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)\n\"[I] would go to these auditions, where there was you know, 15 guys who looked just like me and were saying one line for you know, National Lampoon's Beer Fest,\" he says.\n\"But I'm like, 'But I'm Chris Jericho! I have a fan base! I have some notoriety! And this is what I've been reduced to?'\"\nJericho says he's never crossed the line to become the egomaniac his on-screen character can be. To exclaim, \"Do you know who I am?\" in earnest is, he says, \"the worst thing you can say.\"\n'Comedy is very natural for me:' Chris Jericho 2:14\nPerformer and wrestler\nAn old pro wrestling adage is that the best way to grab an audience's attention is to simply play an exaggerated version of yourself \u2013 your own self with the volume turned up.\nJericho and Cheryl Burke perform on the celebrity dance competition show Dancing with the Stars in 2011. (Adam Taylor/AP photo/ABC)\nIf anything, Jericho (real name Chris Irvine, son of former NHL player Ted Irvine) has had to work hard to keep track of all the versions of himself he plays across all media \u2013 the struggling actor in But I'm Chris Jericho! , his persona in pro wrestling, which oscillates from plucky hero to maniacal villain on a quarterly basis; and even, he slyly admits, the media-friendly persona he fashions when doing interviews.\n\"Every character you play is different. But when you all have the same name it's kind of difficult. It's like Tony Danza \u2013 all the characters he plays are called Tony. Every character I play is still called Chris Jericho. It's kind of funny.\"\nTo those unfamiliar with him, Jericho's multimedia forays might seem like he's struggling to define himself as more than simply a wrestler. But he sees the show as the natural extension of his work in the ring.\n\"When I started out as a wrestler, I wasn't big enough. It was all six-foot-eight, three hundred pound guys and I knew I'd never be the biggest guy on the show, but I could be the best character, with the best charisma, the best personality. So to me, I've always been an entertainer.\"\nHis best-remembered antics in wrestling exemplify this, from debuting in 1999 by immediately pestering their top stars like Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson , to reading off a supposed list of 1,004 wrestling holds off a giant spool of paper.\nDream match in Japan\nFast forward to the 2010s, and Jericho had largely faded from the main event, having transitioned to other work like hosting his podcast, touring with his heavy metal band Fozzy and competing on Dancing with the Stars .\nJericho\u2019s band emerges from wrestling shadow From cracking heads to cracking jokes: wrestler Jake 'The Snake' Roberts turns to comedy\nBut he again proved he was the master of the comeback with a stellar year in 2016 with the WWE, allying with fellow Canadian Kevin Owens. Their friendship would implode in an outlandish variety show called the Festival of Friendship that wrestling critic Brandon Stroud called \"the greatest Raw segment of all time.\"\nBut his most surprising comeback yet will culminate in a match no one thought would ever happen. This past week, Jericho appeared in a video for New Japan Pro Wrestling to challenge their U.S. Champion, Kenny Omega \u2013 who also happens to hail from Winnipeg.\nThe two will meet January 4 in the Tokyo Dome at Wrestle Kingdom 12. It will be his first match outside the WWE in 17 years.\nYOU MUST WATCH THE SHOWDOWN, LIVE FROM TOKYO, 04 JANUARY 2018, ONLY ON https://t.co/cEFFsYKcrQ pic.twitter.com/xQf5Qpheu6\n\u2014 @njpwglobal\n\"When you're from Winnipeg, you follow the other Winnipeggers. I knew there was this guy named Kenny Omega that was killing it in New Japan: the top guy, having the greatest matches in the world,\" said Jericho.\nWhen the idea of a Jericho-Omega match was floated to him, he says he found it \"creatively stimulating.\"\nWrestlers under contract with WWE almost never compete with rival promotions, but Jericho's contract ended in May, allowing him to wrestle elsewhere if he wanted.\n\"So I love it.

Under the new rule, people who do not self-identify as either male or female would be able to put an X in that space. \nMany of the people who support the rule change feel as if they are not truly male or female \u2014 calling themselves \u201cnon-binary.\u201d \nAll of this reminds me of an article our friends at the Colson Center for Christian Worldview wrote in 2014 : \nWe\u2019re all familiar with the argument by now: homosexual attraction is an innate characteristic\u2014maybe genetic. Therefore, denying same-sex attracted individuals the \u2018right\u2019 to get married is the same as racism. \nBut an alternate narrative has appeared on the horizon, and by \u2018horizon,\u2019 I mean the cover of a recent TIME Magazine issue, where it\u2019s used to promote the \u2018T\u2019 in the acronym \u2018LGBT.\u2019 The \u2018T,\u2019 of course, stands for \u2018transgender,\u2019\u2014those who say their biological sex and their perceived gender don\u2019t match. The mantra here goes, \u2018I was born this way, but I want to change. In fact, I have a right to change.\u2019 \nSo we\u2019re told that the biology of the \u2018L,\u2019 the \u2018G,\u2019 and the \u2018B\u2019 can\u2019t change. But when it comes to \u2018T,\u2019 the biology doesn\u2019t matter. \nConfused? Well, you\u2019re not alone. \nYou cannot in one breath say a person\u2019s biology controls their feelings \u2014 as many homosexuals claim \u2014 and in the very next breath say a person\u2019s feelings are more important than their biology \u2014 as transgender and \u201cnon-binary\u201d people claim.

Century LLC and The Frisch School, respectively. The buildings were acquired by M&T Bank in its 2015 acquisition of Hudson City Savings Bank. \n\u201cBoth buildings generated a significant amount of attention within the Bergen County community given their desirable Paramus location in addition to their proximity to lifestyle amenities and major retail corridors, as well as easy access to highways and nearby executive housing,\u201d said Cushman & Wakefield Associate Director Frank A. DiTommaso II. \n\u201cEach offering presented unique opportunities for both investors and developers. Ultimately, after a very competitive bid process, two different local users were selected,\u201d said Cushman & Wakefield Vice Chairman David Bernhaut. \nCushman & Wakefield, a global real estate services firm, served as exclusive sales agent for M&T Bank. In New Jersey, the team of David Bernhaut, Andrew Merin, Gary Gabriel, Brian Whitmer and Frank DiTommaso II orchestrated the sale with assistance from the leasing team of David Sherman, David DeMatteis and Mark Zaziski. The deal also involved close collaboration with William Hartman and Lou D\u2019Avanzo based in the New York City office of Cushman & Wakefield. The Cushman & Wakefield team worked directly with Patricia Dore, Administrative Vice President for M&T Bank, and the Bank\u2019s Senior Corporate Real Estate Manager for, among other areas, the Greater New York City and New Jersey Regions\u2019 corporate real estate portfolio. \n\u201cThis is an excellent example of Cushman & Wakefield\u2019s multiple service lines working together to serve the needs of our corporate clients,\u201d said Cushman & Wakefield Vice Chairman Andrew Merin. \nA private entity plans to relocate to 80 W. Century Road and occupy a portion of the space. The remaining available space will be marketed for lease. M&T Bank will continue to operate its retail bank branch at the property, located immediately off of the entrance lobby. \nThe iconic building at 80 West Century Road, offering approximately 70,000 square feet of space on 3.5 acres, drew strong interest from local and regional developers, according to Cushman & Wakefield. The building is located immediately off of Routes 17 and 80. In addition to its ideal location in Bergen County just 15 miles west of New York City, the property offers a unique design and flexible 15,000+/- square foot floor plates that cater to local demand. \nThe single-story, 25,000-square-foot building at 100 W. Century Road was purchased by The Frisch School, a co-educational high school, whose main campus is located adjacent to the property. \n\u201cThis was a natural acquisition for The Frisch School, which has been expanding their operations to meet their growing needs,\u201d said DiTommaso. \nBased in East Rutherford, New Jersey, Cushman & Wakefield\u2019s Metropolitan Area Capital Markets Group specializes exclusively in investment sales of office, industrial, multifamily, land and retail properties throughout New Jersey, New York, and Fairfield County, Connecticut. The team has completed more than $26 billion worth of transactions since 2000, closing over $3.2 billion in sales in 2016. \nAbout Cushman & WakefieldCushman & Wakefield is a leading global real estate services firm with 45,000 employees in more than 70 countries helping occupiers and investors optimize the value of their real estate.
