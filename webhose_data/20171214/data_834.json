The new smartphone has features such as a thin-bezel display, dual-camera setup, and a metal-finish build to take on the competition. But Xiaomi on Thursday unveiled the Redmi 5 Plus as its compelling option against the Honor 7X with a 5.99-inch display and a Snapdragon 625 SoC. Xiaomi also has the Mi A1 as its Android One option against the Honor 7X. \nWith three smartphones that have similar specifications and prices, you might be confused in picking up the best option for you.

Both variants will go on sale on December 12 and will come with a TPU protection case. \nContrarily, the Xiaomi Mi A1 was launched in India in September at a price of Rs. 14,999. The smartphone is available through various online and offline channels in the country, including Flipkart, Mi.com, Sangeetha, Poorvika, Big C, LOT, and UniverCell among others. However, Flipkart is offering a price cut of Rs. 2,000 and is selling the Mi A1 for Rs. 12,999 during its Big Shopping Days sale that will run until Saturday, December 9.

If you're including additional veggies like bell peppers and mushrooms it's a good idea to cook them before adding to your pizza. These vegetables have a lot of water and it's best to cook it out beforehand to avoid a watery, soggy pizza. Simply cook diced peppers and mushrooms with a spritz of oil for a minute or two over high heat to reduce the water content. While the veggies are cooking, lightly spray a baking sheet with coconut oil or other non trans fat spray. Place flatbread onto baking sheet. Spread sauce onto flatbread. And top with turkey pepperoni and any other vegetable toppings you'd like. Bake at 400 degrees for 8-10 minutes, just long enough for the cheese to melt. Next, crank your oven up to broil and keep a close eye on your pizza while the top browns - it only takes a minute or two. Don't walk away! It can burn in just a few seconds. Posted by Brenda A.

Fennel requires a mild climate and is cultivated as a cold weather crop. The cold and dry weather favors increased seed production.

This unprecedented growth \u2013 nearly 10 times its value since the start of 2017 \u2013 has brought Bitcoin squarely into mainstream attention. \nThough the debates over the currency being in a bubble continue to have voices from all directions, what's clear is that those with a big stake with Bitcoin need to be safer than ever with their digital investment. After all, it's real money that's at stake. Bitcoin wallets have faced multiple hacks in the past, so it's worth going the extra step to secure your funds. \nThe most convenient way to store Bitcoins is by using an online wallet, which allows you to quickly transfer money in and out of the wallet, or turn Bitcoins into alternative cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Monero, Litecoin, and others . But the safest option is known as 'cold storage', which stores your Bitcoins offline away from any Internet access. This is all the more important if you\u2019ve got large amounts of Bitcoin. \nHere's how to set up cold storage for your Bitcoin wallet: \n1. Paper Wallet The easiest way to take your Bitcoins offline is by using paper and a printer. Yes, really. You'll also need a website that allows you to create an offline Bitcoin address, such as Bitcoin.com or Bitaddress.org. Follow these steps to create a Bitcoin paper wallet: Head to the Bitcoin.com paper wallet or the Bitaddress.org page. Save the page locally to your computer as an HTML file. Next, close the page and disconnect your computer from the Internet. Open up the saved local version of Bitcoin.com paper wallet or Bitaddress.org. Follow the instructions on the page to create a new Bitcoin address. Once you've a pair of keys and QR codes, print the page. Make sure your printer is not connected to the Internet for added security. You can now use the new public address/ QR code to transfer Bitcoins from another online wallet. \nThe printed page is the most valuable piece of document for your Bitcoin investment. You should ideally store the printed page in a water and fire-proof container, such as a safe. If that's not an option, create multiple versions of it and give it for safekeeping with trusted family, in the case of damage to your version. You could also laminate the page for protection. Bitcoin Is at an All-Time High. Should You Invest in It Now? \n2. BitKey While taking your computer and printer offline is a good security measure, it's not as safe as using a clean operating system. BitKey is basically a free bootable Linux distro that you can write to a USB drive or CD-ROM. Plus, it can run live from computer's memory (RAM) so you can eject the drive/ disc once it's running. \nBitKey comes pre-installed with multiple software options: Electrum Bitcoin client, WarpWallet (more on that later), and Bitcoin paper wallet among others. It also has built-in network, printer, and wireless managers so you can use it for all necessary Bitcoin purposes. Creating a paper wallet with BitKey is safer than using your existing OS. Here's how to create a bootable USB/CD with BitKey: Head to the BitKey website to download the OS image. Click the Download button, and get the 64-bit version. Choose between USB and CD-ROM. The latter is safer since they are read-only by default. For USB sticks without write protection, it's advisable to remove them after boot. Burn a CD with your favourite program, or use a utility such as UNetbootin to write the BitKey ISO to a USB drive. Boot into BitKey by using your computer's advanced boot function (varies from F8-F12 depending on motherboard manufacturers). \nIf the boot is successful, you can use BitKey to create a paper wallet, and you can even use the Electrum client to create an offline wallet. BitKey provides three operation modes \u2013 cold-offline , cold-online , and hot-online \u2013 which define whether the computer is offline and air-gapped. \nIt also decides how convenient the process will be. Choose cold-offline in BitKey for maximum security and least convenience, and hot-online for lesser security and more convenience. You can only prepare transactions in cold-online, though. Follow the three links to figure out which method works for you best. What Is Blockchain? Blockchain Technology Uses Beyond Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency \n3. WarpWallet For the even more paranoid, an even safer way to store Bitcoin involves something called a brain wallet, which generates an address by using a memorised passphrase. WarpWallet takes that a step further with \"salt\", an additional piece of data such as your email address which forces attackers to target you individually instead of casting a wide net. \nThis way, your private key isn't actually stored anywhere physically or digitally, it's in your head (read: brain). That means you don't have to take care of a piece of document, as long as you don't forget the passphrase, for which most people advise that you leave cryptic notes around the house. \nOwing to the complexity and secure nature of this method, it's been described as how Jason Bourne stores his Bitcoin . Anyway, if you think this is the way to go, here's how to get started on WarpWallet: Head over to the WarpWallet website, and make note of the SHA-256 sum in the URL. Save the page locally to your computer as an HTML file, and transfer it to a USB drive. Boot up a bootable Linux distro, such as BitKey from above. Copy the HTML file over to BitKey. Open sha256sum warp.html to verify the SHA-256 sum matches the one from step 1. Open the HTML file as a local file in Chrome/Firefox. Generate a passphrase that works on an entropy algorithm, such as One Shall Pass . Anything with 58 bits or more of entropy is very secure. Use the passphrase in HTML file, and your email address as \"salt\". Scan public key QR code with phone, and transfer it to a device with Internet. Shut down BitKey. \nYou can now transfer Bitcoin from your online wallet/ exchange to your WarpWallet address. You don't have to store your private key anywhere, as it can be regenerated with WarpWallet's website, with the help of your passphrase and \"salt\". Just don't forget any of the details, or your Bitcoin (and the money invested in them) are gone forever. \nThese are the most popular ways to store Bitcoin offline. If you want something with more convenience than BitKey and WarpWallet, and are willing to spend for it, look at hardware wallet options such as TREZOR . They cost a lot \u2013 TREZOR comes in at over Rs. 8,500 including shipping to India \u2013 but they are easier to use than booting a Linux distro. \nFor more tutorials, head to our How To section . \nBitcoin is at an all-time high but should you still invest in it now?

Thanassis Stavrakis AP Photo Turkey's Erdogan arrives in Athens for official Greece visit By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press December 07, 2017 03:56 AM UPDATED 3 MINUTES AGO ATHENS, Greece \nRecep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Athens Thursday for the first official visit to Greece by a Turkish president in decades, with Greece hoping the trip will help improve often frosty ties with its neighbor and NATO ally. \nErdogan was greeted by an honor guard at the airport and headed to central Athens, laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier before talks with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and other officials. On Friday, he travels to northeastern Greece to meet with members of the country's Muslim minority. \nSecurity was tight in the Greek capital, with roads shut down and demonstrations banned in the center of Athens. \nOn the eve of his arrival, Erdogan alarmed Greek officials by saying in an interview with Greece's Skai television that the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which determined current Greek-Turkish borders among other issues, should be \"updated.\" Never miss a local story.

SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"In fact, all agreements (pacts) in the world should be updated with the passage of time,\" Erdogan said in the interview. \"Lausanne too, in the face of all these developments, is in need of an update. This update would be beneficial not only for Turkey but also for Greece.\" \nErdogan has made similar comments in the past about the peace treaty, which set the borders of modern Turkey, but his repetition on the day before his arrival in Athens came as an unwelcome surprise to his hosts. \nHis comments \"raises serious concerns and questions,\" Greek government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said in a statement. \n\"The Greek government and the prime minister want his visit to be a reason to build bridges, not to raise walls.\" \nTzanakopoulos said respecting the treaty is \"the exclusive and non-negotiable foundation on which the honest cooperation of the two countries can be built.\" \n\"Comments regarding its revision do not contribute to the climate we are trying to build in our relations and in the region,\" he said. \nThe refugee crisis will be high on the agenda of talks with Erdogan, as Greek islands have been the gateway into Europe for migrants crossing from the Turkish coast. Regional relations, energy and business ties, Turkey's stalled bid to join the European Union and longstanding disputes such as Turkey's territorial claims in the Greek Aegean will also be discussed. \nOne of the current thorny issues to be raised will be the case of eight Turkish servicemen who have requested asylum in Greece following last year's failed coup in Turkey. Ankara has demanded their extradition, a request rejected by Greek courts on the grounds they could not be guaranteed a fair trial in Turkey. \nThe move infuriated Erdogan, who said in his Wednesday interview that his country's judicial system is \"the best in Europe.\" He said Tsipras had promised to return the servicemen in \"15 to 20 days\" after they flew to Greece in a military helicopter. \n\"That is what he said. But unfortunately right now they are still in Greece,\" Erdogan said, adding that the servicemen should have been handed over before Greek courts became involved. \n\"If you leave it up to the judiciary there will be no result,\" he said. \"In order to facilitate the work of the judiciary you must first, as the government, take the necessary measures before you assign it to the judiciary.\" \nErdogan's visit comes as his country finds itself increasingly isolated on the international stage, and his comments will be closely watched for signs he might try to improve some of Turkey's international relations, particularly with the EU. \nTurkey's ties with the EU, and with several European countries, deteriorated significantly following Erdogan's post-coup crackdown. Tens of thousands of Turks have been fired from their jobs, and tens of thousands more have been imprisoned on accusations of being linked, however tenuously, with Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Islamic cleric that Erdogan blames for masterminding the coup. \nOther than Greece, Poland is the only other EU country to have invited Erdogan to visit since mid-2016. \nHistorical tensions between Greece and Turkey, which have brought the two countries to the brink of war on three occasions since the 1970s, remain. Decades-old thorny issues include territorial disputes in the Aegean, the Muslim minority in northeastern Greece and the continued occupation by Turkish troops of northern Cyprus. \nTension between Ankara and Washington has also increased recently, particularly over the New York trial of a Turkish banker over alleged transactions with Iran. Earlier in the week, Erdogan described the trial of Mehmet Hakan Atilla as an American conspiracy to blackmail and blemish his country.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tzanakopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mehmet hakan atilla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elena becatoros", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tsipras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitris tzanakopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexis tsipras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fethullah gulen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greek presidential guard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greek aegean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cyprus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aegean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lausanne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tomb of the unknown soldier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:53.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9ddc32f72250db1473a54f9a7958257bad42f7e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOKWfhz_3E2LLLR8wYhTEMR9P1xZGv.mXmpy9YYe1RaCI3luQkCDv9odUxVXk4G8BifDdwtk7Z61Ik5WwQzDPzNw6efP7n7YrdcSlQAZ3hf.XqU.Sw5yb6lluiEpL52dA-", "site_full": "www.hoteldealsphuket.com", "site": "hoteldealsphuket.com", "site_section": "http://www.hoteldealsphuket.com/phukettravelnews/feed/", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "travel", "buying_selling_homes", "hotels"], "section_title": "Phuket News", "title": "Cambodia's Sihanoukville morphs into 'Macau 2'", "title_full": "Cambodia's Sihanoukville morphs into 'Macau 2'", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.hoteldealsphuket.com/images/phuket-hotel-deals.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9ddc32f72250db1473a54f9a7958257bad42f7e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOKWfhz_3E2LLLR8wYhTEMR9P1xZGv.mXmpy9YYe1RaCI3luQkCDv9odUxVXk4G8BifDdwtk7Z61Ik5WwQzDPzNw6efP7n7YrdcSlQAZ3hf.XqU.Sw5yb6lluiEpL52dA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Cambodia's Sihanoukville morphs into 'Macau 2'", "text": "Vote!

However, just a day after the announcement, cracks developed in the relations between the two parties. Dismayed at the response over the alliance, Sattar lashed out at PSP chair and announced to quit politic. However, he reversed the decision at the behest of his mother. Sattar kept reiterating that the partnership between two parties is an alliance, however PSP leaders said that it was a merger. Reacting to Sattar's statement, Kamal remarked that he met with Sattar because the latter had requested the establishment to bring the two to the table. Kamal added that Sattar has been giving the impression that whatever decisions PSP takes is at the behest of the establishment. \n\u201cSattar has been meeting us through the establishment since eight months,\u201d he said, saying that the developments are not just 48 hours-long.

That means that they increase the risk as they have nothing left to lose. Their currency reserves and commercial bank currency reserves should be depleted and FED risks attack on dollar by speculators. The currency reserves were spent on propping the dollar last two months as central banks understood FED is printing illegally money to prop USA shares that may be some trillion. ECB will hide that deposits are leaving EU for some days before rationing and also attack my family. From Fawell I find most quoted paper with 19 quotations , for Draghi less then 300 in google scholar. USA are about to put the only person who is ready to take the ultimate risks wit USA economy to achieve the ultimate goal share bubble. Powell comes from the team that received the lowest grade for a FED chairman by CNBC ever and makes the perfect couple with the worst president ever Trump according to surveys. Simply put USA will take all risks for their future economic development to steal money in last attempt with share bubble now. Powell is supposed to leave the interest rate low and let banks to use deposits to buy shares with huge risk. The USA bubble is doomed after some 7 trillions waisted on buyback to increase the share price unsuccessfully for some 3 years to 2017 that made FED to print some trillion non legally to prop the share market recently. The money should have been given to the commercial big USA banks to bail them out in advance and spent on shares , so USA banks have already spent as much deposits as they can on shares and any reforms will only legalize this risks reckless but not move the market really. USA is spending the currency reserve of commercial bank and central bank as printed constantly money to prop the share market put the dollar down with avalanche effect from returned reserves of other central banks and there is inflation from QE money taken out of jars that are up to a trillion. The current bubble looks more like a lottery as some shares mostly NASDAQ are so over-evaluated with 10 s time over historic PE ratio as Amazon and Netflix that if there is probability for doubling from this irrational exuberance that absence as no one expects the bubble to continue for a year from the investors , the downward risks may be for over 10 fold decrease for some shares tor historic PE ratio , and this is a risk for lottery not bubble. To choose head of fed for one lottery , will risk even hyperinflation in USA with his questionable knowledge as in recession weak FED will print money to cover government sixpences soon in addition to QE trillion in jars and illegally printed some trillion recently , and here are a lot of similarities to EU and UK. Next to printed illegally money FED will bluff with fake news for economic growth , banks using deposits for shares , tax reform bringing strong growth and so on. \n\n\nGe0rg1 . For the dollar they say when it rains for 4 days or over you must be in UK where the pound declined by some 40 % due to returned currency reserves. USA started to follow the UK to go in currency crisis with over 25% decline to retain for some time share bubble to cheat you to buy shares. These days intensively USD currency reserves of Central Banks and commercial banks are exchanged for other currencies as the dollar starts to decline a little bit more vs EUR and there is an avalanche effect in these stuff as the first one wins and the decline is steep as was the case was for pound and eur. US currency reserves data cannot be trusted as US , EU and UK printed illegally a lot of money lately to prop the shares that creates inflation and devaluates currencies . Sell now your shares until FED is still propping the prices not you to take half money latter. FED ECB are about to castrate their financial markets and international money function forever. FED ECB are playing a chicken game with me by poisoning all the members of my family these days to get rid of my analyses. Like two cars against each other but the problem is that there is a tree on the road closer to fed as they depleted their currency reserves and may decline the support for shares with illegal printed money or the the dollar not to decline further this year and inflation to jump. The decline of shares may renew steep as USA and EU currency reserves end and cannot prop further USD and EUR so USA and EU may let shares go first before currency rates and vice versa. China , Russia , Japan are not likely to lend currency reserves to USA to prop the bubble there or can provide currency only for 2 , 3 weeks.

Same pair, but different price action in different account? IS IT HONEST FOR ANY TRUE ECN BROKER? REALLY? Sep 11, 2016 - 1 Star For currnent time, I will suggest that just stay away from #Pepperstone, they have many excuses before and even after user got evidences they had some problems. They may be good before, but now they are NOT, maybe even changed into a scammer. Be careful, regulation can not guarantee a broker don't do dirty things to you, they may fake out \"tech issues\" when you get a good entry trade or in profit. For ex., the classic \"tech issue\" is to blame on your ISP was suck, but the fact is, even on their official suggested VPS, MT4 will disconnect \"at the correct moment\" when you will get a best entry. Such as, it had happened on the last biggest NFP news event of the year 2016. I had provided evidence but they never want to investigate what had happened. On the last NFP, they even didn't let me close my trade when my account still has some fund in it, I wanted to close the loss trade when the account has level about 30%, but I can not close it buy one click trade at that moment, my order just disappeared, and my account was stopped out 3 seconds after my order was created with -316%, not even close to +20% stop out level they claimed. The spread was high at the news event but only under control at most stop out 20% or let me close it manually will be about 30% remain, and they just Hudini my order and took the price even did not exist higher over 900 points on the chart and let my account became -316% level. When I ask about the account level, they said \"No problem\", just as any execuses when they were not got caught. See this \"CRITICAL ISSUE\" I had caught here: http://i.imgur.com/OSn7fgF.png They finally compensated this order *only*, but only the one I stared on it and caught. they won't admit anything if you did not stare on the chart and catch the dirty thing personally. (But if I have to do it, how come I using an EA to trade for me? Even manually trader can not 24/7 stare on the chart, not even an EA trader.) And sometimes another classic \"tech issue\" is lost price ticks (price doesn't update) on your trading account when you have some order with good entry or your EA will catch good entry, they just don't tick your EA new price. They call its tech issue or \"NO OTHER CLIENT HAS PROBLEM BUT YOURSELF PROBLEM\". Yes, it's true, you will get \"ONLY YOU HAVE PROBLEM\", it will only happen on your current trading account, but you won't get any problem if your account is not using and 0.0 deposit in it. The \"RESTING\" accounts will perform without even any piece of problem just like a Demo account very well. I had done some tests on 2 accounts in the same time with 2 MT4, the empty account would connect well and price ticks normally, but on the account which had fund within and doing trade, it just doesn't get price ticks normally for over minutes many times, and disconnected oftenly when the trend is good to you. (I had to do EA notification to catch such dirty things to see how often and how long they disconnect my trading account when my EA had chances to get good trend or an order in profit. They just don't want my EA to scalp it in profit by dirty disconnected my account even on NYC VPS they official recommended.) All these suspicious dirty scam things they won't admit until you got iron evidence like a screenshot with dark price gap, if you got evidence, they will just take the part you caught, but never compensate others trades which may have the same problerm that you did not catch it. All these they call \"tech issues\", and regulation could not help on tech issues, but they will keep shooting you issue, issue, issue, issue... again and again on your current trading live account. If you do not stare on the chart 24/7, then you could not catch them, and regulation won't say they are scamming but tech issues. Did Pepperstone scam? I don't know. Did Pepperstone always has some TERRIBLE CRITICAL ISSUES? I can confirm that with my live trading experience. However, you will finally trapped by tons of \"TECH ISSUES\" and lose all your money there. Maybe they will be stunning again someday in the future, - BUT - in current phase, for your own money good, I won't suggest to trade with them, and hope you are clever enough to stay away from Pepperstone.

If you do not stare on the chart 24/7, then you could not catch them, and regulation won't say they are scamming but tech issues. Did Pepperstone scam? I don't know. Did Pepperstone always has some TERRIBLE CRITICAL ISSUES? I can confirm that with my live trading experience. However, you will finally trapped by tons of \"TECH ISSUES\" and lose all your money there. Maybe they will be stunning again someday in the future, - BUT - in current phase, for your own money good, I won't suggest to trade with them, and hope you are clever enough to stay away from Pepperstone.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:54.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ddb6aabd0382db870008b200369d7b9b22627f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacRg7DnedAeW_mr0YE2CIgKIORd6UD_mOhQXrLKA6E0WHH9CST7VDKUQ--", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/phones", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Phones - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "MTN And 9MOBILE Cheap Data Bundle", "title_full": "MTN And 9MOBILE Cheap Data Bundle - Phones - Nigeria", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 951, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ddb6aabd0382db870008b200369d7b9b22627f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacRg7DnedAeW_mr0YE2CIgKIORd6UD_mOhQXrLKA6E0WHH9CST7VDKUQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "brainy02", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "MTN And 9MOBILE Cheap Data Bundle", "text": "*My Data Hub*\nWe offer internet Data Service at the cheapest price\n*MTN*\n*Bank payment* (New Price)\nMTN 1GB - *#750*\nMTN 2GB - *#1,400*\nMTN 3GB - *#2,000*\nMTN 5GB - *#3,300*\n*ETISALAT*\n1GB~ 800\n2GB~ 1400\n5GB~ 3300\n*WE ALSO BUY AND SELL BITCOIN AT FAIR RATES*\nContact us for price\nwww.datadatahub.com\nContact:\n08060674098 WhatsApp\n08027178777 Calls\nOr join our *WhatsApp Group* where new clients or prospectives can meet old clients for *authentication*\nhttps:///8ZVR3c9jfMdHvfotOi4gbu", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:54.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6361c42f93888caa26e57fa0300218f7faf620fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhRi9rUVe42r264xOCLb4X9fxagtDRL8NH0GftsmCyAbdbITQAq7TjlJS0EFfTF8E831AJwEGAw0._VUGgzDMhp3g3Ujo6G.7m6I1Uh8tpcj5e8iajuBj1yH2xYpVLgA4quQJGl3oupf2hPE0xHioRVkLn1EiBCRGZDtHBOBRrtcvS6wuAAYu9_bM0bD8bUP4gbOcS_yniF8Ew--", "site_full": "www.chennaiclassic.com", "site": "chennaiclassic.com", "site_section": "http://www.chennaiclassic.com/feed/1/posts", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "Chennai  - ChennaiClassic.com", "title": "Hiring for Mba Fresher in Bengaluru/Bangalore, Chennai for Exp. 0 - 0 yrs at JEYAM GROUPS., in Chenn (Chennai Job)", "title_full": "Hiring for Mba Fresher in Bengaluru/Bangalore, Chennai for Exp. 0 - 0 yrs at JEYAM GROUPS., in Chenn (Chennai Job)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 64302, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6361c42f93888caa26e57fa0300218f7faf620fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhRi9rUVe42r264xOCLb4X9fxagtDRL8NH0GftsmCyAbdbITQAq7TjlJS0EFfTF8E831AJwEGAw0._VUGgzDMhp3g3Ujo6G.7m6I1Uh8tpcj5e8iajuBj1yH2xYpVLgA4quQJGl3oupf2hPE0xHioRVkLn1EiBCRGZDtHBOBRrtcvS6wuAAYu9_bM0bD8bUP4gbOcS_yniF8Ew--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hiring for Mba Fresher in Bengaluru/Bangalore, Chennai for Exp. 0 - 0 yrs at JEYAM GROUPS., in Chenn (Chennai Job)", "text": "Hiring for Mba Fresher in Bengaluru/Bangalore, Chennai for Exp. 0 - 0 yrs at JEYAM GROUPS., in Chenn (Chennai Job) Reply to: (Not Shown) (Please mention ChennaiClassic.com when contacting) Job Description: Required MBA Freshers.

Business | Press Trust of India | Updated: December 07, 2017 15:33 IST 6 Shares PRINT COMMENTS New Delhi: UIDAI, the authority which issues Aadhaar, said today that the deadlines for verifying bank accounts, PAN cards and mobile SIM cards with the biometric ID stand \"valid and lawful\", and there is no change in them.\nWhile the deadline for verifying bank accounts and income tax Permanent Account Number (PAN) by providing Aadhaar is December 31, for SIM cards it is February 6. Refuting social media messages, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) said that as on date there is no stay from the Supreme Court on Aadhaar and its linking to various services. \n\"That Aadhaar Act being in force, all notifications for requiring Aadhaar for various welfare programmes, verifying bank account, PAN card and SIM card with Aadhaar stand valid and lawful,\" it said in a statement. \n\"Today's legal position is that there is no stay as on December 7, 2017 from the Supreme Court on Aadhaar and its linking to various services,\" it added. \nThe government has made it mandatory for verifying bank account and PAN to weed out black money and bring unaccounted wealth to book. The same for SIM has been mandated to establish identify of mobile phone users. \n\"The mandatory requirements of Aadhaar for PAN, bank accounts, welfare programs, and SIM cards have been challenged in the Supreme Court and no stay has been granted. Therefore, it is clear that the video is outdated because it does not reflect the latest legal position as on today (December 7, 2017),\" the statement said. \nUIDAI said the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 was passed by the Parliament on March 16, 2016 and notified in the Gazette of India on March 26, 2016. \n\"Therefore, subsequent notifications issued under section/s of Aadhaar Act for requiring Aadhaar as primary identifier by various ministries and departments of Government of India and States/UTs Governments for various services, benefits and subsidies hold the field today,\" it said. \nUIDAI asked people not to get misled by an outdated video doing rounds in the social media and Whatsapp and said \"people should instead verify their banks accounts, investment accounts, SIM cards, etc as per the current laws and deadlines as early as possible to avoid any inconvenience.\" \n\"UIDAI has clarified on a video circulated purportedly out of context of a lady lawyer on WhatsApp, Twitter and Social Media and said that the video refers to an order passed by the Supreme Court on August 11, 2015 when the court had restricted use of Aadhaar to only few programs,\" the statement said. \nThe video, it said, does not reflect \"true legal position\" as it stands today, because after the said Supreme Court order of 2015, Aadhaar Act was passed by Parliament in 2016. \nSubsequent to the Act, notifications have been issued making Aadhaar mandatory for availing various welfare benefits such as public distribution services (PDS), cooking gas LPG, MNREGS, scholarships and pensions. \nThe Income Tax Act was amended in March 2017 to make Aadhaar mandatory for PAN cards. On June 1, 2017, PML Rules have been amended to make Aadhaar mandatory for linking all bank accounts, insurance, pension, mutual funds and DMAT accounts. \n\"Supreme Court too in Lokniti Foundation case through an order passed in February 2017 has approved verification of all SIM cards with Aadhaar,\" UIDAI said. \nThe Apex Court has upheld the linkage of Aadhaar with PAN in the case of Binoy Viswam vs Union of India which mandates Aadhaar for income tax returns and PAN.
