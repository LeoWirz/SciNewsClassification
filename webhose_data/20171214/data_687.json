Save \nMICHIGAN CITY \u2014 An increase in the number of students participating in advanced placement courses along with consistently high scores in such classes have earned Michigan City Area Schools a place on the AP Honor Roll. \nThe district is one of 447 school districts in the U.S. and Canada honored by the College Board. It is among 19 districts in Indiana honored this year, according to a news release issued by the district. \n\u201cWe are committed to exposing more of our students to rigorous AP coursework, expanding our course offerings and assisting our students in preparing for AP exams,\u201d Michigan City Area Schools Superintendent Barbara Eason-Watkins said in the release. \u201cOur staff and students are working extremely hard in this area, and we\u2019re thrilled to receive this recognition.\u201d \nMichigan City High School offers 16 advanced placement courses to students, most of whom are in the Honors College or Early College programs. The courses are AP Biology, AP Calculus, AP Chemistry, AP English Language and Composition, AP English Literature and Composition, AP Environmental Science, AP European History, AP Microeconomics, AP Music Theory, AP Physics, AP Psychology, AP Statistics, AP U.S. Government, AP U.S. History, AP World History and AP Human Geography. \nNext fall, an AP Computer Science Principles course will be added, the district said. \nAdvanced-placement courses play an important role for college-bound students because good scores translate to college credit at about 95 percent of all universities in the nation, according to Michigan City High School Principal Candy Van Buskirk \nIn addition, she said, many Ivy League schools won't consider an application for admission unless the student has taken more rigorous courses such as advanced placement. \n\"This is very exciting,\" Van Buskirk said. \"We've seen several successes this fall, and this is just another achievement we're very proud of on the way to making Michigan City High School one of the top academic institutions in Northwest Indiana.\" \nThe high school earlier this fall improved its state score from a C to a B and will continue to push its college and career readiness programs to prepare students for life after high school, she said. \nThe district has been focusing on a more rigorous curriculum for about a year, Van Buskirk said, highlighted by a professional development grant it received from the University of Notre Dame this summer providing teachers with math, science and English education courses. \nMichigan City High School in November hosted an AP conference for about 300 students from eight high schools across northern Indiana. The conference was one element of a five-year partnership between MCHS and Notre Dame, the Advanced Placement Teacher Investment Program for Indiana, or TIP-IN. \nAccording to the College Board, the Michigan City district and others on the honor roll are successfully identifying motivated, academically prepared students who are ready for advanced placement courses. \n\u201cCongratulations to all the educators and administrators in this district who have worked to clear a path for more students of all backgrounds to participate and succeed in AP,\u201d said Trevor Packer, head of AP and Instruction. \u201cThese educators and administrators are fostering a culture in their schools and classrooms that allows students to face new challenges and build the confidence to succeed.\u201d \nIn 2017, more than 4,000 colleges and universities around the world received AP scores for college credit, advanced placement or both, along with consideration in the admissions process. \nInclusion in the eighth annual AP District Honor Roll is based on a review of three years of AP data, from 2015 to 2017, looking across 38 AP exams. The following criteria were used. \nDistricts must: \n\u2022 Increase participation or access to AP by at least 4 percent in large districts, at least 6 percent in medium districts and at least 11 percent in small districts; \n\u2022 Increase or maintain the percentage of underrepresented minority students (American Indian/Alaska Native, Black/African-American, Hispanic/Latino, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander) taking exams, and simultaneously increase or maintain the percentage of such students scoring 3.0 or higher on at least one AP exam; and \n\u2022 Improve or maintain performance levels when comparing the 2017 percentage of students scoring a 3.0 or higher to the 2015 percentage, unless the district has already attained a performance level at which more than 70 percent of its AP students earn a 3.0 or higher. \nThe complete Eighth Annual AP District Honor Roll is available at: https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/score-reports-data/awards/honor-roll .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "betsy k", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "van buskirk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "betsy kohna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barbara eason-watkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trevor packer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "betsy kohnlaptops", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jon gard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan city high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap physics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eighth annual ap district honor roll", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap computer science principles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap chemistry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mchs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap biology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap microeconomics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap u.s. government", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap human geography", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of notre dame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honors college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap environmental science", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap psychology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap district honor roll", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap statistics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan city high school principal candy van", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "college board", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "michigan city area", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific islander", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "notre dame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northwest indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan city area schools", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:37.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2aa29cb6d8c44f621e02eea27dcc0506015cd554", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWzApDEW3DUB3iJ0JicjShLn59EA4jfF.gF0Q0N9sR1xzN39htPREWieSXqqYEFdYGSvkrh13V4dPQ2t0SYbUoztVCD2hp5oW4-", "site_full": "news.cision.com", "site": "cision.com", "site_section": "http://news.cision.com/ListItems?format=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Cision News", "title": "SEMCON WINS CONTRACT WITH FORTUM", "title_full": "SEMCON WINS CONTRACT WITH FORTUM", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://mb.cision.com/Public/1934/2409193/a0f9d8356ca22150_400x400ar.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29062, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2aa29cb6d8c44f621e02eea27dcc0506015cd554", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWzApDEW3DUB3iJ0JicjShLn59EA4jfF.gF0Q0N9sR1xzN39htPREWieSXqqYEFdYGSvkrh13V4dPQ2t0SYbUoztVCD2hp5oW4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "SEMCON WINS CONTRACT WITH FORTUM", "text": "SEMCON WINS CONTRACT WITH FORTUM Thu, Dec 07, 2017 10:00 CET \nTechnology company Semcon is entering a new collaborative venture with energy corporation Fortum.

Please do not post about a specific user you believe to be exploiting/cheating, this will be taken as a witch-hunt and will be removed. Please report any suspected hacking or exploiting activity directly to Bluehole using this link . No trading, begging, LFG or gambling posts Posts relating to the trading and buying of in-game items or game copies should not be made here and will be removed. If you would like to find others to play with, please use our official Subreddit Discord using the link in the next sidebar section. No gambling or linking to gambling websites. No low effort posts or unrelated topics This includes, but is not limited to, simple screenshots of loot, your inventory, or other common PUBG sights, as well as memes and any other contributions that would be considered low effort. Posts on the Subreddit should ideally contain content capable of sparking discussion, and should be specifically about the game. No direct promotion No promotion of Twitch, YouTube or any other platform accounts. Please contact us if you want to do a giveaway, we can give you further details on what we allow. Megathreads, common topics, and duplicate topics During the week we will have various megathreads covering various topics. You can find them here . Any posts covering these topics outside of the megathreads will be removed. Common topics that are seen multiple times per day will be removed as long as a similar topic has been popularized recently. We will also remove topics which duplicate a recent post (such as multiple posts of the same stream highlight or news item). Additionally, there are times where an event occurs that sparks a range of lively interest and opinions. If there are already publicised posts on the topic we may remove separate threads which do not contribute new information. No game ban appeals Complaints or appeals relating to specific game bans should be made directly to Bluehole or BattleEye and not to the subreddit. Subreddit moderators or users cannot help with bans, and posting them here only succeeds in fueling drama, often with little evidence. General discussion of PUBG's rules and ban reasons are allowed.

Eleven more houses had been damaged.\nThe fire brought back memories of the 1961 Bel-Air fire, in which movie stars including Maureen O\u2019Hara and Fred MacMurray fought to save their homes \u2014 a seminal event that fed apocalyptic visions of Los Angeles for decades to come.\nWednesday\u2019s fire drew on another iconic aspect of L.A. life: a soul-crushing traffic jam on the 405 Freeway.\nOfficials closed the freeway through Sepulveda Canyon, directly west of Hoag Canyon, from just after 5 a.m. until 1:30 p.m. With that artery closed, freeways and streets throughout the city clogged.\nGenaro Molina / Los Angeles Times The bedroom of a home is engulfed in flames from the Skirball fire along Linda Flora Drive in Bel-Air.

The university lost power, as did more than 800 Department of Water and Power customers.\nJackson Rogow, 24, woke up at 6 a.m. to the smell of smoke and the wail of sirens. In his boxer shorts, he ran out to the sidewalk on Bellagio Road \u2014 where, 56 years before, Zsa Zsa Gabor lost her house, saying: \u201cMy three dark minks, my white mink, my sables, some really very nice little jewels are gone.\u201d\nHis neighbors were already in the street, packing their cars. The waning crescent moon was blood red.\nRogow turned on the news and in the aerial footage of the fire saw his eight-unit apartment building in the apparent path. \u201cWe should pack,\u201d he told his girlfriend.\nBy 7 a.m., fire trucks were racing up and down the street. He waved to one and shouted, \u201cShould I leave?\u201d A firefighter gave him a thumbs up, he said.\nRogow packed the couple\u2019s cat, Zeppelin, and a bag of kitty litter.

They were squarely inside it.\nRogow remembered a conversation he\u2019d had with his neighbor, who had temporarily left the state for cancer treatment. When she left, Rogow had asked her a question arguably unique to Southern California canyons: \u201cIf your house is burning down, what do I grab?\u201d\nHer medals, she said. She had more than three dozen \u2014 from marathons, half-marathons and 5K races. Rogow broke a window and grabbed them.\nRogow planned to go to a friend\u2019s apartment in Westwood with a rooftop where they could watch the fire. But he made one stop first.\n\u201cI needed a smoothie,\u201d he said. He picked up his regular order: a blend with probiotics, strawberries and kale.\nResidents near Bel Terrace and North Sepulveda Boulevard raced outside as flames encroached on their homes.\nBeverly Freeman, 83, pulled out of her driveway ahead of the fire just before 7 a.m. She didn\u2019t take any belongings with her.\nAs Freeman drove away from the two-story gray house that her husband built for her three decades ago, she was not sure whether she would have a home to return to.\nGenaro Molina / Los Angeles Times Firefighters work in a Linda Flora Drive home scorched by the Skirball fire in Bel-Air.

County firefighter spotted flames in a portion of the 13-acre Moraga Vineyards, which Murdoch bought in 2013. He radioed other firefighters, who within minutes showed up and pried open the gate at the bottom of the property.\nWhen winds picked up again, the vineyard \u2014 covering an area from the canyon floor to the eastern ridge \u2014 was a big target.

Some of our neighbors have suffered heavy losses and our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time.\u201d\nBy the afternoon, the blaze had subsided, but firefighters continued to guard the multimillion-dollar homes. The winds were expected to hit hard again starting about 10 p.m. Wednesday, and the fire was only 5% contained.\nOn Moraga Drive, a gated community of about 36 homes, one fire truck guarded every three houses, Batiste said. Neighbors said public figures and celebrities such as Jerry West and Magic Johnson have or still lived on the street.\nWhile residents could only wait to see what the night would bring, firefighters employed hand crews and retardant drops to establish a hard line to keep the fire from spreading into Brentwood, as the flames did in 1961, when they destroyed 500 homes in total and consumed 16,000 acres.\n\u201cWhen the winds come up, they\u2019re going to come out of the northeast,\u201d said Los Angeles Fire Deputy Chief Chuck Butler, \u201cand they\u2019re going to want to push the fire across the 405.\u201d\nCAPTION A series of Santa Ana wind-driven wildfires have destroyed hundreds of structures, forced thousands to flee and smothered the region with smoke in what officials predicted would be a pitched battle for days.\nA series of Santa Ana wind-driven wildfires have destroyed hundreds of structures, forced thousands to flee and smothered the region with smoke in what officials predicted would be a pitched battle for days.\nCAPTION A series of Santa Ana wind-driven wildfires have destroyed hundreds of structures, forced thousands to flee and smothered the region with smoke in what officials predicted would be a pitched battle for days.\nA series of Santa Ana wind-driven wildfires have destroyed hundreds of structures, forced thousands to flee and smothered the region with smoke in what officials predicted would be a pitched battle for days.\nCAPTION The rapidly growing brush fire in the Bonsall area has charred 2,500 acres, destroying 20 structures and threatening 2,000 more, fire officials said.\nThe rapidly growing brush fire in the Bonsall area has charred 2,500 acres, destroying 20 structures and threatening 2,000 more, fire officials said.\nCAPTION A wildfire began in Murrieta on Thursday afternoon, destroying one structure and triggering evacuations as firefighters continued to battle destructive blazes across Southern California.\nA wildfire began in Murrieta on Thursday afternoon, destroying one structure and triggering evacuations as firefighters continued to battle destructive blazes across Southern California.\nCAPTION Rich Macklin, public information officer for the Ventura County Fire Department, says strike teams are attacking flames in the Faria Beach area.

Credit: Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University \nCanola oil is one of the most widely consumed vegetable oils in the world, yet surprisingly little is known about its effects on health. Now, a new study published online December 7 in the journal Scientific Reports by researchers at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University (LKSOM) associates the consumption of canola oil in the diet with worsened memory, worsened learning ability and weight gain in mice which model Alzheimer's disease. The study is the first to suggest that canola oil is more harmful than healthful for the brain. \n\"Canola oil is appealing because it is less expensive than other vegetable oils, and it is advertised as being healthy,\" explained Domenico Pratic\u00f2, MD, Professor in the Departments of Pharmacology and Microbiology and Director of the Alzheimer's Center at LKSOM, as well as senior investigator on the study. \"Very few studies, however, have examined that claim, especially in terms of the brain.\" \nCurious about how canola oil affects brain function, Dr. Pratic\u00f2 and Elisabetta Lauretti, a graduate student in Dr. Pratico's laboratory at LKSOM and co-author on the new study, focused their work on memory impairment and the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau, which is responsible for the formation of tau neurofibrillary tangles, contribute to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration and memory loss in Alzheimer's disease. The animal model was designed to recapitulate Alzheimer's in humans, progressing from an asymptomatic phase in early life to full-blown disease in aged animals. \nDr. Pratic\u00f2 and Lauretti had previously used the same mouse model in an investigation of olive oil, the results of which were published earlier in 2017. In that study, they found that Alzheimer mice fed a diet enriched with extra-virgin olive oil had reduced levels of amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau and experienced memory improvement. For their latest work, they wanted to determine whether canola oil is similarly beneficial for the brain. \nThe researchers started by dividing the mice into two groups at six months of age, before the animals developed signs of Alzheimer's disease. One group was fed a normal diet, while the other was fed a diet supplemented with the equivalent of about two tablespoons of canola oil daily. \nThe researchers then assessed the animals at 12 months. One of the first differences observed was in body weight - animals on the canola oil-enriched diet weighed significantly more than mice on the regular diet. Maze tests to assess working memory, short-term memory, and learning ability uncovered additional differences. Most significantly, mice that had consumed canola oil over a period of six months suffered impairments in working memory. \nExamination of brain tissue from the two groups of mice revealed that canola oil-treated animals had greatly reduced levels of amyloid beta 1-40. Amyloid beta 1-40 is the more soluble form of the amyloid beta proteins . It generally is considered to serve a beneficial role in the brain and acts as a buffer for the more harmful insoluble form, amyloid beta 1-42. \nAs a result of decreased amyloid beta 1-40, animals on the canola oil diet further showed increased formation of amyloid plaques in the brain, with neurons engulfed in amyloid beta 1-42. The damage was accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of contacts between neurons, indicative of extensive synapse injury. Synapses, the areas where neurons come into contact with one another, play a central role in memory formation and retrieval. \n\"Amyloid beta 1-40 neutralizes the actions of amyloid 1-42, which means that a decrease in 1-40, like the one observed in our study, leaves 1-42 unchecked,\" Dr. Pratic\u00f2 explained. \"In our model, this change in ratio resulted in considerable neuronal damage, decreased neural contacts, and memory impairment.\" \nThe findings suggest that long-term consumption of canola oil is not beneficial to brain health. \"Even though canola oil is a vegetable oil, we need to be careful before we say that it is healthy,\" Dr. Pratic\u00f2 said. \"Based on the evidence from this study, canola oil should not be thought of as being equivalent to oils with proven health benefits.\" \nThe next step is to carry out a study of shorter duration to determine the minimum extent of exposure necessary to produce observable changes in the ratio of amyloid beta 1-42 to 1-40 in the brain and alter synapse connections.

If you enjoy these prompts (or are looking to improve your writing or submit a manuscript), do take a look at my online courses \u2026 five are currently half price and the other two are FREE (when using coupon codes)! \nTime yourself for 15 minutes for each one, then either have a break or move on to the next one. When you\u2019ve finished, do pop over to this blog\u2019s Facebook Group and let everyone know how you got on. \nBelow are the four \u2013 you can do them in any order. Keywords: play, down, overall, dance, lightning Random: a holy grail Picture: what does this inspire? Final sentence end: \u2026and put it back. \nHave fun, and if you would like to, do paste your writing in the comment boxes below so we can see how you got on! Remember though that it counts as being published so don\u2019t post anything that you would want to submit elsewhere (where they require unpublished). \nSee below for explanations of the prompts, they do vary\u2026 Sentence starts = what they say on the tin. You can start the beginning of the story with them or a later sentence but they\u2019re a great way of kicking off. Keywords = the words have to appear in the story but can be in any order and can be lengthened (e.g. clap to clapping). One-word prompt = sometimes all it takes is one word to spawn an idea. Sometimes it easy, sometimes hard but invariably fun. Mixed bag = two characters, an object, a location, a dilemma, a trait. Mix them all together and you have a plot\u2026 hopefully. First person piece or monologue (a one-sided conversation). Dialogue only = this is where you literally just write a conversation between two people. No \u2018he said\u2019, \u2018she said\u2019 or description, just speech and the reader has to be able to keep up. \ud83d\ude42 Second-person = some of you will know that I champion. The prompt can be in any style but has to be written in second-person viewpoint\u2026 oh, what a hardship. \ud83d\ude42 Title: This is the title of your story. Picture prompts = nothing other than a picture. What does it conjure up? Random = whatever takes my fancy! \nTips Don\u2019t forget your five senses: sight, sound, touch, taste, smell Show don\u2019t tell: if your character is angry, don\u2019t tell us he is, have him thumping his fist on the table. Colours: Include at least one colour in your story. It does add depth. Use strong verbs and avoid adverbs: Have a character striding instead of walking confidently. Only use repetition to emphasise. When you\u2019ve finished the first draft, read the story out loud. It\u2019s surprising how many \u2018mistakes\u2019 leap out at you when you read out loud\u2026 assuming you have any of course! \nPicture above courtesy of morguefile.com and/or pixabay.com \nI love to talk about writing so feel free to .

Her abuse was kept a secret until her twin sister approached authorities in 2015 with details of the crimes, against the victim\u2019s wishes. \nLa Porte County Prosecutor John Espar released a statement recounting the \u201cdevastating\u201d effects of the prolonged sexual abuse on the girl, who was hospitalized for suicidal tendencies as early as age 7, and who continues to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression caused by her childhood trauma. \nAfter four hours of deliberation on Thursday, a 12-person jury delivered guilty verdicts on two class A felony child molesting charges, for Mashburn having performed and submitted to deviate sexual conduct with a child under the age of 14; as well as two class C felony counts of child molesting, for him having performed and submitted to fondling or touching with a child under the age of 14. \nA mistrial was declared in regard to the class A child molesting count Mashburn faces that charges him with having engaged in sexual intercourse with his victim, as the jury was deadlocked on the issue. \nMashburn will return to La Porte Superior Court 1 for sentencing on Jan. 11 at 8:30 a.m. He remains incarcerated at the La Porte County Jail as he awaits the resolution of his case.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

A man walks past a bitcoin ATM in Vilnius, Lithuania. Image: Reuters \n\"Unfortunately, there has been a security breach involving NiceHash website. We are currently investigating the nature of the incident and, as a result, we are stopping all operations for the next 24 hours,\" the marketplace said in a statement late on Wednesday. \n\"Importantly, our payment system was compromised and the contents of the NiceHash Bitcoin wallet have been stolen. We are working to verify the precise number of BTC taken,\" it added. \nCoindesk reported on Thursday that the loss is about 4,736.42 Bitcoins, worth more than $60 million. \n\"Are we going to get our btc? or might as well just forget it. Your press release said nothing about sending us what you owe. I have 4000$ stuck in your wallet which is now almost 4300$,\" tweeted a user named Lohit. \nAnother NiceHash user Philip Richardson tweeted: \"If I don't get my btc back I will never use your service again\". \nEarlier in the day, the value of one Bitcoin had crossed $14,000, a new record high for the cryptocurrency. \nBitcoins are created through a complex computer process known as mining and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. \nA steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins are created a day - with about 16.5 million now in circulation from a maximum limit of 21 million, BBC reported. \n\"Clearly, this is a matter of deep concern and we are working hard to rectify the matter in the coming days. In addition to undertaking our own investigation, the incident has been reported to the relevant authorities and law enforcement and we are co-operating with them as a matter of urgency,\" NiceHash said. \nThe company recommends users to change their passwords - both on NiceHash and other services. \nThe incident brings back the memories of the 2014 implosion of the \"mtGox\" Bitcoin marketplace which lead to losses of millions of dollars. \nIn India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) this week cautioned the \"users, holders and traders\" of Bitcoins about the security-related risks associated in dealing with such virtual currencies (VCs). \nThe apex bank reiterated its stand that \"it has not given any licence or authorisation to any entity or company to operate such schemes or deal with Bitcoin or any VC\". \n\"In the wake of significant spurt in the valuation of many VCs and rapid growth in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), RBI reiterates the concerns,\" the central bank said in a statement.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nicehash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip richardson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nicehash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reserve bank of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ians", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vilnius", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lithuania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:39.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d9cd62a3c6cf173feacd911b213067baff1a931", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_jqUUOF_be6jbkm7.aBK64BBJNkVhO02pWlXOImIrOdFjXjrrf1K2yo151AIelkZyx5IqwDiCsXTdhq2u_l_r2Xd7lcsmucLj9FOk9_jdXTw--", "site_full": "ways2capital-agritips.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://ways2capital-agritips.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Ways2Capital|NCDEX Tips|Free Agri Commodity Tips|Best NCDEX Tips|NCDEX Trading Tips", "title": "Soybean futures closed higher on Wednesday", "title_full": "Soybean futures closed higher on Wednesday", "published": "2017-12-07T12:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d9cd62a3c6cf173feacd911b213067baff1a931", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_jqUUOF_be6jbkm7.aBK64BBJNkVhO02pWlXOImIrOdFjXjrrf1K2yo151AIelkZyx5IqwDiCsXTdhq2u_l_r2Xd7lcsmucLj9FOk9_jdXTw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ishita Singh (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "Soybean futures closed higher on Wednesday", "text": "\n\nSoybean futures closed higher on Wednesday due to reports of good physical demand as Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA) increased its estimates for meal exports for 2017/18.

Aluminum-clad metal doors. One hundred and three sturdy windows. If anything was going to burn, Rochelle Olson thought, it would be the wooden garage door. The rest of her home was built to withstand flames.\nAnd at first, it seemed like the house Olson lived in on Bridgeview Drive for 30 years would be OK. She and her husband evacuated at 4:30 a.m. Tuesday as the Thomas Fire closed in. When they returned later that afternoon, the house was still standing.\nTheir art \u2014 a half-million dollars of it \u2014 was still on the walls. Her wedding ring was in a tray by her bathroom sink.\nStray embers landed on the lawn. She put them out with water scooped from the toilet. The faucets weren\u2019t working. Then she noticed smoke seeping out of a hallway closet.\n\u201cWe have a problem,\u201d she thought.\nNow Playing: Now Playing Homes Burn as Fire Breaks out in Los Angeles AP Fast-moving wildfire burns in Bel Air LATimes People, Animals Flee California Wildfire AP Guy Drives Down Street During Major Fire JukinMedia Creek Fire: Homes burn in Shadow Hills LATimes Ventura resident shows view of massive fire sfgate Smoke from Creek Fire smothers Lake View Terrace in Los Angeles sfgate So.

They evacuated a second time, not grabbing anything.\nAn errant ember had probably blown into a crawl space under the foundation, an off-duty firefighter told them. But all the engines were busy. By the time one arrived nearly 20 minutes later, the house was aflame. In another few minutes, it was gone.\n\u201cAll these houses out here were saved,\u201d Olson said Wednesday, gesturing to her neighbors. Soot smeared her forehead and underneath her red manicured nails. \u201cSomehow ours wasn\u2019t. Who would have thought it would be this one? No one. The house next door has weeds up to your waist and it\u2019s still standing.\u201d\nPicking through the wreckage, her son Damon came across a charred chunk of metal. \u201cWhat is this thing, mom?\u201d he said, holding it up.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what any of this is.\u201d\nOne thing that did survive was a tall family safe, which fell through the floor. The family fetched it up with rope, and still hasn\u2019t been able to pick the lock \u2014 the key is lost in rubble \u2014 but they\u2019re hoping Olson\u2019s passport is intact inside.\nShe has plans to fly to Cabo San Lucas.

Slowking from the Burning Shadows Pokemon Card Set.  Slowking is a Stage 1, Psychic type Pokemon card, with a HP of 120. It has a x2 weakness to Psychic type Pokemon, no resistance type, and a two Colorless Energy card retreat cost.  This card does not have an Ability but it does have two moves.  The first move on this card is called Drift Ashore, for one Psychic Energy card, this move allows you to search your deck for a card and put it into your hand.  Unarmed is the name of this card's second move, for three Psychic Energy cards, this move does 110 damage, plus, if you have no cards in your hand, you may ignore all Energy costs associated with this attack.\n\nPokemon Card Strategy: \nSo as far as strategy goes, since Slowking is a Stage 1 Pokemon with a Basic evolution form in Slowpoke, which is most recently in the Guardians Rising set, you'll have to first get Slowpoke into play before you can use this card.  Because this card requires only Psychic Energy to attack, it will be harder to fit into decks, but if you are building a majority Psychic type deck, this card and line is worth a look.  Early in a game, Drift Ashore can be very useful, it is almost like using Tapu Lele GX, but in this case you can get the exact card you need, but you have to be in the Active Pokemon spot to do so.  Unarmed is a pretty powerful move in my opinion if you can get no cards in your hand at all, making it so for only one Energy card, this card can use both of its moves.  Playing the online TCG, I have seen this Slowking card being used, mainly with Lunala GX decks.  Again, if you're building a majority Psychic type deck, this is certainly a line to consider, at least using a 1-1 line of it.\n\nPokemon Card Rating: \nI would give this card a 4 out of 5 rating.  In my opinion, this is an above average Stage 1 Pokemon card from the Burning Shadows set.  In the competitive TCG, if you're able to attach a Float Stone Trainer to this card, you can move it in and out of the Active Pokemon spot with ease, helping set up your Bench as well as to do 110 damage for little Energy.  This card is both a powerful attacker and a handy Pokemon for setting up the main Pokemon in your deck.  So certainly consider this card when building a Psychic type deck.\n\nTomorrow's Pokemon Card: \nSo thanks for reading today's Pokemon card review of Slowking from the Burning Shadows set, stay tuned for tomorrow's card review of Wobbuffet, which is from this same set.

We're not talking about Monday morning with a label created Sunday either. Ebay claimed one was \"shipped\" 6 days ago and it is already past the expected delivery date and Fedex claims the seller submitted pre shipment info but never actually gave them the item. I have had a number of items \"Ebay\" claimed \"shipped\" 2 weeks before the seller actually gave it to the carrier. I have also had items Ebay claimed \"shipped\" that the carrier never got. Ever. Zero tracking. I contend that when Ebay claims something was \"shipped\" based on label creation, pre shipment info, real or phoney \"tracking numbers\" or anything other than actual receipt by the carrier it is dishonesty to the buyer on Ebay's part.\nI ordered $600 worth of Lego sets from Target two weeks ago.

These are used in oil & gas industry for hydraulic fracturing in shale oil & gas extraction and consume around 90% of total production by Asia Pacific. Hydraulic fracturing activity has seen a rise in the U.S. that in turn is anticipated to propel guar gum market. \n\nThese find application in food & beverage sector as thickening, suspending, stabilizing and binding agent in bakery products. Bakery industry shall grow at a CAGR of above 6% in next five years and expected to enhance its consumption. These are used in explosives industry and mixed with nitro-glycerine and ammonium nitrate to provide waterproofing agent. Further it amplifies sheet formation and folding for printing and expected to boost guar gum market. Guar gum or guaran is fabricated from beans and utilized in various industries owing to its thickening and stabilizing properties. The seeds are de-husked, screened and milled obtain product. It is produced as free flowing and off-white powder and classed as galactomannan. These are polysaccharide, comprises of sugar galactose and mannose and solubility higher than locust bean gum. These are quite stable at pH range 5-7. Major restraint for guar gum market is emergence of gluten free substitutes such as psyllium fibre and chia seeds. It has lost its lustre with oversupply and reduced demand in recent years. Further, decrease in oil price has affected its demand with reduced oil & gas exploration activities globally. European commission issued a warning against its high intake due to presence of dioxins that weakens immune system. Week exports and huge stock burden may limit its growth in near future. Based on grade, guar gum market is segmented into food, industrial and pharmaceutical. Industrial grade has major share owing to its application in vast applications in oil & gas, mining, explosives, textile, tobacco, paper manufacturing and photography industries. Food sector has substantial share with multi-functional properties and use in confectionary and frozen food products. Frozen food industry is anticipated to grow at a CAGR above 4% in next seven years and shall propel its demand. Based on function, guar gum market is classified as thickening, gelling, binding, friction and others including flocculating & setting, coagulating, strengthening and hardening. Gelling has larger share with utilization in oil & gas industry for exploration. In addition, owing to its gelling property these are employed in personal care and pharmaceutical products such as creams & gels, liquid soaps and dental impression materials. With respect to application, guar gum market is segmented into food & beverages, oil & gas, paper manufacturing, pharmaceuticals & explosives and mining & explosives. Oil & gas industry has major share with increase in exploration activities and oil well drilling projects. These are primarily used in hydraulic fracking for shale oil production with the U.S. driving its demand. It enhances fracture creation and minimizes formation damage. Food & beverage industry has substantial share in guar gum market and utilized in bakery products. These improve dough yield, texture, shelf life and resiliency in pastries. It acts as binder in meat and helps to maintain homogeneity and texture in dairy products such as milk, yogurt, ice cream, kefir and cheese. Further, these are used in pharmaceutical applications as it reduces serum cholesterol level and improves bowel movement. North America has substantial share in global guar gum market owing to prevailing oil & gas industry. Increase in non-conventional oil production such as shale oil and oil sand in the U.S. and Canada has enhanced its demand and this region is largest importer globally. Asia Pacific has significant share with presence of India and Pakistan as largest producer. India contributes around 80% of overall production. Europe has moderate share in guar gum market with demand in frozen and processed foods. These are utilized in pharmaceutical and personal care products that are expected to show healthy growth. Latin America and Middle East & Africa has nascent share and may grow with increase in demand for bakery and processed food. Prominent players of guar gum market are India Glycols, Vikas WSP, Rama Industries, Dabur India, Hindustan Gums and Chemicals, TIC, Nutriroma, AEP Colloids and Shree India Sino.

Volvo is now focusing on their 60 branded range of vehicles - the first of which, is the XC60 . It's a crossover that is much loved around the globe and the new one it appears will fit into the lineage just fine. The 2018 Volvo XC60. Image: Volvo \nDesign It speaks the design language of its elders and though I'm not a big fan of the same-sausage-different-size philosophy, the elegance of Volvo's new design is something that I would openly welcome on various body styles. Like the 90 branded range of Volvo's, the XC60 too is built on the Scalable Product Architecture - a modular platform that allows Volvo's engineers and designers to customize the dimensions of the car to suit various body-styles. \nThe distance between the front axle and the dashboard remains unchanged on all SPA cars though and this works in the XC60's favour by giving it proportions appropriate for a premium crossover. Compared to its highly successful predecessor, the new XC60 is 44mm longer, 11mm wider and 14mm shorter and the result is a crossover that has an athletic stance and looks very proportionate. The 2018 Volvo XC60 is built on the Scalable Product Architecture - a modular platform that allows Volvo's engineers and designers to customize the dimensions of the car to suit various body-styles. Image: Volvo \nThe Volvo XC60 does resemble the XC90 in many ways, but its smaller dimensions are evident even when it's standing by itself. Another quick way of distinguishing the XC60 from the XC90 is the front face, where the Thor's Hammer daytime running lights poke their way out to reach the grille. The headlight assembly is studded with adaptive LED headlamps and the rear is typical Volvo with the familiar design of the taillights. The headlight assembly is studded with adaptive LED headlamps and the rear is typical Volvo with the familiar design of the taillights. Image: Volvo \nThe side profile looks quite interesting too with the 19-inch wheels beefing up the stance. I particularly like the large doors which now extend all the way down to the floor and integrate the side skirting within the exterior door panel. This prevents your trousers from picking up stains during ingress or egress after an off-road session or a wet weather drive. Quite practical and thoughtful. \nCabin Despite the lower height of the roof, getting in and out of the cabin is pretty easy. The steering and the vertical infotainment screen establish the resemblance with the XC90 yet again. It is actually a good thing since the buyer gets Volvo's top drawer equipment and materials even in the carmaker's medium-level car. A seamless panel of grey coloured open pore wood snakes across the length of the dashboard and its natural texture feels nice when you touch it. You will also notice a flag of Sweden embossed in the chrome lining on the dash. Its coloured counterpart, as always, is situated on the side of the driver's seat. The upholstery and interior of the 2018 Volvo XC60. Image: Volvo \nThe perforated Nappa leather upholstery on the seats looks best in tan (which is getting increasingly popular with customers, says Volvo) and I like the soft texture of the leather used too. As in most new Volvo vehicles, the seats in the XC60 also have a slim profile and an orthopaedic certified design. On the launch edition that you see here, these come with ventilation and massage functions for the front pair of seats. The rear is quite roomy and the seats seem comfortable for long distance journeys. Despite the narrow glasshouse, there is an airy feel to the cabin, thanks to the panoramic sunroof. The steering and the vertical infotainment screen establish the resemblance with the XC90 yet again. Image: Volvo \nLuxury car makers normally take audio sound quality very seriously and the XC60 has summoned the expertise of Bowers & Wilkins for its audio setup. It is made up of 15 speakers including a set of tweeters that are designed to play without any reverb; and an air-ventilated subwoofer that is the only one of its kind found in a standard fit automotive audio system. All this ensures the audio is great no matter what your choice of music or equalizer preset setting is. \nEngine and driving Should you choose to not play any audio at all, the cabin turns into a place so quiet, that it is pleasantly surprising for a diesel-burning vehicle. Volvo has worked hard on insolating the road, tyre, wind and drivetrain noises and the result is clearly evident. Our drive was largely limited to the smooth tarmac of Chennai's East Coast Road where we hardly experienced any road or tyre noise. The engine refinement is also impressive with the XC60 building pace deceptively. The new Volvo XC60 - T8 powertrain. Image: Volvo \nThe engine in question is the same 2.0l four-cylinder motor that's available in the D5 variants of Volvo's 90 branded range of vehicles. It manages to churn out a commendable 235PS and 480Nm of torque, which are figures that are usually in V6 territory. Given the overall lightweight (~1860kg) of the Volvo XC60, the engine feels eager and enthusiastic. \nThe eagerness of the engine is complemented by a fairly quick eight-speed transmission sourced from Aisin and a Haldex all-wheel-drive system. We have sampled this setup in the past and know that the XC60 is predominantly front wheel drive until there is a loss of traction which transfers power to the rear wheels. I'm pretty sure in our test car the majority of the drive was with the power going to the front wheels only since the straight roads and grippy tarmac were hardly a challenge for traction. The Volvo XC60 will also be offered with air suspension on all four corners that enables the car to alter damping and ride height if needed. Image: Volvo \nAt launch, the Volvo XC60 will also be offered with air suspension on all four corners that enable the car to alter damping and ride height if needed. Our test car lets us choose between Eco, Comfort, Off-road and Dynamic modes to alter the nature of the suspension and drivetrain. Surprisingly, the Individual mode to set suspension and drivetrain parameters separately wasn't available. That said, the preset settings work just fine. The XC60 is an easy driver when you want it to be and seems like it will deliver equally well when given the beans. \nSafety If the list of safety features isn't the juiciest part of the brochure, the car wouldn't qualify as a Volvo. Appreciably, the carmaker hasn't shied away from bringing in some of its best safety tech to the India-spec XC60 either. For a mid-level offering, the list is commendable and the most notable features and assistance systems are front, side and curtain airbags, collision mitigation support at the front and rear, emergency steering assist, lane keeping assist and emergency braking assist. The City Safety package, which uses most of these systems in its application, had debuted in India on the previous generation XC60. The new one takes it further by being active at city as well as highway speeds, making the new Volvo XC60 a safer package overall. The City Safety package, which uses most of these systems in its application, had debuted in India on the previous generation XC60. Image: Volvo \nThe previous generation XC60 was clearly the best seller for Volvo, contributing to 30 percent of the carmaker's overall sales. In fact, I had even termed it one of the best buys from Sweden for its practicality. The new XC60 only seems to make the deal sweeter. It is still as sensitive as you would expect a Volvo to be, but the added enthusiasm and youthfulness should give it an even wider appeal. \nPublished Date: Dec 07, 2017 03:07 pm | Updated Date: Dec 07, 2017 03:07 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "volvo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bowers & wilkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aisin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "volvo  luxury", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chennai's east coast road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:41.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "816e708c9cc38d7ff52364032757f4a0a851db07", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZmwXkxg578YB3MFeYtOQY8a", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ -

China", "text": "Hello Friends: I am currently living in Shenzhen, planning above trip during new year week, alone. I am flying from Shenzhen on 29/30 December (Still confused whether to cut off one day from the trip as flight is slightly cheaper on 30 Dec). That would basically mean whether 4 days are enough for Beijing or I should extend to 5 days to not miss on any experience. 29/30 Dec: Travel from Shenzhen to Beijing Until 3 Jan: In Beijing, then travel overnight to Harbin Until 6 Jan: In Harbin, then overnight train back to Beijing on 6 Jan night. 7Jan: Daytime again spend in Beijing, and fly back to Shenzhen by night 21:00. I am looking for some help with itinerary for Beijing (30 Dec to 3 Jan or 31 Dec to 3 Jan), Harbin (4 Jan to 6 Jan), Beijing again on 7 Jan (Daytime). Need special recommendation for 31st night on Beijing and Ice activities in Harbin as well as best areas to stay in both the cities (attraction/places convenient to visit) I am more of an adventurous guy, Ok for hectic schedules like get out of hotel early morning and come back late. I read some more discussions and figured out places interesting to visit like- Beijing: Great Wall (Mutianyu supposedly recommended for first experience), Tiananmen square, Forbidden city, Wangfijing pedestrian street, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palance, Pearl Market, Drum & Bell Towers, Lama Temple, Peking University, Fragrant Hill. Harbin: Yabuli skii resort, Sun Iceland tourist spot, Ice & Snow world and Ice lantern world (Zhaolin park), St. Sophia orthodox church, central street, winter swimming watching, frozen river. Open for any help, suggestions, criticism. Thanks in advance.

On my assumption the consignment is still left in our Storage Vault here at the Memphis International Airport till date,the details of the consignment was only your email and the official documents from the United Nations office in Geneva are tagged on the  Trunk box.\r\n However, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment, as the Interim Head of Luggage/Baggage Unit, I will advise you provide your current Phone Number and Full Address, to enable me cross check if it corresponds with the address on the official documents tagged.\r\n\r\nNote that this consignment is supposed to have been returned to the United States Treasury Department OR to its country of origin as unclaimed delivery,I will not be able to receive your details on my official email account. So in order words to enable me cross check your details, I will advise you send the required details to my private email address for quick processing and response. Once I confirm you as the actual recipient of the trunk box, I can get everything concluded within 48hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery.\r\n\r\nLastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to contact you personally about this abandoned consignment is because I want us to transact this business and share the money 70% for you and 30% for me since the consignment have not yet been return to the United States Treasury Department after being abandoned by the diplomat so immediately the confirmation is made, I will go ahead and pay for the United States Non Inspection Fee of $3,700 dollars and arrange for the box to be delivered to your doorstep Or I can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble but you have to assure me of my 30% share.\r\n\r\nI wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive and I will appreciate if we can keep this deal confidential.\r\n\r\nPlease get back to me via my private Email:{ philipsmoore52@yahoo.com } for further directives:\r\nYou can call me on my telephone number and drop a message.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nMr.Philips Moore\r\nphone no:+1(901)443-8410\r\nInspection Officer.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "philips moore", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip moore", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "treasury department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "storage vault", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "memphis international airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "memphis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "airport storage vault", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "memphis international airport usa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:42.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "713206ca08fcf9049bc770127f042ea913f5acc7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPWUBPdRzkzb6ABPBP6HgBjrHuWZPh6o.EVRdHKBUk07MTrffwzGDNFKtVvPBOAnshHfXFhHw.R.e", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g294211-i642-China.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "China Forum, Travel Discussion for China - TripAdvisor", "title": "Internet in Beijing - Beijing", "title_full": "Internet in Beijing - Beijing Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-07T10:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "32b3562d78e1f0c1d52dd62b2431ec5ffc2a28fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPWUBPdRzkzb6ABPBP6HgBjrHuWZPh6o.EVRdHKBUk07MTrffwzGDNFKtVvPBOAnshMrsbiT9AY_gbCqelvctWtI-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "BePu", "published": "2017-12-07T10:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "A couple of weeks ago, whatsapp did not work at all or very badly.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:42.000+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15092102, "moreResultsAvailable": 15092002, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512641202000&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 249}
