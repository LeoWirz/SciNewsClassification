But the Christian need not lose heart. Holidays, despite whatever they represent culturally, are powerful opportunities for us to remember, reflect, and, most of all, to recover Christian thankfulness, propelling us into the year to come.\nThe same God who can make dry bones live can revive even a dead consumerist back to his glory and praise.\nAn Update on Dr. Sproul\u2019s Health Prayer needed for R.C. Sproul.\nWhen Distracted Pastors Are Dangerous Mark Dance:\nDistracted drivers are dangerous because they are oblivious to how their actions affect those around them. It is not uncommon to see people driving through heavy traffic in Nashville with their phones on top of their steering wheels.\nDistracted pastors are dangerous as well to a degree\u2014both to themselves and to others.\nIs Racial Harmony Disintegrating? John Piper:\nI write not as an authority on race relations, or as one with vast experience across cultures, or as one who considers himself especially successful in realizing my own dreams. Instead I write as a watcher of our sad world, a pursuer of biblical reality, a lover of Jesus Christ, and a hoper for more harmony, more justice, and more beauty in my wider family \u2014 the body of Jesus Christ.\nStop Trying to Grow the Fruits of the Spirit JD Greear:\nYou may have spent years trying to work to develop the fruit of the Spirit found in Galatians 5:22-23: \u201cBut the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. The law is not against such things\u201d (CSB).\nBut the gospel has a better approach to spiritual growth than you trying to become more mature on your own and by your works. Here are three things to remember when you think about this passage.\nHow Acts 29 Survived\u2014and Thrived\u2014After the Collapse of Mars Hill Sarah Eekhoff Zylstra does a great job digging into what\u2019s happened in recent years with the Acts 29 Network.\nFive words that follow every decision I make A favorite from the archives:\nLast week, as Emily and I were driving home from a Christmas party, we were talking about another big decision we\u2019d made recently. And about halfway through the conversation, I realized all I was doing was spiralling on the what-ifs, and wasn\u2019t recognizing reality\u2014and that in doing so, I was failing to acknowledge the fact that I can actually trust God with all of these things.\nAnd so, I stopped mid-sentence and immediately began to pray.\nThe post Links I like (12/07) appeared first on Blogging Theologically .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zach barnhart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah eekhoff zylstra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emily", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sproul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r.c. sproul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus christ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john piper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jd greear", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "csb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nashville", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:12.044+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0243d3fffd5dc182206c87000579b9763b56e87f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9F_yf.l4Qe0vclufdhfYzbxjF.wB.6MahMSdvVJFlv9Ys1tEEhOEdit3T6GZP4AyK93zN2qKWSASC1YnfB8_eP", "site_full": "www.fightercontrol.co.uk", "site": "fightercontrol.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.fightercontrol.co.uk/forum/viewforum.php?f=18", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Warbirds, Replicas and Nostalgic Photography \u2022 FighterControl \u2022 Home to the Military Aviation Enthusiast ", "title": "More relics from the loft", "title_full": "More relics from the loft \u2022 FighterControl \u2022 Home to the Military Aviation Enthusiast", "published": "2017-12-07T09:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6dbaf87c4273ff8198b5ac634beb2693e9424a62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9F_yf.l4Qe0vclufdhfYzbxjF.wB.6MahMSdvVJFlv9Ys1tEEhOEdit3T6GZP4AyK93zN2qKWSARNFp4jIkiDPOtqdh7U.ILg-", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "pawlee1", "published": "2017-12-07T11:51:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Cheers Pads, I miss those beefy Drakens.\nThanks for the memories.\nAll the best\npawlee", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:12.046+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "82a05de66df6741c23bb245920df945dd487ca10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pl2NhdRZH3Pb4AiGhLQdr9DRIFv.3jA0O", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/b/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/b/ - Random - 4chan", "title": "Spit, swallow, or cum on her face?", "title_full": "/b/ - Spit, swallow, or cum on her face?

This, in turn, caused some to remind others about the prudence of getting-in early when it comes to crypto assets. Mr. Antonopoulos further clarified his plight, detailing how the opportunity costs of keeping his bitcoin would\u2019ve placed his family at financial risk. Rather than do that, he sold it all to stay afloat back in 2013. What happens next is a testimony to the generosity of bitcoiners, and the love our community has for the Greek citizen of the internet, with his Eddie Munster hairlines. \nAlso read: Silk Road \u2013 The Theatrical Version, Funded by Bitcoin, to Debut in London Love for Our Own \nAndreas Antonopoulos has gone through nearly all of the hundreds percentage bitcoin price increase without enjoying its spoils. Mr. Antonopoulos isn\u2019t just some guy who missed out on the crypto gravy train. He\u2019s arguably the most respected and influential personality in the decentralized currency world. That he, of all people, was toiling away to get above water in terms of personal finances came as a shock to many of his fans. \nFaster than a bitcoin transaction confirmation, the pan-crypto community came to a sudden realization, albeit subconsciously: How did we let this happen?! Twitter raged. Reddit posse\u2019d up. Mr. Antonopoulos\u2019 bitcoin address (1andreas3batLhQa2FawWjeyjCqyBzypd) and Patreon account were flung to all reaches of cyberspace. \nInevitably, shrill and less-than nuanced voices attempted to turn love into a gross political statement, the kind of tribalism many feel at least exhaustion at if not outright contempt. One-upmanships were on full display. Those less inclined toward toddlerism sat back and became philosophical: Whatever. Make this about internal bitcoin politics if you wish. Just support Andreas Antonopoulos. In Defense of Optimism \nThe man of the hour took to his Patreon account and wrote in homage to the community he loves in turn, titled In Defense of Optimism . To read it in its entirety, interested folk will have to unlock the content. And it would not be right to give too much away, as that is the point of the entire exercise (and this article). But it\u2019s worth quoting at least a little. \nHe recounts responses from his Twitter exchanges: \u201cOver the next several hours, tens, dozens, then hundreds of people responded. I sat reading the responses with tears in my eyes. An outpouring of positivity washed over me. People I have never met jumped to my defense, reminding me that they started their journey after watching my videos, or reading my books. Some people attacked the original criticism and its author (which I strongly discourage). But the vast majority focused on optimism,\u201d he clarified. \n\u201cToday,\u201d Mr. Antonopoulos continued, \u201cI am even more focused on my goals: educate the next 10 million users. Train the next 10,000 developers. Do it all in every medium possible. Do it in more languages. Do it with more energy, with more passion. Do it with unrelenting optimism. In the end, my engine runs on hope, it runs on optimism. And today, it\u2019s turbocharged.\u201d \nAt press time, donations to Mr. Antonopoulos were nearing 700,000 USD, with at least one generous soul slapping down 37 bitcoin , or over 500,000 USD in one donation. Now that\u2019s love. Here is the bitcoin address , if YOU also would like to donate a few satoshis to the great Bitcoin explainer. \nTell us your Andreas Antonopoulos\u2019 stories in the comments below. \nImages via Pixabay, Twitter. \nDo you like to research and read about Bitcoin technology?

It is high treason of the persons involved and any other person facilitating that process,\u201d he said. \nHe also said that the NASA leader\u2019s (Raila Odinga) swearing in would be null and void without the presence of the Chief Justice who presides over the ceremony. \nAlso present was government spokesperson, Eric Kiraithe who said that the state was open to dialogue with those in the opposition who feel aggrieved but will not allow \u2018banditry politics.\u2019 \nOdinga has maintained that he will be lawfully sworn in as the people\u2019s president and will not recognize the legitimacy of the Jubilee government. \nHe on Thursday told off the US administration that has warned against further polarising the country, saying that they should not interfere in Kenya\u2019s internal affairs. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t recognize the swearing-in. We will go by the results of August 8 elections in which Kenyans expressed their will. We will not be intimidated\u2026our friends can advise us but they should not shout at us about violating of the constitution\u2026constitution my foot,\u201d \nthe former Premier said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ag githu muigai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "githu muigai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raila odinga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "odinga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muigai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric kiraithe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "people\u2019s assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "raila odinga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republic of kenya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:12.069+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0243d3fffd5dc182206c87000579b9763b56e87f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9F_yf.l4Qe0vclufdhfYzbxjF.wB.6MahMSdvVJFlv9Ys1tEEhOEdit3T6GZP4AyK93zN2qKWSASC1YnfB8_eP", "site_full": "www.fightercontrol.co.uk", "site": "fightercontrol.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.fightercontrol.co.uk/forum/viewforum.php?f=18", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Warbirds, Replicas and Nostalgic Photography \u2022 FighterControl \u2022 Home to the Military Aviation Enthusiast ", "title": "More relics from the loft", "title_full": "More relics from the loft \u2022 FighterControl \u2022 Home to the Military Aviation Enthusiast", "published": "2017-12-07T09:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd10a743b156507bf34243b6608361af81387c0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9F_yf.l4Qe0vclufdhfYzbxjF.wB.6MahMSdvVJFlv9Ys1tEEhOEdit3T6GZP4AyK93zN2qKWSARiS6vExX0QjFdwqZQrybvw-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "phantom6", "published": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Yes a lovely bit of nostalgia there Paddy", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:12.071+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0243d3fffd5dc182206c87000579b9763b56e87f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9F_yf.l4Qe0vclufdhfYzbxjF.wB.6MahMSdvVJFlv9Ys1tEEhOEdit3T6GZP4AyK93zN2qKWSASC1YnfB8_eP", "site_full": "www.fightercontrol.co.uk", "site": "fightercontrol.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.fightercontrol.co.uk/forum/viewforum.php?f=18", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Warbirds, Replicas and Nostalgic Photography \u2022 FighterControl \u2022 Home to the Military Aviation Enthusiast ", "title": "More relics from the loft", "title_full": "More relics from the loft \u2022 FighterControl \u2022 Home to the Military Aviation Enthusiast", "published": "2017-12-07T09:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "164a6569c59b1f8d2682e36e9f77cba3a7e52cec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9F_yf.l4Qe0vclufdhfYzbxjF.wB.6MahMSdvVJFlv9Ys1tEEhOEdit3T6GZP4AyK93zN2qKWSAYe1vX9tpJwUvwzYDZ909IQ-", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Sparts99", "published": "2017-12-07T11:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "what they said In this world there's two kinds of people, my friend.

Barb Schoop, Kendall Hunt Gifted Sales Consultant and Janet Meyers, Kendall Hunt Director of K-8 Product Development & Sales accept the 2017 Legacy Award from a representative of the TAGT. \n\u201cAs a new unit that\u2019s been on the market for just over a year, it\u2019s a tremendous honor for \u201cMind Your Time\u201d to be recognized in this capacity by the Texas Association for the Gifted & Talented,\u201d said Chad Chandlee, president of Kendall Hunt Publishing Company. HOUSTON (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 Kendall Hunt Publishing Director of K-8 Product Development & Sales Janet Meyers and Gifted Sales Consultant Barb Schoop accepted the 2017 Legacy Book Award for Curriculum Materials for the unit \u201cMind Your Time\u201d during the Texas Association for the Gifted & Talented Annual Conference Thursday, Nov. 30, 2017, in Houston, Texas. The TAGT Legacy Book Awards honor books published in the United States that not only have long-term potential for positively influencing the lives of gifted individuals, but in addition, contribute to the understanding, well-being, education and success of gifted and talented students. The curriculum materials category encompasses supporting materials that educators might use in the classroom, such as workbooks, lesson plans, manuals and classroom activities. \u201cMind Your Time,\u201d authored by the William & Mary Center for Gifted Education, is designed for gifted students in grades 4-5. The focus of the language arts unit is that every person has experienced the effects of time on various phases of their life. Many individuals take time for granted and do not understand the important role it plays in their everyday lives. The reading selections and instructional activities are designed to intrigue and challenge high ability students. Students work independently and in groups doing classwork as well as homework outside the classroom. Kendall Hunt is a two-time Texas Legacy Award recipient. \u201cThe Pursuit of Justice\u201d, authored by Mary Ann Yedinak was recognized as the 2016 Curricular Materials Award Recipient. Additionally, the Kendall Hunt\u2019s Project M3 unit \u201cShopping at the Bazaar: Connecting Number and Algebra with the Meerkats\u201d was also considered for the 2017 TAGT Legacy Book Award. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous honor to have a Kendall Hunt product recognized by the Texas Association for the Gifted & Talented,\u201d said Chad Chandlee, president of Kendall Hunt Publishing Company. \u201cThe fact that \u201cMind Your Time\u201d is a new unit and has been on the market for just over a year makes this honor that much more exciting.\u201d In all, awards were given in four categories from the Texas Association for the Gifted & Talented. The categories include: Curricular Materials; Educator; Parent and Scholar. A total of 22 books were submitted by nine publishing companies and reviewed by 31 readers.

trial Nicole Bitette , New York Daily News Thursday, December 07, 2017 Credit: Bryan Steffy/Getty Taylor Swift comments Taylor Swift wasn\u2019t going to be bullied or made to feel like she was to blame for being sexually assaulted by a Denver DJ in 2013.\nThe famous singer opened up about her trial against David Mueller for the first time in an interview with Time magazine after she was placed on the cover for the 2017 Person of the Year: the #metoo movement.\nSwift was initially the defendant in the case, being sued by Mueller, who felt he was unjustly let go from his job. The \u201cBad Blood\u201d artist countersued for $1 \u2014 and won.\n\u201cMy mom was so upset after her cross-examination, she was physically too ill to come to court the day I was on the stand. I was angry. In that moment, I decided to forgo any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened,\u201d she told Time.\n\u201cThis man hadn\u2019t considered any formalities when he assaulted me, and his lawyer didn\u2019t hold back on my mom \u2014 why should I be polite?\u201d\nNow a voice for the movement as identified by Time, Swift urged her fans not to feel blamed, as she did.\n\u201cYou might be made to feel like you\u2019re overreacting, because society has made this stuff seem so casual. My advice is that you not blame yourself and do not accept the blame others will try to place on you,\u201d she told the mag in a message to her diehard fans.\n\u201cYou should not be blamed for waiting 15 minutes or 15 days or 15 years to report sexual assault or harassment, or for the outcome of what happens to a person after he or she makes the choice to sexually harass or assault you.\u201d\nThe 27-year-old star declared that Mueller has yet to pay her the $1.\n\u201cI think that act of defiance is symbolic in itself.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "de", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "nicole bitette", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "taylor swift", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swift", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryan steffy/getty taylor swift", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david mueller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york daily news", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "denver dj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:14.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "25620f5ea2c0147f29bb0f7af83386a6c7543cca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pl2NhdRZH3PbvEWj3DuDv9TxqdzAQ3CsH", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/b/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/b/ - Random - 4chan", "title": ">your age >number of sex 24 0", "title_full": "/b/ - >your age >number of sex 24 0 - Random - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T13:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 99, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4e3fe9448b33db1ae2398d3e3f3fc85ec61f22ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pl2NhdRZH3PbvEWj3DuDv9S.ieNrQMEw5jxjFyG9_KhY-", "ord_in_thread": 41, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>753156660\nQuit being a faggot and get over it.

Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm.\nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin.\nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up.\n\"A horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\" he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies.\nSechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business.\nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \"disappeared \u2014 what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\"\nUlyukaev went to Sechin's office in November last year to discuss Rosneft's affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages.\nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher's shop.\nUlyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev's actions \"are undermining the authority of the government.\"\nUlyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \"those absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised. I was a hypocrite. I love taking gifts and giving gifts. When you're doing all right, you shamelessly turn your back on other people's misfortunes.\"\nUlyukayev asked for \"people's\" forgiveness and pledged to devote rest of his life to \"defending people's interests.\"\nThe court is expected to deliver the verdict next week.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ulyukayev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ulyakayev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "igor sechin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ulyukaev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexei ulyukayev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sechin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rosneft", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:14.081+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "25620f5ea2c0147f29bb0f7af83386a6c7543cca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pl2NhdRZH3PbvEWj3DuDv9TxqdzAQ3CsH", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/b/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/b/ - Random - 4chan", "title": ">your age >number of sex 24 0", "title_full": "/b/ - >your age >number of sex 24 0 - Random - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T13:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 99, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ec40c065ef67c1b748dd751f0a651945082d233d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pl2NhdRZH3PbvEWj3DuDv9S.ieNrQMEw5YArOsJrvn8Y-", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>753156084\nOnly chlamydia, 4 times...
