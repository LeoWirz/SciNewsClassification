So what better way to thank each one of you than with one of our newly pressed thank you cards. Made by Us by Hand with Love \nThese cards have been created in our workshop using rescued and restored 60 year old printing presses. The first step in their creation, however, was very much rooted in the 21st century. \nThe design was created by Andrea\u2019s brother, a graphic designer, who has come to work for the business \u2013 in fact \u2013 he\u2019s writing this article right now. \nUsing a piece of software which allows a great degree of typographical control, a few design ideas were created. \nOnce one of the designs was chosen it was then sent to a specialist company in the UK that create brass blocking dies (below left) \nThese beautiful blocking dies are then fixed to a heated plate and rolls of \u201cfoil\u201d are passed over it. In the case of this card, a red and black foil were used (above right). \nThe heated blocking die causes the pigmented foil to release its colour and transfer onto a piece of card (sourced from a British paper mill) when it is pressed against it. \nThe result is a beautiful and tactile piece that will be finding its way into your orders very soon. \nWe do not charge extra for these or add anything to our prices. We just do it because we love making beautiful things by hand and want to show this to you our customers, that we truly are thankful to all of you who shop with us online or over the phone.

This is Greg from OLA English with Greg and in this\nlesson I'm going to teach you the difference between come and go, bring and\ntake, and been and gone. Let's go!\nAlright guys, remember, as always, this video comes with subtitles so if you\nwant to follow, watch it again with subtitles\njust click the button below. OK, let's get into it then.\nFirst: come and go.\nWhat's the difference between come and go? It's very simple, you've just got to\nthink: where is the speaker? Alright, currently I am without an office so I'm\nusing my good friend Javi's house to record these videos. Javi is at work at\nthe moment but he will come here when he's finished. He will come here when\nhe's finished. I'm speaking, I'm in a Javi's house so when he's finished work\nhe will come here, to where I am, to where the speaker is. If I call Javi and ask\nhim the same question, 'what time are you coming home?' he will say I'm going home\nin 10 minutes. I'm going home in 10 minutes, because again, the speaker is in\na different place and he's going there in 10 minutes.\nAlright, so you go there and you come here. That's a very important sentence to\nlearn because it helps us learn the difference between go and come and also\nthere and here. You go there you, come here.\nAlright, the past of go is: go - went - I have gone. But sometimes we say 'I have\nbeen', right? I have been, I have gone... what's the difference? Let me give you\ntwo examples and we'll look at the different implications of these two\nsentences. My mum has gone to the supermarket / my mum has been to the\nsupermarket. My mum has gone to the supermarket means\nthat she left the house, she went to the supermarket and at this moment she is\nstill in the supermarket. Where's your mum? She's gone to the supermarket. The\nsecond example, my mum has been to the supermarket means\nthat she left the house, she went to the supermarket, she did the shopping, she\ncame home and now she's home again. Alright, she is where she started. So it\nmeans she's gone and come back she's been to the supermarket. The cupboards\nare full! Yes! Why are the cupboards full? Because mum has been to the supermarket!\nThe difference between bring and take is a very similar thing to go and come. You\ngo there, you come here, you take something there, and you bring something\nhere. If you're in a bar and you ask the waiter for a beer you ask him, 'can you\nbring me a beer please?' You want the waiter to give you the beer\nhere. So you sit back and you enjoy your beer and oh it's disgusting, it's\nhorrible, you can't drink! It, it's just so bad, so you get up and you take your beer\nback. You take your beer to the bar, you take your beer there and you ask your\nwaiter to bring you another beer here.\nIf you've liked this I have a I have a playlist\nof similar videos where I explain commonly confused words in English. You\ncan watch that playlist by clicking up there, I recommend you do that now! Thank\nyou so much for being here.

(AP) \u2014 Columbus North swimmer Nick Green didn\u2019t quite understand how severe his condition was when he was diagnosed with osteochondritis dissecans right before his freshman season.\nMultiple doctors informed Green and his family that he could lose his ability to walk if he didn\u2019t treat the condition in a timely manner.\nSome bone in Green\u2019s right knee was dying and getting absorbed, which was creating a hole. Doctors told him that more would continue to break off if he didn\u2019t get it fixed.\n\u201cIt definitely took me by surprise,\u201d Green said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know the word for it. I was just shocked. I was very upset. I didn\u2019t think I was going to have my high school season, to be honest. But we found a doctor who said I could swim and have my high school season.\u201d\nMost Read Stories Seahawks broadcaster and former Husky star Warren Moon sued for sexual harassment Neil deGrasse Tyson responds, says Seahawks' lateral was just the 'Galilean transformation' Saying goodbye to Seattle\u2019s beloved 13 Coins Redhook brewery site in Woodinville sells for $24.5M America\u2019s hippest city is Vancouver, Washington? Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Green finished his freshman swim season before having his surgery in March. Doctors had to drill on the sides of his knee and insert screws to establish blood flow for his bone to grow.\nThe doctors took bone from his hip and partially filled the hole with bone plugs in hopes of having the rest of his bone grow back. Green received good news when a doctor told him at his most recent checkup that the bone was growing back.\nGreen\u2019s next check up is on Thursday, where doctors will check the progress and see if any screws in his knee have migrated.\nGreen, who has been swimming competitively since he was 6 years old, wasn\u2019t sure if the surgery would work, which put his entire swimming career in jeopardy. Fortunately for Green, he spent eight weeks on crutches, but was allowed back in the water just two weeks after the surgery.\nGreen eventually transitioned to a custom-fit unloader knee brace to help shift the weight from the healing portion of his leg. He participated in physical therapy once a week at the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital for about four months.\nAlthough he could get back in the water, Green wasn\u2019t allowed to kick for six months. He put a pull buoy between his legs to prevent himself from kicking, which put a lot of strain on his upper body muscles.\nGreen had to push off with one leg for his flip-turns and did only upper body lifts in the weight room. He couldn\u2019t even carry weights around because he couldn\u2019t have any more than the weight of his back pack weighing down on him. Green spent almost an entire year not kicking his legs in the water.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a long process, and it\u2019s still not over,\u201d Green said. \u201cThey said it\u2019s going to take up to two years to completely heal all the way because I guess bone grows back really slowly.\u201d\nGreen still is dealing with a lot of pain, but said he is happy he still gets to compete this year. He swims the 200- and 500-yard freestyle events for the Bull Frogs and is also hoping to get on relay teams this year.\nGreen is not yet able to do any impact activity like running, but his doctor informed him that moving his leg around in the pool can actually be good for his recovery.\nGreen is back to regular swimming workouts and competitions for his sophomore season. He isn\u2019t all the way back to where he was, but is slowly working on getting there. North coach Logan Schaefer said they both have been working on focusing on the things Green is able to do and do the best they can.\n\u201cI think once we start to move and progress overall to getting back to full swimming, I think those things that we could do are going to be some strengths as we build back into more of the kicking and those types of things that we couldn\u2019t do a whole lot of recently,\u201d Schaefer said.\nGreen already is getting close to the times he swam last season, which is a good sign of how his recovery is going. He has aspirations of gaining a college scholarship for swimming and said he is glad osteochondritis dissecans hasn\u2019t taken those opportunities away from him.

It Quote: s an Iraqi doctor, Laeth al Sadi, who says: \"I faced some difficulties in trying to understand the Glaswegian accent. Words like 'I didnae ken' and 'swally', but with listening and speaking to people you get used to them and people are very helpful.\"\nWe like the fact that Al Jazeera then adds that the phrases mean \"didn't know\" and \"an alcoholic drink\" for those from further afield.\nStop the bus\nWHAT are the most exotic destinations you see on buses around Glasgow? Auchenshuggle and Bonkle are my favourites. Been to both, by the way. Anyway the story of the Bonkle baby bus will be celebrated at a stunning hi-tech son et lumiere show on Saturday at the Vintage Vehicle Trust's Bridgeton Garage when the tales will include the expectant mum in 1960s Lanarkshire who couldn't afford a taxi to Bellshill Maternity and instead caught the Bonkle bus where she was caught short and gave birth behind the driver's cab.\nThe clippie doubled as a midwife and she banished all the menfolk to the Woodbine-fugged upper saloon. The show runs from 4-8pm.\nRemembering Christine\nTHE death of former model Christine Keeler, who was caught up in the Profumo affair, reminds us of when The Herald's redoubtable Jack Webster interviewed Christine over dinner at the Russell Hotel in London. She drank three large whiskies then followed Jack to his hotel bedroom, still raging about people who had deceived her. As a worried Jack later revealed: \"Here I was, alone in a bedroom with the notorious Christine Keeler! I also got the feeling she rather liked me.\"\nFear not gentle reader. Jack diplomatically persuaded her to leave the room and escorted her back to the lounge bar.\nIrish puzzle\nAS we all try to make sense of the DUP's intervention in the Brexit debacle, John Henderson explains: \"The irony of the DUP is that they are nothing more than a bunch of dinosaurs who don't believe at all in the existence of dinosaurs.\"\nCopped it\nOUR story about Edinburgh being a possibility for Prince Harry's stag night reminds Russell Smith in Kilbirnie: \"A friend was tied to a lamppost in Paisley 's High Street many years ago after a stag night and he called out to a passing policeman for help. 'Don't worry son, the worst is still to come,' was the reassuring reply when he explained he was about to get married.\"\nSecret Santa\nA GLASGOW lawyer tells us: \"At the risk of revealing my Secret Santa mission to my colleagues, I thought the new Herald Diary book would be an ideal gift. I went into Waterstone's in Argyle Street, and as I entered, a very nice lady assistant engaged me in a welcoming smile, so I just asked, 'Herald Diary?' at which she grinned broadly, leaned forward and in her best pantomime voice said, 'It's behind you!' which it was.\"\nHave we mentioned that there is a new Diary compilation out just now? Under a tenner too.\nMonday night fever\nWE feel we should pass on the observation on social media by singer Tim Burgess, best known for being the frontman for The Charlatans -late on Tuesday morning he posted: \"Monday nights in Glasgow are like Saturday nights in most other places.\" He then added one of those winking smiley faces, but I'm keeping the Diary column unbesmirched by emojis.",

This energy can be generated by a sudden dislocation of segments of the crust, by a volcanic eruption or even by a manmade explosion. The dislocation of the crust causes most destructive earthquakes. The crust may first bend and then the stresses exceed the strength of rocks, they break. In the process of breaking, vibrations called seismic waves are generated. These waves travel outward from the source of the earthquake along the surface and through the earth at varying speeds depending on the material through which they move. These waves can cause disasters on the earth\u2019s surface. No structure on the planet can be constructed 100% earthquake proof; only its resistance to earthquake can be increased. Treatment is required to be given depending on the zone in which the particular site is located. Earthquake occurred in the recent past have raised various issues and have forced us to think about the disaster management. It has become essential to think right from planning stage to completion stage of a structure to avoid failure or to minimize the loss of property. Not only this, once the earthquake has occurred and disaster has taken place; how to use the debris to construct economical houses using this waste material without affecting their structural stability. \nHOW EARTHQUAKE RESISTANT CONSTRUCTION IS DIFFERENT? Since the magnitude of a future earthquake and shaking intensity expected at a particular site cannot be estimated with a reasonable accuracy, the seismic forces are difficult to quantify for the purposes of design. Further, the actual forces that can be generated in the structure during an earthquake are very large and designing the structure to respond elastically against these forces make it too expensive. Therefore, in the earthquake resistant design post yield inelastic behavior is usually relied upon to dissipate the input seismic energy. Thus the design forces of earthquakes may be only a fraction of maximum (probable) forces generated if the structure is to remain elastic during the earthquake. For instance, the design seismic for buildings may at times be as low as one tenths of the maximum elastic seismic force. Thus, the earthquake resistant construction and design does not aim to achieve a structure that will not get damaged in a strong earthquake having low probability of occurrence; it aims to have a structure that will perform appropriately and without collapse in the event of such a shaking. Ductility is the capacity of the structure to undergo deformation beyond yield without loosing much of its load carrying capacity. Higher is the ductility of the structure; more is the reduction possible in its design seismic force over what one gets for linear elastic response. Ensuring ductility in a structure is a major concern in a seismic construction. \nEFFECT OF EARTHQUAKE ON REINFORCED CONCRETE           BUILDINGS In recent times, reinforced concrete buildings have become common in     India. A typical RC building is made of horizontal members (beams and slabs) and vertical members (columns and walls) and supported by foundations that rest on the ground. The system consisting of RC columns and connecting beams is called a RC frame. \n\nThe RC frame participates in resisting earthquake forces. Earthquake shaking generates inertia forces in the building, which are proportional to the building mass. Since most of the building mass is present at the floor levels, earthquake induced inertia forces primarily develop at the floor levels. These forces travel downward through slabs to beams, beams to columns and walls and then to foundations from where they are dispersed to the ground. As the inertia forces accumulate downward from the top of the building (as shown in fig3.1) , the columns and walls at the lower storey experience higher earthquake induced forces and are therefore designed to be stronger than the storey above. \nRoles of floor slabs and masonry walls: Floor slabs are horizontal like elements, which facilitates functional use of buildings. Usually, beams and slabs at one storey level are cast together. In residential multistoried buildings, the thickness of slab is only about 110mm-150mm. when beams bend in vertical direction during earthquakes, these thin slabs bend along with them. When beams move in horizontal direction, the slab usually forces the beams to move together with it. \n\nIn most of the buildings, the geometric distortion of the slab is negligible in the horizontal plane; the behavior is known as rigid diaphragm action. After columns and floors in a RC building are cast and the concrete hardens, vertical spaces between columns and floors are usually filled in with masonry walls to demarcate a floor area into functional spaces. Normally, these masonry walls are called infill walls, are not connected to surrounding RC beams and columns.  When the columns receive horizontal forces at floor levels, they try to move in the horizontal direction, but masonry wall tend to resist this movement. Due to their heavy weight and thickness, these walls develop cracks once their ability to carry horizontal load is exceeded. Thus, infill walls act like sacrificial fuses in the buildings, they develop crack under severe ground shaking but help share the load the load of beams and columns until cracking. \nStrength hierarchy: For a building to remain safe during earthquake shaking columns (which receive forces from beams) should be stronger than beams and foundations (which receive forces from columns) should be stronger than columns. Further the connections between beams and columns, columns and foundations should not fail so that beams can safely transfer forces to columns and columns to foundations. When this strategy is adopted in the design, damage is likely to occur first in beams. When beams are detailed properly to have large ductility, the building as a whole can deform by large amounts despite progressive damage caused due to consequent yielding of beams. If columns are made weaker, localized damage can lead to the collapse of building, although columns at storey above remain almost undamaged. \n\n\nSEISMIC DESIGN PHILOSOPHY Severity of ground shaking at a given location during earthquake can be minor, moderate and strong. Relatively speaking, minor shaking occurs frequently; moderate shaking occasionally and strong shaking rarely. For instance, on average annually about 800 earthquakes of magnitude 5.0-5.9 occurs in the world, while the number is only 18 for the magnitude ranges 7.0-7.9. Since it costs money to provide additional earthquake safety in buildings, a conflict arises \u2018should we do away with the design of buildings for earthquake effects? Or should we design the building to be earthquake proof wherein there is no damage during strong but rare earthquake shaking. Clearly the formal approach can lead to a major disaster and second approach is too expensive. Hence the design philosophy should lie somewhere in between two extremes. \nEarthquake resistant building: The engineers do not attempt to make earthquake proof buildings that will not get damaged even during the rare but strong earthquake; such buildings will be too robust and also too expensive. Instead, engineering intention is to make buildings earthquake resistant, such building resists the effects of ground shaking, although they may get damaged severely but would not collapse during the strong earthquake. Thus, safety of peoples and contents is assured in earthquake resistant buildings and thereby, a disaster is avoided. This is a major objective of seismic design codes through the world. \n\nEarthquake design philosophy: The earthquake design philosophy may be summarized as follows: \u00b7           Under minor, but frequent shaking, the main members of the building that carry vertical and horizontal forces should not be damaged; however the building parts that do not carry load may sustain repairable damage. \u00b7           Under moderate but occasional shaking, the main member may sustain repairable damage, but the other parts of the building may be damaged such that they may even have to be replaced after the earthquake. \u00b7           Under strong but rare shaking, may sustain severe (even irreparable) damage, but the building should not collapse. \n\n\nThus after minor shaking, the building will be operational within a short time and repair cost will be small and after moderate shaking, the building will be operational once the repair and strengthening of the damaged main members is completed. But, after a strong earthquake, the building may become disfunctional for further use, but will stand so that people can be evacuated and property recovered. The consequences of damage have to be kept in view in the design philosophy. For example, important buildings like hospitals and fire stations play a critical role in post earthquake activities and must remain functional immediately after earthquake. These structures must sustain very little damage and should be designed for a higher level of earthquake protection. Collapse of dams during earthquake can cause flooding in the downstream reaches, which itself can be a secondary disaster. Therefore, dams and nuclear power plants should be designed for still higher level of earthquake motion. \n\n REMEDIAL MEASURES TO MINIMISE THE LOSSES DUE TO EARTHQUAKES Whenever a building project is prepared and designed, the first and the most important aspect of design is to know the zone to which this structure is likely to rest. Depending upon these, precautionary measures in structural design calculation are considered and structure can be constructed with sufficient amount of resistance to earthquake forces. Various measures to be adopted are explained pointwise, giving emphasis to increase earthquake resistance of buildings. \nBuilding planning: The records of various earthquake failures reveal that unsymmetrical structure performs poorly during earthquake. The unsymmetrical building usually develops torsion due to seismic forces, which causes development of crack leading to collapse of a structure. Building therefore should be constructed rectangular and symmetrical in plan. If a building has to be planned in irregular or unsymmetrical shape, it should be treated as the combination of a few rectangular blocks connected with passages. It will avoid torsion and will increase resistance of building to earthquake forces. \nFoundation: IS code recommends that as far as possible entire building should be founded on uniform soil strata. It is basically to avoid differential settlement. In case if loads transmitted on different column and column footing varies, foundation should be designed to have uniform settlement by changing foundation size as per code conditions to have a loading intensity for uniform settlement. Raft foundation performs better for seismic forces. If piles are driven to some depth over which a raft is constructed (raft cum pile foundation), the behaviour of foundation under seismic load will be far better. Piles will take care of differential settlement with raft and resistance of structure to earthquake forces will be very large. \n\nProvision of band: IS code recommends construction of concrete band at lintel level to resist earthquake. The studies revealed that building with band at lintel level and one at plinth level improves load carrying of building to earthquake tremendously. It is suggested here that if bands are plinth level, sill level, lintel level and roof level in the case of masonry structure only, the resistance of building to earthquake will increase tremendously. Band at sill level should go with vertical band and door openings to meet at lintel level. Hold fast of doors can be fitted in their sill band. In case of earthquake of very high intensity or large duration only infill wall between walls will fail minimizing casualties and sudden collapse of structure. People will get sufficient time to escape because of these bands. \nArches and domes: Behavior of arches has been found very unsatisfactory during earthquake. However domes perform very satisfactory due to symmetrical in nature. Arches during earthquake have tendency to separate out and collapse. Mild steel ties if provided at the ends, their resistance can be increased to a considerable extent. \nStaircases: These are the worst affected part of any building during earthquake. Studies reveal that this is mainly due to differential displacement of connected floors. This can be avoided by providing open joints at each floor at the stairway to eliminate bracing effect. \nBeam column joints: In framed structures the monolithic beam column connections are desirable so as to accommodate reversible deformations. The maximum moments occur at beam-column junction. Therefore most of the ductility requirements should be provided at the ends. Therefore spacing of ties in column is restricted to 100mm centre and in case of beam strips and rings should be closely spaced near the joints. The spacing should be restricted to 100mm centre to centre only near the supports. In case of columns, vertical ties are provided; performance of columns to earthquake forces can be increased to a considerable extent. Steel columns for tall buildings ie buildings more than 8 storey height should be provided as their performance is better than concrete column due to ductility behavior of material. \nMasonry building: Mortar plays an important role in masonry construction. Mortar possessing adequate strength should only be used. Studies reveal that a cement sand ratio of 1:5 or 1:6 is quite strong as well as economical also. If reinforcing bars are put after 8 to 10 bricklayers, their performance to earthquake is still better. Other studies have revealed that masonry infill should not be considered as non-structural element. It has been seen that in case of column bars are provided with joints at particular level about 600-700mm above floor level at all storey should be staggered. It may be working as a weak zone at complete floor level in that storey. As such if few measures are adopted during stages of design and construction of building their resistance to earthquake forces can be improved considerably. Though buildings cannot be made 100% earthquake proof but their resistance to seismic forces can be improved to minimize loss of property and human life during the tremors. \nEARTHQUAKE RESISTANT BUILDING CONSTRUCTION WITH REINFORCED HOLLOW CONCRETE BLOCK (RHCBM) Reinforced hollow concrete blocks are designed both as load-bearing walls for gravity loads and also as shear walls for lateral seismic loads, to safely withstand the earthquakes. This structural system of construction is known as shear wall-diaphragm concept, which gives three-dimensional structural integrity for the buildings. \n\n\nStructural features: \u00b7           Each masonry element is vertically reinforced with steel bars and concrete grouts fill, at regular intervals, through the continuous vertical cavities of hollow blocks. \u00b7           Similarly, each masonry element is horizontally reinforced with steel bars and concrete grout fills at plinth, sill, lintel and roof levels, as continuous RC bands using U-shaped concrete blocks in the masonry course, at repetitive levels. \u00b7           Grid of reinforcement can be built into each masonry element without the requirement of any extra shuttering and it reduces the scope of corrosion of the reinforcement. \u00b7           As the reinforcement bars in both vertical and horizontal directions can be continued into the roof slab and lateral walls respectively, the structural integrity in all three dimensions is achieved. \nStructural advantages: \u00b7           In this construction system, structurally, each wall and slab behaves as a shear wall and a diaphragm respectively, reducing the vulnerability of disastrous damage to the structure during natural hazards. \u00b7           Due to the uniform distribution of reinforcement in both vertical and horizontal directions, through each masonry element, increased tensile resistance and ductile behavior of elements could be achieved. Hence the construction system can safely resist lateral or cyclic loading, when compared to other masonry construction systems. This construction system has also been proved to offer better resistance under dynamic loading, when compared to the other conventional systems of construction. \nConstructional advantages: \u00b7           No additional formwork or any special construction machinery is required for reinforcing the hollow block masonry. \u00b7           Only semi-skilled labour is required for this type of construction. \u00b7           It is faster and easier construction system, when compared to the other conventional construction systems. \u00b7           It is also found to be cost-effective. \nArchitectural and other advantages: \u00b7           This constructional system provides better acoustic and thermal insulation for the building. \u00b7           This system is durable and maintenance free. Studies on the comparative cost economics of RHCBM: There is a general apprehension that the RHCBM would be a costlier system, as it advocates reinforcing and use of concrete grout in the hollow spaces within the masonry. To dispel the apprehension, the relative cost economics of RHCBM structures are worked out in comparison with conventional construction systems. \nStructural scheme cost per sq.m in Rs. Reinforced hollow concrete block masonry                               Rs.1822 RC framed structure with brick masonry infill                             Rs.1845 Load bearing masonry                                                                  Rs.1782 RHCBM has structural advantages of lighter dead weight and increased floor area. These advantages are quantitatively worked out from the fact that, RHCBM is built of 20cm thick hollow block wall, when compared to the 23cm thick one brick wall of RCC framed structure and 34cm thick one and half brick wall of load bearing structure. \nMID-LEVEL ISOLATION This includes mid-level isolation system installed while the buildings are still being used. This new method entails improving and classifying the columns on intermediate floors of an existing building into flexible columns that incorporate rubber bearings (base isolation systems) and rigid columns which have been wrapped in steel plates to add to their toughness. A combination of these two types of columns is then used to improve the earthquake-resistant performance of the building as a whole This is the first method of improving earthquake resistance in Japan that classifies the columns on the same floor as flexible columns and rigid columns, and it is the first case in west Japan (the Kansai region) of attaching rubber bearings by cutting columns on the intermediate floors an existing building. This method involves improving earthquake resistance while the buildings are still being used as normal operations.\n                        There are three types of base isolation systems, depending on the location where rubber bearings are incorporated: \u00b7           Pile head isolation \u00b7           Foundation isolation \u00b7           Mid-level isolation By cutting horizontally all columns and walls on a specific intermediate floor and installing rubber bearings in the columns that have been cut, that floor becomes extremely flexible, and the building will sway horizontally with the large sway amplitude of 40-50 centimeters under maximum level earthquakes. It therefore becomes possible that the finishing materials, piping and existing elevators may not be able to keep pace with the deformations and break, perhaps resulting in their protruding from the site of the building.\n                         In the head office of Himeji Shinkin Bank, columns with rubber bearings incorporated in them to allow them to move flexibly and rigid columns which were made tougher by wrapping steel plate were placed effectively, thereby suppressing horizontal deformation and improving the earthquake resistance of the building as a whole.\nVibration control units incorporating viscous materials with high energy absorption performance were installed in walls, to play the role of dampers. This reduced the swaying of the building. Mid-level isolation procedure is shown in the fig. \n\nEARTHQUAKE RESISTANCE USING SLURRY INFILTRATED MAT CONCRETE (SIMCON) Following the devastating earthquakes in Turkey this summer that killed as many as 20,000 people and injured another 27,000, images of survivors trapped beneath the rubble of collapsed buildings appeared daily in news reports worldwide. Now a North Carolina State University engineer is developing a new type of concrete to help prevent such scenes from happening again. Because it's reinforced with mats made of thousands of stainless steel fibers injected with special concrete slurry, the new material, called Slurry Infiltrated Mat Concrete (SIMCON), can sustain much higher stress loads and deformations than traditional concrete. Tests show that concrete buildings or bridges reinforced with SIMCON are far more earthquake-resistant and less likely to break apart in large chunks that fall off and cause injury to people below. If extreme stresses cause SIMCON to fail, its mass of fibers and concrete doesn't collapse in the same way traditional concrete does. Instead of large chunks breaking and falling from a structure, the material crumbles into small, harmless flakes. This controlled form of failure is a key advantage of SIMCON. Because failure is inevitable in all structures, engineers must design buildings and bridges to fail in the safest way. In conventional concrete structures, this is achieved through the use of steel reinforcing bars -- rebars -- that give the concrete tensile strength it would otherwise lack. For safety and design reasons, the concrete is designed so that the rebars will fail before the concrete does. Unfortunately, many structures have not been designed to sustain the powerful stresses caused by earthquakes. When such extreme stresses occur, the concrete can crack, explode and break away from the rebars, causing the structure to collapse. By contrast, failure of SIMCON would present little danger to people or property below. \nTRADITIONAL EARTHQUAKE REISTANT HOUSING Earthquakes are not common phenomena in most parts of the world. Hence, houses in most rural areas are not built to withstand seismic forces, resulting in heavy causalities even in moderate quakes. In some parts of the world, however, where earthquakes are common, people have incorporated the critical elements of quake-resistance in their traditional construction method. Traditional house building techniques have successfully demonstrated, during past earthquakes in the Himalayan region, that there is inherent after component associated with the constructional design. This was found during the 1905 Kangra earthquake, the traditional Kat-Ki Kunni houses in Kullu valley made up of timber remained unaffected. The Dhajji-Diwari buildings remained intact in the 1885 Srinagar earthquake. Similarly, in Uttarkashi the traditional 100 years old multistoried buildings called Pherols have incorporated basic features of earthquake resistance. \nThe Pherols of Uttarkashi: Pherols are old traditionally built multistoried structures found in Uttarkashi district. The main materials of constructions are stone and wood with mud mortar. The construction is essentially coarse-rubble masonry type. The various earthquake resistant features in these types of houses are the use of wooden tie-bands as beams and vertical timber columns as pins to tie the inside and outside Wyeths of a wall. Long stones with flat surfaces are distributed in the walls to make the loads vertical in the wall units and minimize the tendency of the wall stones to push or run outward. Moreover, to distribute some of the seismic load vertically corner reinforcements are provided by the use of wooden blocks and long flat stones. Also, the height of the floor is kept low and there are minimum numbers of openings, for keeping the centre of gravity low and also for the insulation purposes. \nThe Dhajji-Diwari buildings of Kashmir: The Dhajji-Diwari buildings were the one that survived when part of the palace and other massive old building collapsed in the Srinagar quake of 1885. The most significant aspect of the Dhajji-Diwari buildings is the combination of the building materials used. These materials are locally available and have been used for generations. The basic elements in these buildings are the load bearing masonry piers and infill walls. There are wooden tie-bands at each floor level. The foundation consists of rubble masonry with lime mortar whereas; mud mortar is used for the rest of the structure. The infill materials are usually abode bricks bonded with mud mortar. The wooden bands tie the walls of the structure with the floors and also impart ductility to a structure that is otherwise brittle. The unreinforced masonry walls have stiffness but not strength. In the absence of strength, flexibility is essential for quake resistance. Here, the desired flexibility is provided by the combination of wood and unreinforced masonry laid in a wear mortar. The wooden beams tie the whole house together and ensure that the entire building sways together as one unit in an earthquake. \nThe Kat-Ki- Kunni Buildings of Kulu Valley: Similar to the Pherols and the Dhajji-Diwari buildings, the Kat-Ki-Kunni or timber cornered buildings suffered minimal damage in the epicentral tract of Kulu Valley during the 1905 Kangra earthquake. This structure is almost identical to the Pherols of Uttarkashi. It combines the weight, solidity and coolness of a stone building with the flexibility and earthquake-resisting qualities of a wooden one. Here the wood bonding takes place at vertical intervals of three to five feet. Two parallel beams are laid along with layer of masonry, one on the inside and one on the outside. At the end of one wall the beams cross them on the walls at right angle, and the wooden pins hold the crossing together. Crossties of wood similarly hold the two parallel beams in position at intervals along their length. \nQuincha earthquake resistant buildings: Following a devastating earthquake in the Alto Mayo region of Peru in 1990 ITDG's Shelter Programme became involved in a major reconstruction project to build earthquake resistant housing using 'improved quincha' - a timber and lattice frame design with an earth infill - based on traditional technologies. Traditional quincha building technology results in a flexible structure with an inherent earthquake resistance. It has been used in parts of Peru for many centuries. Traditionally, a quincha house would have a round pole set directly in the ground; in filled with smaller wooden poles and interwoven to form a matrix, which is then plastered with one or more layers of earth. ITDG worked closely with builders, householders and community organisations in Alto Mayo to introduce improved, earthquake resistant building technology - quincha mejorada. Improved quincha had the following characteristics over and above traditional quincha: \u00b7      Concrete foundations for greater stability. \u00b7   Wooden columns treated with tar or pitch to protect against humidity, concreted into the ground with nails embedded in the wood at the base to give extra anchorage. \u00b7   Using concrete wall bases to prevent humidity affecting the wood and the canes in the walls. \u00b7     Careful jointing between columns and beams to improve structural integrity. \u00b7     Canes woven in a vertical fashion to provide greater stability. \u00b7     Lightweight metal sheet roofing to reduce danger of falling tiles. \u00b7     Nailing roofing material to roof beams; tying of beams and columns with roof wires. \u00b7    Incorporating roof eaves of sufficient width to ensure protection of walls from heavy rains. \nCONCLUSIONS \u00b7     There is a lack of awareness in the earthquake disaster mitigations. Avoiding non-engineered structures with unskilled labour even in unimportant temporary constructions can help a great way. \u00b7      Statewide awareness programmes have to be conducted by fully exploiting the advancement in the information technology. \u00b7     Urgent steps are required to be taken to make the codal provisions regarding earthquake resistant construction undebatable. \u00b7 The builders and constructors should adopt the codal provisions in all the future construction, as prevention is better than cure. On the light of avoiding the risk, this may not be an impossible task as earthquake resistant measures in building involves only 2%-6% additional cost depending on the type of building. Using construction techniques like SIMCON and RHCBM can not only mitigate earthquake effects but also are cost effective. \n\n\n                                          REFERENCES \n1.

The Palestinians want east Jerusalem \u2014 which Israel captured in 1967 \u2014 for their capital. \nBut Trump declared it was time for a new approach to Mideast peace after decades of failure. Calling Jerusalem Israel\u2019s capital, he argued, was merely recognizing the obvious. \n\u201cWe cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past,\u201d the president said. \nFreeland had been briefed on the announcement in a call Monday with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, sources told The Canadian Press. The two are together this week at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where Tillerson has been getting an earful from world leaders over Trump\u2019s move. \n\u201cWe are strongly committed to the goal of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East, including the creation of a Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace and security with Israel,\u201d Freeland said in a statement. \n\u201cWe call for calm and continue to support the building of conditions necessary for the parties to find a solution.\u201d \nPrime Minister Justin Trudueau, who is on a state visit to China, told reporters Thursday that Canada will keep its embassy in Tel Aviv. \n\u201cCanada has a long-standing policy on the Mideast that we need to work toward a two-state solution through direct negotiations,\u201d Trudeau said. \n\u201cWe will continue to engage constructively and substantively in the region with partners and friends around the world.\u201d \nWorld leaders from the Pope to the Chinese government raised concerns Wednesday that Trump\u2019s move would further escalate tensions in the region and threaten the ongoing peace process, as well as any potential for the U.S. to broker any kind of peace. \nIn Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his nation was \u201cprofoundly grateful\u201d and Trump\u2019s announcement was an \u201cimportant step toward peace.\u201d \nHowever, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that the U.S. shift \u201cis a declaration of withdrawal from the role it has played in the peace process.\u201d \nNew Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh said the U.S. decision was counterproductive and Canada should speak up. \n\u201cIt is something that needs to be pointed out as being divisive,\u201d Singh said. \nThe Conservatives offered no comment, perhaps remembering their own political history. \nMuch like Trump\u2019s decision was part of a campaign promise, in 1979, Progressive Conservative leader Joe Clark made a similar promise ahead of the federal campaign. \nHe reiterated it upon winning power, but after a significant outcry from business and community leaders, backed away from the idea. \nEven former prime minister Stephen Harper, a staunch supporter of Israel, never proposed the idea, though his former foreign affairs minister courted some controversy when he met with an Israeli politician in east Jerusalem, which many diplomats refuse to do. \nBut that the proposal continues to have some political traction domestically was evident during the campaign to replace Harper, when contender Kellie Leitch proposed moving the embassy as part of her platform. \nShe wouldn\u2019t comment Wednesday. \nGroups who advocate on behalf of the Jewish community do feel the Liberals should follow Trump. \n\u201cSince the re-establishment of the modern State of Israel, Jerusalem has been the home to Israel\u2019s democratically elected parliament, independent supreme court, and national government offices,\u201d the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs said in a statement. \n\u201cWe have always maintained that Canada should formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\u201d \n\u2014 with files from the Associated Press ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kellie

There is nothing worse than waking up after very little sleep knowing that you\u2019ve got a heavy session ahead of you. Especially when it\u2019s benching. Although I\u2019ve honestly felt tired since I turned 18 (who else is with me?), that feeling is amplified 100 times when I don\u2019t get at least 7 hours. Anything less than that and my body just seems to be working in slow motion. \nI know some people will look at me complaining about not getting 7 hours of sleep when they get 5-6 hours every night like I\u2019m a bitch. And you\u2019re right, I am a bitch about my sleep. But that\u2019s because I like it!! Some people are able to work off of very little sleep and I applaud you, I have no idea how you do it. To me you\u2019re superheroes. \nThe point I\u2019m trying to make is that whether you can work off of 5 hours of sleep or you need to 10 hours of sleep to function, you need to be making sure that you are getting that consistently every night. \nOne of the easiest things that you can do to help your lifting is making sure you are getting enough sleep for your body to be able to perform at a high rate. Sleeping is where your body rests and recovers the best, because you\u2019re not doing anything. Simple enough. So don\u2019t take it for granted. \nThere will be times in your schedule where you\u2019ll be forced to get less sleep than you need. Which as a lifter who is on a program it sucks, because unless you\u2019re able to take that next day as rest from the gym, majority of the time that sleep deprived workout is going to be a struggle. \nJust like yesterday was!! \nNot only was I forced to wake up a lot earlier than I would have liked, but my working day was far longer than normal, and when it comes to lifting specific weights on certain days, any little disruption can have a impact in your training. \nMy bench press session suffered greatly for this. It\u2019s one of the lifts where if I\u2019m sleep deprived, the lift just feels like crap. Deadlifts and squats I\u2019m fine with because if need be I can muscle through reps or I can easily dump the weight. Not so much on the bench press when the bar is literally hovering over your body. \nIf you do decide to go to the gym regardless if you\u2019re sleep deprived or not. You\u2019ve gotta make sure that you kill the workout!! Otherwise you\u2019ll put yourself into a negative frame of mind that could snowball into the next workout and so forth. \nIf you get to your working sets and you don\u2019t lift the weight with as much speed as you\u2019d like, or if it feels heavy. Don\u2019t let that stop you. As soon as you finish that set, put it to the back of your mind. It\u2019s done and you don\u2019t need to worry about it anymore, just make sure that your sets get better as they go along. You\u2019ll end up finding, as I did, that the deeper into the workouts you get, the smoother things will feel. That\u2019s exactly how I felt. It was only around the 5th set or so that things started to click. From there the bar speed was quite consistent. \nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say within this post is that you should be trying to get as much sleep as possible for the days that you are lifting. It\u2019ll help massively with your overall mental state as well you\u2019re recovery which in turn leads to better lifting success. However if you do get less sleep than planned. SMASH THAT WORKOUT!! \nHow many hours of sleep do you need to feel ready to training?

12/7/17 4:11 AM \nCOLUMBUS, Ind. \u2014 Columbus North swimmer Nick Green didn\u2019t quite understand how severe his condition was when he was diagnosed with osteochondritis dissecans right before his freshman season. \nMultiple doctors informed Green and his family that he could lose his ability to walk if he didn\u2019t treat the condition in a timely manner. \nSome bone in Green\u2019s right knee was dying and getting absorbed, which was creating a hole. Doctors told him that more would continue to break off if he didn\u2019t get it fixed. \n\u201cIt definitely took me by surprise,\u201d Green said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know the word for it. I was just shocked. I was very upset. I didn\u2019t think I was going to have my high school season, to be honest. But we found a doctor who said I could swim and have my high school season.\u201d \nGreen finished his freshman swim season before having his surgery in March. Doctors had to drill on the sides of his knee and insert screws to establish blood flow for his bone to grow. \nThe doctors took bone from his hip and partially filled the hole with bone plugs in hopes of having the rest of his bone grow back. Green received good news when a doctor told him at his most recent checkup that the bone was growing back. \nGreen\u2019s next check up is on Thursday, where doctors will check the progress and see if any screws in his knee have migrated. \nGreen, who has been swimming competitively since he was 6 years old, wasn\u2019t sure if the surgery would work, which put his entire swimming career in jeopardy. Fortunately for Green, he spent eight weeks on crutches, but was allowed back in the water just two weeks after the surgery. \nGreen eventually transitioned to a custom-fit unloader knee brace to help shift the weight from the healing portion of his leg. He participated in physical therapy once a week at the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital for about four months. \nAlthough he could get back in the water, Green wasn\u2019t allowed to kick for six months. He put a pull buoy between his legs to prevent himself from kicking, which put a lot of strain on his upper body muscles. \nGreen had to push off with one leg for his flip-turns and did only upper body lifts in the weight room. He couldn\u2019t even carry weights around because he couldn\u2019t have any more than the weight of his back pack weighing down on him. Green spent almost an entire year not kicking his legs in the water. \n\u201cIt\u2019s just a long process, and it\u2019s still not over,\u201d Green said. \u201cThey said it\u2019s going to take up to two years to completely heal all the way because I guess bone grows back really slowly.\u201d \nGreen still is dealing with a lot of pain, but said he is happy he still gets to compete this year. He swims the 200- and 500-yard freestyle events for the Bull Frogs and is also hoping to get on relay teams this year. \nGreen is not yet able to do any impact activity like running, but his doctor informed him that moving his leg around in the pool can actually be good for his recovery. \nGreen is back to regular swimming workouts and competitions for his sophomore season. He isn\u2019t all the way back to where he was, but is slowly working on getting there. North coach Logan Schaefer said they both have been working on focusing on the things Green is able to do and do the best they can. \n\u201cI think once we start to move and progress overall to getting back to full swimming, I think those things that we could do are going to be some strengths as we build back into more of the kicking and those types of things that we couldn\u2019t do a whole lot of recently,\u201d Schaefer said. \nGreen already is getting close to the times he swam last season, which is a good sign of how his recovery is going. He has aspirations of gaining a college scholarship for swimming and said he is glad osteochondritis dissecans hasn\u2019t taken those opportunities away from him. The goal is to be back at 100 percent by next season.

Well here\u2019s my Top 10 presents for lifters which are perfect for Secret Santa!! \n1. Creatine Monohydrate \nMost supplements are expensive to buy, especially some of the big brands. Especially when it comes to pre-workouts and protein powders. If you\u2019re on a budget and need to get them something relatively cheap then creatine monohydrate is the way to go. You can buy a big bag of the supplement for less than \u00a310 and it lasts a very long time. The purpose for this supplement is to help promote protein synthesis, AKA gains!! No who doesn\u2019t want that. \n2. Chalk \nWhether it\u2019s standard block of chalk, or the liquid chalk. This is a life saver for the average lifter. For those who are training for powerlifting where straps aren\u2019t allowed. Chalk will help for those sessions where the bar just keeps slipping from your hands. I use chalk pretty much every session and I honestly don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without it. \n3. Lifting Straps \nIf for whatever reason your Gym doesn\u2019t allow you to use chalk (personally I would switch gym\u2019s if that were the case). Then lifting straps are a great accessory to have in your gym bag. This takes grip problems out of the equations and allows you to handle significantly heavier weights. \n4. LAX Ball \nIf you are looking for an mobility tool that really works the deep muscle tissue to release tension before you lift. Look no further than a simple LAX ball. It\u2019s absolutely torture to use, but your body will thank you for it afterwards. \n5. Protein Treats \nThere are a lot of food companies who have expanded into selling treats such as cookies and chocolate that have a higher percentage of protein than normal. Definitely a worthwhile gift for someone who is struggle through cutting and has a little bit of a sweet tooth. \n6. Protein Beer \nThis is a great gag gift for those who are so strict on their diet they don\u2019t allow themselves to drink alcohol. So get them to lighten up over the holiday by buying a 6 pack of protein beer. It means they can come out partying as well as hit their macros!! \n7. Smelling Salts \nFOR THE HARDCORE LIFTERS ONLY!! I have never tried nor ever wanted to try smelling salts. But if you know someone who likes to use them to get amped up for their workouts, it may not be a bad secret Santa gift. \n8. Deadlift Slippers \nNot to be confused with the weird shoes that show off each individual toe. The idea of this gift is so that the lifter can be as close to the ground as possible, giving them the best leverages. Whilst you can\u2019t compete in socks. You can in deadlift slippers. \n9. Tripod \nAre you tired of having to be the one filming your friend for various different angles whilst they work out? Maybe it would be worth buying them a tripod that can be wrapped around a squat rack or propped on a bench. At least it means you\u2019re free on camera-person duty. \n10. Sour Sweets \nSour sweets maybe just me when I\u2019m training a long, heavy session. But sweets in general can give you a good little boost of energy to help get through your workout. Just make sure they don\u2019t eat the entire bag during one session, make them savour it over a couple at least. Anddd that\u2019s the list!! You\u2019ve now got a list of presents you can get a lifter if you were stuck with them on secret Santa, or if you wanted to get them a stocking filler. As always, if I\u2019ve missed anything off. Let me know if   Happy Holidays!!
