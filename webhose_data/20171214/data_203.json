While some non-native species have minimal effects on biodiversity*, and a few may be beneficial, about 15% have unacceptable damaging consequences and are termed invasive non-native species. It is critical to ensure that the invasive subset of the non-native species are identified so that plans can be put into place to manage them. However, this can be difficult. Additionally, given limited resources available, it is necessary to prioritise invasive non-native species by ranking them, for example on the basis of the extent of their negative impacts. Evidence of impacts is often scarce. These are species that may not yet have arrived in a new region and so the nature of their ecological interactions within an invaded range may be yet to unfold. Authors Helen Roy and and Wolfgang Rabitsch \nDespite these constraints there have been many studies developing ways of assessing impacts which have contributed hugely to understanding of invasions. Furthermore, there have been many predictive models to describe the probability of a species arriving and subsequently establishing self-sustaining populations. Risk assessments endeavour to pull together all the information on the invasion process for a specific species using the best available evidence on introduction events, establishment probabilities, patterns of spread and potential negative impacts. Such risk assessments are a vital component of decision-making and underpin policies in invasive non-native species. \nMany different risk assessment approaches have been developed. Some focus on specific groups of plants or animals, others on distinct environments and some for specific legislative purposes. In every case, considerable work is required to bring together the required information and, there are huge benefits for ensuring consistent approaches while recognising that one size does not necessarily fit all. \nWith funding from the European Commission, 35 European experts on invasion biology from 17 European countries came together through a collaborative study to devise a framework of minimum standards as a checklist for quality assurance . I had the pleasure of leading this group and enjoyed the lively and stimulating discussions that ultimately led to agreement that a risk assessment should comply with 14 minimum standards (attributes). Many of these are intuitive, a risk assessment should include a basic description of the species and how likely it is to invade, spread and have negative impacts on biodiversity. However, socio-economic impacts are also important and, while the invasion community has struggled to consistently assess biodiversity impacts, socio-economic impacts seem to be even more tricky to assess (although there has been huge progress with the recent publication of SEICAT ). It is exciting to see new ways of tackling these difficulties including through the development of innovative statistical models . \nSo the agreed minimum standards were: Basic species description", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "helen roy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wolfgang rabitsch", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:05.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e6bbe3184b852f29f8a4249a0ab3ff09ce435b02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyg1PCQry16HRcKaGHapGr5r1q5S9s7MrheBkd1hkvDj7ga.gHNcNoyQlbQv.MCFM-", "site_full": "dublinss1.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://dublinss1.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "ORLAISE \u2013 Our visit to Dublin", "title": "ORLAISE", "title_full": "ORLAISE", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e6bbe3184b852f29f8a4249a0ab3ff09ce435b02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyg1PCQry16HRcKaGHapGr5r1q5S9s7MrheBkd1hkvDj7ga.gHNcNoyQlbQv.MCFM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Els Planells", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "ORLAISE", "text": "The sport we have created is Orlaise.\nIt is played on land and it is about speed, this sport is a team sport.\nThe sport is played on a field like a football one.

Having found his wife in bed with another man just before her death, Jakob decides his only chance of closure is to find her lover so that he can comprehend what they shared. With the help of Grace, a lost and troubled companion, Jakob starts to search for the pieces of the puzzle to lead him to the man but closure changes to obsession and revenge and ultimately forces Jakob to face his own personal failings, as Grace realizes all is not what it seems. Written bySebastien Guy \n\nNerve (2013) online streaming \n\n2495778 User Review: \n\nI have had the pleasure to watch Nerve during the Sydney Film Festival and all I could think of was 'Whaoooo'. I was glad to see one of my favorite style executed in a movie shot in my own city. The style which allow you as an audience to think, and see where it will take you. Nothing is given away in too many obvious way, but everyone with a sense of details will get to the end of the film and think 'yeah, that's it, I understand now!' Allowing us to think as an audience, but also as people, relating with our own life, our own doubts, and our own mistakes. Relating to the character in such a deep way that we understand them, or just accept them without judging. The directing and acting performances has been extremely well executed. I loved the way it has been filmed. It helped me to be part of this space, which somehow created that tension that I am looking forward when watching a movie like this. The sound has been admirably polished to a point where you could easily just close your eyes and let it go. Highly recommend.\n\n2495778 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christian clark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sebastien guy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgina haig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben livingston andrea demetriades", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helen white denise roberts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stevens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jakob", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elena shadae magson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jakob evans georgina haig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vincent gregory gary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darren anderson sara wiseman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jakob evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tj nathan waring", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer rest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gwen evans murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gary sweet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sally livingston cameron daddo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silvia colloca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy paul winchester", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:06.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c0dc2e98d9f8016f3f7b6d00e7fa31d0c7d0d8c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog604l4yNF7vJvB8AdsWR0mQY2GmJr3PDD5re4_Xx._oe.gcf_G6qsuf4tToHQx.hGPVu8oqJrRZPYN0KHU0TJXxI-", "site_full": "community.freepbx.org", "site": "freepbx.org", "site_section": "http://community.freepbx.org/c/general-help", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "General Help - FreePBX Community Forums", "title": "FreePBX using wrong username on Trunk", "title_full": "FreePBX using wrong username on Trunk - General Help - FreePBX Community Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T17:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.freepbx.org/assets/default-apple-touch-icon.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 38874, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c0dc2e98d9f8016f3f7b6d00e7fa31d0c7d0d8c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog604l4yNF7vJvB8AdsWR0mQY2GmJr3PDD5re4_Xx._oe.gcf_G6qsuf4tToHQx.hGPVu8oqJrRZPYN0KHU0TJXxI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "GWalmsley", "published": "2017-12-07T17:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "FreePBX using wrong username on Trunk", "text": "Hi,\nI am running two FreePBX servers (13.0.192.19), one in London and one in Manchester on Asterisk 11.23.1. I have a strange issue were calls are being made out via trunks using the wrong username. This only seems to happen if the initial call came in down an intra-company route.\nFor example: User has a call forward set to their mobile phone. If their extension is called from another extension on the same PBX, the forward works, but if the call came from the other PBX down an intra-company route, the forward never happens.\nAnother example (which I have logs for): We have some departments split over the two sites, so we have ring groups setup in both sites with one site (Manchester in this case) having the number of the other site (London) ring group in the extension list with an # on the end. Users call the Manchester ring group which then rings phones in both sites. If the call is from an extension in Manchester, it all works fine, but if it is from a London extension (so call goes down the intra-company route to Manchester, then the London ring group is called from there) then the London ring group never rings.\nFor the test:\nCalling London Extension: 2292\nManchester Ring Group: 3289\nLondon Ring Group: 2289\nLooking in the logs I have, you can see the call going out from London 2292 to Manchester 3289 and the phones in the ring group, including 2289# being dialled but the call to 2289 is rejected.\n-- Executing [s@macro-dialout-trunk:23] Dial(\"Local/2289@from-internal-0000658b;2\", \"SIP/LondonSIP/2289,300,rwWxXTt\") in new stack -- Called SIP/LondonSIP/2289 -- Local/2289@from-internal-0000658b;1 is ringing WARNING[2466][C-000067fa]: chan_sip.c:23242 handle_response_invite: Received response: \"**Forbidden**\" from '\"Help:IT Build Room\" <sip:**2292@172.29.0.217**>;tag=as4373543e' == Everyone is busy/congested at this time (1:0/0/1) -- Executing [s@macro-dialout-trunk:24] NoOp(\"Local/2289@from-internal-0000658b;2\", \"Dial failed for some reason with DIALSTATUS = CHANUNAVAIL and HANGUPCAUSE = 21\") in new stack\nYou can see from where I have highlighted, the wrong username is being sent to the other PBX. The username on the Trunk is set to 'ManchesterSIP' but FreePBX is sending 2292 which is the extension number of the original caller.\nOn the London end you can see the incoming call being rejected because the username is wrong:\nWARNING[24684][C-0000457a]: chan_sip.c:16588 check_auth: username mismatch, have <**2292**>, digest has <**ManchesterSIP**> NOTICE[24684][C-0000457a]: chan_sip.c:25801 handle_request_invite: Failed to authenticate device \"Help:IT Build Room\" <sip:2292@172.29.0.217>;tag=as313a0dc2\nI can't see any setting to change this behaviour, so I am guessing it is either a bug, or I am missing something fundamental in my setup.\nAny help or advice would be appreciated.\nGraham", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:06.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae9f597005cd0e91d26e3f75f86c4a0d972f970a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.atIXNnaXxGciShFBUBfPwOmABis1ZAxYvTiqfi8SPOlWvAIwLoz4IRu3gNkvk2D.Pd5tmvRyemeakvdSnv.xI3esFudWt0UU-", "site_full": "www.ramforum.com", "site": "ramforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.ramforum.com/f41/", "site_categories": ["entertainment", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Exterior - DODGE RAM FORUM - Dodge Truck Forums", "title": "Some days you should be able to get a do over", "title_full": "Some days you should be able to get a do over - DODGE RAM FORUM - Dodge Truck Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T15:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b57bf53929d341e60627f6a57b398c9f42e710b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.atIXNnaXxGciShFBUBfPwOmABis1ZAxYvTiqfi8SPOlWvAIwLoz4IRu3gNkvk2D.Pd5tmvRyemeakvdSnv.xInpA2yp3NUjHqJ0XVi77VRw--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "JRG18", "published": "2017-12-06T06:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Originally Posted by Thorvald Strange you should post this... my son's basketball net blew over in the wind last night and JUST missed our new truck.\nGet home tonight and the wife asks if I saw the hood of my car...\nGRRR missed truck, hit car.

Von vier N\u00e4chten haben wir uns drei Tage \u00fcber die Hygiene des Zimmers beschwert, drei Mal war jemand bei uns im Zimmer und hat sich f\u00fcr den Zustand entschuldigt. Nach der dritten Beschwerde wurde unser Zimmer mit Chlor gereinigt und hat danach zwei Tage nach Chlor gestunken. Die kaputte Glasplatte blieb nat\u00fcrlich da und sauber war es trotzdem nicht. Im Badezimmer hing ein Bild mit mehreren Spritzflecken und diese wurden bis zu unserer Abreise \u00fcberhaupt nicht beseitigt. Die B\u00f6den unserer Kommoden im Schlafzimmer waren ebenso bis zur Abreise staubig und wurden nicht gewischt, obwohl wir dies explizit an das Management und den MOD weiterleiteten.

We've overcome many hurdles thrown our way, and they've only made us stronger. If you\u2019ve purchased a Rank or any other item on the Hypixel Store, you\u2019ve directly helped us cover our costs and supported the development of minigames and systems across the server.\nBack in June 2014, when the EULA was first announced, we were quite scared and to be honest, it did hurt our income quite badly. We had to work a lot harder to cover the high expenses of running a big Minecraft server in the following months. It resulted in the demise of many networks, the EULA was written by people who have little idea what communities like Hypixel are about and listened to none of the suggestions put forward by lead server networks.\nInstead of giving up, we decided to triple the size of the team. Our logic was that if we were having such a hard time so were our competitors, and that it was the best time for us to stand out and improve ourselves to survive. The quantity and quality of content improved and soon we started to break player records across the board. Backed by the support of our community, we were able to invest further in Minecraft and scale our team beyond anything we could have ever imagined.\nBack in 2015, I made a topic asking the community for ideas for the Hypixel Store and we ended up adding some of them, as well as improving our current ranks by adding tons of features, and generally reducing the prices of all store items.\nSome of these changes really helped and allowed us to hire passionate developers that are making updates and new games that are enjoyed by millions - you guys are amazing for allowing us to do this.\nToday, I come to you guys for suggestions and ideas for the store once again. We want to keep hiring talented people, buy more servers and improve the quality of services as a whole across all aspects of the server. Many veterans for the past few years have been asking for new stuff and find it quite difficult to support the server if they are not excited by Mystery Boxes or Loot Chests.\nWe decided it would be a good time for us to sit down and think of ideas before the holidays. Talking about monetization with our community is something that we like to do and is not common in the gaming industry, but we want to find the right balance to make everyone happy as well as being able to keep the lights on.\nIn 2013, long before EULA happened, we said that we wouldn't add a new rank after MVP+ and I still think it's possible to keep it that way. To be honest, it would be quite confusing to add a new rank name with all of our MVP+ features around. However, one idea that I had is to have a rank addon/extension, MVP++ for example (or gold MVP+?), that would come with much requested features such as access to a new redesigned /nick command, private custom game hosting, animated forum frames, automatic tipping, monthly bonuses as well as other features.\nWe are thinking to price it fairly low on a monthly subscription, so that way we can have a more stable income on a month to month basis and easily plan out our future investments with the network, and the income would help us support rolling these features out to so many players which we can\u2019t easily do at the moment. So far these are all just ideas, so please help us out with your feedback!\nKeep in mind that we are still working on a Merch store selling physical items like Hypixel clothing - we have received products from a variety of companies, and we are reviewing the quality right now - as soon as we have made our choice, we will setup the store and get it rolling, we aren\u2019t expecting it to have it out by christmas however.\nWe are aiming for the highest quality possible and do not plan to make much profit on this; our goal is to have people wearing Hypixel stuff in everyday life - so this is kind of unrelated with this post and will be discussed more deeply in another topic.\nIm sure you guys have plenty of ideas and suggestions for us, so we are going to do a contest and I will pick 5 people for 100$ store coupons that come up with great ideas for new addition to the store or rank addon features.\nExample of other ideas;\n- A special Mystery Box that guarantees an item you don't have\n- Loot Boxes for SkyWars\n- Special VIP Lobby Party House\n- A gadget that allows you to dab (pls no)\nI will be picking 5 winners for $100 store credits by December 20th 2017, please note that even if someone is picked for an original idea(s), it doesn't mean the idea will be used.\nDisclaimer: Please keep in mind that this is an ongoing discussion topic, nothing is final and ideas in this post are what they are: ideas.\nPlease read the full post before posting.

We've overcome many hurdles thrown our way, and they've only made us stronger. If you\u2019ve purchased a Rank or any other item on the Hypixel Store, you\u2019ve directly helped us cover our costs and supported the development of minigames and systems across the server.\nBack in June 2014, when the EULA was first announced, we were quite scared and to be honest, it did hurt our income quite badly. We had to work a lot harder to cover the high expenses of running a big Minecraft server in the following months. It resulted in the demise of many networks, the EULA was written by people who have little idea what communities like Hypixel are about and listened to none of the suggestions put forward by lead server networks.\nInstead of giving up, we decided to triple the size of the team. Our logic was that if we were having such a hard time so were our competitors, and that it was the best time for us to stand out and improve ourselves to survive. The quantity and quality of content improved and soon we started to break player records across the board. Backed by the support of our community, we were able to invest further in Minecraft and scale our team beyond anything we could have ever imagined.\nBack in 2015, I made a topic asking the community for ideas for the Hypixel Store and we ended up adding some of them, as well as improving our current ranks by adding tons of features, and generally reducing the prices of all store items.\nSome of these changes really helped and allowed us to hire passionate developers that are making updates and new games that are enjoyed by millions - you guys are amazing for allowing us to do this.\nToday, I come to you guys for suggestions and ideas for the store once again. We want to keep hiring talented people, buy more servers and improve the quality of services as a whole across all aspects of the server. Many veterans for the past few years have been asking for new stuff and find it quite difficult to support the server if they are not excited by Mystery Boxes or Loot Chests.\nWe decided it would be a good time for us to sit down and think of ideas before the holidays. Talking about monetization with our community is something that we like to do and is not common in the gaming industry, but we want to find the right balance to make everyone happy as well as being able to keep the lights on.\nIn 2013, long before EULA happened, we said that we wouldn't add a new rank after MVP+ and I still think it's possible to keep it that way. To be honest, it would be quite confusing to add a new rank name with all of our MVP+ features around. However, one idea that I had is to have a rank addon/extension, MVP++ for example (or gold MVP+?), that would come with much requested features such as access to a new redesigned /nick command, private custom game hosting, animated forum frames, automatic tipping, monthly bonuses as well as other features.\nWe are thinking to price it fairly low on a monthly subscription, so that way we can have a more stable income on a month to month basis and easily plan out our future investments with the network, and the income would help us support rolling these features out to so many players which we can\u2019t easily do at the moment. So far these are all just ideas, so please help us out with your feedback!\nKeep in mind that we are still working on a Merch store selling physical items like Hypixel clothing - we have received products from a variety of companies, and we are reviewing the quality right now - as soon as we have made our choice, we will setup the store and get it rolling, we aren\u2019t expecting it to have it out by christmas however.\nWe are aiming for the highest quality possible and do not plan to make much profit on this; our goal is to have people wearing Hypixel stuff in everyday life - so this is kind of unrelated with this post and will be discussed more deeply in another topic.\nIm sure you guys have plenty of ideas and suggestions for us, so we are going to do a contest and I will pick 5 people for 100$ store coupons that come up with great ideas for new addition to the store or rank addon features.\nExample of other ideas;\n- A special Mystery Box that guarantees an item you don't have\n- Loot Boxes for SkyWars\n- Special VIP Lobby Party House\n- A gadget that allows you to dab (pls no)\nI will be picking 5 winners for $100 store credits by December 20th 2017, please note that even if someone is picked for an original idea(s), it doesn't mean the idea will be used.\nDisclaimer: Please keep in mind that this is an ongoing discussion topic, nothing is final and ideas in this post are what they are: ideas.\nPlease read the full post before posting. Click to expand... GADGETS:\n1. Staff Magnet:\nPulls Staff Towards You To Annoy Them (You can disable this in your Privacy Settings?)\n2. Ice Skating Rink:\nMakes Ice Appear on the ground with fences around it (For a Few Seconds), and makes you slide around in it like you've gone ice skating!\n3. iDubbbz Suit:\nA green suit with a face that looks like iDubbbz. It makes you jump around like a frog, and when it lands it crouches!\nRANK EXTENSIONS:\n1. MVP++ or Gold MVP+:\nHowever, one idea that I had is to have a rank addon/extension, MVP++ for example (or gold MVP+?), that would come with much requested features such as access to a new redesigned /nick command, private custom game hosting, animated forum frames, automatic tipping, monthly bonuses as well as other features. Click to expand...\n2. Each different Rank gets a Party House:\ne.g. Welcome to the &bMVP&c+ Party House!\n3. Exclusive Maps and/or Minigames:\nMVP+'s get to play on minigame maps, that only they can access and staff. Or MVP+'s get their own minigame, but I that be excluding the lowers ranks too much.\nSTORE ADDITIONS:\n1. Crafted Mystery Boxes:\nPlayers who cannot afford all that mystery dust for 1 crafted mystery box, will now be able to buy 2 for 4.99$ .\n2 - 4.99$\n4 - 8.99$\n10 - 18.99$\nMore to come... \u200b", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:07.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f5ae01dfaf37b9455dbb63f9a75379cdc3ba0ae7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSu2pBmyvyP_UVfznq.FEr9NiMldM3j_nHwD.HVM9HBw8LG.yWNRad_ajb06Ct3GbGoOyqxzjWWgfWbrjF48EPFMVGM5rNj9dly6v72EIpgsQ--", "site_full": "hypixel.net", "site": "hypixel.net", "site_section": "https://hypixel.net/forums/official-hypixel-minecraft-server/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Hypixel Server Discussion | Hypixel - Minecraft Server and Maps", "title": "Looking for store suggestion!

I would call it [PRO] and make it purple, just personal preference.\nDon't make people pay monthly for a rank. I have always loved how Hypixel is one of the few servers that does not do this, and it really encourages more players to buy a rank if it is something they will have forever.\nI would make this rank sort of like a baby YT rank. Give it some features YT's get but not all.\nSome features PRO might get:\nNot getting kicked to limbo Special weekly \"Bounties\" which are basically very difficult quests. Bounties may involve specific objectives, for example \"Kill 5 players in a one Bedwars game with only TNT\" or \"Win a skywars game under 2 minutes with at least 5 kills.\" Basically, something that gives a challenge to keep trying until you finally get it. Once completing you would get a high paying reward. Larger housing plots Ability to enable pvp in housing plots Ability to host custom games Autotip Animated portrait boarder on the forums. and more (when I think of more) I would not give PRO the /nick command mainly because, I feel like that is something YT's should have to make them unique.\nStore purchases Ideas\nUpgradeable Companions, sort of like the achievement totem Companions that give everyone around them special potion effects such as (speed, jump boost, or even blindness if you want to troll people) Custom banners Custom sound packs for different games that change death sounds, Games start sounds, kill sounds, etc. I hope you like some of these ideas!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:07.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f5ae01dfaf37b9455dbb63f9a75379cdc3ba0ae7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSu2pBmyvyP_UVfznq.FEr9NiMldM3j_nHwD.HVM9HBw8LG.yWNRad_ajb06Ct3GbGoOyqxzjWWgfWbrjF48EPFMVGM5rNj9dly6v72EIpgsQ--", "site_full": "hypixel.net", "site": "hypixel.net", "site_section": "https://hypixel.net/forums/official-hypixel-minecraft-server/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Hypixel Server Discussion | Hypixel - Minecraft Server and Maps", "title": "Looking for store suggestion!

We've overcome many hurdles thrown our way, and they've only made us stronger. If you\u2019ve purchased a Rank or any other item on the Hypixel Store, you\u2019ve directly helped us cover our costs and supported the development of minigames and systems across the server.\nBack in June 2014, when the EULA was first announced, we were quite scared and to be honest, it did hurt our income quite badly. We had to work a lot harder to cover the high expenses of running a big Minecraft server in the following months. It resulted in the demise of many networks, the EULA was written by people who have little idea what communities like Hypixel are about and listened to none of the suggestions put forward by lead server networks.\nInstead of giving up, we decided to triple the size of the team. Our logic was that if we were having such a hard time so were our competitors, and that it was the best time for us to stand out and improve ourselves to survive. The quantity and quality of content improved and soon we started to break player records across the board. Backed by the support of our community, we were able to invest further in Minecraft and scale our team beyond anything we could have ever imagined.\nBack in 2015, I made a topic asking the community for ideas for the Hypixel Store and we ended up adding some of them, as well as improving our current ranks by adding tons of features, and generally reducing the prices of all store items.\nSome of these changes really helped and allowed us to hire passionate developers that are making updates and new games that are enjoyed by millions - you guys are amazing for allowing us to do this.\nToday, I come to you guys for suggestions and ideas for the store once again. We want to keep hiring talented people, buy more servers and improve the quality of services as a whole across all aspects of the server. Many veterans for the past few years have been asking for new stuff and find it quite difficult to support the server if they are not excited by Mystery Boxes or Loot Chests.\nWe decided it would be a good time for us to sit down and think of ideas before the holidays. Talking about monetization with our community is something that we like to do and is not common in the gaming industry, but we want to find the right balance to make everyone happy as well as being able to keep the lights on.\nIn 2013, long before EULA happened, we said that we wouldn't add a new rank after MVP+ and I still think it's possible to keep it that way. To be honest, it would be quite confusing to add a new rank name with all of our MVP+ features around. However, one idea that I had is to have a rank addon/extension, MVP++ for example (or gold MVP+?), that would come with much requested features such as access to a new redesigned /nick command, private custom game hosting, animated forum frames, automatic tipping, monthly bonuses as well as other features.\nWe are thinking to price it fairly low on a monthly subscription, so that way we can have a more stable income on a month to month basis and easily plan out our future investments with the network, and the income would help us support rolling these features out to so many players which we can\u2019t easily do at the moment. So far these are all just ideas, so please help us out with your feedback!\nKeep in mind that we are still working on a Merch store selling physical items like Hypixel clothing - we have received products from a variety of companies, and we are reviewing the quality right now - as soon as we have made our choice, we will setup the store and get it rolling, we aren\u2019t expecting it to have it out by christmas however.\nWe are aiming for the highest quality possible and do not plan to make much profit on this; our goal is to have people wearing Hypixel stuff in everyday life - so this is kind of unrelated with this post and will be discussed more deeply in another topic.\nIm sure you guys have plenty of ideas and suggestions for us, so we are going to do a contest and I will pick 5 people for 100$ store coupons that come up with great ideas for new addition to the store or rank addon features.\nExample of other ideas;\n- A special Mystery Box that guarantees an item you don't have\n- Loot Boxes for SkyWars\n- Special VIP Lobby Party House\n- A gadget that allows you to dab (pls no)\nMaybe you could add the ability to buy /nick in the store.

Her stage work includes The Tempest, Carmen, Protocol, A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream and Gospodjica. \nShe has had leading roles in almost all of director Edwin Brienen\u2019s feature films, which were shot in Amsterdam and Berlin. In New York she continues to make films with inspired filmmakers such as Jonathan Caouette, Jorge Torres -Torres and Onur Tukel. She has appeared in more than 35 films that have been screened in more than 50 film festivals, including Cannes and Sundance. \nHer stage work has revolved around Mata Hari, and she has been developing this piece since 2009. Variations have included MATA HARI IN PRISON (2016) at the Lower East Side Festival. \nJoe Battista is the Artistic Director of The 13th Street Repertory Theatre and this marks his third directorial work at 13th Street Rep.

Miniatures would be a way to bring a 'pet' into any game on the network (at least where they won't affect gameplay). They will be purely cosmetic and simply follow its owner. No name tags, no sound effects, simply a mini 'pet' that follows you around (or even flies / hovers near you if it's something like a bumblebee).\nThey should be very small, perhaps slightly smaller than a regular companion where possible, so to not be obtrusive.\nBenefits:\n- Cool pet that stays with you everywhere on the server, not just in lobbies.\n- More exposure - more people will see them and think \"hey, that looks cool\" which may lead to more sales.\n- Cute cosmetic feature that does not affect gameplay whatsoever.\nDrawbacks:\n- Not sure if possible everywhere on the network due to the limitations of some games.\nSkyWars Loot Chests\nYou mentioned this in the post, and I 100% back it. I think it would be awesome. I get SO many questions from fans asking about my in-game SkyWars cosmetics, such as the notes trail, blood explosion kill effect, magic box cage, etc. who are all disheartened when I tell them that it's a ranked reward. Some people are just not able to reach the higher tiers and will never be able to enjoy in-game cosmetics.\nI think that the current ranked rewards should remain prestigious in the respect that they can only be unlocked by reaching a certain division as it currently is to avoid backlash from the ranked community, but new cosmetics should be added that are unlocked via Loot Chests as in Bed Wars / Murder Mystery. Click to expand... Miniatures are probably impossible in resource pack games, especially smash. Neat idea for the other games, though. I think the staff will not add in purchasable SW ranked rewards as they are supposed to be a reward, a motivation for players to grind towards and show off their skill. What's the point of having that if you can just buy it on the store?\nOllyRolly said: \u2191 More gift values, not just 2, 5, 10. I know with the holiday bundles there are more options but just for the holidays one. Click to expand... but you can buy 40 gifts by getting 4 10 packs or whatever\nKingCandy101 said: \u2191 I am so excited for what's coming next on the store. What I would really like to see is more ways to get items in certain games than just grinding. So like in a game like cops & robbers maybe you could buy cops & robbers mystery boxes or loot boxes? Click to expand... First, it's Cops and Crims. Second, you can just get a booster and get items that way.\nKingCandy101 said: \u2191 Maybe cosmetics or ingame items but either way, items that cannot be unlocked even playing for very long would show just how much you care about Hypixel.

They are hard working athletes. They have desire, passion and they don't give up. The only time we lose game is when we run out of time. I felt like that a bit today and not a lot went our way. It's a great team to coach, very responsive and they always are going to fight back - whether one-goal down they're always going to fight,\" he told media after Belgium were knocked out of the Hockey World League Final by India in a shootout.\nAfter they came back twice to draw level at 3-3, Belgium got two late penalty corners but wasted both and McLeod feels they should have sealed the game when they had the chance. \"We did enough to give ourselves a chance to winning the game. It is always the little details that make the change. I don't think it [missing penalty corners] swung the momentum. I think we may have missed the opportunity of sealing the game,\" he said.\nBelgium captain Thomas Briels said it was a hard-fought contest but the Indian were better tonight. \"I think it was a really nice [match], especially for the Indian audience. We were 0-2 down, so we fought and got back into the game. We then got 2-3 down and then again got back. We even had a corner to win it. It was a good response from the team but India really played well - compact and counterattacked well which we already know.

The things which featured for India were that they were quite collective, disciplined to their task and the scoreline encouraged them to continue fighting.
