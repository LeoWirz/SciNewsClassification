I felt really well taken care of, everybody was very attentive and wanting me to have the best possible experience in the city. I found Anjo Azul after a disastrous experience on AirBnB the night before and was so glad I found them - my only regret was to not have found them earlier! The hotel's location is perfect, it is very close to a very lively area but the street is quiet. I was traveling alone, and for a single traveler you can't beat the quality of service and of the room for the price! Amazing value. The room, and especially the bathroom was definitely on the small side but that was sufficient for my needs. The decor is quaint, charming. They offer you an espresso every morning.

Launched earlier this year, the Uber Visa card offers a surprisingly high rate of cash-back rewards in popular categories like travel and dining out. Not only that, but it comes with no annual fee and added perks that could make it a valuable addition to any wallet. \nEven if you don\u2019t actually use the rideshare service, don\u2019t be too quick to write off this card. While you can redeem your points for Uber rides, you can also cash them in for gift cards or regular ol\u2019 cash back. And, did we mention this card has a signup bonus? \nKeep reading about this new rewards card that will likely go head to head with other popular cash-back cards like the Chase Freedom\u00ae and Citi Double Cash Card . The Simple Dollar\u2019s Key Takeaways Great earning potential. The new Uber Visa Card offers some pretty stellar earning tiers that could benefit almost everyone. Not only will you earn 4 points per $1 spent on dining including restaurants, bars, UberEATS, and takeout, but you get 3% back on hotels, airfare, and vacation home rentals (such as Airbnb). You\u2019ll also score a generous 2% back on online shopping, video and music streaming services, and Uber rides, along with 1 point per dollar spent on all other purchases. No annual fee. Amazingly, the New Uber Visa card doesn\u2019t charge an annual fee of any kind. Signup bonus. At the moment, you\u2019ll score a sweet $100 signup bonus after you use your card for $500 in purchases within three months of account opening. Added perks. In addition to the card\u2019s more obvious perks, the Uber Visa Card offers a $50 annual credit for streaming services after you spend $5,000 on your card each year, up to $600 in mobile phone protection, and no foreign transaction fees . Review: A Stellar Cash-Back Card for Travelers or Frequent Diners \nIf you\u2019re angling for a rewards card that offers a cash-back structure you\u2019ve never really seen before, the Uber Visa Card might be right up your alley. While there are many cards that offer high rates of return on travel and dining, almost all of them charge an annual fee. Take the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u2120 , for example. This card doles out 3 points per dollar on travel and dining (along with other benefits), but comes with a staggering $450 annual fee. \nStill, among traditional cash-back cards, the Uber Visa Card stands out. Where there are several no-fee cash-back cards that offer 1.5% or even 2% cash-back, their offers pale in comparison to the 3-4 points per dollar you can earn on travel and dining with the Uber Visa Card. \nThe new card\u2019s signup bonus is a nice touch, and so is the fact that you don\u2019t have to redeem points for actual Uber rides. According to Uber and the card\u2019s issuer, Barclaycard, you can redeem your rewards for Uber rides, gift cards, or cash-back with \u201ca simple tap.\u201d \nAdd on the free cell phone coverage and $50 credit for streaming services and you\u2019ve got a real winner. Since this card doesn\u2019t charge an annual fee, there\u2019s nothing to lose \u2013 so what\u2019s not to like? Uber Visa Card: Where It Falls Flat \nWhile the new Uber card has a lot going for it, it still faces some of the common challenges of other traditional cash-back cards. While it\u2019s great you can redeem your points for gift cards or statement credits along with Uber rides, you can\u2019t transfer to airline or hotel loyalty programs like you could with the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card or other premier travel cards, for example. Not only that, but the Uber card doesn\u2019t offer any additional travel perks such as airport lounge access. \nLast but not least, some of the card\u2019s \u201cextras\u201d come with added stipulations. To take advantage of the $50 annual credit for streaming services, for example, you have to spend $5,000 on your card every year. Further, the $600 in cell phone coverage is only good if you use your card to pay your cell phone bill every month. Who This Card Is Good For: Anyone who spends a ton on dining and travel. People who want to earn cash back instead of travel rewards. Cash-back enthusiasts who are against paying annual fees. Who Should Pass: Travelers who want to be able to transfer points to hotel and airline loyalty programs. Anyone who wants special travel benefits like airport lounge access or hotel or airline status. People who don\u2019t spend a lot on travel, dining, or online purchases who may be better off with a flat-rate cash-back card.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) prev next Despite incendiary words from President Donald Trump, Congress seemed on track Wednesday to approving legislation that would avert a partial government shutdown over the weekend as all sides seemed ready to avert a confrontation \u2014 for now.\nIncreasingly confident House leaders planned a Thursday vote on a bill that would keep federal agencies functioning through Dec. 22, and Senate approval was expected to follow. Even the head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members have been threatening to oppose the measure, predicted passage.\n\"No one wants a shutdown, including Freedom Caucus members,\" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters.\nThe moderated tone reflected a sense within both parties that though major differences remain over spending, immigration, health care and other issues, this was no time for a headline-grabbing government closure.\nRepublicans want the public focus to be on the party's prized $1.5 trillion tax bill, which they hope to enact by Christmas. They also have no interest in a shutdown that would raise questions about their ability to govern.\nWhile many Democrats seemed likely to oppose the measure, enough were expected to support it in the Senate to allow its passage there. They know they'd still have leverage on subsequent bills needed to keep the government running.\nCongressional leaders of both parties planned to meet Trump at the White House on Thursday to bargain over long-term spending limits and other issues that have become entangled with lawmakers' year-end work.\nBut Trump unexpectedly tossed a hand grenade into the mix when he told reporters that a shutdown \"could happen\" and blamed Democrats. He said they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\"\nHis comments drew a tweet from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who called Trump \"the only person talking about a government shutdown.\"\nTrump tweeted similar attacks on Democratic leaders shortly before a meeting that was scheduled last week, prompting angered Democrats to boycott it.\nThis time, the White House followed up with a more accommodating statement that praised Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. The written statement said Trump was glad the two top Democrats had decided to \"put their responsibility to the American people above partisanship\" and said Trump was anticipating productive talks between \"leaders who put their differences aside.\"\nLater, the White House issued another statement indicating Trump would sign the two-week spending extension and laying out its goals for upcoming budget bargaining. It said money for the military including missile defense and security along the border with Mexico \"must be prioritized in a long-term funding agreement.\"\nThe two-week bill is aimed at giving negotiators more time to settle differences. The measure also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program, a widely popular program that provides medical care to more than 8 million children.\nDemocrats have been using their leverage to insist on spending boosts for health care, infrastructure and other domestic programs that would match increases Republicans want for defense.\nDemocrats are also seeking an agreement to extend protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. Trump ended safeguards against deportation three months ago but has expressed an openness to restoring them.\nMeadows said the Freedom Caucus had not taken a final position on whether it will back the short-term bill, but he and several others stopped short of saying they'd oppose it.\nConservative leaders met with top House Republicans and said they were seeking a strategy to reduce Democrats' budget leverage by quickly approving a full-year budget for the military. It was unclear how Republicans could prevent Senate Democrats from blocking such a move.\nThe roughly 30-member caucus has been trying to win promises of tight budget curbs and other concessions from leaders in exchange for backing the short-term bill. Without support from many of them, Republicans would need votes from Democrats to push the temporary spending measure through the House, and Democrats have not said what they will do.\nDemocratic votes for any budget measure will be crucial in the Senate, where Republicans by themselves lack the 60 votes needed to approve the legislation.\n___\nAP reporter Ken Thomas contributed.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul ry", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steve scalise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott applewhite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark meadows", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin mccarthy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "freedom caucus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democrats", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap photo/jacquelyn martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house freedom caucus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "children's health insurance program", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol rotunda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-la.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-wis.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:10.167+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a3052ce602bc0282dff96e547b80893d33a16252", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaENWAQqlCJPM1RdH.bSF4QyXb_jcIP1XSxfZ8QT0zYSkL6Ir0uQhVZw5WkjXltujTJZ.y7jW9KHnYmywvyJNu1YUGz0fntFUCaIt7t2Wzd40-", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/San-Diego-Hoteis.d178304.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Condado de San Diego: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "Best Western Plus Oceanside Palms:", "title_full": "Best Western Plus Oceanside Palms: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-10-31T00:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "57d46a71b60f1a169295f9ac9d5ace2a4a260e99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaENWAQqlCJPM1RdH.bSF4QyXb_jcIP1XSxfZ8QT0zYSkL6Ir0uQhVZw5WkjXltujTJZ.y7jW9KHnYmywvyJNu1YUGz0fntFUCdWP8Qj6IwFnQNbKUQ9Fo7TZlF5P_k4uPWblHu790Dwc-", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-29T13:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "This is a great hotel.

Muscle-sparing techniques diminish this concern, but often sacrifice the quality of exposure. We describe a novel muscle-sparing, high thoracotomy approach for the treatment of ventral cervicothoracic and upper thoracic spine lesions.\nMethods A novel muscle-sparing, high thoracotomy approach is described, utilizing a midline posterior incision with lateral extension from the lateral decubitus position. Five patients are presented to illustrate the application of this technique in thoracic tumors with intimate spinal involvement.\nResults The muscle-sparing, high thoracotomy approach afforded gross total resection and spinal reconstruction in five consecutive patients, including stage IV lung carcinoma with invasion of the T5 and T6 vertebral bodies, two malignant fibrous histiocytomas causing thoracic cord compression, a metastatic T6 lesion of unknown primary with associated cord compression; and a Pancoast tumor. All patients seen at 6 months had full symmetric shoulder range of motion postoperatively.\nConclusions The described muscle-sparing, high thoracotomy approach provides excellent exposure of the ventral cervicothoracic and upper thoracic spine without the morbidity associated with the transection of shoulder girdle muscle bellies. This technique is particularly useful in patients with primary malignant bone tumors requiring en bloc excision and metastatic tumors with large soft tissue components.\n\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2AhEzWh\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pancoast", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:12.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a1b1f85d914558a78ce241950c2074adc693bec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WMuXTosIDFKLtFge97IUcULuKDo3ujlaBKJeaWIP.HCxhD7592NGSoE4IeK.NaCMZQH8aY0LpPojsC7yA3uWS", "site_full": "www.pistonheads.com", "site": "pistonheads.com", "site_section": "http://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/forum.asp?h=0&f=24", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_cars", "vehicles", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "Website Feedback - Page 1 - PistonHeads ", "title": "Football thread titles out of date 2", "title_full": "Football thread titles out of date - Page 2 - Website Feedback - PistonHeads", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8486, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "de6891be6a1f2352bd82ed47cd3128460a1ea9be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WMuXTosIDFKLtFge97IUcULuKDo3ujlaBKJeaWIP.HCxhD7592NGSoE4IeK.NaCMZQH8aY0LpPnrXN88AyvMOEEUiO4Rlmpk-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "stuartmmcfc", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I think more \u201cdirect action\u201d may be necessary now,", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:12.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "134c669d416bdf2b56238c37f4feb12c8efe0af6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8L_tQjOeM.EAvAnF6EAtWcgnaNNaqfOfwU4LDKgr3Iq8l5cPfscr10h6fGoIYY4O0-", "site_full": "www.dslreports.com", "site": "dslreports.com", "site_section": "http://www.dslreports.com/forum/vzfiostv", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Verizon FiOS TV forum | DSLReports, ISP Information", "title": "Verizon sham", "title_full": "Verizon sham - Verizon FiOS TV | DSLReports Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T00:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//i.dslr.net/logos/dslr-default-og.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5796, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "94cc482e2e9a9947fab77f67c1cf45b0627b5387", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8L_tQjOeM.EAvAnF6EAtWcgnaNNaqfOfwU4LDKgr3Iq8l5cPfscr10axPberKJvUJYw62J5XaF6A--", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "joeygoon", "published": "2017-12-07T02:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "What\u2019s the 20 or 30 dollars difference got to do with it?

According to a new CareerBuilder survey, companies lost an average of $14,900 on every bad hire in the last year, and it's a common mistake \u2014 nearly three in four employers (74 percent) say they've hired the wrong person for a position. \nThe survey was conducted online by Harris Poll from August 16 to September 15, 2017 and included a representative sample of 2,257 full-time hiring managers and human resource professionals and 3,697 full-time workers across industries and company sizes in the U.S. private sector.\n\"It's important to note that there's a ripple affect with bad hires. Disengagement is contagious \u2014 poor performers lower the bar for other workers on their teams, and their bad habits spread throughout the organization,\" said Rosemary Haefner , chief human resources officer at CareerBuilder. \"The best thing hiring managers can do is put in the time and effort on the front end to make sure they have the best available pool of applicants for every job opening. And, just as importantly, have good procedures in place for evaluating candidates.\" \nWhen asked how a bad hire affected their business in the last year, employers cited less productivity (37 percent), lost time to recruit and train another worker (32 percent) and compromised quality of work (31 percent).\nWhat Makes a Bad Hire\nHow do you know if you've hired the wrong person? When asked what made them think they had made the wrong decision, employers who have made a bad hire said: \n\nWhile the candidate didn't have all the needed skills, thought they could learn quickly: 35 percent Candidate lied about his/her qualifications: 33 percent Took a chance on a nice person: 32 percent Pressured to fill the role quickly: 30 percent Had a hard time finding qualified candidates: 29 percent Focused on skills and not attitude: 29 percent Ignored some of the warning signs: 25 percent Lacked adequate tools to find the right person: 10 percent Didn't do a complete background check: 10 percent Didn't work close enough with HR: 7 percent Overall, this is how employers categorize someone as a bad hire: \n\nThe worker didn't produce the proper quality of work: 54 percent The worker had a negative attitude: 53 percent The worker didn't work well with other workers: 50 percent The worker had immediate attendance problems: 46 percent The worker's skills did not match what they claimed to be able to do when hired: 45 percent Workers Have Regrets, Too\nEmployers aren't the only ones making regretful decisions. Two in three workers (66 percent) say they have accepted a job and later realized it was a bad fit, and while half of these workers (50 percent) have quit within six months, more than a third (37 percent) have stuck it out. Workers who said they had taken a job only to realize it's a bad fit said they noticed their mistake based on toxic work culture (46 percent), boss' management style (40 percent), job didn't match what was described in the job listing and interviews (37 percent), and a lack of clear expectations around the role (33 percent). \nDon't Let the Good Ones Go \nWhile the cost of hiring the wrong person can be high, the cost of letting a good worker go is even higher. According to employers, the average cost of losing a good hire was $29,600 this year. And while 75 percent of workers say they're loyal to their current employer, much less (54 percent) say they feel their company is loyal to them, and nearly a third (31 percent) say they are likely to change jobs in the next year. \nSurvey Methodology\nThis survey was conducted online within the U.S. by Harris Poll on behalf of CareerBuilder among 2,257 hiring and human resource managers ages 18 and over (employed full-time, not self-employed, non-government) and 3,697 workers ages 18 and over (employed full-time, not self-employed, non-government) between August 16 and September 15, 2017 (percentages for some questions are based on a subset, based on their responses to certain questions). With a pure probability sample of 2,257 and 3,697, one could say with a 95 percent probability that the overall results have a sampling error of +/- 2.06 and +/- 1.61 percentage points, respectively. Sampling error for data from sub-samples is higher and varies.\nAbout CareerBuilder\u00ae\nCareerBuilder is a global, end-to-end human capital solutions company focused on helping employers find, hire and manage great talent.

Dementia is severe enough to affect an individual\u2019s daily activities and functions accompanied by certain changes in personality. A person with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) develop severity of dementia, termed as AIDS associated dementia or AIDS Dementia Complex (ADC). AIDS associated dementia is primarily caused by viral proteins that damage nerve cells directly by infecting cells of the brain and spinal cord. AIDS associated dementia occurs in six stages: normal, subclinical, mild, moderate, severe and end stage. Report Overview and TOC: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/aids-associated-dement... Additionally, a severe form of AIDS associated dementia includes symptoms such as speech problems, muscle weakness, vision problems, and loss of bowel control. Certain imaging diagnostic tests are used for the diagnosis of AIDS associated dementia: CT scan or MRI of the head and position emission tomography (PET). Other tests include spinal tap, Electroencephalography (EEG), and neuropsychological testing. Request brochure: Based on the treatment, the AIDS associated dementia market can be segmented as follows: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART): Highly active antiretroviral therapy is used for the control of HIV infection and also protects people with HIV-positive from developing AIDS dementia complex Drug medication: Certain drugs may improve the symptoms of AIDS associated dementia such as antidepressant medications are administered to treat depression and antipsychotic medications are used to treat severe aggression, hallucinations and delusions. Various novel drugs such as abacavir, efavirenz, d4T, and indinavir are used are used to lessen the extent of HIV infection in the cerebrospinal fluid of an individual. Based on geography, the AIDS associated dementia market can be segmented into four major regions: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Rest of the World. Out of these regions, North America dominates the market followed by Europe. The factors which are driving the growth of AIDS associated dementia market are increasing incidences of HIV infection amongst the population, and growing awareness regarding the loss of mental abilities caused due to AIDS associated dementia. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 1.1 million people in the United Sates are affected with HIV infection.

I was wondering if there is anyone here who experiences similar condition.\nI am 24 y.o. and about a year ago I developed cyst acne. The thing is, I have only one or two cysts and they always appear only on my chin. I also developed milia that grows into acne sometimes. It is also only on my chin. The rest of my skin is perfectly fine and always was fine, hence my enormous frustraition with my new 'friend' cyst acne.\nIt all started a year ago when I foolishly mistreated a regular pimple on my chin (overdryed, picked million times and then it just never went away). Maybe it worth mentioning that I moved to the States a year ago as well, however, chin acne started to appear one-two months after the moving.\nSince now, for over two months I have been eating salads every day, fruits, lemon water in the morning, I cut off dairy too (not 100% , I have milk chocolate sometimes). I use expensive treatments too: dermatologica cleanser for acne, daily microexfoliant, renee rouleau anty-cyst spot treatment (the only thing that seems working), I always use spf and cetafil cream that doesn't clogg pores, i do chacoral masks once in a week, and I get facials almost every month. And of course that cyst acne on my chin doesn't give a damn about any of the healthy stuff I am doing. Last time I got two nasty cysts right on the date of my birthday, I am so desperate I can't even articulate it. It's still there, right next to a scar a got after having cyst acne.\nAnyone has similar situation here? Usually I see posts about severe acne which is not the case here. What is the next step?

That could limit Freeport\u2019s sale to a 9.36 percent stake. \nSuch a deal could be \u201ca win-win-win for Freeport, Rio and Indonesia as value leakage for Freeport would be less than expected, Rio would be able to exit a business that is non-core and high risk, and Indonesia would own a majority stake in Grasberg,\u201d Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina said. \n\u201cThis would be an elegant solution to a complex problem, and a positive for Freeport,\u201d he said in a note to clients. \nFreeport\u2019s shares came off earlier lows to end down 1.3 percent, down less than other copper miners as copper had its biggest drop in two years. Rio\u2019s shares were down 2 percent. \n\u201cAccording to the state-owned enterprise ministry, they are willing in principle,\u201d Jonan said, referring to Freeport and Rio. \nA Melbourne-based spokesman for Rio declined to comment. Freeport Indonesia and the head office in Phoenix also declined to comment. Budi Gunadi Sadikin, chief executive of PT Inalum, Indonesia\u2019s state-owned mining holding company tipped to acquire the stakes, declined to comment. \nJonan said the drafting of an agreement had begun and the state-owned enterprise ministry and other government bodies aim to complete the acquisition in 2018, along with new fiscal terms in a special mining permit to replace Freeport\u2019s Grasberg contract. \nHe said the government \u201cwill maintain the valuation that we believe is correct,\u201d referring to a price of between $6 billion and $7 billion for Freeport\u2019s Indonesian unit. \nA review of two decades of annual reports shows Rio\u2019s capital expenditures on Grasberg reached nearly $2 billion, while its net profit adds up to just $1.7 billion. \nRio has previously said it was holding talks with Indonesia on a potential exit from the venture. \nOutside Indonesia, Rio has been expanding its exposure to copper mining amid a favourable outlook for the metal, including spending around $1 billion a year on its Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia. \nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-freeport-rio-tinto/indonesia-plans-to-acquire-rio-tinto-interest-in-freeport-indonesia-mine-idUSKBN1DZ0SB", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jonan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ignasius jonan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher lafemina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "budi gunadi sadikin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rio", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jefferies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freeport\u2019s grasberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freeport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rio tinto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freeport-mcmoran inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "freeport indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rio tinto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mongolia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grasberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phoenix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oyu tolgoi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:13.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "37810d0d69bfa0a654ef330e4ed6b56dafc4fb5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9s7BCK1Px0NkxubFHbtUAq.K1KYPNF.WIuRy6BoaqBeGL_VDhTmSdXXYPE4qEISknHLqo7AI2b6CA9goiKU0b", "site_full": "www.acne.org", "site": "acne.org", "site_section": "https://www.acne.org/messageboard/forum/70-general-acne-discussion/", "site_categories": ["dermatology", "health"], "section_title": "General acne discussion - Acne.org Community", "title": "Chin Only Cyst Acne", "title_full": "Chin Only Cyst Acne - General acne discussion - Acne.org Community", "published": "2017-12-07T03:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31242, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bd0b52d499849b3b2b85ca1f6a1bac3cc52cad4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9s7BCK1Px0NkxubFHbtUAq.K1KYPNF.WIuRy6BoaqBeGL_VDhTmSdXXYPE4qEISknHLqo7AI2b_Fef0oPLg0TJALNeQK1u9j5kye_tNRtzQ--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "99f", "published": "2017-12-07T15:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Please try applying tea tree oil mixed 50:50 with isopropyl alcohol to the affected area once or twice daily for several days and let us know of the results.

Both of them are hothouse blossoms, exercises in sensibility for directors (Sofia Coppola and Yorgos Lanthimos, respectively) with very particular agendas. \u201cThe Beguiled\u201d remakes a pulpy early-\u201970s study in sexual hysteria into an arch melodrama of beleaguered femininity. As the headmistress of a school full of Southern belles who welcome a wounded Yankee into their midst, Kidman is an avatar of Victorian womanhood. Her character is also the only one to understand how absurd the situation is and to grasp the raw currents of power and lust that surge under the decorous surface. Kidman herself disrupts the film\u2019s decorum, much as she complicates the mechanical allegory of Lanthimos\u2019s film. Everyone else in \u201cSacred Deer\u201d is slotted into a carefully measured box, working in the service of what is essentially a literary conceit. A young man places a curse on a modern, upper-middle-class family, who must contemplate a horrible crime if they wish to break it. While the other actors obey the director\u2019s fairy-tale strictures, Kidman behaves like a real person.

In this Oct. 22, 2017, file photo, FBI Director Christopher Wray speaks at the International Association of Chiefs of Police annual conference in Philadelphia. \nBy SADIE GURMANAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Christopher Wray faces a tough test four months into his leadership of the FBI: He must defend America's top law enforcement agency against blistering attacks from President Donald Trump without putting his own job at risk. \nThe competing pressures Wray faces will be on display Thursday when he testifies before the House Judiciary Committee. Democrats may push him to respond forcefully to Trump's weekend tweets calling the FBI a biased agency whose reputation is \"in Tatters - worst in History!\" and urging Wray to \"clean house.\" \nSome Republicans will likely echo Trump's concerns about what they see as political bias in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of possible coordination between Trump's campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election. Like Trump, they have seized on revelations that an FBI agent was removed from Mueller's team because of anti-Trump text messages. \nWray's start as FBI head would have been difficult enough, even without the intense scrutiny of the Russia investigation. Since he was sworn-in Aug. 2, the U.S. has had two of the deadliest shootings in its modern history and a terror attack in Manhattan. \nTrump's weekend tweets created a fresh dilemma for Wray. With his bosses, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy Rod Rosenstein, staying publicly silent, it fell to Wray to defend the agency. But FBI directors traditionally have been low-key and stoic - with Wray's predecessor, James Comey, a notable exception. And Trump's firing of Comey while he led the Russia probe shows the risk of antagonizing the president. \nWray's defense, in an email to FBI employees this week, didn't directly mention Trump's comments, leaving some current and former officials wishing he had pushed back more forcefully. \nWray said he was \"inspired by example after example of professionalism and dedication to justice demonstrated around the bureau\" and urged agents to \"keep focused on our critical mission\" while constantly under a microscope. \nFor some agents still reeling from Trump's firing of the popular Comey, the episode cut to the heart of their deepest concern: whether a Trump-appointed FBI director would be able to stand up to a president who routinely lashes out at law enforcement and has publicly lamented his inability to directly influence the agency's affairs. \nWray repeatedly promised during his confirmation hearing that he could be independent, but \"the jury is still out\" on whether he has demonstrated that, said Frank Montoya Jr., a former senior FBI official who keeps in contact with agents still on the job. \n\"The absence of comment from the top, to us, has been really frustrating,\" Montoya said. \"On the inside, it's like, why are we still a punching bag and nobody is counter-punching? A word of comfort or of calm or a sign of leadership would be appreciated at this time.\" \nWray has stayed mostly under the radar in his first months on the job and has subtly tried to distance himself from Comey, who was widely criticized for publicly announcing that Hillary Clinton shouldn't face criminal charges for her use of a private email server. Wray, for example, said he couldn't imagine holding a news conference about someone who had not been charged, noting Justice Department policies against doing so. \nThose close to Wray, a former high-ranking Justice Department official in the Bush administration, describe him as a steady hand whose low-key demeanor makes him well-suited to lead the FBI during a tumultuous time. He has seemed relaxed but reserved in his few public appearances. His memo Monday to employees ended with his favorite work-ethic maxim: \"Keep calm and tackle hard.\" \n\"In a society sometimes fixated to a fault on results, I am somebody who is a big believer in the importance of the integrity of process,\" Wray said at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in October. \"That's part of how I am hoping to sort of steady the ship. By staying laser-focused on the mission and the work itself, day in and day out, left foot right foot, grinding away. Following the rules. Following the law. Trying to make sure we are doing the right thing, but in the right way.\" \nTom O'Connor, president of the FBI Agents Association, said Wray has been supportive of agents' concerns so far, meeting with the organization shortly after his confirmation. \n\"He has said that, in the four months since becoming director, he has learned more about, and is even more impressed with, agents' work ethic and commitment to the bureau's mission,\" said O'Connor, who issued his own impassioned defense of the FBI after Trump's attacks. \nOthers defended the agency as well, including Eric Holder, attorney general under President Barack Obama, who urged Justice Department leadership to speak out. Comey himself tweeted, \"The FBI is honest. The FBI is strong.

These abnormal cells undergo rapid division and form tumors andeventually begin affecting the lung\u2019s ability to provide oxygen to the bloodstream. Cancer that originates in the lungs is known as primary lung cancer whereas secondary lung cancer initiates in other parts of the body, metastasizes and reaches the lungs. The mode of treatment of these two types of cancer differs from one another. Lung cancer is number one leading cause of deaths in the U.S. and worldwide. According to National Cancer Institute, in the year 2012, the number of deaths due to lung cancer accounted to around 160,340 cases and there were around 220,160 new lung cancer diagnosis cases. Also, as per World Health Organization (WHO), cancer accounts for around 13% of the global deaths and lung cancer alone results in around 1,370,000 deaths annually. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are the two major types of lung cancer classified on the basis of microscopic observation. NSLC accounts for around 80% of the lung cancers whereas SLC accounts for the remaining 20% of the lung cancer cases worldwide. NSLC is further categorized into four types namely, adenocarcinoma, bronchioalveolar, squamous cell carcinoma and large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma. The two major causes of lung cancer are inhalation of carcinogenic substances and genetic predisposition inherited from family members. Tobacco, arsenic, radiations such as X-rays and UV rays and asbestos are some of the examples of carcinogens. Around 87% of lung cancers are associated with inhalation of carcinogens and smoking. On the other hand genetic predisposition either directly causes cancer or increases the chances of developing lung cancer due to exposure to certain environmental factors. Read Report Overview: www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/lung-cancer-surgery-... Surgery is the treatment option majorly used to treat non-small cell lung cancer and is usually not preferred for treatment of small lung cancer.There are four types of lung surgery namely pneumonectomy, segmentectomy or wedge resection, lobectomy and sleeve resection. Pneumonectomy is a surgical procedure that includes removal of entire lung, while in segmentectomy, a small wedge shaped piece of lung is excised and in lobectomy the entire cancer affected lobe of the lung is removed. Sleeve resection includes the removal of cancerous part of the bronchus and reconnects the healthy part. The market for lung cancer holds immense growth potential majorly due to increasing number of lung cancer cases worldwide. Lung cancer surgery market can be segmented on the basis of types of surgeries and devices deployed in the surgery. Also, a detailed geographical landscape of the surgeries can be provided. Robot assisted surgery and minimally invasive surgical procedures (such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) and percutaneous transcatheter surgery (radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation) are some of the surgical procedures adopted to treat lung cancer. The geographical landscape includes the analysis of the lung cancer treatment options across four major geographies namely North America, Asia-Pacific, Europe and Rest of the World. Request to view Sample Report: www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-396 The major factors driving the growth of the market are consistent increase in the number of lung cancer patients worldwide along with increased inhalation of carcinogens such as tobacco and particulates. In addition technological advances and novel surgical approaches (robotic surgery) are a further boost the growth of the market.

There, Republicans from both sides of Congress generally agree on two big changes. \nSaving for private school \nTaxpayers can currently save money for college through a 529 plan, where earnings grow tax-free. Many states also offer deductions for contributions. In the proposals, Republicans want to let taxpayers use 529s to pay for K-12 tuition at private and religious schools, too. Families can already do that with a different plan \u2014 Coverdell Education Savings Accounts \u2014 but these have low contribution limits and aren't open to high-income Americans. The move to expand the 529 would dramatically increase who could use these plans and the money they could save. \n\"I think the only taxpayers who will be in a position to benefit from the 529 change are very rich people,\" says Nora Gordon, an economist and associate professor at Georgetown University. She says using these accounts to save for elementary or high school won't help much unless you can afford to set aside a lot of money early on. No wonder, when the Government Accountability Office studied 529s and Coverdells a few years ago, it found \"families with these accounts had about 25 times the median financial assets\" of those who didn't use them and \"about three times the median income.\" \nWhile the proposed expansion of 529 plans would largely help affluent parents who use private schools, Republicans are proposing another change that could hurt funding for the nation's public schools. \nThe SALT (State And Local Taxes) deduction \nUp to now, taxpayers who itemize their deductions \u2014 generally high-earners who make up about a third of households in the U.S. \u2014 have gotten a break from the federal government for paying state and local taxes. \nThink of it as a kind of rebate \u2014 courtesy of Washington \u2014 that ultimately helps state and local governments pay for important things, like schools, among other things. \nRepublicans now want to cut that discount, getting rid of the income and sales tax deductions and putting a $10,000 cap on the deduction for property taxes. \n\"This bill is gonna make it more painful for residents to increase local property taxes to pay for public schools,\" says John Friedman, an associate professor of economics at Brown University. \nOn average, nearly half of public schools' funding (45 percent) comes from local taxes, often property taxes. In the past, when locals hiked these taxes to help pay for their schools, the federal government made the hike hurt less with that SALT deduction. So imagine, if Congress caps the property tax deduction, for high earners who already pay a lot \u2014 in places like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, even Texas \u2014 a new hike would hurt more than it used to. \n\"This is a really big deal for some states and no deal at all for other states. And the states that it's a really big deal for are blue states,\" says Nora Gordon of Georgetown. \"They're states with higher cost of living, higher property values, and states that spend more on their state and local government.\" \nWhile local taxes provide nearly half of public school dollars, state taxes account for much of the rest (46 percent). Kim Rueben of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says states often use these sales and income taxes to help their poorest schools. \n\"The money from the state ends up helping to prop up school districts that have less ability to raise money from the property tax,\" she says. Getting rid of these deductions, Rueben says, will make state-level taxes more painful for some and, again, could make it harder to raise money for schools in the future. \nImportant context: All this is happening with many school districts still reeling from the Great Recession. According to a recent analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, after adjusting for inflation, \"twenty-nine states provided less overall state funding per student in the 2015 school year than in the 2008 school year, before the recession took hold.\" \n*** \nThe two tax bills are farther apart when it comes to higher education. \nIn the House: fewer tuition benefits \nWe've heard a lot about graduate students' reaction to the proposal to tax their tuition waivers as income. \nAs Ariana Figueroa reported for NPR: \n\"Many grad students \u2014 especially in Ph.D. programs \u2014 receive tuition waivers in exchange for teaching classes or doing research. Under current law, that money isn't taxed as income. But the House bill calls for those tuition waivers to be counted as income and subjected to income taxes. \nThat means graduate students would be paying taxes on money they never receive.\" \nThe House bill also cuts or reduces other higher education tax benefits: The Hope Scholarship Credit The Lifetime Learning Credit and tuition deduction The deduction on interest for those repaying student loans The American Opportunity Tax Credit, which students and families can use to offset college tuition payments, is limited to exclude part-time and graduate students, although it is also extended for a fifth year. \nTogether, the axed benefits are worth about $6.5 billion a year to students and families, according to the American Council on Education. \nThe Senate bill doesn't include any of the above. \nState funding for public higher education may also be in jeopardy, for the same reasons we discussed above \u2014 a consequence of getting rid of the deductions for SALT. Scaling back, or cutting federal discounts to taxpayers may cause a squeeze on funding for state universities and colleges. \nPrivate college penalties \nBoth public and private colleges have expressed concern that fewer people are going to be taking the charitable deduction, because of the increase in the standard deduction. They're worried this will lead, in turn, to less money in donations. The American Council on Education estimates about $100 billion less a year in donations across all nonprofits. \nThere are also some provisions in the House and Senate bills that target private colleges specifically. One provision would levy a tax on investment gains for a small group of private colleges that have very large endowments on a per-student basis. Currently, this money grows tax-free thanks to the colleges' nonprofit status. \nThis affects about 65 private colleges with extremely large endowments. But even more colleges are worried about it, says Terry Hartle of the American Council on Education. \n\"Even though public universities are not affected by the endowment tax, they are very much opposed to it, for fear it would set a precedent that would be applied to them in the future.\" \nCulture war? \nThe tax plans, which passed on party lines in both the House and Senate, are aligned with a broader Republican agenda. On the K-12 side, cuts that impact the source of public school funding are coming hand in hand with special tax benefits for families with means to put aside money for private school tuition. \nOn the higher education side, Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and adviser   told Bloomberg that Republicans are going after university endowments because \"universities have become playpens of the left.\" Amplifying that point, a recent Pew poll showed there is a sharply rising partisan gap on higher education, with 58 percent of Republicans saying colleges have a negative effect on the country, while 72 percent of Democrats say they have a positive impact.
