These initial adjustment should get the tractor running unless there is an internal problem with your new carb.\nWhen you get to the final carb adjustment stage, follow these procedures:\nOnce the engine is warm, move the throttle lever to idle. Set idle speed to 450 RPM, then try adjusting the IDLE MIXTURE screw. The correct procedure is to simply turn the idle mixture screw in until the engine stumbles (too rich) then back out until the engine runs smoothly. Usually this increase idle above 450-500 RPM so you need to re-do the idle mixture. When you get it right, the engine should accelerate smoothly, without smoke, as you advance the throttle lever from idle to full throttle.\nIf the tractor stumbles as you increase speed, then adjust the main jet.

Murphy Genre:  Paranormal Romance Publisher: Soul Mate Publishing \n\nPoor Roz\u2026once again stuck on the horns of a dilemma. Does she accept the great offer for a job that\u2019s hundreds of miles from Crooked Lake? Or does she pick David, the great guy who grows grapes half a mile from her house? And either way\u2014assuming our crabby woman-of-a-certain-age manages to make a decision\u2014what about her ghost, Bob? Granted, Bob and Roz have never had a \u2026 ummmm\u2026 \u2018traditional\u2019 relationship but still, martini-loving ghosts don\u2019t toddle along every day of the week. What happens to the wit, the sparkle, the laughter? So many questions\u2026(sigh). Join Roz, David\u2014and Bob\u2014as they spend a beautiful, but confusing, summer on Crooked Lake. And oh, by the way, watch out for drips\u2026 \nMy ghostly guest, Bob, swirled his drink while the late afternoon sun streamed across the kitchen, lighting the martinis on the table with an otherworldly glow. Outside the kitchen\u2019s picture window, Crooked Lake nestled into dusk. Even though it was only early May, a determined fly fisherman drifted in the center of the lake, casting for dusk-feeding trout. Gentle waves splashed against the rock wall I\u2019d struggled to build only a couple of months before. Enough water had drained off after the spring floods that I once again had an actual beach and I planned to spend the summer shoveling shale to enhance and deepen it. I glanced at Bob, my ghostly companion of many months, as he sipped his drink. I\u2019d gotten to the point where Bob didn\u2019t intimidate or scare me at all. In fact, if it came to being crabby, unpleasant, and maybe even a little scary, I had him beaten by a mile. (I\u2019m not proud of this, mind you. But I do try to call a spade a spade. It\u2019s one way to simplify what seems to have become an awfully complicated life.) Despite the small spare tire Bob sported around his middle and hair that, in the right light, might be characterized by some as thinning, Bob prided himself on being a suave and debonair ghostly figure. He had nothing but disdain for those immature spectral bullies who throw furniture around and make their hauntee\u2019s lives miserable. I don\u2019t think, now that I focus on it, that I\u2019ve ever even heard Bob raise his voice. (He would not be able to say the same about me, I\u2019m afraid. Not that I have anger management issues. I mostly have crabby management issues.) Lately Bob has spent his time wandering around the house in a gentle alcoholic fog, babbling about whatever topic he\u2019s fixated on that day. Sometimes it\u2019s the value of 5000 hedgehogs; other days, he\u2019ll get obsessed with his bird phobia or government conspiracies to wear out shoes, or he\u2019ll fret about wearing a white suit. I\u2019ve become used to it. In our early days, we\u2019d only get together at dinnertime. Now that David\u2019s not spending any time at my house, Bob stops by much (MUCH!!!) more often.  Although the soul of ghostly gentility himself, Bob tends to hang out with what I might diplomatically call a challenging sort of crowd, the Algonquin Round Table in Manhattan. I\u2019d visited his friends at The Algonquin hotel a couple of times and the word \u2018surreal\u2019 pops into my mind every time I try to describe the experience. Fortunately, though, his ghostly buddies hadn\u2019t found their way from midtown Manhattan out to my isolated lake house in western New York. I planned to keep it that way. \nAmazon \u272f Amazon Int'l \u272f Goodreads \n\n\nBob at the Lake What would happen if Roz, a crabby woman of a certain age, moved to the wintry shores of a New York lake\u2014and got a ghost? And not just any ghost, mind you. Bob\u2019s a ghost from 1920\u2019s Manhattan, full of quips and over fond of his martinis, who swans around in a silk smoking jacket and makes Roz\u2019s life very . . . well, let\u2019s just say \u2018complicated.\u2019 Especially after Roz meets David, the good-looking grape grower who lives up the hill. Join Roz, David\u2014and Bob\u2014as they navigate blizzards, cookie mazes, holiday shopping sprees, and the occasional power outage.

Amazon \u272f Amazon Int'l \u272f Goodreads Bob at the Plaza Bob, our favorite martini-loving ghost, has vanished. Now Roz faces a miserable snowbound Crooked Lake winter alone. Well, almost alone. Thank goodness for David, the practical, kind grape grower who lives up the hill. What a winter it is! Record-breaking snows followed months later by record-setting rains. Ah, the joys of living on a lake shore when the spring floods arrive. High water, anyone? Undeterred by mice, sociopathic relatives, Carnegie Hall disasters, and spring floods, Roz searches for her MIA ghost. In the process she goes toe-to-toe with the hyper-verbal crowd at the Algonquin Round Table. Can Roz best smarty-pants Dorothy Parker in a game of wits?

I have always said the best paid comedian in Nigeria are the politicians and with the recent appointment of Mrs Ogechi Ololo (nee Okorocha) as the Commissioner for Happiness and Couples\u2019s Fulfillment, Imo State has to be the biggest joke I heard in my entire life. As a matter of fact I think Governor Rochas Okorocha also deserves his own statue, he for me is a golden clown. The jokes about Rochas Okorocha started some couple of months back when the self-acclaimed best governor of Imo State started to unveil different statues worth millions of Naira in Owerri, the first of many to come was that of South African President Jacob Zuma which according to report was built for N520 million Naira. While Nigeria's Twitter was still on fire about this joke the Governor gave us another statue, this time he unveiled that of the president of Liberia, you can say Rochas is a back to back man. If we are being honest this back to back joke of Rochas started way before the unveiling of these meaningless statues, but let me start from the ones that got me seriously laughing this year, the ban of Keke Napep (Tricycle) on all major road in Owerri which if I am not mistaken very soon all Keke Napep would seize to work in Imo State before the end of the year. Of course the governor did the right thing by replacing them with taxis. Many believe Rochas' heart was in the right place when doing this but let's do a quick analysis, I won\u2019t go far, I will just compare that policies to that of the former governor of Lagos State Raji Fashola , banning Okoda on major road in Lagos, he didn\u2019t just replace it, he made sure the replacement was something that will definitely easy the pain and suffering of the people. Replacing Okada with Keke Napep in major roads in Lagos remain one of the best thing Fashaola did, safety aside, let\u2019s talk about the expenses, entering a Napep is more cheaper than entering Okada in Lagos, where Okada will charge for 500 per person Napep won\u2019t take you more than 300 the highest, now that's economically sensible, you have reduced cost and also save lives in the process because the rate of Okada accident in Lagos na die . In Imo State which is not even close to Lagos state in terms of development the governor decides to ban the cheap Napep transportation to replace them with Taxis, Taxis which are not lower in terms of fare rate and sometimes have high fare than Napep and from what I have gathered, the Taxis which was reported to be 2000 in numbers for first batch, is actually 300 and the free of charge claim is also not true as I have heard that the former Napep drivers hired to drive the taxis were asked to pay 20,000 Naira registration form and then sign an agreement to remit the sum of 2 million Naira in installment while some of the drivers complained about the quality of the taxis, many are of the opinion the car will become a liability after six months as it will require constant maintenance. Like they say in compute village the cars na refurbished . If you are in Imo you would know that Rochas doesn\u2019t value education much and this is me being modest, I heard from many sources even close friends that the so called free education from primary to university down to polytechnics was just a campaign scam as Imo State natives pay school fees just that the fee isn\u2019t as high as that of the non-natives which is even a common practice among most state university in Nigeria but 'free' has a new meaning in Imo. But that is not the joke, the real joke is moving the state library from the Government House to a Disco House, sorry I mean close to Concord Hotel. At this point I must hail the man at least if you're finding it hard to grasp what you're reading, you can just walk into the hotel and relax before going back to the library, Rochas you are indeed a baller. What makes me laugh the most is how his party APC has remained silent on these issues, from what I was taught in school no candidate/party member is bigger than his/her political party unless I was taught the wrong thing, na Naija I dey trust me it's possible , children are the leaders of tomorrow n a wetin still dey make some people believe say Atiku never old to contest for 2019 . Someone has to put Rochas in check and for me the party is the best organisation to do it, as this is not just a slap on what the party represent but also a disgrace to the little integrity they are trying to hold on to To every Imo State native out there I just want you to know that I feel your pain but on the bright side there is a commissioner of Happiness, so for those of you not happy that neither Wizkid or Davido hasn\u2019t gotten a statue yet, you know where to lodge your complain.

Workers", "text": "  \nWASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to weigh in on a ruling from the Texas Supreme Court expressing that the nation\u2019s highest court has not made clear whether the \u201cspouses\u201d of homosexual government workers are entitled to benefits. \nThe nine justices denied the appeal of Turner v. Pidgeon without comment on Monday, along with dozens of other petitions for certiorari from across the country. \n\u201cWe are very excited about our win today in front of the United States Supreme Court. The court decision confirms that the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s 9-0 decision reversing the Court of Appeals was correct,\u201d attorney Jared Woodfill said in a statement. \nAs previously reported , in 2013, Houston Mayor Annise Parker issued an order that required the city to provide benefits to homosexual city workers \u201clegally married\u201d out-of-state as same-sex nuptials were illegal in Texas at the time. \nThe following month, a pastor and an accountant filed suit against the city, stating that Parker\u2019s order violated the Houston city charter, the Texas Defense of Marriage Act and the state Constitution. \nState Judge Lisa Millard granted an injunction against Parker, but the city moved the legal challenge to federal court, resulting in the injunction becoming moot. However, the federal court moved the suit back to the state on jurisdictional grounds. \nFollowing the 2015 Supreme Court ruling of Obergefell v. Hodges, an appeals court lifted the injunction and plaintiffs Jack Pidgeon and Larry Hicks took the matter to the state Supreme Court. The court declined to hear the appeal in September 2016, but supporters\u2014with the agreement of Gov. Abbott urged the justices to reconsider.   \nIn January, the court agreed to rehear the case, and held an oral argument hearing in March. It then released its written opinion in June. \n\u201cWe agree with the mayor [of Houston] that any effort to resolve whether and the extent to which the Constitution requires states or cities to provide tax-funded benefits to same-sex couples without considering Obergefell would simply be erroneous,\u201d Justice Jeffrey Boyd wrote on behalf of the panel. \u201cOn the other hand, we agree \u2026 that the Supreme Court did not address and resolve that specific issue in Obergefell.\u201d \n\u201cThe Supreme Court held in Obergefell that the Constitution requires states to license and recognize same-sex marriages to the same extent that they license and recognize opposite-sex marriages, but it did not hold that states must provide the same publicly funded benefits to all married persons,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, that does not mean \u2026 that the city may constitutionally deny benefits to its employees\u2019 same-sex spouses. Those are the issues that this case now presents.\u201d \nThe court unanimously sent the matter back to the trial court for further consideration. \nFollowing the ruling, Houston appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the high court denied the petition. \n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful that the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed our lawsuit to go forward,\u201d Texas Values President Jonathan Saenz, who is representing Pidgeon and Hicks, said in a statement on Monday. \u201cMayor Annise Parker defied the law by providing spousal benefits to same-sex couples at a time when same-sex marriage was illegal in Texas, and we intend hold the city accountable for Parker\u2019s lawless actions and her unauthorized expenditures of taxpayer money.\u201d \nSarah Kate Ellis of the homosexual advocacy group GLAAD decried the court\u2019s denial as permitting other similar lawsuits at the state level. \n\u201cThe Supreme Court has just let an alarming ruling by the Texas Supreme Court stand which plainly undercuts the rights of married same-sex couples,\u201d she stated, according to the Dallas Observer. \u201cToday\u2019s abnegation by the nation\u2019s highest court opens the door for an onslaught of challenges to the rights of LGBTQ people at every step.\u201d   \nSupreme Court Declines to Hear Texas Case Regarding \u2018Spousal\u2019 Benefits of Homosexual Govt. Workers   6,   Michael C \nGot it. The family members of straight Texas government employees get health insurance but the family members of gay Texas government employees do not. \nThey can get all uppity with their marriage licenses but we\u2019ll have the last laugh when we deny them health care. Yay morality! New Testament Bible Course \nI don\u2019t think that this has anything to do with morality or getting back at people. It simply sounds like this issue is getting bogged down in a court system that can\u2019t keep up with societal changes. After Obergefell, I can\u2019t see anyone being denied benefits. Michael C \nAfter Obergefell, I can\u2019t see anyone being denied benefits \nWhat do you mean by this?

Haniya said in a speech in Gaza City on Thursday that US President Donald Trump's recognition \"killed\" the Israeli- Palestinian peace process. \"This decision has killed the peace process, has killed the Oslo [accord], has killed the settlement process,\" he said. \"The US decision is an aggression, a declaration of war on us, on the best Muslim and Christian shrines in the heart of Palestine, Jerusalem.\" \"We should work on launching an intifada in the face of the Zionist enemy,\" Haniya said. He stressed the fact that the Palestinians see Jerusalem as united and the capital of their future state. \"Jerusalem, all of Jerusalem, is ours,\" he said. \"We are here today at a critical point in the history of the Palestinian issue and the core of the issue is Jerusalem, a critical point in the history of the Arab and Muslim nations following the provocative decision, the unfair decision adopted by the US administration.\" He called on all Palestinian factions to unite quickly \"in order to have the strategy to confront the occupation and the US administration policies inside the Palestinian Territories\". \"We urge, we ask and we stress the necessity of rearranging the Palestinian situation to confront this dangerous plot and to put our priorities clearly to face that provocative decision, that unfair decision,\" he said. Ignoring warnings Trump, ignoring warnings from the international community, announced on Wednesday that the US formally recognises Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and will begin the process of moving its embassy to the city, breaking with decades of US policy. On Thursday, Mustafa Barghouti, the secretary general of the Palestinian National Initiative, speaking to Al Jazeera from Ramallah, said that Trump was \"joining Israel in the war crimes and in confirming the annexation of the occupied Palestinian Territories\". \"I hope that the Palestinian Authority will not accept to meet with this American team anymore,\" he said. \"Israel decided it wants everything. They want everything? Fine. We will also fight for everything,\" he said. \"We might be talking about a popular wide uprising but non-violent one, similar to the first intifada. That's what we need.

The title poem reads as follows:\n\n\u201cMy old clock I wind \nAnd much philosophy therein find. \nI can bring \nThe pendulum\u2019s swing \nTo a stop with my hand; \nYet I can not command \nTime to default \nOn his duty and halt \nThe passing of the years. \nHe has no ears \nFor our laughter and tears \nAnd his sickle will swing on \nLong after we are gone\u201d. \n\nAbout The Author \nI was born in Liverpool in 1969, a year best known of course for my birth. Well no, actually it is better known for the moon landings which certain peculiar\nconspiracy theorists still maintain never took place (the moon landings that is, not my birth!).\n\nIt was from my grandfather that I derived my first love of literature and I have many happy memories of him reading to me. As I grew older I learned to\nread Braille which opened up the world of independent reading and I still remember how amazing it was to me, as a young boy, to be able to sit with a book\non my knee reading for myself.\n\nI attended school in Liverpool and later went on to read history and politics at university. Having obtained my BA, I went on to gain an MA in political\ntheory.\n\nSince 1994 I have lived and worked in London. I find that I cannot write with background noise, other than the singing of birds, and am lucky that my home\noverlooks a large garden and an historic park in Crystal Palace, famed for it's steep hills and fresh air.\n\nWhere to buy \u201cMy Old Clock I Wind\u201d \nAudible (UK) - https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Arts-Entertainment/My-Old-Clock-I-Wind-and-Other-Poems-Audiobook/B077VYT3X6/ \nAudible.com - https://www.audible.com/pd/Drama-Poetry/My-Old-Clock-I-Wind-and-Other-Poems-Audiobook/B077VS5CTN/ \nAmazon (US) - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0735JBVBG \nAmazon (UK) - https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0735JBVBG \nMoyhill Publishing - http://moyhill.com/clock/ \nThe royal National Institute of Blind People (braille edition) - http://shop.rnib.org.uk/ or call 0303 123 9999, quoting order number 25870603.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kevin morris", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national institute of blind people", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "liverpool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crystal palace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:34.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0af482f38bf768ba1b9056ebb02c5506e23b0b42", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rZxEMSci6mbglD4hAY1PQt8RMmSBZ0ROI0zSfjDX6kgKO_ImwaicIXNz6KnPPzIzvmUEbpGmoiVty9kYaS4azFcW2x.dmoWhbkKi5Q9eClPtEi6Hj2Bdv", "site_full": "www.stockmarketwire.com", "site": "stockmarketwire.com", "site_section": "http://www.stockmarketwire.com//rss/headlines/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Stock Market Wire", "title": "Italian unemployment down 0.1%", "title_full": "Italian unemployment down 0.1%", "published": "2017-12-07T11:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0af482f38bf768ba1b9056ebb02c5506e23b0b42", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rZxEMSci6mbglD4hAY1PQt8RMmSBZ0ROI0zSfjDX6kgKO_ImwaicIXNz6KnPPzIzvmUEbpGmoiVty9kYaS4azFcW2x.dmoWhbkKi5Q9eClPtEi6Hj2Bdv", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "Italian unemployment down 0.1%", "text": "Italian unemployment down 0.1% 7 December 2017 | 09:45am StockMarketWire.com - The number of people who were classed as unemployed in Italy totalled 2.879 million in October.

Backcasting on blockchain: how big would Bitcoin blockchain need to scale up in order to dominate global transactions? December 7, 2017 \nNon-cash global transactions amount to about 522 billion and are increasing in a big way, growing by 9.1% between 2015 and 2016 alone. For Bitcoin blockchain to dominate that enormous number of transactions in the future, it will need to scale massively. But just by how much? \nThe number of transactions corresponds to 9,722,220 transactions every 10 minutes, the same duration for publishing blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain, according to an opinion piece by Software Engineer and Computer Science and Business student   Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University Subhan Nadeem . \nIt means every block would hold 2.4 gigabytes of data at today\u2019s size of 250 bytes . So Bitcoin would see 350 gigabytes on its blockchain every day and 127 terabytes every year. It currently produces 50GB of data every year. Also Read: New Bitcoin Improvement submits Drivechain technology proposal \nValidating a single block and propagating it to other nodes in the network consumes 1.25 gigabytes of memory and takes approximately thirty seconds according to an analysis . Nodes validate and propagate 1-megabyte blocks to other nodes around the world. An eight-megabyte block would take about 150 minutes to validate. \nAssuming validation time and memory consumption scale only linearly in future. Since to validate the newly projected monster blocks. However, we would need over 51,000 minutes per block or approximately 35.4 days for a miner running at today\u2019s consumer-grade hardware. Therefore, to validate a block that would hold about 2.4 gigabytes of data. \nOnly the HP Z8 , which will cost $10,000 on release, would come close to managing that work. Also, with the cost of data storage, the operator of the machine that handles all that amount of data. However, from the blockchain would need to spend $2,413 per year on storage costs due to blockchain growth. Currently, a user would pay $0.95 in yearly costs for the 50GB of data increase every year. Also Read: IOTA hates Blockchain as Ethereum displeasures tangle \nWith the current node distribution, a node would need to manage a bandwidth of 691 GB every day or 20.73 terabytes per month if it downloads a block every 10 minutes and uploads the recommended 144 blocks per day. That comes to about $600/month (at least) for bandwidth costs in the United States using this calculator if the machine owner would route blocks through a CDN operator (no consumer grade network provides that level of bandwidth today). \nIn other words, if the numbers go that high, there is a higher risk that mining centralization will occur. It also means the security and proper functioning of the network would be left in the hands of large corporations. The two would be avoided only if the scaling of the blockchain is matched by an improvement in block technology, for instance, a technology that makes Bitcoin scale without increasing block size . \nAnother change that will certainly occur is the reduction of costs, including bandwidth and storage costs. \nFor the Bitcoin blockchain to scale fast enough to reach billions very quickly. There would need to be a very fast reduction in bandwidth. Besides storage costs for many people to manage the costs. Also, the cost of machines would need to drop very fast. The machine technology itself would need to improve to see the network handle. Thus that huge amount of data and transactions without hitches and security breaches. \nThere is no doubt that appropriate systems will need time to develop and it will take time.

Besides these will push up transaction levels even beyond Visa\u2019s processing capability. Although augments by artificial intelligence systems. \nThe rise of AI and the entry of quantum computers I wrote about a few months ago show that things will have changed a lot in the next 20 years in terms of wallets, underlying blockchain tech and may be forced improvement on almost everything that\u2019s crypto today.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "subhan nadeem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel jeffries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of waterloo and wilfrid laurier university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "drivechain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:34.033+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae929bec154549683ee6160dff63514c824a6019", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfS5owzClBjjML78thEN.30N.IvLpJXaNl3D_cfVNefSMeVLlcg5lBancUEQmGHuZsq5k4roK1cQ--", "site_full": "coinpedia.org", "site": "coinpedia.org", "site_section": "https://coinpedia.org/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency encyclopedia | Cryptocurrency information | Cryptocurrency News", "title": "Digital wallet NiceHash hacked around $60mln stolen", "title_full": "Digital wallet NiceHash hacked around $60mln stolen", "published": "2017-12-07T11:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://coinpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Digital-wallet-NiceHash-hacked-around-60m-stolen.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae929bec154549683ee6160dff63514c824a6019", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfS5owzClBjjML78thEN.30N.IvLpJXaNl3D_cfVNefSMeVLlcg5lBancUEQmGHuZsq5k4roK1cQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David", "published": "2017-12-07T11:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "Digital wallet NiceHash hacked around $60mln stolen", "text": "Subscribe   Digital wallet NiceHash hacked around $60mln stolen Digital wallet NiceHash hacked around $60mln stolen December 7, 2017 \nNiceHash mining market was hacked yesterday and the unknown amount of coins stolen according to a company announcement posted on social media and now on its website. \nAlthough the company has not reported the number of coins stolen, users have to circulate a wallet address suggesting that 4,736.42 BTC worth more than $62 million was stolen from company\u2019s hot wallet.

Studying history is a passion of mine that I can see Mark shares. His novel may take place in the late 18th century, but it is easy to see how the themes are applicable to modern times. As President Harry S Truman once said, 'The only thing new in the world is the history you don't know.' Are you wondering how the era of William Pitt the Younger might give insight to the politics of today? Read on. \n~ Samantha \nGuest Post by Mark Stibbe \nThe setting of The Fate of Kings in many ways couldn\u2019t be more topical. The story focuses upon a fictional Vicar, Thomas Pryce, who becomes enrolled in the nascent British Secret Service, formed in 1793. That year had many parallels with our own unsettling times.\n\nIn the winter of 1792, the parliament of William Pitt the Younger was faced with issues related to immigration and terror. Thousands of refugees were pouring into Britain, escaping from the guillotine in France. In December of that year, four thousand emigr\u00e9s entered the country, appalled by the massacres and decapitations in the cities of their brutalised nation. Britain welcomed these men, women and children with open arms. \n\nHowever, as it turned out, peoples\u2019 arms were a little too open. \n\nPitt soon realised that among these legitimate fugitives were French agents and assassins, hell-bent on destroying the foundations of British society. He rushed through an Act of Parliament at the start of 1793 (the Alien Act), designed to filter the wheat from the chaff. He also set up the Alien Office under William Wickham. This created a network of urban magistrates tasked with identifying and interrogating suspected terrorists among the desperate fugitives. Pitt even had Habeas Corpus suspended for a while so these potential Terror-ists could be held longer and questioned more rigorously. This is interestingly what formally launched the British Secret Service.\n\nThe first of the Thomas Pryce adventures, The Fate of Kings , is set within this turbulent time. Pryce, the newly enrolled (fictional) Vicar of St Leonard\u2019s Upper Deal, is ideally suited to become an agent. Not only does his life as a clergyman provide a perfect cover, his ability to speak French fluently makes him a most unusual and accomplished asset.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that Pryce and his spymaster William Wickham go to work in an unquestioning way. Pryce faces a faith-eroding dilemma during the first story. On Sundays, in his public role, he declares the Ten Commandments, including \u2018Thou Shalt Do no Murder.\u2019 In the week, in his private and secret role, he finds himself in predicaments where he must choose whether to kill French assassins, intent on great evil.\n\nWickham too wrestles with major ethical issues \u2013 issues to do with the freedoms that the British public has been used to, and the restrictions that now must be employed in the interests of national security, especially when the terror caused by massed decapitations threatens to reproduce the equivalent of the French Revolution in London and throughout Britain.\n\nAs in the 1790s, today we face the same kinds of dilemmas that caused such radical action on the part of Wickham and Pitt. We too must learn to balance mercy with discernment, compassionate action with political decisiveness. Just as Wickham had to root out \u2018the spy in our midst\u2019, so we now find ourselves forced to identify and restrain the terrorists in our midst.\n\nThe times may be different, but the issues remain strikingly similar.\n\nAnd The Fate of Kings gives us a unique opportunity to learn from the past and set the course for the future.\n\n\n\n\nPurchase The Fate of Kings   \nAmazon US paperback or Kindle \nAmazon UK paperback or Kindle ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark stibbe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pryce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william wickham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas pryce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wickham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry s truman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william pitt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "samantha  guest post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st leonard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "secret service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "habeas corpus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alien office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kindle  amazon uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:36.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0195736d8b070cbb9b4851c712e4424e3f3131b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYCuIk8eytDCqOyRsyM1MXLp", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "CryptoSanta Thread", "title_full": "/biz/ - CryptoSanta Thread - Business & Finance - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T13:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 75, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "871f50d449d69c7772b11f8eeaa13d202c22767e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYCuIk8eytDCqPR_ZhNEt5_6wRiskhzLVUM-", "ord_in_thread": 51, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Lisk?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:36.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "068e25ca9fe5a58e3a81b1ea7be446f7e176290d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeLDLpeLZQsIFjkk9JIx506.ab5wNZlHKwU8PvyCG9BECl0CYi84VqPRteILHd2LClFMqgKd2fC2bEVGo2oshCptcLcRJeaHpUpGtB0576CJWox.mkQCPJTKUtlLnx0c9HroRcquKay81YT.F7gEiBLtmkTUhbgyxN8uc2neJXT8c-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/sports-outdoors-accessories/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Sports Accessories With Best Price At Lazada Malaysia", "title": "Portable 230V AC Electric Air Pump For Inflatable Air Bed Sofa Swimming Pool", "title_full": "Portable 230V AC Electric Air Pump For Inflatable Air Bed Sofa Swimming Pool | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2016-12-13T04:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 53, "participants_count": 52, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.061, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e42b70fbdadb3983903e4d23e06e638a673aa028", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeLDLpeLZQsIFjkk9JIx506.ab5wNZlHKwU8PvyCG9BECl0CYi84VqPRteILHd2LClFMqgKd2fC2bEVGo2oshCptcLcRJeaHpUpGtB0576CJWox.mkQCPJTKUtlLnx0c9HroRcquKay81YT.F7gEiBLtmkTUhbgyxN2VSy0H_RUuVq.4mS8PmohA--", "ord_in_thread": 52, "author": "Yap C.", "published": "2017-12-04T14:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "Four Stars", "text": "Received in good condition.
