Back in 2011, it was worth less than a dollar. \nSome leading economists and financiers are calling bitcoin a bubble and a fraud, but industry insiders say they think it\u2019s only going to get bigger as it gains more widespread acceptance. \nSo howdoes the virtual digital currency work \u2014 and what\u2019s behind its spectacular rise? \nRelated: Bitcoin pops above $14,000 for the first time \nWhat is bitcoin? \nBitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Many of its backers saw it as a simple global payment system for anyone to use rather than a financial asset for investors to trade. \nUnlike the U.S. dollar or Japanese yen, digital currencies such as bitcoin aren\u2019t issued by central banks like the Federal Reserve. Instead, they are \u201cmined\u201d by computers using complex algorithms. \nRelated: Bitcoin bubble brewing or is it still a bargain? \nPayments in bitcoin can be made without traditional middlemen such as banks and without the need to give your name. \nThat made bitcoin popular with criminals and others who wanted to move money anonymously. But it\u2019s also been adopted by businesses around the world as a way to pay for everyday things like groceries, train tickets and haircuts. \nIts price has taken off this year as mainstream investors have become more interested. \nNational governments are trying to keep up, puzzling over how to regulate bitcoin and other so-called cryptocurrencies. Countries like China and Venezuela have expressed interested in creating their own digital forms of money. \nVenezuela plans its own version of bitcoin \nWhy have prices gone crazy? \nSome experts say the biggest force pushing bitcoin prices higher this year has been \u2026 higher prices. \nInvestors have been buying in this year out of \u201cFOMO,\u201d or the fear of missing out, according to Dave Chapman, managing director of Octagon Strategy, a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange. \n\u201cThere is admittedly a lot of speculation in this market,\u201d he said. \nBitcoin is also being driven higher by the hands-off approach many financial regulators seem to be taking toward the digital currency, Chapman said. \nJapan\u2019s government, for example, gave bitcoin the seal of approval and started licensing bitcoin exchanges earlier this year. \nThe only black mark has been China, which has been cracking down some uses of the virtual currency. \nAnnouncements from some major financial institutions in the U.S. are helping bitcoin gain greater mainstream acceptance. \nRelated: Bitcoin craziness spreads to Overstock, Square \nThis month, investors will be able to start trading bitcoin futures via the Chicago Board Options Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. \nNew York\u2019s Nasdaq plans to launch its own bitcoin futures in 2018. \n\u201cThe fact the CME, CBOE and Nasdaq will now all offer bitcoin products lends additional legitimacy\u201d to the digital currency, said Chapman. \nWho\u2019s buying it? \nFor much of this year, it\u2019s mom-and-pop investors who have been buying in. \nMany arein Japan and South Korea, where recent regulation changes have made it easier to trade bitcoin, according to experts. \nBut the biggest gains from the virtual currency\u2019s massive rally are likely to be concentrated among a relatively small number of investors. \nRelated: Russia eyes cryptocurrency dominance \nWhen you invest in bitcoin, you don\u2019t have to buy a whole unit. According to research site BitInfoCharts, the vast majority of bitcoin accounts contain just 0.1 bitcoin(about $1,400) or less. Just 3% of more than 20 million bitcoin accounts hold one bitcoin or more. \nBig institutional investors such as hedge funds and assets managers have largely stayed on the sidelines. But some experts predict they\u2019ll move into the market in the coming months, despite skepticism from the likes of Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. \nWhat\u2019s next? \nSome industry insiders are incredibly bullish. \nArthur Hayes, CEO of Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Bitmex,predicts prices could hit a mind-boggling $50,000 by the end of next year, driven by the flow of money when institutional investors \u201cpull the trigger\u201d on investing in the digital currency. \nOctagon\u2019s Chapman is willing to stick his neck out even further. He thinks it will go above $100,000 before 2018 is over. \nRelated: Nobel winner says bitcoin \u2018ought to be outlawed\u2019 \nWith a total value of around $235 billion, the bitcoin market is small compared with more established assets. \n\u201cThis is a drop in the ocean compared to the trillions transacted daily\u201d in currency and stock markets, said Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Gatecoin. Just a small amount of mainstream investors\u2019 money would make a big difference to bitcoin prices, he said. \nBut some finance industry veterans are wary. \nOanda\u2019s Innes, who has worked in currency trading for decades, referenced a famous piece of investment advice from Buffett: \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy.\u201d \n\u201cFollowing the herd rarely produces large scale gains,\u201d Innes said. \nInvestors were given a reminder of bitcoin\u2019s unpredictability in November. After topping $11,000, it plunged more than $2,000 before resuming its ascent. \nCNNMoney (Hong Kong) First published December 7, 2017: 12:20 AM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chapman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arthur hayes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie dimon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas glucksmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave chapman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "innes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nasdaq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "overstock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "octagon strategy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago board options exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago mercantile exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jpmorgan chase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "octagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oanda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:28.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "128301897f936a895e7a295269bb1d495122bb7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxUSIgBkIguegIfvKPqDULG89D4hHYI4clfrJ2B.y2OZK", "site_full": "blog.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/blog?query=h&start=59&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "sfghsfghs", "title_full": "sfghsfghs : \ub124\uc774\ubc84 \ube14\ub85c\uadf8", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "KS", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "http://blogimgs.naver.net/nblog/mylog/post/og_default_image_160610.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "128301897f936a895e7a295269bb1d495122bb7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxUSIgBkIguegIfvKPqDULG89D4hHYI4clfrJ2B.y2OZK", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "yyf57k6k", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "sfghsfghs", "text": "sfdh\nsfhfsg\nhsf\nh", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:28.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c92b71cd7358c93159e021c3b9605125f9a4a58c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG28R0Zu2Qk2pYKvGQz1QztDTIqr6UEUyYLYg3RkU.7K33m_8Nt_ZWEe.MCMv4pgCNnT2iB0OUG8SCtYggJ8oDXIhg2uXMvCmis.O5jWTe4otY-", "site_full": "www.mumsnet.com", "site": "mumsnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/style_and_beauty", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Style and beauty | Mumsnet Discussion ", "title": "Day by Day M&S Beauty Calendar- No Spoilers!", "title_full": "Day by Day M&S Beauty Calendar- No Spoilers!

They\u2019re increasing homelessness. \nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development said Wednesday that homelessness ticked up 0.7% in 2017. By HUD\u2019s definition, 553,742 people were homeless at least one night during the year. \nBut it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that. As HUD puts it, homelessness actually declined \u201cin most communities of the U.S. with increases reported in high-cost areas.\u201d \nIn 30 states and even in relatively expensive Washington, D.C., homelessness was down \u2013 but, according to HUD, \u201cchallenges in some major metropolitan areas, however, have had a major impact on the national trend lines.\u201d \nRead: Malls are dying. There aren\u2019t enough homes. Is there a solution? \nExpensive rent and surging home prices aren\u2019t just coastal stories, of course. There\u2019s a housing shortage throughout the country. Even metro areas that were slammed in the housing crisis are rebounding, and as Americans flee the highest-cost areas, they help nudge prices higher throughout the country. \nRead: \u2018High-cost housing refugees\u2019 are bringing the real estate crunch into Middle America \nBut the high-cost places are, well, high-cost. \nAn Apartment List analysis for MarketWatch showed that the metros with the most cost-burdened residents are nearly all in California, Florida, or the Northeast. (\u201cModerately cost-burdened\u201d renters are those who spend 30 to 50% of their income on rent, while the \u201cseverely cost-burdened\u201d spend 50% or more.) \nAs Sydney Bennet, an Apartment List research associate, puts it, \u201cHouseholds spending that large of a share of income on rent likely don\u2019t have a buffer for when things go wrong, like a medical emergency, or a car breakdown and thus are more likely to be evicted or end up homeless.\u201d \nIt\u2019s worth noting that Los Angeles ranks sixth on the cost-burdened list and New York isn\u2019t even in the top 10 \u2013 but in both cities the number of cost-burdened tenants has risen over time as rents have surged for several years. Across the U.S., the median rent rose 8% in the ten years to 2016, while in New York they rose 15%, and in Los Angeles 13%. \n\u201cRent change doesn\u2019t seem to fully explain the HUD data, but the combination of rent growth with already high rents are likely to push renters over the edge,\u201d Bennet said. \nHUD officials say they understand the situation. \u201cWith rents rising faster than incomes, we need to bring everybody to the table to produce more affordable housing and ease the pressure that is forcing too many of our neighbors into our shelters and onto our streets,\u201d said HUD Secretary Ben Carson in a statement. \u201cThis is not a federal problem-it\u2019s everybody\u2019s problem.\u201d \nOf course, surging prices are also hitting buyers. \nHome prices rose at the fastest pace since 2014 last month, according to the closely-watched Case-Shiller index. \nAnd many of the areas with the most expensive rental costs also make for the priciest purchases. According to data from the National Association of Realtors, many of the most expensive metros in the third quarter of 2017 were in California, or the New York City metro area. \nBut those who struggle to pay the rent may be more vulnerable. And many affordable-housing advocates are worried that the tax bills advancing through Congress may make the problem much worse. \nOne industry expert told MarketWatch in November that he expects an increase in homelessness if the legislation becomes law, and a resulting increase in public spending on crime and health services.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sydney bennet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bennet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben carson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marketwatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national association of realtors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of housing and urban development", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:28.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53c70af8c31b55134bce153d33cb7cab461e67b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqAY0p_pThMNXYjTfiRMt4Wa_4D_DSKPLgV.vKaIHqac0vR.shwJCOcfxOzDcRyhWJM8b4OtZYlLVDOwfN0wBGPhipVJmaz3YNsHy7xl1Ujeq0bEMswsTb3pUx5T4Ae8g-", "site_full": "www.avforums.com", "site": "avforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.avforums.com/forums/blu-ray-dvd-players-recorders.148/", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Blu-ray &amp; DVD Players &amp; Recorders | AVForums", "title": "Cambridge Audio CXUHD Ultra HD Blu-ray Player Review | Page 3", "title_full": "Cambridge Audio CXUHD Ultra HD Blu-ray Player Review | Page 3 | AVForums", "published": "2017-12-06T12:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://static.avforums.com/data/avatars/m/413/413150.jpg?1386083606", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10709, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ec48e66a8dd9a618e48d909b11bf4ad9890111a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqAY0p_pThMNXYjTfiRMt4Wa_4D_DSKPLgV.vKaIHqac0vR.shwJCOcfxOzDcRyhWJM8b4OtZYlLVDOwfN0wBGPhipVJmaz3YNsHy7xl1Ujeq0bEMswsTb8FPI8NnWomw_2qXlxKQcUg--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "plum23", "published": "2017-12-06T15:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Beoboi said: \u2191 Whether or not the loss of those outputs and associated DACS leads to a performance edge re less noise in the audio and video signals as Cambridge claims is anyones guess.

Isn\u2019t it funny how both times Roberts made it clear he isn\u2019t choosing her she\u2019s suddenly ended up pregnant? Accept this time she saw her chance because Aaron\u2019s jealousy and paranoia has been obvious from the start. Chrissie never would of suspected them and in a way Rebecca didn\u2019t tell her because she didn\u2019t want to hurt her sister. But when it comes to Aaron she has no loyalties to him. He\u2019s nothing to her. He\u2019s not a relative. He\u2019s not a friend. He\u2019s the one who beat her and won Robert and she didn\u2019t like Robert yet again chose some over her. Why do you think she hasn\u2019t apologised? Because she\u2019s playing Robert. In her mind now she wins. She\u2019s got the baby. She\u2019s got Robert involved. But endgame? She doesn\u2019t win. He gets Aaron back. Aaron\u2019s the one by his hospital bed. Lachlan is suddenly spying on his family even after he\u2019s threatened to get revenge on Lachlan. I\u2019m calling it now. Either Rebecca is going to be speaking to the baby or someone already knows (like chrissie) he isn\u2019t the dad and she\u2019ll be talking about it. Lachlan will overhear it most likely use his brain as he seems to be the only White with one and probably record it. Robert will find out confront Rebecca and Rebecca being scared ends up telling Lawrence. Roberts driving up to the village to expose Rebecca but something happens and takes him off the road (reason for the coma) that way no one knows until he wakes up. Everyone will be sat there talking about how he has to fight for his son and how he will be the best father possible and they\u2019ll all need to wait till he wakes up to find out that\u2019s not his kid. Why do you think when the robron future , the reunion and the wedding have been mentioned Rebecca and the baby haven\u2019t? The journalists who get interviews aren\u2019t even asking the question of how aaron accepts the baby or how robron will decide to try with rebecca and the baby around.

Recently, we demonstrated that organo-chalcogen (sulfur and selenium) Zn complexes elicit strong anti-diabetic effects. In this study, we treated leptin-deficient ob/ob mice with organo-chalcogen Zn complexes, and evaluated the resulting anti-diabetic effects in a mouse model of diabetes arising from pathogenic mechanisms different from those in KKAy mice. C57BL/6J ob/ob mice orally received either bis(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4(H)-pyran-4-thiono)Zn, [Zn(hmpt)2] or bis(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4(H)-pyran-4-seleno)Zn, [Zn(hmps)2], daily for 28 days. Both Zn complexes elicited potent blood glucose-lowering effects and improved HbA1c values. Moreover, glucose intolerance improved as evidenced by the oral glucose tolerance test, and fasting plasma insulin levels decreased in both types of Zn complex-treated mice. Zn concentrations in the liver and pancreas of [Zn(hmpt)2]-treated mice and in the pancreas of [Zn(hmps)2]-treated mice were increased, respectively. The results suggest that the present Zn complexes mainly exerted an anti-diabetic effect in the liver or pancreas. This study is the first to demonstrate that potent Zn complexes elicit anti-diabetic effects in not only KKAy but also ob/ob mice via a normalizing effect on insulin secretion and fasting blood glucose levels.\n\nfrom #AlexandrosSfakianakis via Alexandros G.Sfakianakis on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2iYIkbC\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandros g.sfakianakis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "takayuki nishiguchi yutaka yoshikawa hiroyuki yasui", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:29.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7d3b432b66e00efeb4af3f63a4c16246fa47ce54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_C0rNnsH4cVy4hkKonSEdpr95m6xBt1VDFOCT_E1PpAgyWnvPtAlMTEpq7O1uPqQzbpGBrkFacUcPP62bPe217wtLscvSWG8aOFWXo93sMrK.lZ4kW3O__kzdPuZYotoHWfjUjlhDynH5FSUOVsOemC_FoLR5ivXmjivTBxxkgyw--", "site_full": "www.thesunshinereporter.com", "site": "thesunshinereporter.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Australian Flooring Store Giving Back with Voucher Campaign To Every Customer | The Sun Shine Reporter", "title_full": "Australian Flooring Store Giving Back with Voucher Campaign To Every Customer | The Sun Shine Reporter", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.181, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7d3b432b66e00efeb4af3f63a4c16246fa47ce54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_C0rNnsH4cVy4hkKonSEdpr95m6xBt1VDFOCT_E1PpAgyWnvPtAlMTEpq7O1uPqQzbpGBrkFacUcPP62bPe217wtLscvSWG8aOFWXo93sMrK.lZ4kW3O__kzdPuZYotoHWfjUjlhDynH5FSUOVsOemC_FoLR5ivXmjivTBxxkgyw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Australian Flooring Store Giving Back with Voucher Campaign To Every Customer | The Sun Shine Reporter", "text": "Australian Flooring Store Giving Back with Voucher Campaign To Every Customer December 07 08:55 2017 Murarrie, Queensland \u2013 Carpet One Australia one of the largest flooring companies in the country is delighted to announce their latest promotion, which offers a $100 voucher redeemable in-store to anyone who completes a simple form on the website. This promotion is one of the most generous and ambitious the company has ever undertaken, and the expectation is that demand will be huge. The process has been designed to be quick and easy; the form only asks for five key pieces of information, first name, last name, email address, phone number, and postcode. Once completed the site visitor then receives their voucher via return email. They simply take the voucher to their local Carpet One Australia Store and can redeem it against any purchase over $750.00 including sale items. \u201cWe are always looking for innovative promotions and ideas that truly benefit our customers,\u201d said David Meyer of Carpet One Australia. \u201cRather than offer a promotion on specific floor coverings or other merchandise available in store, we decided to offer a voucher that allowed all of our customers to benefit regardless of the products they chose to purchase. We believe that this could be our most successful promotion ever, in fact, the biggest problem customers could face is choosing which product best suits their home. We have even thought of that though and have created our exclusive flooring comparison tool to give our customers some guidance in the peace and quiet of their own homes. Be warned though this promotion must end by the 31 st January.\u201d Carpet One is a co-operative and one of the world\u2019s largest retail floor covering groups. This means that they have huge buying power. The subsequent savings made as a result are then passed onto customers offering unbeatable value all year round. All of their stores offer a large range of carpet, timber, vinyl, and laminate. Each individual store has the flexibility to provide additional products and services \u2014 like carpet cleaning, tiles, furniture, rugs and window fashions.

Varadkar recently announced that the Government will publish a five year roadmap for pension reform before the end of the year. \nCurrently in the UK, employers must complete a number of auto enrolment duties in order to remain fully compliant with the law. These include record keeping, ongoing employee assessment and enrolling staff after the staging date. Ultimately the responsibility of auto enrolment lies with the employer and they must ensure to avoid auto enrolment fines. \nIn Ireland, there will be an introduction of similar workplace pension legislation for private sector workers, two-thirds of whom currently have no occupational pension to supplement their state pension. \nThe first payments are expected to be made into new individually held funds by 2021. \nWritten by Holly McHugh | BrightPay Payroll Software", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "taoiseach leo varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holly mchugh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:30.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "500db22a9bd8f704de73a3ed7c649d9d0097ff5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Bh55tG5__078IRBF6VnFWpcNzx51fSVuoLF.um0b4m9IUfSsSspMQaXnUY2FiD9g18vHcA0GghGMFkpa1UKMY9kyKNE0ws0M-", "site_full": "www.createregisteraccount.com", "site": "createregisteraccount.com", "site_section": "http://www.createregisteraccount.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "How To Create Register Account", "title": "Welcome to Facebook Sign In", "title_full": "Welcome to Facebook Sign In", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UuVCt_idEgM/WhITwBmH6WI/AAAAAAAAWak/GjQWp19epA8_ColpvND-z7oO5xrW82i9ACLcBGAs/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/Facebook%2BAccount%2BSign%2BIn.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "500db22a9bd8f704de73a3ed7c649d9d0097ff5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Bh55tG5__078IRBF6VnFWpcNzx51fSVuoLF.um0b4m9IUfSsSspMQaXnUY2FiD9g18vHcA0GghGMFkpa1UKMY9kyKNE0ws0M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Arif Rahman (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "Welcome to Facebook Sign In", "text": "Home \u00bb Sign In \u00bb Welcome to Facebook Sign In Welcome to Facebook Sign In By Arif Rahman \u2014 Dec 7, 2017 \u2014 Sign In Welcome To Facebook Sign In : Facebook is more than simply a social networking system; it's a system-wide powerhouse that currently integrates with a myriad of various other websites.

REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo State prosecutors said the bribe was given last year on Nov. 14 in exchange for Ulyukayev approving the sale of state-controlled oil company Bashneft to Rosneft. Ulyukayev denies the charges. He says he thought the bag holding the bribe was a gift of expensive alcohol. \u201cA monstrous and cruel provocation was carried out against me,\u201d Ulyukayev told the court in his final statement before it hands down a verdict on Dec. 15. \u201cThis trial has aroused public interest similar to that of a circus,\u201d he added. \u201cThe charges are absurd, the evidence is absurd, and at its base lies the cruelty and impunity of the provocateur.\u201d Rosneft head Sechin, a witness in the trial and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has not appeared in court, citing work commitments. Russian prosecutors earlier this month sought a sentence of 10 years in jail for Ulyukayev.

Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images Brexit Grayling: UK does not need identical laws to EU for Irish border trade \nRegulatory equivalence would allow free flow of trade, says senior Tory as deadline looms for first-stage Brexit deal Thursday 7 December 2017 09.19 GMT Last modified on Thursday 7 December 2017 11.40   Share on Messenger Close \nThe UK does not have to have identical laws to Brussels in order to align regulations to allow free-flowing trade, one of the cabinet\u2019s leading Brexiters, Chris Grayling , has said, hinting at the path the government may pursue to break the stalemate over the Irish border. \nMichel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has told member states that the British government has less than 48 hours to agree a text on a potential deal or negotiations will not move on to the second stage. \nDowning Street needs to agree a solution over the Irish-Northern Irish border that will satisfy both the Irish government and Theresa May\u2019s parliamentary allies, the Democratic Unionist party. \nThe negotiations centre on a guarantee of \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d of Northern Ireland with the EU, to allow a free flow of trade and prevent a hard border, which the DUP said was unacceptable if it put Northern Ireland on a different footing to the rest of the UK. Q&A Show Hide \nInside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland (as part of the UK) are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards. \nThe only way to avoid a hardening of the border after Brexit is to ensure regulations and standards on both sides remain more or less the same in areas like food, medicines and so on. \nThis might imply a permanent acceptance of EU rules \u2013 something that would be anathema to hardline UK Brexiters and the DUP, who reject anything that would \"decouple\" the North from the UK. \nDavid Davis told parliament that regulatory alignment would not mean adopting exactly the same rules as the EU but \"mutually recognised\" rules and inspections. \nHowever, an official in Brussels countered that regulatory alignment would mean that the UK would have to implement rules from Brussels without having any influence over them. \nWhat is the government\u2019s plan for \u2018regulatory alignment\u2019? Davis says the UK could continue to follow some rules of the EU\u2019s single market. This would help avoid a hard border, but would also limit the UK\u2019s ability to diverge from EU regulations. \nWhat does the EU think? Davis thinks the UK and EU can agree to meet the same aims, while achieving them in different ways. The EU believes this could see its standards on workers\u2019 rights and the environment undercut. \nCan it even work? Parliament cannot bind its successors. This principle would mean a deal would never be completely secure for more than five years \u2013 putting its feasibility in doubt. Photograph: PA Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. \nGrayling, the transport secretary, said such alignment did not mean the UK had to accept all Brussels regulation. \u201cPlenty of countries have what you call regulatory equivalence where in one country you have anti-money laundering law and you have another in another country,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \n\u201cThey are not the same, they have a similar goal and each recognises the integrity of the other to stamp out money laundering.\u201d \nGrayling said the government would not stitch up a deal where UK laws had to match those of the EU. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to have, and we\u2019ve never said we will, and we don\u2019t want to have a situation where in future our laws are identical to the European Union ,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThere will be areas where we do do things in a similar way. There will be areas where we don\u2019t do things in a similar way. That\u2019s all the prime minister was seeking to achieve to make sure we can ensure trade flows as freely as possible across the borders.\u201d \nOvernight, the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, struck a similar note, saying that regulatory alignment did not have to apply to everything, merely areas of \u201cnorth-south\u201d activity. \nHowever, it is understood the DUP believes No 10 is still not offering adequate guarantees that Northern Ireland will be treated in exactly the same way as the rest of the UK after Brexit. Quick guide Why is the Irish border a stumbling block for Brexit? Show Hide Counties and customs \nInside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two. \nBritain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety. \nEarly drafts of the agreement Britain hoped to get signed off on Monday said there would be \u201cno divergence\u201d from EU rules that \u201csupport north-south cooperation\u201d, later changed to \u201ccontinued alignment\u201d in a formulation that appeared to allow for subtle divergences. \nBut it raised new questions about who would oversee it and how disputes might be resolved. It was also clearly still a step too far for the DUP. \n- Photograph: Design Pics Inc/Design Pics RF Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. \nGrayling said such disputes were to be expected at tense stages of negotiations. \u201cThis is a complex negotiation running up to a deadline next week. It\u2019s not surprising at this stage in the negotiation.\u201d For the DUP, the border question is raw identity politics | Graham Gudgin Read more \nMeanwhile, the Brexit-backing Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin said the UK must not give up its goal of \u201cregulatory autonomy\u201d after Brexit, and accused the European commission of using the Republic of Ireland as a \u201cproxy\u201d to prevent the creation of an open frontier on the EU\u2019s border. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should walk away, but I do think we should take a firm line, as the prime minister did earlier this week,\u201d Jenkin told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be allowing ourselves to be bullied into promising more and more money, or giving up the goal of regulatory autonomy, or being dragged into a long period of uncertainty without clarity on what we are getting at the end of it.\u201d Topics", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "charles mcquillan/getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leo varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grayling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris grayling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernard jenkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michel barnier", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bbc radio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sinn f\u00e9in", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conservative", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic unionist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dup", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brexit grayling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "downing street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belfast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republic of ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:31.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9fc594f1e683a49f7ecbcb7461dc827bda5256fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKy7BJdobROjJ1RhkIMmWcMO8xyUyOOXMOhNmlrKvPSdtuFzpCTDZ4BhkDFrviYwMdK5MjZCeIru1OuYH8reQfSDOPslsWesCOOIiR_LQTsTY7BW3A2QYMjdOx3BxoSn2sGIJQcZg9ru6Cjm.YgxjuMZRDJ0Z1akEJ0-", "site_full": "perezhilton.com", "site": "perezhilton.com", "site_section": "http://perezhilton.com/category/kuwtk/", "site_categories": ["entertainment"], "section_title": "KUWTK News and Photos | Perez Hilton", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian & Her Disick Babies Grab The Spotlight For Day SIX Of The Kardashian Christmas Card Teaser!", "title_full": "Kourtney Kardashian & Her Disick Babies Grab The Spotlight For Day SIX Of The Kardashian Christmas Card Teaser! | PerezHilton.com", "published": "2017-12-06T22:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.978, "main_image": "http://i.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kourtney-kardashian-disick-babies-christmas-card-teaser__oPt.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2905, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6904522eb72e65e8233100a4c76fab0784e48d4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKy7BJdobROjJ1RhkIMmWcMO8xyUyOOXMOhNmlrKvPSdtuFzpCTDZ4BhkDFrviYwMdK5MjZCeIru1OuYH8reQfSDOPslsWesCOOIiR_LQTsTY7BW3A2QYMjdOx3BxoSn2sGIJQcZg9ru6Cjm.YgxjuMZA98Rzn0TvDicU4s5S1exUw--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "thepasguy", "published": "2017-12-06T22:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Kuntney Kardashian.

Aim of this study was to analyze the CMG2 mRNA and protein expression in soft tissue sarcoma and their association with patient outcome. CMG2 mRNA was measured in 121 tumor samples of soft tissue sarcoma patients using quantitative real-time PCR. CMG2 protein was evaluated in 52 tumor samples by ELISA. CMG2 mRNA was significantly correlated with the corresponding CMG2 protein expression (rs = 0.31; p = 0.027). CMG2 mRNA expression was associated with the mRNA expressions of several ECM and tissue remodeling enzymes, among them CD26 and components of the uPA system. Low CMG2 mRNA expression was correlated with a worsened patients\u2019 disease-specific survival in Kaplan-Meier analyses (mean patient survival was 25 vs. 96 months; p = 0.013), especially in high-stage tumors. A decreased CMG2 expression is a negative prognostic factor for soft tissue sarcoma patients. CMG2 may be an interesting candidate gene for the further exploration of soft tissue sarcoma genesis and progression.\n\nfrom #AlexandrosSfakianakis via Alexandros G.Sfakianakis on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2kso1Ud\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandros g.sfakianakis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas greither alice wedler swetlana rot jacqueline ke\u00dfler astrid kehlen hans-j\u00fcrgen holzhausen matthias bache peter w\u00fcrl helge taubert matthias kappler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elisa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "patients  international journal of molecular sciences", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:31.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9fc594f1e683a49f7ecbcb7461dc827bda5256fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKy7BJdobROjJ1RhkIMmWcMO8xyUyOOXMOhNmlrKvPSdtuFzpCTDZ4BhkDFrviYwMdK5MjZCeIru1OuYH8reQfSDOPslsWesCOOIiR_LQTsTY7BW3A2QYMjdOx3BxoSn2sGIJQcZg9ru6Cjm.YgxjuMZRDJ0Z1akEJ0-", "site_full": "perezhilton.com", "site": "perezhilton.com", "site_section": "http://perezhilton.com/category/kuwtk/", "site_categories": ["entertainment"], "section_title": "KUWTK News and Photos | Perez Hilton", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian & Her Disick Babies Grab The Spotlight For Day SIX Of The Kardashian Christmas Card Teaser!", "title_full": "Kourtney Kardashian & Her Disick Babies Grab The Spotlight For Day SIX Of The Kardashian Christmas Card Teaser!

If you throw in a bit of porridge and Jim Broadbent then you have an enjoyable film called Get Santa .\nThe plot is delightfully playful with Santa (Jim Broadbent) crashing a new sleigh in London and ending up behind bars. This innocent old man has to survive. However help is at hand!\nRafe Spall recently released from the same prison manages to get the barber, the excellent Stephen Graham to offer help to Santa while he is inside. The results are hilarious. Meanwhile Rafe Spall and Kit Connor (his on screen son) set about trying to get everything sorted out. I\u2019ll tell you no more about the plot except to say it works well and is delight.\nWhen you have children it\u2019s hard sometimes to know whether they ought to watch such a film if they still believe in Santa. This is a safe film totally watchable from that point of view yet hugely enjoyable for adults as well. Unlike US films there is no schmaltz, no tugging at the heart strings just a very good way to spend 90 minutes.\nAt one point in the film they are at a tower in Norfolk and I couldn\u2019t help thinking about Harry Potter as what follows at the tower is a lovely moment of fun as our two heroes escaping from the chasing police end up in Lapland.\nJoanna Scanlan is hilarious as the Probation

immune-mediated and infectious diseases based on rationally defined consortium of human microbiome-derived bacteria, today announced the initiation of a Phase 1a/1b, first-in-human, clinical trial of VE303, the Company's lead, orally-administered microbiome therapeutic product candidate for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI). VE303 is the first known investigational drug consisting of a rationally-defined bacterial consortium in powder form to enter the clinic.Vedanta also today announced thatVE303 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \"The initiation of this study marks an important milestone for both Vedanta Biosciences and the microbiome field, as we've been able to advance a new class of drugs to the clinic,\" said Bernat Olle, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Vedanta Biosciences. \"First-generation approaches in the microbiome field have relied on uncharacterized fecal material or spore fractions of fecal material, which are inherently inconsistent procedures. Products with a rationally-defined composition are the next logical step in the evolution of the microbiome field. We believe VE303 is the first rationally-defined bacterial consortium in powder form to advance into the clinic in any indication, and we plan to rapidly advance two additional programs into clinical development in 2018.\" VE303 is an orally-administered investigational microbiome therapeutic consisting of live bacteria designed to restore colonization resistance against gut pathogens, including C. difficile , following recurrence. The Phase 1a/1b, dose-escalating study will assess the safety, tolerability, and colonization of VE303 in healthy volunteers, and will enroll approximately 30 subjects. The primary outcome of the study is the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of VE303, and secondary outcomes include the kinetics of intestinal colonization by the bacteria in VE303. The study is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018. Pending the results of this study, Vedanta plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial in rCDI in 2018. VE303 has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Orphan Drug Designation is a status given to drugs and biologics that are intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers C. difficile infections one of the most urgent bacterial threats. C. difficile infections account for 15,000 deaths each year in the U.S. alone. Existing interventions for C. difficile infections include antibiotics, which have the undesirable side effect of damaging the gut microbiome, leaving patients vulnerable to re-infection and building resistance to antibiotics. Microbiome-based therapies offer an alternative to antibiotics that could address both of these problems at once. VE303 is an orally-administered investigational microbiome therapeutic. It is produced from pure, clonal cell banks, which yield a standardized drug product in powder form and bypass the need to rely on direct sourcing of fecal donor material of inconsistent composition. It consists of a defined consortium of live bacteria designed to restore colonization resistance against gut pathogens, including C. difficile . VE303 was generated using Vedanta's proprietary discovery platform, which leverages what is believed to be the largest collection of human microbiome-associated bacterial strains, and is manufactured in-house at Vedanta's state-of-the-art, cGMP-compliant facilities. In November 2017, the VE303 program received a grant of up to $5.4 million from CARB-X (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator), a global public-private partnership focused on funding the development of promising new antibacterial products and rapid diagnostics. This was CARB-X's first award announced for a microbiome project and also the first for a project targeting C. difficile . About Vedanta Biosciences Biosciences is pioneering development of a new category of therapies for immune-mediated and infectious diseases based on rationally designed consortia of bacteria derived from the human microbiome. An affiliate of PureTech Health (PureTech Health plc, PRTC.L), Vedanta's founding team includes a group of world-renowned experts in immunology and microbiology. Vedanta Biosciences is a leader in the microbiome field with capabilities and deep expertise to discover, develop and manufacture drugs based on live bacterial consortia. The Company's facilities include integrated manufacturing operations providing cGMP-compliant manufacturing of rationally-designed bacterial consortia in powder form. Leveraging its proprietary technology platform and the expertise of its team of scientific co-founders, Vedanta Biosciences has isolated and maintains the largest collection of human microbiome-associated bacterial strains and has characterized, in collaborations with leading experts, how the immune system recognizes and responds to these microbes. This pioneering work has led to the identification of human commensal bacteria that induce a range of immune responses \u2013 including induction of regulatory T cells, CD8+ T cells, and Th17 cells, among others \u2013 as well as the characterization of novel molecular mechanisms of microbial-host communication. These advances have been published in leading peer-reviewed journals including Science", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bernat olle", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vedanta biosciences", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puretech health plc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vedanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antibiotic resistant bacteria biopharmaceutical accelerator", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prtc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vedanta biosciences biosciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puretech health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:31.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f204013e9a07ba675cd0586ff4edf8f22dd7c3d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6aoitnkY7ap6zywIT8tCnqsp7pdh.Teip372i.NutvQgw6ltFnCnDfaphdk3_gd.L8aNSJNWN2.pqaPfO1qjBpk3.lrtZUV113d7khsUnSVacfsld0S0e7KlJWhwZlW45rb25y2fk7Dik.VPoqati", "site_full": "www.revitforum.org", "site": "revitforum.org", "site_section": "https://www.revitforum.org/blog-feeds/", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "painting", "sports", "home_video_dvd", "tech", "adult", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "scuba_diving", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Blog Feeds", "title": "Alive in the Lab: #CSEdWeek and #HourOfCode is more than trying to code \u0096 it\u0092s about", "title_full": "Alive in the Lab: #CSEdWeek and #HourOfCode is more than trying to code \u0096 it\u0092s about", "published": "2017-12-05T23:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.341, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f204013e9a07ba675cd0586ff4edf8f22dd7c3d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6aoitnkY7ap6zywIT8tCnqsp7pdh.Teip372i.NutvQgw6ltFnCnDfaphdk3_gd.L8aNSJNWN2.pqaPfO1qjBpk3.lrtZUV113d7khsUnSVacfsld0S0e7KlJWhwZlW45rb25y2fk7Dik.VPoqati", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alive in the Lab", "published": "2017-12-05T23:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "Alive in the Lab: #CSEdWeek and #HourOfCode is more than trying to code \u0096 it\u0092s about", "text": "I majored in Computer Science at the University of Louisiana in Lafayette from 1977 to 1981.

Mediumship is said to entail mediating communication between the spirits of the dead and living human beings. There are various categories of mediumship and they include spirit channeling. However, there is also a high number of fraud cases and the practice would lose credibility and this has been going on until this day. This led to the inclusion of scientific research to validate the practice of medium. Nevertheless, mediums Dallas tx is still practiced.\n\nThe role of mediums is being intermediaries between those who live and the spirit world. They assert to listen to spirits and the ability to pass messages or communications from them and can do this by letting the spirits to have control over their body while communicating through them using drawings or by automatic writing. Spiritualists categorize mediumship into physical and mental and vary in terms of their modes of communication with the spirits as well as how to relay messages.\n\nMediumship became popular in the nineteenth century but it had begun being practiced in the early years of human history. However, the popularity of the practice also came with a rising number of trickery cases. However, different ways, for instance, mental mediumship entails communicating with the spirits by means of telepathy. The different forms of telepathy in play enabling the medium to feel, hear and see information from the spirits.\n\nPhysical mediumship is characterized by manifestations of the use of objects and noises. There is also channeling which involves psychics who speak to spirits and communicate the messages they have received. In spiritualism, psychic senses applied by mental mediums are categorized differently from other paranormal groups. A medium has psychic powers but not all psychics operate as mediums.\n\nAs earlier stated, there have been a number of causes pertaining to trickery under mediumship. This is blamed on darkness and poor lighting that ease the chances of fraud to happen. More recently, more research has been undertaken by scientists to provide evidence of the happenings after death.\n\nSome of the explanations made on whether mediums do really communicate with the spirits are made by spiritualists and scientists. According to spiritualists, mediums are able to perform their duties by help from external spiritual agents. However, psychic researchers like Thomson Jay say that all types of mediumship can be clear if we understood suggestion and telepathy but not rely on spirit hypothesis.\n\nOn the other hand, scientists who specialize in anomalistic psychology consider mediumship to result from fraud and psychological factors. This means that where there lacks evidence of fraud, and spiritualism can be understood through learning about hypnotism, suggestion, and magical thinking. For instance, in the case of trance mediumship claimed to be discarnate spirits speaking but which can be explained by Dissociative identity disorder.\n\nNonetheless, it is crucial that individuals remain cautious prior to seeking assistance from a medium.

In this review, we have described the mechanisms of \u03b3-PGA synthesis and gene regulation, its role in fermentation, and the phylogenetic relationships among various pgsBCAE, a biosynthesis gene cluster of \u03b3-PGA, and pgdS, a degradation gene of \u03b3-PGA.

"text": "The crude acetone extract (CAE) of defatted inflorescences of Tagetes patula was partitioned into five semipurified fractions: n-hexane (HF), dichloromethane (DF), ethyl acetate (EAF), n-butanol (BF), and aqueous (AQF). BF was fractionated by reversed-phase polyamide column chromatography, obtaining 34 subfractions, which were subjected to HSCCC, where patuletin and patulitrin were isolated. CAE and the fractions BF, EAF, DF, and AQF were analyzed by LC-DAD-MS, and patuletin and patulitrin were determined as the major substances in EAF and BF, respectively. BF was also analyzed by HPLC and capillary electrophoresis (CE), and patulitrin was again determined to be the main substance in this fraction. CAE and the semipurified fractions (750, 500, 300, 100, and 50\u2009mg/L) were assayed for larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti, with mortality rate expressed as percentage. All fractions except AQF showed insecticidal activity after 24\u2009h exposure of larvae to the highest concentration. However, EAF showed the highest activity with more than 50% reduction in larval population at 50\u2009mg/L. The insecticidal activity observed with EAF might have been due to the higher concentration of patuletin present in this fraction.\n\nfrom #AlexandrosSfakianakis via Alexandros G.Sfakianakis on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2AiUlAc\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandros g.sfakianakis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eaf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hplc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hsccc", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:33.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e3e3a51bd3af3faae857b443a9ba34d9adbfdd32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRLywjOOLoe1FhBTYgv4U4VDF1NWyWZ9FtXdksjHryEY0X6oQ.zUs_clp9sSbePDpljoAZSl75bZZ_19m8wlgE3", "site_full": "screenrant.com", "site": "screenrant.com", "site_section": "https://screenrant.com/", "site_categories": ["movies", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Screen Rant: Movie News, Movie Reviews, Movie Trailers, TV News", "title": "Kathleen Kennedy 'Would Love' a Taika Waititi Star Wars Film", "title_full": "Kathleen Kennedy 'Would Love' a Taika Waititi Star Wars Film", "published": "2017-12-07T02:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 20, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "https://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Star-Wars-Logo-Taika-Waititi.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2771, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e5b1bb58a344762c93d81e2f67b4e905d3bceb75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRLywjOOLoe1FhBTYgv4U4VDF1NWyWZ9FtXdksjHryEY0X6oQ.zUs_clp9sSbePDpljoAZSl75bZaixYN9G0VN2ppzbxnrbuso-", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "Kord", "published": "2017-12-07T14:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Yeah, I agree, I don't think you could or should make a Black Widow movie comedic, it would need to follow the tone set in Winter Soldier.

An insurance contract must have a policyholder who should enter into a contract with the insurance company [but this did not happen].\u201d \n\u201cWhere is the insurance policy? Where is the contract?\u201d he questioned. Some National Service personnel have been up in arms over the compulsory insurance policy, which they say has been imposed on them by the National Service Scheme headed by Ussif Mustapha. \nThe personnel argued that, the decision to have the insurance program, was not made by them, neither were they consulted before its implementation, hence deductions must not be made from their meager allowances compulsorily. \nNSS personnel petition CHRAJ over compulsory insurance \nSome National Service Personnel earlier this week petitioned the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ), over the mandatory insurance package introduced for them by the National Service Secretariat. \nAccording to them, the imposition of the insurance package infringes on their basic human rights since the decisions taken by the National Service Personnel Association (NASPA), does not bind all service personnel. \nService personnel agreed to \u2018compulsory\u2019 insurance \u2013 NSS Boss \nThe National Service Scheme\u2019s head, Mustapha Ussif, has denied suggestions that the compulsory insurance package meant for all service personnel in the country is being imposed on the personnel. \nHe insisted that the personnel backed the insurance package, and even pushed the management of the Scheme to implement it. He said the National Service Personnel Association of Ghana (NASPA), the group which represents service personnel across the country, decided unanimously at their Congress to back the policy. \nThe insurance package \nThe NSS partnered with MTN and Glico Life Insurance, earlier this week, to launch the life insurance cover for the over 90,000 personnel. This compulsory insurance package spearheaded by various insurance companies is expected to pay claims to service personnel who get involved in accidents in their line of duty. \nThe claims vary from GHc 15,000 in cases of death or incapacitation and GHS3,000 for cases of disability. As part of the insurance package, National Service personnel are entitled to a GHc 500 loan which is payable within six months. \nNSS insurance meant to reward NPP financier \u2013 Kpessah Whyte \nA former Executive Director of the National Service Scheme (NSS), Dr. Michael Kpessah-Whyte, had alleged that the compulsory insurance package is a venture to pay back a financier of the governing New Patriotic Party\u2019s (NPP) election campaign. \nAccording to him, the insurance scheme may have been put together to reward the owner of a known insurance company, who supported the NPP\u2019s campaign with GH\u00a21 million. \nHe is thus of the view that the policy is not in the interest of National Service persons, and that it constitutes \u201cdaylight robbery.\u201d \nNSS insurance scheme not a reward from NPP \u2013 GLICO \nHowever, GLICO Life has denied allegations that its engagement with the NSS to provide an insurance package for National Service personnel, is a reward for the company because the owner was a financier of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP). \nThe Managing Director of GLICO Life, Forkuo Kyei, in a statement to citifmonline.com, said the allegations are unfounded as GLICO Life is part of five other companies offering the insurance package to the service personnel.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mustap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kpessah whyte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ussif mustapha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael kpessah-whyte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forkuo kyei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "godwin edudzi tamakloe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mustapha ussif", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national service secretariat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national service personnel association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chraj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new patriotic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mtn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national service scheme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national service personnel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission on human rights and administrative justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glico life insurance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "npp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "citi news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naspa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national service personnel association of ghana", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:33.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "38fb4542bb029c3ed2cb2f2b52a571db9c8e0955", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG28R0Zu2Qk2pYKvGQz1QztDTIqr6UEUyYLJSd0INzAI_9MQX0bARFU8Uyn0t9XzKO07.zIO2WB0IeVemRhri3eew--", "site_full": "www.mumsnet.com", "site": "mumsnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/style_and_beauty", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Style and beauty | Mumsnet Discussion ", "title": "Make up brand for young teen?", "title_full": "Make up brand for young teen? | Mumsnet Discussion", "published": "2017-12-07T07:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.017, "main_image": "/images/logo/mn-logo-square.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6762, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f1d5d0cce1e927c42cad9660617a42bd5c4287b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG28R0Zu2Qk2pYKvGQz1QztDTIqr6UEUyYLJSd0INzAI_9MQX0bARFU8Uyn0t9XzKO07.zIO2WB0Ici4LscoYQ2sCL8uPQ3rKoa", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "M5tothesouthwest", "published": "2017-12-07T16:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "All the young teens I know (14 ish) use more expensive brands than I do!
