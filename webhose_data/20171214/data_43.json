The boys are doing well defensive wise and in midfield but we need some pace out wide and up front, maybe even a No.10.\"\nBaccus, who has cemented his spot as a consistent midfield performer, reiterated Gombau's message that change will take time.\n\"It's gone from one extreme to another,\" he said.\n\"With Popa we had six at the back, with Josep we have four plus one.\n\"But we had a lot of outs with Popa, so could play a lot of long balls ... Josep wants us to keep it on deck, keep possession and play out from the back and make it exciting for people to watch.\"\nDespite poor recent results - the Wanderers have not won a game since the opening round - Baccus assured there'd been no loss of faith before hosting Sydney FC at ANZ Stadium.\nThe quietly spoken 26-year-old took heart from the last two displays against the champions - last season's 1-0 win and October's 2-2 fightback.\n\"Our confidence hasn't really been dampened, whether we've lost these last two games,\" Baccus said.\n\"It just comes down to us boys believing what we're going to be doing under Josep and taking one game at a time.\n\"People are putting too much pressure on the team even though there's another 20 games left.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://resource2.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/site-resource/assets/loading.gif\\", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=%2Fen%2Fgombau%2Dset%2Dto%2Dshop%2Dfor%2Dattackers%2Dbaccus%2Dstory%2D429367&send=false&layout=standard&width=450&show_faces=true&font=lucida+grande&colorscheme=light&action=like&height=80"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "baccus kearyn baccus", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gombau", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "baccus gombau", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tony popovic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kearyn baccus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "popa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baccus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josep gombau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josep", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sydney fc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "anz stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:30.053+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "542c85115a3fc803b8f9eb7c3948a3cf79453e21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg81TOwC7ayRWWm6woL1kELiTVR64YWx8n2YBn6YULm3dDcPZ4EGyduhx7qnxip606J2LL6sSPm_pGO8PcvhAGPWS54T9hVImswgsML6vJdUg40X0CFGFrptPDBym1VE3IC_YcEmVq2bC1DvMUvSDXsVBkaCnwjQn6KFt.pd9lHt7U3Vu6Cvq_UVMjyd4ISvwx8-", "site_full": "www.newsbug.info", "site": "newsbug.info", "site_section": "http://www.newsbug.info/search/?q=&t=article&l=100&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&nsa=eedition&c[]=news/national/indiana,news/national/indiana/*&f=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "www.newsbug.info - RSS Results in news/national/indiana,news/national/indiana/* of type article", "title": "Winning numbers drawn in 'Quick Draw Evening' game", "title_full": "Winning numbers drawn in 'Quick Draw Evening' game", "published": "2017-12-06T06:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/newsbug.info/content/tncms/custom/image/70b23e4a-4a9f-11e6-b38d-ab22b39bbc4f.png?_dc=1468595933", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "542c85115a3fc803b8f9eb7c3948a3cf79453e21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg81TOwC7ayRWWm6woL1kELiTVR64YWx8n2YBn6YULm3dDcPZ4EGyduhx7qnxip606J2LL6sSPm_pGO8PcvhAGPWS54T9hVImswgsML6vJdUg40X0CFGFrptPDBym1VE3IC_YcEmVq2bC1DvMUvSDXsVBkaCnwjQn6KFt.pd9lHt7U3Vu6Cvq_UVMjyd4ISvwx8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Associated Press", "published": "2017-12-06T06:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "Winning numbers drawn in 'Quick Draw Evening' game", "text": "Winning numbers drawn in 'Quick Draw Evening' game By The Associated Press \nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The winning numbers in Tuesday evening's drawing of the Indiana Lottery's \"Quick Draw Evening\" game were: \n10-14-15-16-18-21-26-28-33-34-38-43-45-48-49-51-55-66-69-72, BE: 16 \n(ten, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty-one, twenty-six, twenty-eight, thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-eight, forty-three, forty-five, forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty-one, fifty-five, sixty-six, sixty-nine, seventy-two; BE: sixteen) \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The result sent shock ways throughout the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. \nIn us estimated that has lost close to a R100 billion as a result of the resignation and possible fraud allegations. \nIn a personalised letter first seen on Fin24 Jooste said he was sorry for the bad publicity he has created over the last couple of months. \nGerman business magazine Manager-Magazin in Agust reported that Jooste was being investigated by German authorities. \nRead Also: Dark days as Steinhoff loses R100 billion \nHe is one of four executives that may be involved in accounting fraud from 2015. \nSteinhoff\u2019s share price closed at R45.65 on the JSE on Tuesday and hit a low of R13.50 yesterday before closing 61.42% down at R17.61. \nJooste goes onto say: \"Now I have caused the company further damage by not being able to finalise the year-end audited numbers and I made some big mistakes and have now caused financial loss to many innocent people.\u201d \n\"It is time for me to move on and take the consequences of my behaviour like a man. Sorry that I have disappointed all of you and I never meant to cause any of you any harm.\" \nSteinhoff\u2019s supervisory board has now appointed its chairperson, Christo Wiese, as interim executive chairperson. \nPieter Erasmus, the previous chief executive of Pepkor Group, has agreed to join Wiese in an executive advisory capacity to assist with managing the group's various retail interests around the world.

December 7, 2017 Facebook Photo Illustration by Andreas Rentz/Getty Images Before I started writing this article, I didn\u2019t spend much time thinking about water. I knew that drinking water is a Good Thing , and drinking activated charcoal water can be a Bad Thing . But if you asked me the difference is between mineral water and regular water? I had no clue. It\u2019s pretty obvious that mineral water is, well, water with minerals , but what minerals? Doesn\u2019t all water have minerals? I wanted a concrete definition\u2014I\u2019m talking Scripps National Spelling Bee level, people. It turns out, some people do know what mineral water is. Those people are the FDA, which actually regulates bottled water . They say that natural mineral waters must contain at least 250 parts per million (ppm) \u201ctotal dissolved solids,\u201d originating from \u201ca geologically and physically protected underground water source.\u201d In other words, mineral waters have to come out of the earth that way. Mineral water commonly contains substances like magnesium, calcium, sodium, and zinc, and, according to recent research, they\u2019re actually a pretty effective way to boost your mineral intake. A recent study found that mineral water has some legitimate health benefits. At its core, mineral water provides minerals the human body can\u2019t create itself. While you don\u2019t need to drink Fiji Water to get your magnesium RDA, those pricey bottles are a legitimate method of consumption. \"Depending on the source, certain mineral waters are a good source of calcium, which is important for bone health,\" says Mia Syn , MS, RDN of Nutrition by Mia . \"The recent study showed that the bioavailability of calcium in mineral waters was comparable or possibly better than that of dairy products, meaning our body can readily absorb and utilize it.\" In addition to promoting healthy bone development, the study also notes \u201csignificant benefits for healthy digestion\u201d thanks to magnesium sulphate, sodium sulphate, bicarbonate, and chloride. However, Syn cautions that mineral waters should still be carefully considered, just like any other supplement. \"Some mineral waters are high in sodium, which should be minimized in individuals with high blood pressure,\" she says. \"If you are drinking sparkling mineral water, it is important to ensure you stay hydrated in other ways if needed, since the carbonation can be filling and may potentially lower your overall intake.\" The researchers found one more benefit of mineral water: It\u2019s delicious. And, as Americans reduce their soda consumption , many people are turning to mineral water (and yes, LaCroix ) as a healthful alternative. So, while nobody should feel obligated to start buying mineral water by the caseload, this is one product that\u2019s true to its name.

Now seems as good of a time as any. Something I hear ALL the time from people from all walks of life is that there is no good music being made any more. All of the good artists are now a thing of the past and there is no one to step up to the plate to carry on the torch. Everything sucks and nothing makes sense any more. The future of music is doomed.\n\nThis is something I most frequently hear from fans of classic rock and metal, but not exclusively. Many people my own age who are into pop, rap, or whatever else feel that there has been nothing good since the 90's or early 2000's. This has brought up some points in my mind that I would like to go over.\n\nBefore I go on, I'd like to pose the following question:\n\nIs there really no good new music any more or do you just not like anything that came out after you graduated high school because what is in the mainstream now isn't being marketed toward you any more? \n\nLet's face it. The youth are the most loyal, avid, and profitable consumers of new media, be it music, film, TV, video games, the internet, or anything else. Why would the big fat cat record labels focus their time, effort, and money on an older demographic when the teens and people in their early 20's are the more profitable one? The whole point of the music industry is to make money. What demographic brings in the most cash? The younger folks.\n\nWhat also helps the record labels is that young people will also do a lot of the advertising of an artist for free. They will plaster the music, imagery, websites, social media, etc. of an artist all over their own social media accounts. They will talk about them online, spread the word, and create further awareness of the brand. That is something not a whole lot of people in older demographics do.\n\nIt kind of sucks when you get to a point in your life when you realize you're not the target audience for the popular new stuff any more. That said, if you're one of the people feeling there is no good music any more you're not the first generation to feel like this. The generation before felt the same way about the music you liked as a kid and currently like. It made no sense to them and they felt that there wasn't any good new music any more. They felt like the world of music was going to Hell in a hand basket and that their generation of music was the last of the good stuff. They too went through the same thing where they stopped being the demographic being marketed to.\n\nHowever, just because you are no longer part of the key demographic any more that doesn't mean your musical journey has to come to an end. Although what constitutes as good music is entirely subjective, if you don't like what is being pushed by the mainstream media there are other options for you. We live in an age where we have access to countless hours of music of all kinds with just the click of a mouse or more commonly these days the tap of a phone screen. If you're willing to dive down the rabbit hole and explore, you might just find something you absolutely love and never would have known about before had you not taken the journey.\n\nThere are SO many artists that don't get attention from the mainstream media that are still making rock n' roll, metal, other pre-existing genres, or even doing things that are entirely new and experimental. Just because you don't see them at first on the surface, it doesn't mean they aren't there.\n\nIn order to find them, you have a myriad options. You could go on Pandora where right away you can have a FREE online radio station catered to your tastes. You can put in a genre or artist you like and within 10 or 20 minutes there is a good chance you will have heard something amazing by someone you had never heard of before.\n\nWhat I used to do as a teenager to find new music (and still some times do to this day) is deep dive through YouTube. I would look up a song by an artist I like. Then maybe I would see a link to another video with that band collaborating with another artist. I would then look into the collaborating artist and see what they have and then go from there. There are all kinds of ways I to go about this, but this method brought my attention to so many of the bands I know and love to today.\n\nSpotify is also a good way to discover new stuff as well. This is also free unless you decide to go premium. You can put on some of their pre-made playlists for different genres and a song will come up by an artist you haven't heard yet. I can guarantee there will be songs you haven't heard before and that you might just find a new artist to look into.\n\nThese are just some of the ways in which you can discover music that is being made in this modern era right now. It's ok to have specific tastes in music. You are entitled to like what you like. However, don't be so quick to say that there is no good music being made any more when you haven't really taken the time to go out and look for it. Don't be the type of person who stops listening to anything new once they get out of high school.

Having auto insurance protects you and helps offset costs, should you be in a car accident. Use the following tips to pick the right auto insurance company to fit you or your teen driver\u2019s needs.\nThe year and options on your vehicle will play a large roll in how much your insurance premium is. Having a newer car with lots of safety features can save you some, but if you have it financed you will also have to pay more for full coverage.\nTo make sure your insurance covers you like it should, make sure you know how to file a claim and keep the paper work related to your insurance policy handy. When something happens, do not wait to file a claim. Contact your insurance right away so that they can help you out quickly.\nOne way you can save on car insurance is to keep a clean driving record so you can take advantage of the discounts offered to safe drivers. Minor infractions won\u2019t amount to much but being involved in traffic accidents can drive up your insurance costs tremendously. So, drive consciously, maintain a good driving record and enjoy the reward of lower premiums.\nSaving money on auto insurance does not have to be a difficult thing, especially if you are loyal to the same company. Most policies are only for a term of around a year, so make sure you re-up with the same company. If you show loyalty to the insurer, you will be rewarded with lower monthly premium payments.\n\nWhen choosing an auto insurance policy, look into the quality of the company. The company that holds your policy should be able to back it up. It is good to know if the company that holds your policy will be around to take care of any claims you may have.\nDo not bother insuring an older car with collision coverage. Your insurance provider will only give you the book value on your car. Chances are that an older vehicle might not be worth much, thus rendering the collision coverage pretty useless. Check the book value on the car before continuing with collision coverage.\nIt is essential to understand what exactly you are covered for. One of the most complete types of insurance is called comprehensive. Comprehensive is considerably more expensive, but covers you even in strange situations like fires, floods and vandalism. Most of the time you will not need this, but in some situations, it can be a lifesaver.\nDo not settle for the first auto insurance company that you find. You may be missing out on special discounts or rewards. For instance, some insurance companies offer discounted premiums for accident-free drivers, or for people of certain professions. Some even give discounts to college students who maintain good grades.\nWhen looking into auto insurance, especially, if you are looking to save money, you should check to see if your prospective insurance carrier offers multiple-policy discounts. For go to this website , if you have health insurance with a company, see if they offer auto insurance as well and if it is offered with a discount. Sometimes, this discount can be 10 percent or more.\nAlways consider the costs of insurance before purchasing a car. Keep in mind that cars with better safety features get lower premiums. Many sports cars are not favored by insurance companies. Remember to include this expense when buying a new car.\nAlthough, it can be good to have all your insurance in one place, you don\u2019t have to be slavishly loyal to your insurance agent. If you can get a better deal on car insurance from a company other than the one that carries your homeowners policy, by all means, change companies!\nIf your car is more than 10 years old, you might want to consider dropping the comprehensive portion of your auto insurance. You may be paying more for that portion then your older car is worth. Instead, save the extra money and use it when the time comes to buy a new automobile.\nIf you want to get affordable rates on auto insurance one of the best things that you can do is to buy insurance from the internet. http://markets.financialcontent.com/townhall/news/read/35356354 is because most companies offer reduced rates for online applications because the process is automated. You can get reductions that range from 5 to 10 percent.\nAre you looking for the most economical auto insurance coverage you can find? You must be certain to include all of the discounts when shopping for a auto insurance policy. For http://markets.pettinga.com/pettinga/news/read/35356354 , do you qualify for the safe driver discount? Does the company offer a discount for your vehicle\u2019s safety equipment? Are you over 55? Be sure to include all of the discounts you qualify for and you will see a big difference in the cost of your insurance.\nIf you are currently paying for comprehensive auto coverage, you may be able to drop it entirely to save additional money on your bill. This type of coverage includes non-accidental damages to the vehicle, such as flood damage or theft. If your vehicle has a very low book value, it is not likely to be stolen.\nMake sure you know what kind of coverage you have in your policy. Be aware of what your auto insurance is actually insuring. Many things affect the final cost of the policy. There is bodily injury liability, property damage liability, medical payments, uninsured motorist protection, collision coverage, and comprehensive coverage.\nEven though auto insurance is something that\u2019s required by law for you have, make sure that you sign with a company that\u2019s right for you. You can choose who you sign with and what coverage you may need. Apply the tips above for a foolproof way to obtain the right auto insurance for you.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:32.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66d743115e68de1dfbe4d249e0b9097bcef4bd83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOp64.He7wZ0BVrvk8E5k01hwNqDyl4hNKPL9sCYJcDa.5vTxue91ppCcYLE1X5Yj2yDhf5RaY8LICSGR1.nLPBF79g.5lNGzQjEV7KGNLZ0luPLASJk.cA1", "site_full": "supertricolorpostagens.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://supertricolorpostagens.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Minhas Postagens Legais", "title": "MULHER ANDANDO NA RUA \u00c9 EMPURRADA POR UM FANTASMA INVIS\u00cdVEL", "title_full": "MULHER ANDANDO NA RUA \u00c9 EMPURRADA POR UM FANTASMA INVIS\u00cdVEL", "published": "2017-12-07T11:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "BR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66d743115e68de1dfbe4d249e0b9097bcef4bd83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOp64.He7wZ0BVrvk8E5k01hwNqDyl4hNKPL9sCYJcDa.5vTxue91ppCcYLE1X5Yj2yDhf5RaY8LICSGR1.nLPBF79g.5lNGzQjEV7KGNLZ0luPLASJk.cA1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Denilson Marcos da Silva (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "MULHER ANDANDO NA RUA \u00c9 EMPURRADA POR UM FANTASMA INVIS\u00cdVEL", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:32.035+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3c4769b6b340729044fa6c3087dc361f3bd6536e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzrP9xcgD9cCFUwu64BqEHuGeDCdaz_39fEz642pAW51IGTL.KHhJ.HZ", "site_full": "www.booking.com", "site": "booking.com", "site_section": "https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/gianni-franzi.en-gb.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hotel Gianni Franzi, Vernazza, Italy - Booking.com ", "title": "346 Verified Hotel Reviews of Hotel Gianni Franzi | Booking.com", "title_full": "346 Verified Hotel Reviews of Hotel Gianni Franzi | Booking.com", "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 45, "participants_count": 35, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://t-ec.bstatic.com/static/img/facebook-image-else/566c7081f1deeaca39957e96365c3908f83b95af.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 105, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f04087bfe634c12a29fcb350e3e031649159be1a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzrP9xcgD9cCFUwu64BqEHuGeDCdaz_39fEz642pAW51IBPnOuQ2eMmMsqSqRk3wWRNsO.cPIxaktciUm21yOJ3UYPnJnmcP1EE-", "ord_in_thread": 45, "author": "Lee", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\"Quaint city.

Enjoy this errand and make it part of your identity. This is part of your job now. So\u2026 what would my wife do in this situation to make it more fun?\u201d \nAnd there it was, Starbucks. She would definitely buy a $5 coffee to begin her journey. So I ordered an Eggnog Latte with coconut milk, as my daughter played inside the two-seater Kozy Coupe-looking car attached to the front of the shopping cart. \nI tried to order the manliest drink I could think of, but unfortunately, they don\u2019t make the Spicy Mocha that High Brew in Franklin makes: cayenne, cinnamon, and mocha. \nOnce the nice young man handed me my unregulated caffeinated beverage, I made my way towards to organic section. But immediately, I found out it\u2019s quite difficult to make a right turn when your right-handed and are pushing a shopping cart with a giant car attached to the front of it, still while holding a $5 drink in your other hand. \nHow was I going to make it all the way through a ten acre grocery store without spilling my coffee? \nThe answer: I wasn\u2019t. \nHistorically, I have stayed home with the kids while my wife buys the groceries early on Saturday morning. I have yet to memorize where everything is in that grocery store so big it needs its own zip code. \nSome of the items on the \u201cscavenger hunt\u201d were in the baby section, some were in the organic section, and some were just mixed in with the regular stuff. \nIn case my Instagram photo doesn\u2019t show the details, then just believe me: \nEach time I suddenly had to jerk the cart to make a turn in time, or simply bumped into the corner of the aisle I was trying to enter, an eager ounce of the Starbucks magnificently shot out of the adult sippy lid of my coffee cup and landed in the cart. \nNeedless to say, my daughter\u2019s clothes still smell of Eggnog Latte, as she had eventually exited the faux Kozy Coupe and asked me to place her in the normal kids\u2019 seat; right where the majority of the two dollars\u2019 worth of Starbucks had made a miniature puddle. \nI know there will be a learning curve to this stay-at-home dad thing, but today I learned that I shouldn\u2019t be drinking Starbucks and driving the grocery cart.

Under the package, INR 2,000 crore has been earmarked which will be spent over a period of five years beginning 2016 with INR 400 crore to be released by the Centre each year, he confirmed. The key projects taken up under the PMDP include the development of tourism facilities on the Mantalai Sudhmahadev-Patnitop, Gulmarg-Baramulla- Kupwara-Leh, Jammu- Rajouri-Shopian- Pulwama, Anantnag-Pahalgam- Daksum-Ranjit Sagar circuits, being executed by NBCC and NPCC. The projects to be taken up under PMDP include providing infrastructure to 12 tourism development authorities, creating three tourism circuits, setting up 50 proposed tourist villages and conservation of the Wullar Lake, the official said. In another initiative, J&K Tourism is developing a new comprehensive website \u2013 www.jktourism.jk.gov.in and plans to launch it soon.

Afraid to put himself out there, he considers himself a loser, as do all his peers. One day, after having finally had enough, he decides to declare his flame to the beautiful Darcy Silverman, the newspaper\u2019s travel editor and one of Gulliver\u2019s only friends. Darcy accepts and sends him on an assignment to the Bermuda Triangle. There, Gulliver becomes shipwrecked and ends up on the island of Liliput, where he is twelve taller than the tallest man. \nSaturday, December 9 \nMarley & Me \nAfter their wedding, newspaper writers John and Jennifer Grogan move to Florida and he gives her a puppy. While the puppy Marley grows into a 100-pound dog, he loses none of his puppy energy or rambunctiousness. Marley\u2019s antics give John rich material for his newspaper column. As the Grogans mature and have children of their own, Marley continues to test everyone\u2019s patience by acting like the world\u2019s most impulsive dog. \nWith limited seating available, head to Dubai Marina Mall promenade ahead of the 5:30pm screenings to nab the best position!
