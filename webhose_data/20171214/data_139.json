The right aerodynamics will determine the quality of the end freezing result, the dehydration rate of the product and of course the overall energy efficiency of the freezer. \nThe OctoFrost\u2122 IQF tunnel freezer does a great job at joggling all of this by using a complex equation of the right pressure, air velocity, temperature, design of the freezer and fans. The size of the OctoFrost\u2122 IQF freezer, the smaller than any other freezer on the market with the same capacity, is possible only because of the effective aerodynamics. \nDesign of the fans \nIn general, an IQF tunnel freezer runs the fans at full capacity in order to achieve a good freezing result, but this means high energy consumption and unnecessary overblow of the product. The OctoFrost\u2122 uses vane axial fans instead, which can run at different speeds \u2013 a highly important feature for food processors because they can adjust the fans speed according to the product they are freezing. This way the OctoFrost\u2122 doesn\u2019t need to run more than 75% \u2013 85% fan speed. Also, the design of the OctoFrost\u2122 fans is custom-made for the OctoFrost\u2122 IQF freezer with 5 major parts leading to better air control and energy efficiency. \nBedplates \nTraditional IQF freezers will use a conveyor belt, but the design of the belt will bring a minus in terms of energy efficiency for the tunnel. The main reason why the OctoFrost\u2122 fans don\u2019t need to run over 75% \u2013 85% is the OctoFrost\u2122 bedplates. The configuration of the holes\u2019 and the thickness of the plates, make it possible for the bedplates to achieve the desired fluidization type which will mean less energy consumption with improved freezing result. \nCoil design \nThe size of the coil inside the freezer is very important in order to handle the heat transfer. OctoFrost\u2122 freezer\u2019s coil is oversized so it can allow the fans to run at lower speeds while the large front area will increase the time between defrost. \nHousing and floor heating \nTraditional IQF freezers need floor heating against the high temperatures, because otherwise the floor underneath the freezer will freeze, create cracks and eventually destroy the equipment. Heating the floor is the solution for traditional IQF freezers in order to avoid the risk of the floor freezing but it is also one of the highest expenses for IQF processors in terms of energy efficiency. \nThe OctoFrost\u2122 IQF tunnel freezer doesn\u2019t require floor heating because the body of the freezer stands on its own supporting feet and the air can circulate under the freezer to avoid accumulation of cold in the floor. In addition, the walls of the freezer are insulated really well. \nThe energy cost for IQF equipment is very important to look at when deciding for the right IQF tunnel freezer for a production line.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "iqf freezers home news energy efficiency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "energy efficiency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iqf freezers energy efficiency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:42.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cae5c3b0775a9884909c30bc001b273cd1b74f51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UcSKjjIjFY1.pRu6MDrSg.7CEJiSQT59KDXA9qMpcX375FP4FLFekb3a3njBhxJ4TtgevPJLkMQEw--", "site_full": "diamond-cat.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://diamond-cat.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Diamond's blog: by Sasha", "title": "I rang the bell", "title_full": "I rang the bell", "published": "2017-12-06T04:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d3beca81a6aa872a26db01a1307f2e624b87465", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UcSKjjIjFY1.pRu6MDrSg.7CEJiSQT59KDXA9qMpcX375FP4FLFekb3a3njBhxJ4TtmI_gHRX.hVA--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Summer at sparklecat.com", "published": "2017-12-07T07:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Rumor has it that many, many years ago, the humans fostered a cat for about a month that thought those stuffies were PREY, and she would drag them all over the house like she had killed them.

The next few weeks will be crucial, as Noble looks to push its debt restructuring through. \nOne focus is Dec. 20. Lenders had agreed to waive certain rights under terms Noble committed to for its $1.1 billion revolving credit facility until that day. That means the company may need to reach a deal with creditors by then to avoid a default, or seek another extension. \nThe company met with creditors in Hong Kong on Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. The meeting follows talks that started two weeks ago in London and continued last week in Hong Kong, and was to allow creditors to do further due diligence on the sustainability of the company\u2019s operations, one of the people said. \n\u201cIf Noble\u2019s revolving credit facility lenders don\u2019t extend the covenant waiver, it will be a technical default on the facility,\u201d said Annisa Lee, head of Asia ex-Japan flow credit analysis at Nomura International (HK) Ltd. \u201cThat could trigger a cross default on the bonds. If that happens, Noble faces the possibility of going into liquidation, or a debt restructuring, depending on what creditors decide.\u201d \nNoble\u2019s external media representative couldn\u2019t be immediately reached for comment. \nHere are the deadlines to watch in coming months: \nDec. 15: Shareholder meeting \nNoble agreed to sell most of its oil business to Vitol Group in October and will be holding a meeting in Singapore for shareholders to vote on the sale. \nDec. 20: Waiver expires \nA covenant waiver on Noble\u2019s $1.1 billion revolving credit facility expires. Noble\u2019s unsecured lenders, which are ranked the same as its unsecured bondholders, have extended the waiver before, but lenders could use it as a bargaining chip to improve their position. \nDec. 24: Perpetual coupon \nA coupon payment is due for Noble\u2019s $400 million perpetual securities, which have collapsed 46 cents in the past year to 8.5 cents on Thursday, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. Noble has already deferred payment on the notes once. \nJan. 29: Interest payment \nNoble must pay about $39.7 million of interest on its $1.18 billion bonds maturing 2020, according to Bloomberg calculations. Those notes have fallen 42.4 cents to 40.1 cents on the dollar in the past year. \nMarch 20: Bond maturity \nThis is Noble\u2019s first significant bond maturity in 2018. It must pay $379 million of securities on this day. The notes have slumped 42 cents in the past year to 49.9 cents on the dollar Thursday. \nMay 18: Credit facility matures \nNoble faces its second significant debt maturity for 2018, when its revolving credit facility matures.
