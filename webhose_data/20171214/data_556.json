Baik Kemendag maupun Kadin juga sepakat untuk pengurusan administrasi perdagangan oleh pengusaha dalam satu pintu. \nPenandatanganan tersebut dilakukan oleh Ketua Umum Kadin Indonesia, Roeslan P. Roeslani dan Sekretaris Jenderal Kementerian Perdagangan Kariyanto Supri. Perjanjian tersebut juga diketahui serta ditandatangani oleh Kemendag, Enggartiasto Lukita. \nKetua Umum Kadin Indonesia Roesan P. Roeslani mengatakan kesepakatan ini sangat bersejarah bagi Kadin Indonesia dan seluruh kabupaten kota. Hal ini dianggap bukan hanya kesepakatan tapi menjadi lompatan besar bagi antar kedua institusi tersebut. \n\"Seluruh perusahaan harus menjadi anggota Kadin dan Alhamdulilah hari ini kita implementasikan ini dengan Departemen Perdagangan,\" kata Roesan usai penandatangan tersebut di Jakarta, Kamis (7/12/2017). \nKesepakatan ini akan membuat sistem informasi di Kadin dalam bentuk online.

The Republican-led House passed a bill to make it easier for gun owners to legally carry concealed weapons across state lines. J. Scott Applewhite / AP \nThe House approved a bill on Wednesday that would ease legal restrictions for carrying concealed firearms across state lines \u2013 a move pushed by the National Rifle Association that comes just weeks after mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas. \nOn a mostly party-line vote, the measure easily passed, 231-198, although 14 Republicans voted no. Six Democrats voted for the so-called reciprocity measure, which would allow a gun owner with the proper permit in any state to carry a concealed firearm to another state where it is also legal. \nThe bill now goes to the Senate, where it is likely to encounter a much tougher battle. \nIn the House version, GOP lawmakers added a measure aimed at strengthening tracking in the national background-check database of legal and mental health records that might prevent some gun purchases. Just last month it was revealed that Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., legally purchase firearms used in the attack despite a record of domestic assault in the Air Force that should have disqualified him. \nHowever, as The New York Times reports: \"... the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions.\" \nThe bill angered many Democrats who argued that following mass shootings that have killed 80 people, the times called for stricter, not looser gun measures. \nConnecticut Democrat Rep. Elizabeth Esty \u2014 who represents Newtown, Conn., where 20 first-graders and six teachers and staff were killed in a 2012 mass shooting \u2013 said the bill would undermine states' rights, \"hamstring law enforcement and allow dangerous criminals to walk around with hidden guns anywhere and at any time. It's unspeakable that this is Congress' response to the worst gun tragedies in American history,\" according to The Associated Press. \nThe NRA's executive director, Chris Cox, is quoted in the Times as saying Thursday's vote is a \"watershed\" for Second Amendment rights and that the bill would ensure \"all law-abiding citizens in our great country can protect themselves in the manner they see fit without accidentally running afoul of the law.\" \nIn the Senate, supporters would likely need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster by Democrats.

Physicists propose a new method for monitoring nuclear waste Scenarios for using neutrino detectors in nuclear interim storage facilities 07-Dec-2017 Virginia Tech, Center for Neutrino Physics \nA prototype antineutrino detector for monitoring nuclear waste repository sites Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Energy \nDecontamination of a disused nuclear complex in the U. S. state of Washington. Such measures could be supported by employing antineutrino detectors. \nNew scientific findings suggest neutrino detectors may play an important role in ensuring better monitoring and safer storage of radioactive material in nuclear waste repository sites. Researchers at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU) in Germany have made calculations to ascertain the neutrino radiation of spent nuclear fuel emits. Their figures show that neutrino detectors could be useful in certain scenarios. Neutrinos undergo almost no interaction with matter, and so they can penetrate practically unhindered through the Earth and any man-made shield. \"Every second about 100 billion neutrinos per square centimeter strike the Earth from the Sun, both day and night. Because neutrinos only weakly interact with matter, they are among the most difficult elementary particles to detect,\" explained Professor Joachim Kopp from the PRISMA Cluster of Excellence at Mainz University. Kopp is an expert in the field of theoretical neutrino physics and received an ERC Starting Grant for his research in 2014, one of the most highly endowed awards from the EU. The beta decay of radioactive fission products generates neutrinos in very large quantities. However, a minimum energy of 1.8 mega-electron volts is required to detect these particles via the process of inverse beta decay. Only then can they be registered in a scintillation detector, a tank filled with special mineral oils. The high-energy particles interact with the protons in the tank, emitting a characteristic light signal. Such neutrino detectors are already being employed experimentally to monitor nuclear power plants while in operation. However, for monitoring stored nuclear waste there are, as yet, no detectors. \"In-service reactors produce considerably more neutrinos than decommissioned reactors or stored radioactive material,\" explained Kopp, noting that monitoring the whereabouts of nuclear waste is particularly important at present for security reasons. Neutrino monitoring of spent nuclear fuel \nJoachim Kopp and Vedran Brdar from JGU and Patrick Huber from Virginia Tech in the U. S. first calculated the neutrino flux emitted by radioactive strontium-90 and other fission products in spent nuclear fuel. They then considered several scenarios detailing how or where the emissions could be detected. In one of these, a suitable detector would be particularly useful for monitoring above-ground storage facilities, for example, on-site at nuclear power plants. A neutrino detector in this scenario could detect if radioactive material had been removed without being documented. According to the calculations, measurements using a detector with a capacity of 40 tons would have to run for about a year. \"That sounds like a long time, but all that would be required would be to position the detector and wait. The big advantage is that we could verify the contents of a container without ever having to open it up,\" explained Kopp. It would usually be enough to place the detector 10 to 100 meters away, for example, on a truck trailer. According to Kopp, this method might be particularly appropriate in trying to ensure non-proliferation of nuclear weapons-grade material, which is why the European Atomic Energy Community EURATOM has already expressed an interest in this research. In a second scenario, the physicists calculated a situation in which underground repositories are to be monitored, giving as an example the proposed Yucca Mountain repository site in Nevada. According to this, a significant neutrino flux would be detected, even on the surface of a small 10-ton tank. \"However, some realistic hazards, such as the escape of very small quantities of radioactive material, would unfortunately not be detected,\" said Kopp. A third scenario that the scientists dealt with in their calculations was detecting incompletely documented storage facilities, such as those at the Hanford Site, a now-disused nuclear complex in the U.

First off\u2026 \nOk, don\u2019t judge me! I didn\u2019t play a lot of \u2018retro games\u2019 back in my day and the ones I did play were more or less\u2026 Just \u2018ok\u2019 at best. But there are one or two out there who I did spend a number of hours on and I did really enjoy them! So when GBA Advance hit the market, I happily trotted my way down to the nearest electronic store and got myself a console and a random game cartridge. And what game did I end up playing? \nMonster House, based on the movie. Yes, some of you might have watched the movie. First off, I do notice that the game isn\u2019t that old. But seriously, I didn\u2019t play many games back in my time and I found this one to be the most enjoyable one. Forgive me for the lack of images but it was quite an obstacle to take screenshots of a GBA game. \nLong story short, the game basically revolves around these 3 kids who ventured into a monstrous house (hence the game\u2019s title) to kill it.Halloween\u2019s right around the corner and this \u2018monster house\u2019 would gobble up the trick-or-treaters! Apparently, the neighbor\u2019s wife died during the house\u2019s construction period and her soul has never left the house\u2026 Or something like that. Furniture\u2019s come alive and try to eat these kids, blah, blah, blah. It\u2019s been some time since I\u2019ve played the game, alright? I never finished it and I\u2019ve never really paid attention to the dialogue and that\u2019s why I probably can\u2019t remember the game well. I probably should play through it again! \nI get that this isn\u2019t really a series because there\u2019s technically one game. I can\u2019t really find any other retro game series that I\u2019d play if it was rebooted other then this game. Yep. I wasn\u2019t really big on \u2018video games\u2019 back in the day. So\u2026 Why this? \nOn some occasions, I did pay attention to the dialogues and the storyline. The story is intriguing and the gameplay was actually quite enjoyable, (at least, I thought a game like this was enjoyable until I indulged in modern games!) I spent countless hours trying to finish the game and almost finished it. That is until I lost the cartridge. But that\u2019s a story for another day. What made me really want this game to be a modern rebooted game is the storyline and the gameplay. Back then, the gameplay was considered \u2018ungodly,\u2019 or at least, that\u2019s what I thought. The storyline was intriguing and it really sucks you into their world. There\u2019s not much I remember about the game since it\u2019s been like\u2026 5 ~ 7 years since I played it. I would really love to see this series rebooted. Charming & Open \nCharming and Open is inspired by a move of the same name in the tabletop RPG Dungeon World. In the game, it allows a character to ask a direct question and get an honest answer, but there\u2019s a catch \u2013 in speaking openly enough to ask that question, they give the target the opportunity to ask a question on the same terms. This idea of an open exchange of questions to which both parties must give an honest answer is the basis of the community event.Charming and Open is an opportunity for you to ask me a question about video games, tabletops, or blogging in general. I\u2019ll answer your question as a full-length post right here on Adventure Rules. In exchange, if you\u2019re a blogger and want to participate , I\u2019ll ask you a question which you can then answer as a full-length post on your own blog. We link each other and encourage our followers to check out the other\u2019s post \u2013 in this way, the event helps to build community as we exchange ideas and spread the word about one another\u2019s blogs. \nRobert Ian Shepard\u2019s Blog can be visited by clicking here!

Wade?", "text": "By Meridian Magazine \u00b7 December 6, 2017 \nCover image: REUTERS/Rick Wilking \nAs one commentator said, \u201cReligious liberty and same-sex marriage finally met at the Supreme Court\u201d on Tuesday, a clash that was inevitable following the Obergefell ruling that made same-sex marriage legal. \nOral arguments were heard in the case of Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado who refused to create a cake for a same-sex wedding, saying it violated his conscience and freedom of speech and freedom of religion. \nTo understand the nature of the importance of this case, some reports and analysis are highlighted here. \nFirst a response from Jack Phillips himself. He said: \u201cI serve all who walk through my doors, people from all walks of life. I\u2019ve spent many years honing my craft as a cake artist, combining baking with my love of sculpting, painting, and sketching. And I love my craft because a cake is a canvas on which I express ideas, celebrate events, and bring joy to people\u2019s lives. \u201cOne of my favorite parts of my job has always been designing and creating wedding cakes. They allow me to use my artistic vision to create works of art that are beautiful and distinctive and that mark the beginning of something sacred. \u201cThough I serve everyone who comes into my shop, like many other creative professionals, I don\u2019t create custom designs for events or messages that conflict with my conscience. I don\u2019t create cakes that celebrate Halloween, promote sexual or anti-American themes, or disparage people, including individuals who identify as LGBT. For me, it\u2019s never about the person making the request. It\u2019s about the message the person wants the cake to communicate. \u201cI am here at the Supreme Court today because I respectfully declined to create a custom cake that would celebrate a view of marriage in direct conflict with my faith\u2019s core teachings on marriage. I offered to sell the two gentlemen suing me anything else in my shop or to design a cake for them for another occasion. \u201cFor that decision, which was guided by an established set of religious beliefs, I\u2019ve endured a five-year court battle. It\u2019s been very hard on me and my family. There have been tears and many difficult days for us. We have faced death threats and harassment. I\u2019ve had to stop creating the wedding art that I love, which means we\u2019ve lost much of our business\u2014so much so, that we are now struggling to pay our bills and keep the shop afloat. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that the government is forcing me to choose between providing for my family and employees and violating my relationship with God. That is not freedom. That is not tolerance.\u201d \nThat this case is bigger than Jack Phillips or his cakeshop is noted in Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s peppering the attorneys for Colorado and the ACLU with this type of question . \u201cKennedy seemed particularly bothered by a commissioner\u2019s statement claiming that what Phillips had done was \u201cdespicable,\u201d calling this \u201chostility to religion.\u201d He lectured the state: \u201cCounselor, tolerance is essential in a free society. And tolerance is most meaningful when it\u2019s mutual. It seems to me that the state in its position here has been neither tolerant nor respectful of Mr. Phillips\u2019 religious beliefs.\u201d \u201cWhile the state\u2019s attorney expressly disavowed that statement at argument yesterday, it may not be enough. Kennedy asked, in light of that disavowal, \u201cCould your judgment stand?\u201d \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t finished. He also probed, along with Justice Neil Gorsuch (who observed that a second commissioner had expressed animus against Phillips) as to why the state should be able to force Phillips to \u201cteach \u2026 to his family\u201d that the state thinks his beliefs are discriminatory.\u201d \nOutside the Supreme Court others weighed in : \u201cRyan Bomberger, founder of the Radiance Foundation, a nonprofit educational organization to affirm life, says Phillips\u2019 case involves much more than just the rights of a cake baker. \n\u201c\u2019I am adopted,\u2019\u201d Bomberger said, adding: \u2018 And people don\u2019t realize how far-reaching a lot of these issues go when it comes to LGBT activism. In fact, in the state of Illinois, they passed [a law] where if you are not LGBTQ-affirming as a parent, you can\u2019t be a prospective foster care parent\u2019. \n\u201cInstead, Bomberger said, Phillips\u2019 case is about every American\u2019s First Amendment rights. \n\u201c\u2019People don\u2019t realize how deep this is going,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019It is even more than Jack Phillips\u2019 case, but this is why we\u2019re standing here, because we have to affirm our rights, we have to affirm the First Amendment, our right to free speech, our right to religious freedom.\u201d \u201cRyan T. Anderson, a senior fellow in American principles and public policy at The Heritage Foundation, said Phillips\u2019 case boils down to freedom. \u201c\u2019Today\u2019s case is about freedom, and it\u2019s about truth,\u201d Anderson said. \u201c\u2019Today involves a baker. It could involve a painter. It could involve a florist, a photographer. It could involve a speechwriter, a videographer, a movie-maker. All of these people have First Amendment freedoms to speak their message, not the government\u2019s message.\u2019\u201d \u201cSome speakers at the rally had stories similar to that of Phillips. Kelvin Cochran, a former fire chief in Atlanta, said he was dismissed from his job because of his faith. Cochran had written a religious book that included his beliefs about sexual morality.\u201d \nEric Baxter, senior counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, who filed a friend-of-the court brief said: \u201c The idea that the government can force someone to participate in events like weddings, baptisms, bar mitzvahs, or even funerals\u2014events that are so full of cultural and religious meaning\u2014is deeply troubling. The First Amendment requires more of us. The government cannot force someone to celebrate a wedding any more than it could force them to say the Pledge of Allegiance. And it cannot force them to support someone else\u2019s celebration any more than it could force them to raise the flag for the Pledge of Allegiance. \u201cOf course creating a custom wedding cake is part and parcel of celebrating a wedding. Jack Phillips should not be forced to do that any more than someone should be forced to sing at a wedding, or serve as a wedding witness, or attend the wedding with a sufficiently large smile on their face.

Pick from four unique character classes and embark on a mission to protect the oxygen-producing Cores from hordes of deadly aliens who are threatened by their extinction. About \nOk, so first off, where in the world have I been? I\u2019ve been absent for at least a week now. No, I\u2019m not dead and no, I\u2019ve not stopped blogging. For starters, some \u2018factors\u2019 came to be and it appears that my time was cut short. And just another side note, we did a giveaway on this game a couple weeks back. Congrats to Virtual Bastion , \u201cLightning\u201d Ellen and Sam Foden for winning a copy of the game! \nChoose your own loadout of towers, weapons, and perks, but choose wisely because you are humanity\u2019s last defense against the unrelenting hordes set out to destroy it. Sanctum 2 is a new game completely rebuilt from the ground up using community feedback and innovative design to really push the bar of what an independent studio can do.In Sanctum 2, you will utilize elements from multiple gameplay genres to succeed. Construct towers and walls during the building phase before the enemies attack, then jump into the fray and blast everything to pieces in FPS mode. You can progress through the single-player campaign yourself, or play with up to four friends in co-op to discover the secrets of the planet LOEK III and learn the backstory on why the aliens are so intent on destroying the Cores you are sworn to protect. Features!!! \nBuilding on the success of the original game, Sanctum 2 stands alone as the only true FPS/Tower Defense hybrid. No other title delivers gameplay that seamlessly combines both genres. Tower Defense \u2013 Design complex mazes and build powerful towers to stop the enemies from destroying the Cores. First-Person Shooter \u2013 Don\u2019t just sit back and watch, jump into the action yourself! Four playable character classes \u2013 Each with their own unique strengths, weaknesses, and weapons. Vast Customization System \u2013 Pick perks or make the game crazy hard by adding Feats of Strength. In-game Visual Novel \u2013 Unlock a comic-book page for every map you beat to discover the secrets of LOEK III. Progression System \u2013 Increase your rank and unlock new weapons, towers, and perks. 4-Player Co-op \u2013 Progress through the storyline yourself or team up with other players whenever you want. EVALUATION!!! \nSanctum 2 is the perfect game to play with 3 of your friends. The game combines the mechanics of an FPS game and the principles of a tower-defense game. Progress through the story or play with other players through the multiplayer feature. Sure, Sanctum 2 might be fun for a few days or so, but soon, it gets quite stale. The game is repetitive and there isn\u2019t much variation in the gameplay. It might not be a great idea to spend $15 on a game you\u2019ll end up forgetting in a few days. Heck, I\u2019ll be surprised if you\u2019re still playing it after a week has passed!

It is believed that Brexit may well have intensified appetite for UK student housing, as Savills recorded a huge \u00a32.1 billion transacted after the referendum, compared to \u00a31.9 billion earlier in the year. \nDemand for student housing assets has outgrown the supply of available stock, however. Of the \u00a34.5 billion traded by Savills last year, \u00a31.1 billion (25%) involved forward funding developments, while \u00a3223m (5%) was for development sites. Existing stock made up 69% of trades \u2013 the lowest proportion on record. \nThese growth figures are supported by The Mistoria Group, which specialises in high yielding investment property. The firm has seen demand for student property investment in the North West soar by 38% over the past year. The largest rise in investment came from Turkey, which accounted for 20% of the growth, followed by the UAE (9%) and Hong Kong (5%). \nMish Liyanage, the Managing Director of The Mistoria Group, comments: \u201cWe have seen a large increase in international investors\u2019 appetite for student accommodation. They are attracted to the UK because of the relatively low-cost student property on offer, and the excellent net yields that range between 12% and 15% in the North West. Investors have a wide choice of accommodation to choose from, such as HMOs [Houses in Multiple Occupation] to purpose-built accommodation. \n\u201cThere is a general shortage of student accommodation across the UK, and especially in university cities such as Liverpool and Plymouth. In Liverpool, there are now 21,700 PBSA [purpose-built student accommodation] units, meaning 2.1 students for each unit.

Trump also exercised America\u2019s sovereign right to recognize the capital of a close ally and choose the location of its own embassy. \nIn recent years, the refusal of many nations to acknowledge Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital has become an integral part of the international campaign to de-legitimize Israel. \nBy recognizing Israeli sovereignty and historic ties to its capital city, the president not only struck a dramatic blow against this campaign, but reaffirmed the importance of close Israeli-American ties. \nThe president\u2019s announcement also corrects a longtime historic anomaly: that the U.S. has a consulate general in Jerusalem to conduct diplomatic relations with the Palestinians, but no embassy in Jerusalem for engaging Israelis. \nThe commitment to move the embassy was already a longstanding U.S. policy. Congress voted by a bipartisan majority to pass the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, which called for moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by 1999, but allowed presidents to waive the move on national security grounds. \nEvery president since then has signed the waiver due to fear of provoking a backlash that would threaten U.S. interests and reduce the prospects for a final settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \nBut the Oslo peace process stalled anyway, primarily due to continued Palestinian terrorism that undermined Israeli willingness to make increasingly risky concessions in exchange for Palestinian promises that often were not kept. \nTo read the full article on the Daily Signal, click here .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "james phil", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "meridian magazine \u00b7 december", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "u.s. embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heritage foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daily signal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oslo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:46.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "848301e1d86be52807726746d6063fb129781e73", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPfSW64d1H.t8vyy1Jrw9n3LLPJ8O3Qv91MeG6wsBL3wDBv_assvhBjOmzNcLWPsx2sfc2vipYpNsJx0g4yzaQJOiO4g8A_Z.QO73iOYOdJ.wAYBup8qruFk-", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g293889-i9243-Nepal.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Nepal Forum, Travel Discussion for Nepal - TripAdvisor", "title": "Tamang & Lantang trek OR Lantang & Gosaindkund trek - Nepal", "title_full": "Tamang & Lantang trek OR Lantang & Gosaindkund trek - Nepal Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-05T16:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.054, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bcf604ac6543dd1f86f2b4e5050b21933771735d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPfSW64d1H.t8vyy1Jrw9n3LLPJ8O3Qv91MeG6wsBL3wDBv_assvhBjOmzNcLWPsx2sfc2vipYpNsJx0g4yzaQJOiO4g8A_Z.QO73iOYOdJ.wl_x1UeVDpbk-", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "scoodly", "published": "2017-12-06T21:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hi I have trekked Langtang/Gosainkund/Helambu and Tamang Heritage Trail/Ganesh Himal (as well as Langtang valley a couple of times).

Tauseef Mustafa / AFP/Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 12:27 am \nMonths after a tense standoff between China and India along their Himalayan border, Beijing on Thursday expressed anger at an Indian drone that crashed inside its territory. \n\"This action by India violated China's territorial sovereignty. We express strong dissatisfaction and opposition,\" Xinhua cited Zhang Shuili, a senior military official in China's western battle zone command, as saying. \nChina said the drone crashed in \"recent days\" but didn't say where. Zhang said his country would defend its national sovereignty against such intrusions. \nHe said China's border defense forces conducted \"an inspection of the device,\" but didn't elaborate. \nIndia has not responded to the charge. \nAlthough the two countries have made moves toward warmer relations in recent years, they also have a long history of border tensions. In 1962, they fought a brief, but inconclusive border conflict. They have also had ongoing disputes over sovereignty in other border areas, notably Aksai Chin, a Himalayan region that straddles their territorial demarcation in the west. \nThe two countries have also long been at odds over India's hosting of Tibet's government-in-exile and their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, considered by China to be subversive because of his calls for Tibetan independence. \nStarting in June this year, tensions flared again over a disputed region called the Doklam Plateau that borders China, Bhutan and the Indian state of Sikkim. \nAs NPR's Julie McCarthy reported from New Delhi in July , the problems stemmed from China's construction of a road in Doklam Plateau. \"Not far from the plateau lies the narrow passage that connects India's northeast states with the rest of the country \u2014 a strategic link called the Siliguri Corridor but more commonly known as the \"Chicken's Neck. \" Any possibility of China being able to sever that \"neck\" unnerves India. \nAs late as August, India had rushed troops to Doklam Plateau and although an immediate conflict was avoided, heated rhetoric on both sides has soured relations. \nIn September, India's army chief said that his country \"could not afford to be complacent and must be prepared for war,\" according to The Hindustan Times. \nAnd in November, China took umbrage at Indian President Ram Nath Kovind's visit to the remote state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China also claims, Reuters reports.

Lawyers for the company did succeed in getting dismissed one of the five counts that the company could be liable for its failure to spend money to prevent this contamination, known as negative unjust enrichment.\u201cThe court has not found any case suggesting that New Hampshire recognizes claims for negative unjust enrichment,\u201d LaPlante said.As for the other two counts in the suit, negligence and failure to warn these homeowners of the potential contamination, LaPlante said there wasn\u2019t enough cause to dismiss these, so they too were kept alive.But the judge stressed this decision does not mean those bringing the lawsuit will be entitled to those damages.LaPlante also signaled that he may at a future date ask the New Hampshire Supreme Court to weigh in on whether the company can be made to pay the cost of medical monitoring of residents and their family members for health ailments in the future.The company acknowledges PFOAs are used in Teflon coatings on fiberglass and other fabric with this material but lawyers point out other firms in the region also manufacture them.Lawyers for the residents said company officials in Merrimack knew the risk they were presenting with continued use of PFOA\u2019s to nearby residents since contamination was found near Saint-Gobain\u2019s plant in Hoosick, N.Y., in 2014. A federal judge in New York earlier this year issued a decision keeping alive a damages suit in that state.The lawsuit maintains Saint-Gobain moved some operations from a North Bennington, VT. plant to Merrimack after the state of Vermont imposed stiffer restrictions on PFOA\u2019s in that state.Late last year, state officials moved to connect 360 Litchfield homes to the Pennichuck public water system with Saint-Gobain paying all the costs for planning and construction.Merrimack public water customers randomly selected have had their blood tested for PFOA.The company and state officials continue to explore options for providing clean drinking water to 61 properties in Bedford. Saint-Gobain has paid for design of that connection and construction of the link could be done by next spring. klandrigan@unionleader.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kimberly houghton/correspondent", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kevin landrigan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joseph laplante", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laplante", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin brown", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "saint-gobain", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new hampshire supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saint-gobain performance plastics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pfoa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "concord", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vermont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vt.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new hampshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litchfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merrimack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bedford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hoosick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north bennington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:47.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "95e013a6c85dca020ae442e573d3270c15090b88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSuyVp72M3L5k5X_.o.jD04ewnpEPSV1V936Dax8uvN37jO.VbXx7RQ", "site_full": "www.loudoun.gov", "site": "loudoun.gov", "site_section": "http://www.loudoun.gov/support/pages.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "Loudoun County, VA - Pages", "title": "Real and Personal Property Tax Exemptions", "title_full": "Real and Personal Property Tax Exemptions", "published": "2017-12-06T22:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 54533, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "95e013a6c85dca020ae442e573d3270c15090b88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSuyVp72M3L5k5X_.o.jD04ewnpEPSV1V936Dax8uvN37jO.VbXx7RQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T22:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "Real and Personal Property Tax Exemptions", "text": "Real and Personal Property Tax Exemptions Real and Personal Property Tax Exemptions There are two types of property tax exemptions, exemptions by classification and exemptions by designation. Determinations of property tax exemption by classification are made by the Commissioner of the Revenue. Chapter 36 of Title 58.1 of the Code of Virginia provides the authority for Virginia counties, cities and towns to, by designation or classification, exempt from local taxation real or personal property, or both, owned by a nonprofit organization and meeting criteria specified in \u00a7 58.1-3651 of the Virginia Code. Organizations previously granted exemptions from property taxation by Loudoun County are reflected in its Codified Ordinances in Chapter 862, Exemptions from Taxation. On October 7, 2008, the Board of Supervisors adopted a moratorium on the granting of exemptions by designation until December 31, 2011, which was subsequently extended indefinitely on April 17, 2012. On December 4, 2013, the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors lifted the moratorium on the granting of property tax exemptions by designation and has authorized the Commissioner\u2019s office to accept applications annually from nonprofit organizations seeking exemption from real or personal property or both. Applications must be completed and returned to the Office of the Commissioner of the Revenue with a postmark of April 2, 2018 for consideration this year. An exemption, if granted, would be effective January 1, 2019. All applications are reviewed to determine the organization\u2019s eligibility for property tax exemption based on classification. Applications from organizations that do not qualify for exemption by classification and that the Board may wish to consider for exemption by designation, will be forwarded for consideration to the Board\u2019s Finance/Government Services and Operations Committee (FGSO) in September. The FGSO committee\u2019s recommendations for property tax exemption, effective January 1 of the subsequent tax year, will then be provided to the Board of Supervisors at its 2nd business meeting in September.

Promising biobased alternatives to polar aprotic solvents 07-Dec-2017 \nA report from Wageningen Food & Biobased Research commissioned by RIVM (the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment) has revealed a number of promising biobased alternatives to the controversial polar aprotic solvents NMP, DMAc and DMF. Wageningen Food & Biobased Research carried out a broad scan of new and marketable biobased chemicals. This focused specifically on substitutes for the polar aprotic solvents NMP, DMAc and DMF \u2013 all substances of very high concern, the use of which may be limited by EU law in the future. \nWithin the EU BBI project RESOLVE, Wageningen Food & Biobased Research is already developing safe alternatives to toluene and NMP, two widely used substances of very high concern. RESOLVE focuses on the development of alternatives with a completely different chemical structure, entirely avoiding the chemical groups which make toluene and NMP toxic. Moreover, the alternatives are sustainable because they are made from carbohydrate-rich waste streams such as sugar beet pulp. Important solution for toxic substances \nThe RIVM study looked specifically at substitutes for polar aprotic solvents. One of these solvents is DMAc, which received negative coverage in the news as recently as last year for supposedly causing fertility issues among the female employees at a chemical plant. The study was carried out by Daan van Es, senior scientist at Wageningen Food & Biobased Research. \n\u201cBiobased chemicals are currently of considerable interest. The development of new materials with unique chemical structures and properties can provide a replacement for controversial polar aprotic solvents such as DMAc and NMP. It is, however, crucial to understand issues such as technical feasibility, availability of raw materials and the viability of commercial production. Our study presents all this clearly.\u201d \nVan Es indicates that further research is needed in order to be able to judge the effectiveness, sustainability and toxicity of the proposed replacements. \u201cWe have identified a large number of potential replacements, but they are not yet in production as substitutes for the relevant polar aprotic solvents.\u201d Final assessments of sustainability and toxicological properties should be subject to further research performed in cooperation with the private sector. \nRIVM is conducting a desk study to screen which toxicological information is available for these biobased alternatives, if any. Tests with industrial partners \nA follow-up programme in which several potential replacements are made and tested would be very useful. \u201cIdeally, we would work with several industrial partners \u2013 such as manufacturers of paints and industrial detergents, as well as producers of biobased materials themselves \u2013 to examine the proposed substitutes for toxic substances in their solvents,\u201d Van Es continues. The government can encourage and facilitate such partnerships within a broad research programme. \u201cWe have already created an impetus for the substances toluene and NMP within the RESOLVE project. This is necessary to assess the concrete potential of biobased substitutes, and enables us to really start thinking about commercial production together with private sector partners.\u201d Wageningen University and Research Centre (UR)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nmp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wageningen university and research centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wageningen food & biobased research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dutch national institute for public health", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:48.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0dab2bde65c0913f8a594c606d5b3b6d6cca08a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTePsLKr1Idimn_qnklCi4F2sVQZcers7mQusqpCqFy8y_Le.tlA.ZjUbcCkbyncDw-", "site_full": "ldsmag.com", "site": "ldsmag.com", "site_section": "https://ldsmag.com/feed", "site_categories": ["religion", "latter_day_saints"], "section_title": "Meridian Magazine", "title": "Being Kind in the Savior\u2019s Way", "title_full": "Being Kind in the Savior\u2019s Way", "published": "2017-12-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ldsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/take-my-hand-greg-olsen.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86709, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0dab2bde65c0913f8a594c606d5b3b6d6cca08a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTePsLKr1Idimn_qnklCi4F2sVQZcers7mQusqpCqFy8y_Le.tlA.ZjUbcCkbyncDw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Darla Isackson", "published": "2017-12-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Being Kind in the Savior\u2019s Way", "text": "By Darla Isackson \u00b7 December 6, 2017 \nCover image: Take My Hand by Greg Olsen \nI have such mixed feelings about December. I love so many things about it, but no matter how hard I try to simplify and plan ahead I often feel overloaded. No wonder, since I attempt to cram more tasks and events into a schedule I couldn\u2019t keep up with in the first place. However, even in the middle of a hectic holiday season (that too often brings greater stress and irritability), we can honor the Savior whose birth we celebrate by following His example of kindness. \nThe invitation to celebrate the birth and life of the Lord Jesus Christ by participating in the \u201cLight the World\u201d Christmas initiative needs to be applied according to our individual circumstances. We are counseled by the First Presidency: \u201cAs we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ this Christmas season, our hope is that the light and testimony of the Savior\u2019s divine mission as the Redeemer of mankind will come into our hearts and be reflected in our thoughts, our words, and our actions.\u201d ( Church News , December 3, 2017) \nEven if we feel we cannot add one more thing to our Christmas \u201cto-do\u201d list, we can choose to speak kind words and offer small acts of kindness to those around us who are lonely, sad, poor, ill, or frustrated. Mari Vawn Tinney said, \u201cWe can pray for the ability to gently respond in stressful situations with a kind word. We can also pray for the wisdom to know when no words spoken at all may be the kindness that could begin to heal hearts or bring some measure of peace.\u201d \nMarjorie Pay Hinckley wisely suggested, \u201cBe kind. Everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.\u201d Kind and thoughtful words do not cost any money or take much time to say or write. But, oh, what an amazing difference for good and added hope they can make! Words spoken or kindly written can fit into the busiest of schedules. \nGuidelines for Kindness in Our Words \nNever has there been a greater need for kind words than in the divisive climate we find ourselves living in today. I found many guidelines for serving and speaking in the Savior\u2019s way in the book In the Spirit of Jershon: Blessing Others\u2019 Lives in Cultural and Spiritual Unity . \nOne example came from Ally Isom, the director of the LDS Church Public Affairs Department\u2019s division of family and community relations (who also chairs the women\u2019s outreach com\u00admittee for LDS Public Affairs), is responsible for the Church\u2019s communication strategies. Sister Isom believes that words matter, that people matter, and that you matter as a disciple of Christ as you are authentic in sharing the truth of the gospel and your light with others. She offers \u201c A Disciple\u2019s Reality Check \u201d for us to consider: Do my words hurt or strengthen? Do my words marginalize or divide or unify? Does the Spirit tell me to pause and reconsider better words? Do I see others through God\u2019s eyes and regard them as part of the solution? Do I honor others\u2019 agency? What does the Spirit tell me about their hearts? What words and tone would Jesus Christ use? Do I speak truth in love? Am I patient with the progressive understanding and path of others? Do I forgive others and myself? Do I love and pray for all in the arena? Do I trust God and submit to his will and timing? Do I recognize my spiritual gifts and accept my stewardship? Am I pressing forward, steadfast in Christ, feasting upon his words about this issue? Do I allow the Holy Ghost to tell me what to do and how to do it? (Pages 108-109, Jershon book) \nThe April 15, 2015 blog on www, mormon.org suggested we communicate more like Jesus Christ by \u201c\u2026 infusing all that you say and do with much love as you can muster.\u201d \nIn In the Spirit of Jershon book, Mari Vawn Tinney introduced guidelines given by Elder Oaks that we can consider for handling tough challenges or struggling in a relationship during the Christmas season. She said, \u201cWhat if you are the one who is being criticized, ignored, overlooked, or misunderstood? How do you respond in a way that you can speak up with respect and added understanding as you talk things over so that the situation does not get worse?\u201d Then suggested as an answer to her questions: \n\u201cElder Dallin H. Oaks concluded his 2016 BYU devotional address with these five ways for people to act under these conditions: concentrate on what they have in common with oth\u00aders; strive for mutual understanding and treat all with goodwill; exercise patience; speak up for religion and religious freedom; and trust in God and his promises.\u201d \n(Dallin H. Oaks, \u201c Election, Hope, and Freedom \u201c, BYU Devotional, September 13, 2016 https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/dallin-h-oaks_elections-hope-freedom/ Quoted on page 108 of Jershon book.) \nChristlike Actions and Christmas Angels \nThe Lord knows our individual needs and the desires of our hearts, even when we have no idea how our urgent prayers will be answered. To supplement the ministering of angels from heaven the Lord provides opportunities for us to be part of orchestrating good events in the lives of others. Elder Jeffery R. Holland declared, \u201cI testify angels are still sent to help us. In the process of praying for those angels to attend us, may we all try to be a little more angelic ourselves \u2013 with a kind word, a strong arm . . .\u201d etc. \nI was inspired by Christmas stories I read in the book The Spirit of Jershon of people as good neighbors who not only spoke kind words, but used their time and resources to light up the lives of those in need. One ward family renovated a dreary apartment that was being provided for a family fleeing war-ravaged Germany. Another family found joy in a sub for Santa program being provided for single Hispanic mothers. (PP. 131-135) \nMy sister Arlene was a Christmas angel to me last year. Her kindness warms my heart every time I think of it. Arlene does not enjoy shopping in the least, yet she braved holiday crowds when she learned two days before Christmas that I would not have a single present under the tree because I had asked for updating of my computer equipment for my Christmas. I was awe-struck when she appeared on my porch on the afternoon of Christmas Eve, gift-laden. Knowing the drive, too, was hard for her, the gift of her time and her caring touched me far more than the presents. I never felt her love more than I did through the sacrifice she made that Christmas just for me. \nSo many people are lonely during the holiday season. I have a wonderful memory of being a Christmas angel to someone when I was twelve years old, soon after we moved to the town of Ammon, Idaho. We had no living grandma of our own, so \u201cadopted\u201d the widow just across the street, whose only daughter lived far away. She was one of a handful of nonmembers in that little Mormon town, so she was especially lonely. We quickly dubbed her \u201cGrandma Woodhouse\u201d and began including her in family gatherings. When December rolled around we decided to make some presents for her, get her a little tree, and decorate it with lights, old-fashioned paper chains and strings of cranberries and popcorn. Our anticipation grew as we worked together. \nOn Christmas Eve we made our way toward Grandma\u2019s house, our arms filled with small gifts. I looked at the small decorated tree Dad carried, and smiled in excitement. The air was crisp and clean, the sky star-studded. Our breath made frosty poofs as my two little brothers and I excitedly giggled our way across the frozen sparkling street. We followed in Dad\u2019s big footprints across the deep unmarred snow: we obviously were her only visitors. \nWhen Grandma opened the door, we were shocked. She had been sitting alone in near-darkness with nothing in the house to suggest the season. Her eyes lightened with joy, then glistened with tears as we all shouted, \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d We stamped the snow off our feet, then transformed her kitchen with laughter, love, and a little tree complete with gifts. With the tree lights making sparkles all over the room, we sang \u201cSilent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright.\u201d All was calm and bright inside my young heart. I had never before understood all those words I\u2019d heard about \u201cmaking someone else happy makes you happy too.\u201d But now I did! Sharing the Christmas spirit of love filled me with inner light like nothing I had ever experienced. \nKindness Is at the Heart of the Savior\u2019s Example \nThese experiences are small examples of serving in the Savior\u2019s way\u2014ministering one by one, as we offer kind words, service, and smiles. From Aesop\u2019s fable of the lion and the mouse, we are reminded that no act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted. \nSmall, simple acts of kindness are the building blocks for creating Zion in spite of our differences. On page 31 of the Jershon book author Mari Vawn Tinney shared Barbara Morgan Gardner\u2019s thoughts: \u201cThe Brethren have repeatedly asked the mem bers of the Church to have a spirit of inclusion, to reach out to those in need, especially to the minorities, and to help all of us become one in Christ. Is this not what Zion is: be of one heart, one mind, dwell in righteousness, that there are no poor among us? As members of the Church we are trying to bring to pass Zion. We all have a responsibility to help each other in this process. We cannot be saved alone. In these last days of we have a responsibility to help one another in order for all of us to claim the blessings asso\u00adciated with the Abrahamic Covenant. We may have different roles to play, but we are all in this together.\u201d (Barbara Morgan Gardner, page 31, The Spirit of Jershon ) Another famous quote from Sister Hinckley is, \u201cWe are all in this together. We need each other. Oh, how we need each other.\u201d \nThis Christmas season may we all pray to be kind in the Savior\u2019s way . . . to be fountains of kind words, kind actions, and kind feelings. Following the Savior\u2019s example of kindness is the very essence of the spirit of Christmas.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "greg olsen", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "darla isackson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jeffery r. holland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aesop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arlene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallin h. oaks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barbara morgan gardner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hinckley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mari vawn tinney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jershon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus christ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marjorie pay hinckley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "byu devotional", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lds church public affairs department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lds public affairs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "church news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spiritual unity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spirit of jershon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "santa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elder oaks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ammon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jershon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idaho", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:48.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cfea49aa54c0829faf55336b14659db402557254", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQPRzxpWsOw0xwYxDcga1nqRIl2ic5mva440elUl_F9ZJ7eWako2eHVj3O.UZwveyYzswScA1DgROoXTt8iQhgM", "site_full": "rrahmadhaniblog.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://rrahmadhaniblog.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Not About Love \u2013 Sky Full Of Stories", "title": "Not About Love", "title_full": "Not About Love", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ID", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cfea49aa54c0829faf55336b14659db402557254", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQPRzxpWsOw0xwYxDcga1nqRIl2ic5mva440elUl_F9ZJ7eWako2eHVj3O.UZwveyYzswScA1DgROoXTt8iQhgM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "rrahmadhaniblog", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "Not About Love", "text": "\n-This post will specially be written for the only one who can make me laugh by everything he says, to me.

(REUTERS/Abed Omar Qusini) President Donald Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy on Wednesday and recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, effectively taking sides in one of the thorniest issues in the Mideast dispute and upsetting Washington\u2019s friends and foes alike.Trump announced his administration would begin a process of moving the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a step expected to take years and one that his predecessors had avoided so as not to inflame tensions.The status of Jerusalem \u2014 home to sites that are holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions \u2014 is one of the biggest obstacles to reaching a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed Trump\u2019s announcement as a \u201chistoric landmark\u201d but other close Western allies of Washington such as Britain and France were critical.Palestinians accused the United States of abdicating its responsibility to try to broker peace.The international community does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the entire city, believing its status should be resolved in negotiations. No other country has its embassy in Jerusalem.Trump\u2019s decision fulfills a campaign promise and will please Republican conservatives and evangelicals who make up a sizeable portion of his domestic support.\u201cI have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,\u201d Trump said in a speech in the White House. \u201cWhile previous Presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering.\u201dTrump\u2019s decision risks further inflaming a region already grappling with conflict in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.Protests broke out in areas of Jordan\u2019s capital Amman inhabited by Palestinian refugees and several hundred protesters gathered outside the U.S. consulate in Istanbul.Youths chanted anti-American slogans in Amman, while in the Baqaa refugee camp on the city\u2019s outskirts, hundreds of protesters roamed the streets denouncing Trump and calling on Jordan\u2019s government to scrap its 1994 peace treaty with Israel. \u201cDown with America. America is the mother of terror,\u201d they chanted.Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. Palestinians want the capital of an independent state of theirs to be in the city\u2019s eastern sector, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.Netanyahu said any peace deal with Palestinians must include Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. This would be a non-starter for Palestinians in any negotiations if it means the entire city would be under Israeli control. Palestinians upset Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday called the city \u201cthe eternal capital of the state of Palestine.\u201d Abbas said Trump\u2019s decision was tantamount to the United States abdicating its peace mediator role. Jordan called Trump\u2019s decision \u201clegally null\u201dPalestinian Islamist group Hamas accused Trump of a \u201cflagrant aggression against the Palestinian people.\u201dTrump has tilted U.S. policy toward Israel since taking office in January.\u201cHe cannot expect to side entirely with Israel on the most sensitive and complex issues in the process, and yet expect the Palestinians to see the United States as an honest broker,\u201d said former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Daniel Kurtzer.Pope Francis called for Jerusalem\u2019s status quo to be respected, saying new tension would further inflame world conflicts.

They\u2019ve been issued bright green reflective vests. \nThe paper is sold on the street by people who are homeless or formerly homeless, who pay 60 cents for each paper and sell it for $2. \nThe vests, provided by local unions including the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, have a large pocket to put the papers in and a clear plastic slot to display the vendor\u2019s badge. \nUFCW representative Kristen Beifus says for a union representing retail and grocery workers, the move just makes sense and is in line with the union\u2019s goals. \n\u201cThis is an amazing opportunity for our members to help support Real Change vendors, which we see are community workers out on the streets, and the opportunity for them to be a little safer and safety in the workplace is really important and also to sell more papers,\u201d Beifus said. \nShe says Real Change vendors were very supportive of grocery workers during tough contract negotiations several years ago, sometimes even handing out UFCW flyers as they sold papers. \nAccording to the nonprofit organization that runs Real Change, street papers around the world have found that bright vests make vendors easier to see and makes them more approachable, increasing their chance of success. \nIn addition to local unions, Granite Construction, which has a construction supply shop in Everett, printed the first 200 vests for free and will print the remaining 500 at cost. \nReal Change does face challenges, like the fact that people don\u2019t carry single dollar bills. \nYou can now use the Venmo app to purchase from a vendor. Real Change Founding Director Tim Harris says it\u2019s been more successful than a previous app that was too cumbersome. \nHe says one of the biggest challenges right now is just getting the word out about what Real Change does. He says their story was more widely known ten years ago. Now, he says, with so many people being priced out of the city and newcomers arriving, fewer people are aware of the street paper concept.

FILE PHOTO: Darren Cox (R) and concept creator Ben Bowlby stand next to Nissan's new Deltawing racing car after it was unveiled in London, March 13, 2012. REUTERS/Andrew Winning Darren Cox, the man behind McLaren\u2019s \u201cWorld\u2019s Fastest Gamer\u201d competition who also saw one of his drivers win Formula One\u2019s first eSports series in Abu Dhabi last month, feels a tipping point has been reached this year. The former Nissan motorsport boss, who runs the eSPORTS+CARS virtual team, can also see the day dawning -- in maybe three to five years\u2019 time -- when top gamers are earning more than the lowest paid drivers on the real F1 starting grid. In a wide-ranging interview at a simulator centre where his drivers train near London\u2019s Gatwick airport, Cox told Reuters that he expected Formula One teams to become involved in next year\u2019s eSports series. \u201dIf you look at what the NBA (basketball) has done...they engaged the teams right at the beginning. So 17 of the NBA teams have got franchises for the virtual side of the sport and there\u2019s a draft like in the real world. \u201dSo expect something like that to come out of (Formula One owners) Liberty,\u201c added Cox. \u201dIt\u2019s happening now. Those conversations are being had. \u201dThis absolutely will be a big priority for them (Liberty) and I believe they have made it clear to the teams that they will be involved, in some way. \u201cAnd then I guess it\u2019s down to the teams about how involved they want to be.\u201d KITCHEN PORTER Formula One\u2019s first eSports series was won by Brendon Leigh, an 18-year-old kitchen porter who had never previously been out of Britain. Leigh, who drives for Cox\u2019s team and emerged triumphant from 63,000 initial hopefuls, is likely to go professional. Some gamers in other arenas are already earning more than $1 million a year and Cox said the rewards in motorsport were growing all the time. \u201cIf you go back 18 months, these guys were winning an X-box and a free subscription, not any cash. The cash has suddenly come and I think that will ramp up,\u201d said the man who has been dubbed the \u2018Godfather of virtual racing\u2019. He expected all the big F1 teams to end up partnering with outfits like his. \u201cDepending on how well marketed it is by Liberty, there will be a new revenue stream,\u201d he said. \u201cThe teams...will want to have the best drivers and therefore there will be a fight for the best drivers if one is head and shoulders above the others.\u201d Spain\u2019s two times world champion Fernando Alonso recently launched his own virtual team while McLaren appointed Dutch gamer Rudy van Buren to the position of simulator driver after the 25-year-old won the \u201cWorld\u2019s Fastest Gamer\u201d competition. \u201cA great phrase I heard was \u2018nothing changes until everything changes at once\u2019,\u201d said Cox. \u201cSuddenly everything\u2019s happening at the same time and it is a massive benefit to our sport,\u201d added the Briton, who was responsible at Nissan for a successful programme that transformed gamers into real racers. He expected a new wave of technology companies to be attracted to the sport while existing sponsors, particularly those brands targeting a younger demographic, would get more involved. \u201cThis side of things has brought in Logitech to McLaren. They are involved because of World\u2019s Fastest Gamer. And they\u2019ve set a precedent. This is now something that will happen,\u201d declared Cox. Sales of the Formula One game were also likely to accelerate, with knock-on benefits for merchandising.

PM \nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Either Dr. Salomon Melgen is one of the biggest Medicare swindlers ever, stealing more than $100 million from the federal health care program, or a penny ante thief who walked off with $64,000. \nThose were the widely contrasting arguments made Thursday by prosecutors and Melgen\u2019s defense attorneys as they tried to persuade U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra to sentence the Dominican-born, Harvard-trained doctor to 30 years or something significantly less. \nProsecutors are seeking 30 years. They say the doctor subjected elderly patients to painful tests and treatments they didn\u2019t need, for diseases they didn\u2019t have, to support a vacation home in his native Dominican Republic, lavish trips to Europe and outside business interests. The government also says he bribed New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney Alexandra Chase told Marra that Melgen\u2019s practice was so \u201cpermeated\u201d with fraud that the judge should accept the government\u2019s estimate. Chase said even if the 63-year-old Melgen stole just $65 million \u2014 about half as much \u2014 he would be eligible for a life sentence. She pointed to Melgen often seeing more than 100 patients a day, and his employees performing in seconds tests that normally take 10 minutes or more, making them useless for diagnosis but allowing the doctor to bill Medicare for them. \n\u201cThe system was set up to maximize fraud,\u201d she said. \nMelgen\u2019s attorneys argued that the government only proved Melgen stole about $64,000, the amount they will concede was falsely charged for 30 patients who stood in during the trial as a representative sample of the more than 2,000 Melgen saw between 2008 and 2013, most of them numerous times. They say the selection of those patients came from a larger sample of 310 that wasn\u2019t random but cherry-picked and any extrapolation from those samples should be thrown out. They want a short sentence, perhaps even time served. \nJosh Sheptow portrayed his client as ahead of his time, injecting patients with then-experimental drugs that are now approved. Medicare does not pay for experimental treatments, noted Sheptow, who suggested Melgen may have falsified billing statements to get around those restrictions. That would still be fraud, Sheptow said, but he said the treatments were legitimate and therefore the government didn\u2019t lose anything with many of his patients. \nA jury found Melgen guilty of 67 counts last April after a two-month trial, including health care fraud, submitting false claims and falsifying records in patients\u2019 files. \nHe is charged separately with bribing Menendez in exchange for interceding with the Medicare officials investigating his practice and other favors, including getting visas for his foreign mistresses. A federal jury in New Jersey hung on that case last month, and prosecutors there have not said whether they will retry them. \nMelgen\u2019s attorneys rested much of their sentencing argument on the doctor\u2019s use of the drug Lucentis between 2008 and 2013. During most of that time, Medicare approved its use only for wet age-related macular degeneration or ARMD, a retinal disease that can cause blindness. \nLucentis is injected in tiny doses \u2014 0.5 milliliters, or a sixty-fourth of a teaspoon. It comes in single-use vials that contain four times that amount \u2014 a sixteenth of a teaspoon. The manufacturer\u2019s instructions say doctors should pull the vial\u2019s entire contents into the syringe and then squeeze out and dispose of the excess \u2014 about a thirtieth of a teaspoon \u2014 before administering the injection. Medicare reimburses doctors their wholesale cost of $1,900 per vial plus a 6 percent surcharge, $114. \nMelgen used each vial for three or four injections, charging Medicare $2,014 each time. Prosecutors say the two or three extra injections were theft. Melgen\u2019s attorneys argue that he cost the Medicare program no extra money by avoiding what he would have spent buying more vials. \nMelgen also administered the drug to patients who did not have wet ARMD, although he told Medicare they did. Sheptow suggested that the patients had diabetic-related sight loss, types of which Lucentis is now authorized for. He said Melgen and other eye doctors knew Lucentis worked on those diseases and suggested Melgen gave a false diagnosis to Medicare to be reimbursed for a treatment he knew was effective, even if it wasn\u2019t yet approved. That might be fraud, he said, but Medicare lost no money because its mission of providing medical care to the elderly was met. \nWhat had been a scheduled as a three-day hearing that started Tuesday will now need a fourth, possibly later this month or in January, as the sides did not finish their presentations. Marra has said he will then need time to process the information before pronouncing sentence.

But President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made clear he doesn't want a new election, and Schulz reversed course. \nSchulz told Thursday's previously scheduled congress that the leadership's plan for talks, which he hopes to start next week, \"takes no option off the table\" and wouldn't automatically lead to a coalition. \n\"We don't have to govern at any price, but we also shouldn't want not to govern at any price,\" he said. \"What is important is what we can implement.\" \nSchulz has promised a ballot of the party's entire membership on any coalition deal with Merkel's Union bloc. On Thursday, leaders agreed also to hold a party congress to consider whether to move on from exploratory talks \u2014 if they are successful \u2014 to full coalition negotiations. \nIf no coalition is agreed upon, that would leave only a minority government or a new election as options. Merkel has said she is \"very skeptical\" about leading a minority government, which hasn't yet been tried in post-World War II Germany. \nSchulz, however, made clear that some form of support for a minority conservative government is very much an option for his party. \n\"I give you this promise: we will explore every path,\" he told delegates. \nIn his speech, Schulz listed center-left priorities such as equal treatment for men and women in the labor market and a relatively liberal approach to immigration, rejecting the idea of a cap on the number of refugees allowed into the country. \nThe former European Parliament president called for a eurozone budget to boost investment and growth in Europe, and a European finance minister who would curb \"tax dumping.\" \nHe also advocated aiming for a federal \"United States of Europe\" by 2025, and argued that countries that don't sign up to a treaty establishing a federal setup should then automatically leave the European Union. \nMerkel gave a skeptical response when asked at a separate event in Berlin about Schulz' push for a federalized Europe. She said she would concentrate on securing greater cooperation on economic, security, defense and other issues by 2025. \nThe Social Democrats have been part of Germany's government for 15 of the past 19 years \u2014 twice joining a \"grand coalition\" under Merkel, from 2005 to 2009 and again from 2013 until now. \nBut the party suffered historically poor election results after both Merkel coalitions, with support slumping to a post-war low of 20.5 percent in September. \n\"The renewal of the Social Democratic Party will happen outside a 'grand coalition,' or it won't happen,\" said the leader of its youth wing, Kevin Kuehnert. \nDelegates later re-elected Schulz as party leader. Schulz, who ran unopposed, won some 82 percent support \u2014 short of the unanimous backing he received when first elected in March. \n\"I hope that, on the basis of this result, better times will come,\" he said. \n  Photos", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "merkel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "andrea nahles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angela merkel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin schulz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank-walter steinmeier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schulz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerhard schroeder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:49.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c8e73a361cfd26cf83d1203c161a0a1dcfdee2f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS5jkX7_NlaQ3YB249qS5kMk-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c8e73a361cfd26cf83d1203c161a0a1dcfdee2f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS5jkX7_NlaQ3YB249qS5kMk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "using System;\r\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\r\nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework;\r\n\r\nusing System.Threading;\r\n\r\nnamespace PIGFrameWork\r\n{\r\n    public class Gamer\r\n    {\r\n\r\n        public class SignedInGamer\r\n        {\r\n            public string DisplayName { get; set; }\r\n            public string GamerTag { get; set; }\r\n            public bool IsGuest { get; set; }\r\n            public bool IsSignedInToLive { get; set; }\r\n            //LeaderboardWriter\r\n            public int PartySize { get; set; }\r\n            public PlayerIndex PlayerIndex { get; set; }\r\n            //Presence here\r\n            public object Tag { get; set; }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public static List<SignedInGamer> SignedInGamerCollection = new List<SignedInGamer>();\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "playerindex playerindex", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:49.021+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15102097, "moreResultsAvailable": 15101997, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512640549021&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 380}
