Jen Forbus \u2014 The Morning Journal \nWestlake picked up its first win of the season, beating Amherst, 59-52, on the road Dec. 6. \nIt was a physical, back-and-forth game typical of the Southwestern Conference and the Demons trailed by two with just under five minutes left in regulation. But as the game got more aggressive and the fouling increased, Westlake maintained composure and virtually won the game at the free-throw line, shooting 11-of-12 in the fourth quarter. \n\u201cTo win close games, at the end of the game you have to make foul shots and you have to take care of the ball and I thought we did a pretty good job of that,\u201d Westlake coach Art Daniels said. \u201cWe still have things to learn but our kids fought till the end. ... We found a way to get it done, that\u2019s what we talk about all the time, you have to find a way and it\u2019s not always easy.\u201d \nSophomore Gina Adams led all scorers with 19 points and added 13 rebounds for Westlake (1-3, 1-2 SWC). Abby Matalavage added 17 points and Abby Carrington had nine. Advertisement \nIt was a tough break for Amherst, which had matched Westlake\u2019s physicality and tempo most of the game, despite some notable size differences, but where the Demons stayed calm down the stretch, Amherst coach Kevin Collins felt his team got more and more out of control. \n\u201cWe know it\u2019s always going to be physical, I think for us it\u2019s more of being composed,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI think we can match the physical it\u2019s just more of keeping our heads straight and taking care of the ball in those clutch moments. \n\u201cIt felt like every time we got that lead we started to play even crazier and we threw up bad shots and turned the ball over. Just something we have to get better at. In this conference, every night\u2019s a battle and if we\u2019re willing to get better, we\u2019re going to be in it at the end. It\u2019s just a matter of survival.\u201d \nMarisa Gillam and Faith Lewis each had 12 points for Amherst (2-2, 1-2) and Gillam had three of the Comets\u2019 four 3-pointers on the night. \nDespite struggling from 3-point range as of late, Daniels knew what Amherst could do beyond the arc and wasn\u2019t at all surprised by how well the Comets shot against his team. \n\u201cThey push the ball hard. They play hard. They play very aggressive defense. They rebound the ball well,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cWe got exactly what we thought (Amherst) would do. ... They shot the ball well from the 3-point line and they made some key ones.\u201d \nWestlake travels to Berea-Midpark Dec. 9 to continue SWC play while Amherst hosts Lakewood.

The disruptive technology allows businesses to stay connected with their customers to provide the ultimate customer experience. For example, based on the insights it can reveal, organisations can uncover unique, innovative ways to comprehend and influence customer activity including behaviour and buying trends. With that, they have the ability to transform the way consumers\u2019 access information while providing businesses with valuable data which can help increase economic benefits. \nLeveraging IoT for initiatives such as predictive maintenance and resource management alone has the potential economic impact of $4 trillion to $11 trillion by 2025. \nSeeing the impact IoT is generating across these and many more industries, citizens expect government agencies and public services to also reap its benefits. So how can the public sector make the most of this technology? \nAccording to IDC, worldwide IoT spending will rise to $1.4 trillion by 2021 and still has a trajectory to increase even further in the future, with the public sector being no exception to the rule. IoT has already become a major player in transforming the public sector, including new projects to keep citizens connected at all times and continuously transforming cities to keep up with the fast pace of the digital age. How IoT is disrupting UK cities \nIn recent years, making UK cities \u2018smarter\u2019 has been high on the agenda for the public sector. In March 2015, it was announced the government has pledged to invest \u00a340 million in IoT with the intention of making the UK an international leader in innovative technologies. Since then the government initiated new plans utilising IoT in order to develop smart cities for their citizens. \nA number of cities in the UK have made strides in their smart city journey. For example, London has been a leader in implementing urban innovations for its citizens. With initiatives including: \n\u2022 NHS Testbed \u2013 THIUM for Dementia \nThis project is pioneering IoT for dementia patients in order to significantly improve support for them and their carers. The testbed is ran by Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and funded by the Department of Health. This entails using connected devices that allow clinicians to monitor their patient\u2019s safety and wellbeing while they\u2019re at home. These real-time devices will alert clinicians if they identify a problem.

But before Daniel Craig claimed ownership of that closet of suits, the James Bond franchise was searching for a new 007 to replace Pierce Brosnan. And it seems that our home-bred Hugh Jackman piqued their interest, having just begun playing Wolverine in the 2000 hit X-Men . But Jackman turned down the part and the rest, as they say, is history. \n\u201cI was about to do X-Men 2 and a call came from my agent asking if I\u2019d be interested in Bond,\u201d Jackman revealed in a recent interview with Variety. \n\u201cI just felt at the time that the scripts had become so unbelievable and crazy, and I felt like they needed to become grittier and real.\u201d \nThe ridiculousness of the Bond scripts isn\u2019t something Jackman voiced alone. Even Pierce Brosnan admitted things were getting a bit out of hand with that invisible car being Exhibit A. That aside, another motivating factor for Jackman to turn down the part was the desire to do other projects. \n\u201cI was also worried that between Bond and X-Men , I\u2019d never have time to do different things,\u201d he said. \n\u201cI always tried to do different things. But there was a time between X-Men 3 and the first Wolverine movie when I could see the roles getting smaller. People wanted me to play that kind of hero part exclusively. It felt a little bit claustrophobic.\u201d \nAnd in sticking to his guns, Jackman did manage to branch out of the \u2018hero\u2019 part, with films like The Prestige, The Fountain, Les Mis\u00e9rables , and the upcoming The Greatest Showman .

Photograph:BCCI Riding on a career-best 243 in the third Test against Sri Lanka, India captain Virat Kohli on Thursday, jumped three places to grab the second position among batsmen in the ICC Test rankings. \nKohli's double ton was followed by a 50 in the second innings as he finished with 610 runs in the series, which India won 1-0 after the first and third Test ended in draws in Kolkata and New Delhi. \nThe India captain, who slammed back-to-back double-centuries and recorded three-figure scores in three consecutive matches, was ranked sixth at the start of the series, but leapfrogged David Warner, Cheteshwar Pujara, Kane Williamson and Joe Root after the stupendous run, which saw him average 152.50. \nThough 45 points separate him from Australia captain Steve Smith, Kohli will be eyeing the chance of reaching the zenith in all three formats since he is the current No. 1 in ODIs and T20Is, the ICC said in a statement. \nIMAGE: After scoring a century in the first Ashes Test at The Gabba in Brisbane, Steve Smith reached 941 points. However, this week he has dropped 3 points to 938. Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images Smith though has been in a different league and last week reached 941 points, the joint fifth-highest in terms of the points tally in batting history in Tests. \nSmith is now on 938 points while Kohli is on 893 points. \nFormer Australia captain Ricky Ponting is the only batsman to have been at the top in all three formats at the same time \u2013 in December-January 2005-06, while his compatriot Matthew Hayden is the other batsman to have topped all three formats. \nThough Smith enjoys a substantial lead over Kohli, the competition for second to fifth positions remains intense. Before this Test, only 11 points separated second-ranked Pujara from fifth-ranked Kohli. \nFollowing the latest performances, the gap has increased slightly with 28 points now separating second-ranked Kohli from fifth-ranked Williamson. \nAmong other Indians, opener Murali Vijay (up three places to 25th) and middle-order batsman Rohit Sharma (up six places to 40th) have moved up in the rankings. \nPujara slipped two places to the fourth spot. IMAGE: Sri Lankan captain Dinesh Chandimal made his way to into the Top-10 for the first time in his career. Photograph: BCCI In the bowlers\u2019 rankings, Ravindra Jadeja slumped to the third position after losing a place while R Ashwin was unmoved at the fourth spot. \nIn the all-rounders\u2019 list, Jadeja was at the second spot, while Ashwin fell a rung to be at the fourth position. \nFor Sri Lanka, captain Dinesh Chandimal moved into the top 10 for the very first time, gaining eight places to take ninth position after finishing the series with 366 runs. \nAll-rounder Angelo Mathews moved up seven places to 23rd after scoring 111 in the first innings of the 3rd Test, while Dhananjaya de Silva's match-saving 119 in the second innings lifted him nine places to 47th. \nIn the ICC Test Team Rankings, India lost one point but stayed well ahead of South Africa at the top of the rankings, while Sri Lanka remained on its pre-series tally of 94 points in sixth place. \u00a9 Copyright 2017 PTI.

This is the only way to heaven and its not conditional on going to church even Satan goes to church to see who he can recruit and he gets a lot from church everyone going to church are not saved. Which is why Christians get a bad name. just my .02\nA lot of this I agree with. Absolutely many sitting in the pews are there for a multitude of reasons which do not involve the worship of a Holy God and Creator.\nBut on going to church I think some might need to read Hebrews 10:25 . There is no excuse for not being involved in a part of the body of Christ (his Church). Some need teaching and some need to teach and all need to be involve in corporate worship to God. Psalm 22:3. God dwells in the praises of his people) and Mathew 18:20 ( where 2 or more are gathered together in together My name I am in the midst of them) encourages us as beleivers. This shows the importance of gathering together with others.\nSome in The Church are given the spiritual gift of discernment to decide where the enemy is putting himself and this includes the assembling of the saints of God. I Corinthians 12:10 This is for the edification of the body (congregation). Anyone who stays out of a church gathering because of who might be there (sinners, evil folks, satan followers, or even satan himself ) is truly deceived. The Bible even tells us that there are wolves in sheep's clothing so this is nothing new. Mathew 7:15.\nMy personal belief is that once we die we, as believers, are together forever in the presence of our Holy God doing what we were created for, praising Him. Don't ever discount the spiritual nature of this, it is not a carnal experience and none of our feeble minds can begin to conceive what it will be like to be in his radiant presence.\nI was not saying we shouldn't go to church and I agree with everything you said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:20.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d796a13f000d6cc6d6fe45e9dc40acd49d434479", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmPJr73mbL6mqEM.XF4J_9OH61kvkopg0PnIG3wI2yJAeEmOpSWjzhWbeuXvdIQf9GtWxItgmDAQz_2niZ.SB7I67tI.O5ZsCQ-", "site_full": "reason.com", "site": "reason.com", "site_section": "http://reason.com/people/scott-shackford/all.xml", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics", "media"], "section_title": "Scott Shackford: Reason.com articles and blog posts.", "title": "Supreme Court Today Mulls Whether Bakers Can Be Forced to Make Gay Wedding Cakes", "title_full": "Supreme Court Today Mulls Whether Bakers Can Be Forced to Make Gay Wedding Cakes - Hit & Run : Reason.com", "published": "2017-12-05T19:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 237, "participants_count": 51, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1jn4vzj53eli5.cloudfront.net/db/15124226679654.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8107, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ca202cbc5450cda755ba2ffe973287a43390fba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmPJr73mbL6mqEM.XF4J_9OH61kvkopg0PnIG3wI2yJAeEmOpSWjzhWbeuXvdIQf9GtWxItgmDAQz_2niZ.SB7IrOfbmYSzyiHw1kFESFWsiyL1_cRK0K18", "ord_in_thread": 172, "author": "John Galt is back", "published": "2017-12-07T09:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "EscherEnigma|12.5.17 @ 11:01AM|#\nIn short?
