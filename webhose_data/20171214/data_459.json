US enemies now lack the comfort of a predictable adversary, as do domestic adversaries \u2014 and allies. \nSo far, the President has not paid a tangible price for living up to his most controversial promises. But he is taking big risks, especially internationally, and a reckoning may yet come. \nWashington has yet to learn whether the backlash among its allies over Trump\u2019s latest declaration will leave it alone in an hour of need. Anyway, Trump supporters who believe in his America First concept care little that the President is infuriating the country\u2019s friends around the world. \nTrump has also been as good as his word in other areas. \nAs promised, he has moved to renegotiate NAFTA, pulled out of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, walked out of the Paris climate accord, targeted the Iran nuclear deal and introduced a travel ban for residents of some majority Muslim nations, while adopting other radical immigration policies. \nTrump vowed to preside over economic growth and set the stock market soaring. The gross domestic product expanded 3.3% in the third quarter, a three-year high, and the Dow just topped 24,000 points. \nThe message from the White House is that Trump is making good on his promise to shake things up. \n\u201cWhile previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering,\u201d the President said. \nTrump\u2019s re-election campaign jumped on the narrative of a President who is as good as his word. \n\u201cOnce again, President Trump has demonstrated the kind of leadership that Washington does not recognize or understand \u2026 with Donald Trump a promise made is a promise kept,\u201d said the campaign\u2019s executive director, Michael Glassner. \nMore than meets the eye \nBut with the presidency, things are rarely so cut and dried. There is a reason Trump was breaking ground on Jerusalem: Previous presidents judged that the political capital they could gain with a similar move was not justified by the risks. Those have included concerns of inciting Middle East violence or offending Palestinians by prejudging final status peace talks on Jerusalem, a city they also regard as their future capital. \nThe fate of Americans abroad \u2014 easy targets in any violent backlash in the Middle East \u2014 also weighs heavily on presidential consciences. Trump decided to take the risk anyway. \nCritics might also point out that Trump\u2019s list of promises kept is an incomplete and politically expedient one. \nHe has tended to honor pledges that inflame his populist creed or pander to key constituencies like evangelicals and rich donors, including casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, both of whom had intense interest in Jerusalem. \nBut Trump has whiffed on some of his more complex pledges. He\u2019s hardly delivered health insurance \u201cfor everybody\u201d like he said he would. The GOP tax plan, according to multiple independent studies, cuts access to health care and helps Trump\u2019s rich friends more than his working class supporters. \nHe also vowed to get tough with China on trade. But that has failed to materialize as he seeks Beijing\u2019s help in the North Korea nuclear crisis. \nTrump\u2019s rash of promise keeping, including his decision to double down on derailing the Iran deal \u2014 he refused to certify Iran\u2019s compliance in October \u2014 his touting of a travel ban that appears to stigmatize Muslims and his defiance of the global consensus on climate change may reflect deeper political forces. \nThe Russia investigation\u2019s cloud is only getting thicker while his approval rating sits at 35%. And until the GOP tax bill passes, he has few legislative achievements. That means Trump has never needed his supporters more. And CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak reported this week that the President is fretting about losing the political base without which he would shed all political viability. \nAll that may explain why he was prepared to accept the risks of his Jerusalem move, which could stifle his administration\u2019s Israeli-Palestinian peace drive, unite US allies in Europe and the Middle East against him, and trigger extremism or reprisals against American citizens and interests. \nIn that light, his move seems less like a grand gesture of a rare promise-keeping politician than a cynical act of political calculation. \nPolarizing nature \nThe polarizing nature of Trump\u2019s move was reflected in the responses of two veteran former US officials steeped in Middle East politics. \nElliott Abrams, who worked on George W. Bush\u2019s national security council, said the President\u2019s decision was a recognition of reality that Jerusalem is considered by Israel as its capital, and he scoffed at predictions that the President could incite an uprising as \u201ccompletely overblown.\u201d \n\u201cThere are intifadas among the Palestinians when the Palestinian Authority allows it and foments it,\u201d Abrams said on CNN. \nBut Aaron David Miller, a Middle East peace negotiator for Republican and Democratic presidents, said Trump was prioritizing his own political convenience over wider security interests. \n\u201cThis had nothing, in my judgment, to do with the pursuit of Israeli-Palestinian peace,\u201d Miller said on CNN. \n\u201cThis seems to be a political statement by a willful President determined, A, to deliver and to basically say to those who say, \u2018You can\u2019t do it, you wouldn\u2019t do it and you shouldn\u2019t do it,\u2019 to say, \u2018I can deliver.\u2019\u201c \nIt\u2019s not the first time that Trump has defied international opinion to make such a point \u2013 his moves on climate and Iran fit the same category. \nBut the cost of those moves could be less immediate than any backlash from the Jerusalem gamble. \nThe downside for deserting the fight against climate change, in rising sea levels and ravaged weather patterns, may be decades in the future; the loss of US influence to China yielded by exiting the TPP is intangible right now to American voters; if NAFTA falls apart the economic consequences may not be felt immediately. \nBut just because the President hasn\u2019t paid a price yet doesn\u2019t mean it will not happen. \nAnd it\u2019s also possible, if his luck holds, that the President may become more trusting of his decisions, more disdainful of the advice of allies and establishment advisers and more tempted to give his instincts full rein. \nSuch behavior could have implications for the North Korean crisis as experts and allies warn of the consequences of a war on the peninsula that has long been considered as too horrific to contemplate. \nTrump says the isolated state will not be allowed to threaten the United States with a ballistic missile tipped with a nuclear warhead \u2014 a prospect that is just months away from becoming a reality. \nAnd the President is getting a taste for living up to his promises.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abrams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george w. bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elliott abrams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheldon adelson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin liptak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael glassner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nafta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestinian authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:03.039+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "855da28cb69cb6a0537199787bd14c1a2539ac28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMopbZsP2F.BPzPPlhmSPo0PzP.MXnL685XA02eQJCaMVO0jb8obn3WJpCoLCDG92ObHZCnH3kcEpc5h.aS02Qje1KB7vkM5djc-", "site_full": "trueviralnews.com", "site": "trueviralnews.com", "site_section": "http://trueviralnews.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "True Viral News", "title": "The forgotten survivors of the Gyumri earthquake", "title_full": "The forgotten survivors of the Gyumri earthquake", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CZ", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "855da28cb69cb6a0537199787bd14c1a2539ac28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMopbZsP2F.BPzPPlhmSPo0PzP.MXnL685XA02eQJCaMVO0jb8obn3WJpCoLCDG92ObHZCnH3kcEpc5h.aS02Qje1KB7vkM5djc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "TVN stuff", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "The forgotten survivors of the Gyumri earthquake", "text": "The forgotten survivors of the Gyumri earthquake 07.12.2017 tweet \nGyumri, Armenia \u2013 In Gyumri time is measured as \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d the earthquake. On December 7, 1988, an earthquake measuring a magnitude of 7.0 on the Richter scale struck northern Armenia, killing at least 25,000 people and injuring hundreds of thousands more. A countless number of people were left homeless as high-rise apartment blocks collapsed like dominoes. \nGyumri, Armenia\u2019s second largest city, suffered much of the damage. \nSoon after the tragic event, the Soviet Union collapsed and in 1991, Armenia gained its independence, but this transition was full of turmoil. A war with neighbouring Azerbaijan, with consequent energy shortages and an economic blockade, left the landlocked country and its inhabitants in dire conditions. \nA quarter of a century later, although the situation has improved for Armenia, the city of Gyumri has the highest poverty rate in the country at about 45 percent. The city has lost nearly half of its population since 1988, due in part to unemployment and emigration of the labour force. \nAccording to local NGOs, a few thousand familieslive in makeshift shelters because they cannot afford to buy or rent the newly built apartments that were erected in the city after the earthquake. \nDuring the Soviet era, Gortsaranayin 2A and 2B, twin buildings on the outskirts of Gyumri, accommodated around 120 families.

(Image: IBS) \nSEOUL,   \u2013 A major heavy ion accelerator project has been given the green light, with a budget of 1.4 trillion won and an expected completion date in 2021, according to the science ministry. \nThe Ministry of Science and ICT\u2019s business monitoring task force announced plans on Wednesday for the construction of a RAON heavy ion accelerator in Daejeon, after conducting an in-depth analysis of the project. \nRAON was pushed as part of Daejeon\u2019s International Science Business Belt project under the Lee Myung-bak government, and was originally scheduled to have been completed by 2017. \nHowever, the project was postponed due to land acquisition and other delays, leading to increased cost estimates and the elimination of some of the proposed facilities and devices from the plan as a result. \nThe RAON heavy ion accelerator is a research facility where various kinds of heavy ions from protons to uranium will be accelerated to produce rare isotopes, which are valuable in nuclear physics and biomedical sciences. \nAs the government will pour a total of over 1.4 trillion won into the major project, with over 600 billion allotted to building facilities alone, the science ministry\u2019s task force has chimed in to keep the project on track without increasing the overall budget. \nUnder the supervision of the group, which was first formed in August and consists of 12 experts, the RAON project went through restructuring to improve its efficiency, which saw some of the proposed building plans cancelled. \nIn addition, the task force has proposed to create an agency dedicated to research projects within the International Science Business Belt which will be given a budget of 4 billion won over the next four years to support joint international research projects and nurture research personnel. \n\u201cGiven the many major projects where budgets went up in the past, it\u2019s worth nothing that this time, experts including researchers and developers were able to communicate through a task force and found ways to restructure the project, setting a precedent for other major research projects in the future,\u201d said You Young-min, the head of the Ministry of Science and ICT. \nHyunsu Yim (hyunsu@koreabizwire.com)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ion accel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee myung-bak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyunsu yim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "major heavy ion accelerator project", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daejeon major heavy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daejeon   business , construction & real estate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "industries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of science and ict", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "top news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international science business belt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of science", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ict", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "daejeon home", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daejeon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:04.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c2dec8e962a33a6a5a456cf9da2bf3ade66b936c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xac3wRuAFKDK9BwdzNOLqSp2hyc1Nkt5W4tVyK3YTdDlrMb7pXPHn.r9DtHg2Jw8tblpp_6gmjLMvQ-", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/jobs", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Jobs/Vacancies - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "Rivers State Teachers Recruitment 2012 (520)", "title_full": "Rivers State Teachers Recruitment 2012 - Jobs/Vacancies (520) - Nigeria", "published": "2017-12-05T04:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.015, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 951, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1758ec9d8784c831a9002a45f89bf16d0733b26a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xac3wRuAFKDK9BwdzNOLqSp2hyc1Nkt5W4tVyK3YTdDlrMb7pXPHn.r9DtHg2Jw8tblMo1VhyFBh34.ICaBg_irsg--", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "tonero263", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Food for thought, CONVENTION and Rivers civil servants,is like....anything you add,na you sabi.

He's been in really good form recently and been a threat for us putting balls into the box and from set pieces. \nIf he's out for a long period, I think it's something we need to address in the January transfer window. \nANDREW GREENWOOD \nA big one. I think he was playing his best football since he arrived and was full of confidence. It seems like most injuries we get these days are serious knee ligament ones. \nThe only silver lining is that we have the January transfer window to try and get a replacement which will be easier said than done though. \nAMER STANSFIELD-MUSHTAQ \nIt's a blow as Robbie is playing well so on form at present.

The scheme was first launched in 2011 and is available across the UK and offers a grant towards the price of eligible new cars. The paperwork for the grant application is handled by the dealer you purchase your car from. \nHMRC publishes a list of qualifying cars, and only cars listed are eligible for the grant. The list is divided in to 3 main categories. Category 1. Vehicles with CO2 emissions lower than 50g/km and a 'zero-emission' range of at least 112km. Category 2. Vehicles with CO2 emissions lower than 50g/km and a 'zero-emission' range of at least 16km. Category 3. Vehicles with CO2 emissions of 50 to 75g/km and a 'zero-emission' range of at least 32km. \nThe maximum grant of \u00a34,500 (previously \u00a35,000) is available for cars listed in category 1. For cars listed in categories 2 and 3, the maximum grant is \u00a32,500. The grant will pay for up to 35% of the purchase price for these vehicles up to the monetary cap of each category. The scheme is open to qualifying purchases by private individuals and businesses. \nPlanning notes \nTo qualify for the grant, the cars must also come with a warranty covering batteries for at least three years, or 60,000 miles. There is also an 'on the road' price cap of \u00a360,000 over which no grant is available. This means that many popular environmentally friendly electric cars such as some Tesla models are not available under the scheme. \nAs part of the Budget measures, it was confirmed that the a further \u00a3100m has been set aside to ensure the scheme will remain available until at least 2020 to help encourage the growth of this sector. \n\nStart ups require a quick response and have lots to do quite apart from the administrative setup of the business.

(Image: Korean Forestry Promotion Institute) \nDAEJEON,   \u2013 Drones and artificial intelligence will do the work of humans in scouring the nation\u2019s forests and identifying dead trees caused by pine wilt disease. \nThe Korea Forestry Promotion Institute has developed artificial intelligence which employs an algorithm that can accurately pinpoint objects 10 centimeters tall from a single bird\u2019s eye view photo snapped by a drone. Equipped with this highly precise technology, the AI will amass data of dead pine trees in a database which the institute has stated will be used for training purposes. Pine wilt disease effectively strangles trees to death as tiny roundworms infiltrate the inner workings and block off the channels through which water and nutrients flow. (Image: Yonhap) \nPreviously, the only way of accumulating data regarding the spread of pine wilt disease was for experts to take to the field and examine each tree in person. This method had the disadvantages of not only being slow and expensive, but could also generate varying results depending on the expert\u2019s level of training and exhaustion. \nPine wilt disease effectively strangles trees to death as tiny roundworms infiltrate the inner workings and block off the channels through which water and nutrients flow. Earning the moniker \u201cthe Black Death of pine trees\u201d for the threat it poses to forests, the presence of the disease in the country was first discovered in 1988 in Busan. Previously, the only way of accumulating data regarding the spread of pine wilt disease was for experts to take to the field and examine each tree in person.

He had been extradited back to the UK to face 19 charges of indecent and serious sexual assault against 10 pupils while headmaster at St Benedict's School, Ealing. \nYesterday an Old Bailey jury found him guilty on all charges, according to BBC News . Metropolitan Police Former priest Laurence Soper was found guilty of sex abuse against minors by an Old Bailey jury yesterday. \nProsecutor Gillian Etherton QC had told the London court: 'It is the prosecution's case that 'punishments' as described by the complainants in this case were carried out by Soper in entirely inappropriate ways and circumstances and on many occasions with what can only have been sexual motive.' \nShe added that he had used 'fake reasons' to justify punishments; students could face a caning \u2013 or sexual assault \u2013 for 'failing to use double margins', and 'using the (wrong) staircase'. It was heard that Soper, described by an alleged victim as a 'sadist', offered more lenient beatings with the cane if students would receive it with their trousers off. \nSoper, formerly the Abbot of Ealing, has denied all the charges laid against him. \nHe was living in Rome at the headquarters of his Benedictine order when was called to the UK to be interviewed about the claims of abuse. He was granted bail to return to Rome, but fled to Kosovo in March 2011 just before he was due to attend a police station in the UK, taking 204,000 euros with him. He told the court he fled the country out of 'stupidity and cowardice'. \nThe judgment follows four other allegations of sexual abuse at the hands of teachers at the private school. The most recent conviction was that of the 'devil in a dog collar' Father David Pearce, who was jailed in 2009 after admitting to 11 historic charges of indecent assault. In a statement heard by the court St Benedict's apologised for 'serious wrongs of the past'. \n'The school regrets that Soper did not have the courage to plead guilty,' said Lord Carlile QC. \n'The result has been that innocent victims, whom he abused when they were boys in the school, were compelled to give evidence. The tough lessons of the past have been learned, and the errors and crimes of the past are in the daily consciousness and conscience of the school management.' \nSoper is being held in custody and will be sentenced on December 19.

Tannis Weinstein, president and country manager for ASSA ABLOY Canada (the company also sponsored the event), has had to create scheduling workarounds in order to spend quality time with her husband and children while still meeting the major demands of running an organization. And all this while essentially living in two different countries.Weinstein and her family are based in New Jersey, but she travels for three weeks a month to Canada and overseas to meet job requirements. With such a hectic schedule, having a supportive family, says Weinstein, as well as helping hands from friends and other school parents becomes essential. \u201cIt takes a village,\u201d said Weinstein, coining a popular phrase. Facebook Live and Facetime are also invaluable tools for family time when face-to-face isn\u2019t always an option.Weinstein said her current role at ASSA ABLOY is her \u201cdream job\u201d and that her employer is supportive and appreciates the complexities of family life.Weinstein also spoke of the importance of networking in order to achieve career goals \u2014 something that doesn\u2019t come easily to many women, she said. \u201cFirst you have to decide what you want to do,\u201d she said. \u201cThen you have to get over yourself and ask.\u201dWeinstein said that women have achieved a lot in the corporate security workforce, but there is clearly still a long way to go.The day\u2019s second speaker, Lisa Carpenter, TD\u2019s AVP Canada for fraud operations, financial crimes & fraud management group, advocates cultivating multiple interests in order to be an effective manager and parent. A single mother, Carpenter spends lots of time with her daughter, travelling with her on vacation or to softball tournaments. She also sets aside vacation time for herself and spends regular time in the gym and pool. Sundays are reserved for watching football. Allowing time for oneself or one\u2019s activities in an essential part of building a life and a career, she said.Carpenter has worked for three major banking organizations in her career, setting goals for herself, diversifying her skillset, and adapting to change. Be prepared to step out of your comfort zone, she advised, and embrace new challenges. Look for mentors who can guide you, as well as sponsors and champions who can be your advocate and recognize your accomplishments.ASIS Toronto also held its AGM after the presentations. A new executive will be installed after an election is conducted online \u2014 a first for the chapter.

Zero Shuttle will run a 5.5 km loop from the Pangyo Zero City entrance to Pangyo Station at a speed of 25 km/h. A self-driving vehicle specialist said as long as flaws are not detected during the safety inspections, road tests should be possible before the end of the year. (Image: Gyeonggi Province) \nA self-driving vehicle specialist said as long as flaws are not detected during the safety inspections, road tests should be possible before the end of the year. \nOther matters that the provincial government has deemed necessary to take care of are a new set of traffic signals and information pamphlets for riders. \nThrough negotiations with the Korean National Police Agency, 12 traffic control boxes located at intersections where Zero Shuttle would pass through were replaced last month. \nThe information pamphlets provide details on the rights and
