I am looking for a girl, who would like to participate in a fantasy where I just use you for sex. You completely give yourself to me, and let me have my fun with you. You are totally submissive and get put in degrading positions, just to make me happy. Lots of dirty talk, me being degrading to you, bending you over, spreading you open, telling you that you are simply my toy, etc... lots of hot situations. I've done some of this fantasy with a girlfriend, and I just want to try the fantasy with a girl I've never had sex with before... Basically, I come over and use you like a toy. I just want to tell you that I'm just using you to make me feel good. I want to tell you to spread your legs, and let me inside you, so I can get what I need, and you just obey and let me do what I want. Maybe you are just so startled by me talking to you that way and being so bold, that you just feel the need to do whatever I say... I have been interested in sex play with peeing involved too, but also not required. Just something to possibly discuss. What's NOT okay: I am not interested in whipping you, hitting you, slapping you, choking you, hurting you, or leaving any kinds of marks. What IS okay: I am not opposed to pulling hair, light biting, handcuffs, tying you up, or blindfolding you, as long as we discuss it beforehand and it's completely consensual. A safe word will be used. None of this stuff is required. Looks aren't that important... In fact, I'm actually more into bigger, curvy girls, but others are okay too... I just need to \"use you\". Of course this is all completely discreet, as all personal fantasies should be. You might be a girl reading this and be very interested, but be too nervous or scared that something bad might happen to contact me. Don't worry about that with me, I will do whatever you need to feel safe and comfortable. I am honestly not interested in harming you in any way, I just want to have some fun fulfilling my fantasy and hopefully yours as well! A safe word will be used in case you really want to stop.

However, at that time hardly anyone could have imagined that in the years to come the \u2018Power Star\u2019 would carve his own identity and win over a legion of die-hard fans. Today, as Pawan celebrates his birthday, we revisit some of his most significant big screen outings. \nTholi Prema: Released in 1998, Tholi Prema is regarded as the film which kick started Pawan Kalyan\u2019s rise to stardom. Touted as a romantic-drama, it created quite a stir amongst youngsters thanks to the sizzling chemistry between the actor and his vivacious co-star Keerthy Reddy. A runaway hit at the box office, Tholi Prema bagged the National award for best feature film. Moreover, it also won several Nandi awards. \nJalsa: Directed by Trkivikram Srinivas, Jalsa revolved around the intense rivalry between a virtuous gym instructor and a cruel land grabber. Boasting of some melodious songs and pulsating onscreen confrontations, the film fared extremely well on the commercial front, helping Pawan Kalyan bag a Filmfare nomination. Also featuring Ileana and Prakash Raj in important roles, it was later on dubbed into Hindi as Yeh Hai Jalsa . \nGabbar Singh: An attempted remake of Salman Khan\u2019s Dabangg , Gabbar Singh highlighted the exploits of a maverick police officer. Directed by Harish Shankar, the film gave Pawan Kalyan an ideal opportunity to showcase the rough and though side of his personality. Moreover, the \u2018Power Star\u2019 also floored all and sundry courtesy his impressive chemistry with Shruti Haasan. Interestingly, its sequel Sardaar is in the works at present. \nGopala Gopala: Touted as fun-filled satire, this Suresh Babu-produced film is best remembered for taking a firm stand against blind faith and fake god men. Essaying the role of lord Krishna, Pawan Kalyan infused life to the on screen proceedings because of his lively mannerisms and sizzling rapport with Venkatesh. Interestingly, Gopala Gopla was a remake of Oh My God which featured Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal in the lead. \nKushi: One of the biggest commercial successes of Pawan Kalyan\u2019s career, Kushi saw him essay the role of a lover boy with absolute ease. Boasting of some catchy tracks and heartwarming romantic scenes, the film helped the actor bag a Filmfare nomination. Interestingly, it was a retelling of an eponymous Tamil movie which had Vijay in the lead. \nAttarintiki Daredi: Serving as strong proof of Pawan Kalyan\u2019s growth as an actor, Attarintiki Daredi saw him play the role of a young man who tries to improve the strained relations between his aunt and grandfather. Made on a budget of 550 million, it collected nearly 2 billion at the ticket window. Interestingly, the film was recently remade in Kannada as Ranna .

HELENS Council and Merseyside Police have re-emphasised their support of the One Punch Can Kill campaign following the death of a man following an assault on Baldwin Street. \nIt is the second 'one punch' incident to have resulted in a death this year in the town centre. \nIn July much-loved actor and poet Len Saunders died in hospital nine days after being punched by a drunken yob on Ward Street. \nAnd a 60-year-old man from Liverpool died on Tuesday three days after an assault on Baldwin Street. \nAhead of the festive period, St Helens Council and its community safety partners are underlining the link between too much alcohol and its potentially lethal consequences through the One Punch Can Kill campaign. \nAs always during this time of year, there is an increase in the number of people heading out into town to celebrate Christmas and New Year and police patrols will be stepped up and officers will work closely with council CCTV operators to ensure residents and town centre visitors stay safe. \nSt Helens Council\u2019s cabinet member for community safety, Councillor Lisa Preston said: \u201cEveryone enjoys a night out, especially at Christmas, and no one wants to ruin the fun. \n\"But, the actions of a small minority can ruin Christmas festivities for everyone else and we want people to enjoy themselves while out in the town centre \u2013 especially at this time of year. \n\u201cThe whole community was shocked and saddened to hear about the two fatal incidents that took place in our town centre this year which have had devastating impacts on the victims\u2019 families, and is something we certainly don't want to see happen on our streets again. \n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that alcohol affects us all in different ways and just one too many can turn a great night out into a tragedy.\u201d \nSt Helens Local Policing Inspector Matt Drennan added: \u201cMerseyside Police fully supports the 'One Punch' campaign. \n\"A seemingly innocuous disagreement people have whilst drunk can have devastating consequences for the victim, their families and friends, so people need to look after themselves and those they are out with over the festive period, and all year round. \n\"There will be extra police in St Helens to ensure that, for the vast majority of people who want to celebrate this festive period, their night is as safe as possible.\u201d \nSt Helens Council is also supporting a regional awareness campaign this winter about the alcohol laws some people forget. \nDrinkLessEnjoyMore reminds people that it is illegal to serve someone who is drunk and it is illegal to buy a drink for someone who is drunk. \nIf you are drunk, you could be refused service at a bar or club, and if you buy a drink for someone who is drunk you personally could be fined \u00a31,000. \nMerseyside Police are actively enforcing these laws in St Helens, where bar staff have been engaged in the awareness campaign, and cautionary posters, beer mats and bar runners are being displayed. \nTips have been issued to keep people safe: \n\u00b7 Don't drink on an empty stomach \n\u00b7 Stay in control: The Chief Medical Officer recommends two to three units for both men and women \n\u00b7 Think about alternating alcoholic drinks with soft drinks \n\u00b7 Stay hydrated: drink water before you go out, and during the night \n\u00b7 Don't leave your drinks unattended \n\u00b7 Avoid trouble: alcohol can reduce your ability to think straight and affect the way you process information. Don't be drawn into arguments or problems, walk away! \n\u00b7 Plan your night: tell someone where you are going and what time you expect to be back. Book a taxi before you go out and take the taxi firm's details \n*a pint of lower-strength lager, beer or cider (ABV 3.6%) is 2 units \na single shot (25ml) of spirits (ABV 40%) is 1 unit \na standard glass (175ml) of red, white or rose wine (ABV 12%) is 2 units \nFor more information about the One Punch Can Kill campaign, visit: safersthelens.org.uk \nReduce the chances of your night getting cut short.

Realizing it means drawing the Middle East, the region into a huge calamity,\u201d Yildirim said. \nTrump announced his decision on Wednesday despite widespread international opposition to formally recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. \nJerusalem remains at the core of the Israel-Palestine conflict, with Palestinians hoping that East Jerusalem -- now occupied by Israel -- might eventually serve as the capital of a future Palestinian state. \nAhead of his election last year, Trump repeatedly promised to relocate the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \nTurkey will host an extraordinary meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation on Dec. 13 to discuss the U.S. move. \nEnter.News ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "masoud barzani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yildirim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "binali yildirim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "krg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judaism", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:02.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7b27203cd2cc74b24d904d76e8b6e22cdf81d9fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSX66fZOWxt.Y538NTwyHgQ_J7eCIRfTrLk9K745vP1nA5MyqKvxR8rum8pkdEdIyaFDRoRPnolqd65tFsbDAcVL_sBEcGyulIHfXaJmJkghg-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Assassin's Creed", "title": "Expectations for Hidden Ones DLC", "title_full": "Expectations for Hidden Ones DLC : assassinscreed", "published": "2017-12-07T06:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 20, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "35ca26d749be594bc38329327c1a2ea5a30c7957", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSX66fZOWxt.Y538NTwyHgQ_J7eCIRfTrLk9K745vP1nA5MyqKvxR8rum8pkdEdIyaFDRoRPnolqd65tFsbDAcVL_sBEcGyulIsPx0R8D7WiIqcXAXXeg8VdFc06SfnTBO", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Pokedude97", "published": "2017-12-07T08:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "You said most of what I want, especially real assassination animations.

This disclosed a total of 624 indecent images, including 114 videos. \n\u201cThese included sadistic sexual abuse of a baby and girls aged from three to nine years old,\u201d said Mr Taylor \nLiverpool Crown Court heard that Broadhurst, who works part time as a DJ, had been identified as an offender following his Skype conversations with another man about the sexual abuse of children. \nDevon and Cornwall Police notified Merseyside Police and they went to his home at breakfast time on April 20 this year and found both he and his wife present. When later interviewed he described it as \u201cescapism linked to his depression.\u201d \nBroadhurst, who has since separated from his wife and now lives in Leigh, pleaded guilty to seven offences involved making indecent photographs, possessing them making indecent pseudo photographs and possessing prohibited images. \nSentencing him to eight months imprisonment suspended for two years Judge Anil Murray said, \u201cSince your arrest you have taken steps to address your warped desires.\u201d \nHe pointed out that Broadhurst had worked as a coach for a workforce children\u2019s team and while there was no suggestion he had visited the children, \u201cthese offences will mean all the parents of the children you have encountered will now be wondering.\u201d \nHe ordered him to attend an accredited sex offenders\u2019 treatment programme and to carry out 30 days rehabilitation activities. \nJudge Murray also ordered him to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for 10 years and imposed a Sexual Harm Prevention Order for the same length of time banning him from contact with under 16-year-olds. \nJeremy Rawson, defending, said that Broadhurst has no previous convictions. \u201cHe was a family man for many years. He is now separated from his wife and is lonely and remorseful figure.\u201d \nHe has always been employed and is in a management role. Since his behaviour came to light he has voluntarily attended courses and is still undergoing counselling and would benefit from help from the probation service. \n\u201cHe is lost and broken as a result of what has happened.

This range looks great, works well, and the controls are generally very easy to understand and use. STOVETOP: The glass/ceramic stovetop (see picture 1) has 5 heating elements, all of which heat very quickly and cook evenly. The 5 elements include a melt element and 2 small elements in the rear, and 2 dual zone elements in the front (where you can use a small or large heating element). My minor criticism is with the stovetop controls (see picture 2). The rear controls are direct and logical\\u2014the further you turn counter-clockwise the hotter the elements get. The dual zone front burners controls are very different. For the large zone, you turn counter clockwise up to \u00bd the dial (to pointing down) to increase heat. For the small zone you turn clockwise, again up to \u00bd the dial, to increase the heat. Once you\\u2019re familiar with the controls, it\\u2019s not a big deal but it\\u2019s still confusing to a degree. Also, the markings on the control are needlessly quite tiny and hard to read. OVEN: The oven heats very quickly and the controls are digital and easy to understand and use (see picture 3). It\\u2019s also quite spacious with 2 racks (see picture 4). OVERALL: The stainless steel is quite attractive and doesn\\u2019t seem to show fingerprints.
