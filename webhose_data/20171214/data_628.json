The 7 th of November to be exact, and from the 15 th of November, 40 days before the Christmas season began, it was a time of fasting and alms giving, which was the origin for gift-giving at Christmas. \u2018Christmas\u2019, comes from the Anglo-Saxon, Cristesm\u00e6sse , a word first recorded in 1038. It replaced the old pagan \u2018yule-tide\u2019, known back then as Geola and still referred to when talking about yule logs etc. As we know, the early Christian church instructed their emissaries to allow the Christianisation of some pagan traditions, a clever strategy on their part, to encourage people to give up their pagan ways by allowing them to retain some of the features and customs of the old religion. During this time of fasting and strict observance, it was not just the clergy who were expected to fast, attend prayers and vigils, and give alms to the more unfortunates of their world, but the secular communities also. It was a sign of your wealth and status if you could afford to give alms, something that many people were eager to do, for the Anglo-Saxons were as keen as any for their soul to get a free pass to the afterlife. \nSo, that was a lot of days of hardship for less than half the days in return of feasting! Anyway, that aside, only those who were employed to do necessary tasks, were excused from taking 12 days off work. Quite honestly, I could not imagine anyone complaining about that unless they were one of those who were engaged in those aforesaid important occupations. \nOh, there\u2019s one other little thing I have forgotten, there were no carnal relations allowed during this fasting period, after all, with all the vigils and extra prayers and psalm singing, how was one going to fit in having sex as well? But, should one fail in this expectation, and need absolution to restore their spiritual equilibrium with God, there was always confession and more fasting as penance. \nDuring King Edward\u2019s time, the Christmas period was usually spent at Gloucester. Edward was a keen sporting huntsman, something the church frowned on but were able to forgive because he was pious in other aspects of his life. Since the Forest of Dean was his favourite hunting ground, it seemed natural that after a good Autumn\u2019s hunting, that he would spend Christmas at King\u2019s Holme in Gloucester. He did, however, spend his last Christmas on this earth in the newly built palace of Westminster, whilst the new church of St Peter was consecrated that year, in time for the celebrations and his funeral. \nPoor Edward. His life\u2019s work, just ready for him to enjoy and he pops his clogs. At least he got to see it glorified to God, that must have been a very auspicious day for him, for he would be able to go to his rest with the knowledge that he had help to build one of the finest churches this side of the British Channel. No matter though, for the Normans would soon rebuild it more to their taste after the conquest. \nIt couldn\u2019t have been much fun that year of 1065, when he succumbed at last to the illness that seemed to have been brought on by the exile of his favourite courtier, Earl Tostig. The stress of losing Tostig and having to give in to the recalcitrant northerners a few months earlier, obviously affected him badly, because hitherto, he had been quite robust and sprightly for an old man of sixty; a great age in those times. So, Christmas of 1065 would have been quite a miserable one that year, so perhaps we should hearken back to happier times, and the Christmas of \u201964, when having had a good hunting session during the month of October and some of November, Edward was ready to put on his virtuous head, start the fasting and alms giving and settle down to pottage for supper each night until the 25 th December when the holiday would begin. \n\n\nKings Holme (now known as Kingsholm) was the site of an old Roman fortress, significant in size to have made the Roman city an important strategic place. We know that there was definitely a palace located there in 1051, and possibly, it may have dated back much further. At least by 1064, the palace was a well-used one, having been one of three important palaces in Edward\u2019s England, besides Westminster, in London, and Winchester. A hoard of early 11thc coins was found at the site and said to be a large collection from probably a wide area, indicating that this was not and just any old burh . To add to the evidence of its possible magnificence, excavations at the site have uncovered indications of large timber buildings dating to around this time. \nWe cannot say what King Edward\u2019s palace consisted of for sure, but there must have been quite a few domestic and guest quarters amongst the buildings found. At Christmas time, the whole of Edward\u2019s court would have been present in Gloucester, and among them, his secular officials as well as many foremost ecclesiasticals, bishops and abbots and possibly some Abbesses, some of whom were very powerful indeed. Many of the king\u2019s thegns would have been there, and possibly they brought their wives with them, perhaps some brought their sons also, and maybe their daughters, to be presented at court. If those who owed service to the king couldn\u2019t make it for whatever reason, then they would no doubt have to send a representative. The most important of the king\u2019s guests, would have been the archbishops, Ealdred of York and Stigand of Canterbury, and leading earl of the realm, Harold Godwinson. Aside from them, the other lords of the earldoms: Tostig of Northumbria, Morcar of Mercia, Oswulf of Bamburgh, Leofwin and Gyrth Godwinson, earls of the South Eastern Counties and East Anglia respectively, and Waltheof, son of the great Siward, Tostig\u2019s predecessor. No doubt they would also have brought their wives and perhaps their families too, not to mention their retinues, servants, and household guards. No wonder there were several large buildings found on the complex, they would have needed them to house everyone. \nIts most likely that Edward\u2019s great feasting hall was a timber construction, as no evidence for stone foundations have been found during the excavation. Edward had been building his wonderful complex at Westminster in stone, but that was a special undertaking that had been under construction for years. The king\u2019s feasting-hall was basically a large-scale version of the smaller halls that one might find on manorial estates. It was rectangular, with doors in the longest sides, front and back, and possibly with ante chambers at both ends, perhaps one of those rooms could have been where the king and queen slept. The space inside would have been large enough to contain a good few hundred people and was the heart of the community during the Christmas period. During the last few days of fasting before the feast of Christ, the final touches to the d\u00e9cor would have been carried out. Around the walls, were murals decorating the lime washed walls and possibly hung with fine embroidered hangings depicting biblical scenes. Holly and Ivy would have decked the hall, a throw-back to earlier times. Things might have changed somewhat from the early days of the mead-halls as described by Steven Pollington in his book The Mead-Hall, where a lot of the symbel (the feasting) had its rituals rooted in Pagan beliefs and old Teutonic ideals based on the ways of warriors. However, the principle that the hall was the place where the joys of life could be found, drink, merriment, and good times, remained even in the 11 th c. The feasting-hall, or the mead-hall, was where it all happened, much like how some of us nowadays see pubs, clubs, restaurants, and bars. \n\n\nIn the early Anglo-Saxon halls, the lord, chieftain or senior clansman would have had a dais erected on both sides of the hall. The side where the chieftain sat, was raised higher than the guest\u2019s dais across the hearth, obviously to enforce his higher position within the hierarchical structure of the feast. In Edward\u2019s time, if there was another dais, it would most likely have included the most prominent of his people that were not already seated with him around his table. \nPeople often have this idea that the wooden halls of Anglo Saxon times were draught-ridden, smoky, cold places, and this must have been so, but once that big central hearth got going, and the smoke rose upwards to the apertures in the gables at each end of the rectangular building, the place could be surprisingly clear and warm. Obviously the closer you were to the king and the hearth, the more important you were. Servants would usually sit on the floor if there was no room at the tables, or boards as they were often called, being mainly trestles with wooden boards resting on top of them. No doubt, however, King Edward would have had a rather more refined structure for his meal, with his high-backed chair, brightly coloured and bedecked with cushions. His queen, Edith, who sat with him, would also have sat in an ornate chair, but it is also possible that for the Christmas celebrations, they may have wanted to make use of their thrones, both of which were said to have been decorated with gold and precious gems. I for one would not have wanted to spill anything on those beautiful cushions once I\u2019d got a little merry. \n\nThe most important tables would have been covered with the best table linen, the best accoutrements and have the best choice cuts of meat. Feasting in Anglo Saxon times would have been nothing without meat, turkey would not have been on the menu. For the most highest-ranking nobles, meat would have included wild boar and venison, most likely hunted by Edward himself, and preserved for the occasion. Edward would have loved that, to see the products of his efforts being enjoyed by his guests. Apart from these meats which would have been consumed as said earlier by the most noble of the nobility, there would have also been available goat, lamb, and pig. Vegetables were also consumed, and were often preserved by drying by the fire, just as slaughtered animals were. Items such as mushrooms, herbs, fish, and seaweed, were routinely dried and smoking also was a popular method, such as the carcasses that were hung in the rafters. \n\nMedieval people of this time did not know sugar, but they enjoyed sweet tastes, and would have used honey to sweeten their cakes, or dip their breads in. There were opportunities to flavouring their food with salt and pepper, ginger, cinnamon, very expensive commodities. It\u2019s also conceivable that they stewed fruit and served it with cream and it is said that a form of jelly was made from cow heels. \nOften a hall\u2019s hearth was used for cooking over, with great pots hanging on chains with stews of pottage, or with pork bubbling away in them with leeks, onions, garlic, and carrots as part of the ingredients. But in larger halls like Edward\u2019s, the hearth was for warmth and light only, for apart from perhaps some shuttered windows in each end of the hall, there would not have been much light without the hearth. They of course had candles made from bees wax for the wealthy, and tallow from animal fat for the poor. I\u2019m sure that Edward made himself available to the bees wax makers, for they looked and smelled better than animal fat. Torches were available in their sconces on the walls to give off more light and warmth in this cold, dark season, and rushes dipped in fat also made light. \nThe roasting of meats would have been done over hearths in the kitchens which were in buildings separate from the hall. Food would have been brought to the tables on huge platters carried in by members of the king\u2019s household to be served to the guests. I hope the kitchens weren\u2019t too far from the hall, for at this time of years it would have been very cold, perhaps even snowing. \nSo, we have a picture of what the hall would have looked like, decorated for Christmas with holly, ivy and mistletoe and frescos and wall hangings in bright colours depicting the nativity and other biblical representations. The hall would have been full to brimming with people seated at tables, standing, or sitting on the rush mats with Edward\u2019s hounds. The day would have begun with people attending early morning mass in the precinct\u2019s chapel, which would most likely have not accommodated everyone, with the excess standing out side to try and hear the mass. I\u2019m sure that if both archbishops were present, they would have participated in the mass, perhaps taking it in turns. Then everyone would pile into the hall to break their fast, glad that the ritual of abstinence was over at last and they could get their gnashers stuck into what they really wanted to eat, which was meat. But for their first round of food they would have had breads, finely sifted for the top tables, until the bread was white, which was what they preferred to eat, if they had the chance, pretty much like us. And cheese and butter, boiled eggs washed down by ale. \nAs the day progressed, during the feasting which was pretty much nonstop, there would have been all sorts of entertainment, in between going to mass of course. There were scops, jugglers, musicians, singers, acrobats, dancers, and jesters. The king\u2019s own scop would have sung his praises, about how wonderfully kind, brave and majestic he was. He must have been a great liar, also. There would have been dancing, boasting, or flyting, where men (and perhaps women, too) would compete in a game of words. Perhaps the epic tale of Beowulf would have been told in the evening, when people were subdued, and more willing to listen. It is said that Edward enjoyed the poems and songs of the scops, and I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to hear he knew a song or two himself. \nOne thing the Anglo-Saxons loved was a good knees up and after the serious fasting, praying, and alms giving, they must have looked forward to letting their hair down and getting merry, sloshed even, and knowing the old English, they would have loved a scrap or two during the day, I hope no one got killed, but an English feast would not have been an English feast without a fight somewhere in the middle of it. Then everyone would have made amends, said their sorries (hopefully) and all would be well again. \nFor it was Christmas, a time for good will to all men, wasn\u2019t it? \nWith much thanks to Regia Anglorum for the photos of the Saxon Longhall in Wychurst, Kent.

Against this backdrop we meet Wulfhere, a Sussex thegn who, as the sun sets over the wild forest of Andredesweald, is returning home victoriously from a great battle in the north. Holding his lands directly from the King, his position demands loyalty to Edward himself, but Wulfhere is duty-bound to also serve Harold, a bond forged within Wulfhere's family heritage and borne of the ancient Teutonic ideology of honour and loyalty. \nWulfhere is a man with the strength and courage of a bear, a warrior whose loyalty to his lord and king is unquestionable. He is also a man who holds his family dear and would do anything to protect them. So when Harold demands that he wed his daughter to the son of Helghi, his sworn enemy, Wulfhere has to find a way to save his daughter from a life of certain misery in the household of the cruel and resentful Helghi without compromising his honour and loyalty to his lord, Harold.  \n\nSons of the Wolf is a panoramic snapshot of medieval life and politics as the events that lead to the downfall of Anglo Saxon England play out, immersing the reader in the tapestry of life as it was before the Doomsday Book.

12/6/17 2:10 AM \nReferees have a thankless job. \nSomeone inevitably complains about almost every call they make. Fans scream at them. Players scream at them. Coaches scream at them. They get the overwhelming majority of calls right. The ones they get wrong become big news. \nThat being said, they\u2019re not without flaws. \nSo that\u2019s what made what the NBA did Monday so significant. The league suspended Golden State guard Shaun Livingston for one game because he got involved in an on-court altercation with referee Courtney Kirkland, a justifiable sanction because players cannot be permitted to angrily make contact with referees, ever. \nBut the NBA also suspended Kirkland for a week over his role in what happened in the game against Miami. \n\u201cWe regret the recent incident between Courtney Kirkland and Shaun Livingston,\u201d the National Basketball Referees Association said. \u201cThe NBRA has reached out to the National Basketball Players Association to explore ways to improve on-court communications and civility.\u201d \nIt\u2019s time to have those talks. \nThe player-referee relationship, while never buddy-buddy, seems very strained right now. Kevin Durant has been ejected from three games already this season, after getting kicked out of one in his first 700 NBA games. Goran Dragic was so angry over a non-call last week that he kicked a basket stanchion. LeBron James recently got the first ejection of his 15-year NBA career. \n\u201cAt this point, it\u2019s like they\u2019re trying to turn me into a jump-shooter,\u201d James said after his ejection last month, repeating a stance he\u2019s offered plenty of times before that he doesn\u2019t always get the same sort of calls that others get when they drive to the rim. \u201cI can\u2019t be a jump-shooter. I\u2019m not a jump-shooter.\u201d \nReferees are taught to defuse situations and not add fuel to the proverbial fire. That\u2019s where Kirkland failed. Livingston got in his face to argue that he had been fouled seconds earlier, and replays suggested he had a case. Kirkland then took two steps toward Livingston, hardly in a menacing way, but in a manner that didn\u2019t help the situation. \n\u201cBoth the official and the player were part of it,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \nKerr took the high road, though it was clear that whatever happened shouldn\u2019t have happened. Livingston loses a game check and now might find himself wondering if he\u2019ll be watched more critically by referees going forward. Kirkland loses a week of work, and when he\u2019s eligible to return starting Monday, he\u2019s probably going to face even more scrutiny. \nIt\u2019s a teachable moment for the NBA. The league would be foolish to not take advantage. \nTHE WEEK AHEAD \nSome of the key games to watch in the next week: \n\u2014 Sacramento at Cleveland, Wednesday: The Cavaliers are rolling and now seek a 13th consecutive win, which would tie the franchise record. \n\u2014 L.A. Lakers at Philadelphia, Thursday: Lonzo Ball is shooting 31 percent, which the worst \u2014 by far \u2014 of any starter in the NBA this season. \n\u2014 Oklahoma City-Brooklyn, Thursday, and Miami-Brooklyn, Saturday: Mexico City hosts NBA regular-season games for the 25th and 26th time. \n\u2014 Boston at Detroit, Sunday: The East\u2019s best team so far meets one of the East\u2019s surprises, a club that is playing like a Stan Van Gundy team. \n\u2014 New Orleans at Houston, Monday: Doesn\u2019t it seem like the Rockets, off to an NBA-leading 18-4 start, are somehow flying under the radar? \nWARRIORS\u2019 START \nGolden State went 19-6 in its first 25 games. Believe it or not, that\u2019s the Warriors\u2019 worst start in the last four seasons. \nOf course, \u201cworst\u201d is a relative term. \nThe Hornets, Nets, Nuggets, Pelicans and Timberwolves have never been 19-6. The Clippers, Hawks, Heat, Kings and Wizards have never gotten off to a better 25-game start. \nNot having Stephen Curry for the next two weeks, and possibly more, with a sprained right ankle won\u2019t help matters. But only five of Golden State\u2019s next seven games are against teams with winning records. \nSpeaking of Curry, he\u2019s already No. 8 on the career 3-pointers made list, with exactly 2,000. He may get to No. 3 on the list by the end of this season, and it\u2019s not inconceivable to think he could catch Ray Allen for the No. 1 spot by the end of the 2019-20 season. \nCurry will be 32 then; Allen hit his 2,973rd and final 3-pointer when he was 38. \nSTAT LINE OF THE WEEK \nAaron Gordon, Orlando: A 40-point, 15-rebound effort in a win over Oklahoma City last Wednesday gets the nod. He had 20 points in each half, 10 rebounds in the second half, played 44 minutes and committed one foul. And not only did the Magic win, they won despite giving up 21 offensive rebounds and grabbing only two of their own. \nMore AP basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "livingston-kirkland", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tim reynolds", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "goran dragic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lonzo ball", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "curry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen curry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ray allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirkland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lebron james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "livingston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stan van gundy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin durant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron gordon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve kerr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shaun livingston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kerr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "courtney kirkland", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nba", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cavaliers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "timberwolves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l.a. lakers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national basketball referees association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rockets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nuggets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "golden state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wizards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national basketball players association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clippers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oklahoma city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "detroit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sacramento", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami-brooklyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma city-brooklyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "golden state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new orleans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:50.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c6d3c88af3effe636d1b8d279e44fc719b7f7a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTAhPmCEK9VxYD3CvhyZeO0w--", "site_full": "forums.moneysavingexpert.com", "site": "moneysavingexpert.com", "site_section": "http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/forumdisplay.php?f=28", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Overseas Holidays &amp; Travel Planning - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "title": "Christmas sun- where to go?", "title_full": "Christmas sun- where to go? - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T10:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.999, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2270, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "928598e3879c29f8b037b59be259f78bed88e612", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTAhPmCEK9VxYrx2pycMYMsRJMJPnJD3XjgOM_uzC2z94-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "xyz123", "published": "2017-12-07T10:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\u201c If you choose either Cyprus or Malta, make sure the accommodation has adequate central heating.

There is no public timeline for when it will be built. \nChina\u2019s most famous boxer, Zou Shiming , lost his WBO flyweight belt when he was knocked out by Japan\u2019s unfancied Sho Kimura in his first defence in July. \nWhen Pacquiao\u2019s plans for China were first announced in 2014, he said that he believed the partnership could help thaw frosty ties between the Philippines and China, who were engaged in a territorial maritime dispute in the South China Sea. \nRobert Garcia to join Zou Shiming camp? It doesn\u2019t matter to me, says Japanese hero Sho Kimura \nRelations have since improved considerably under current Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte. \nAt the time, Pacquiao defended the decision to open a boxing academy in China instead of his own country. \n\u201cIn the Philippines we don\u2019t have a problem (producing good boxers),\u201d said Pacquiao, a hero in his home country and also a senator.

In the second headbutting controversy in Australian sport in two weeks following Jonny Bairstow\u2019s Liverpool kiss on Aussie cricket rival Cameron Bancroft, Corcoran has promised to fight fire with teeth if Horn wants to play rough at the Brisbane Convention Centre. \u201cJeff headbutts,\u2019\u2019 the Londoner said in his final public workout at Steve Deller\u2019s Fortitude Gym in Newstead. \u201cI\u2019m expecting headbutts. I\u2019m used to it. I\u2019ve been headbutted before and that\u2019s the way Jeff fights. He\u2019s known for leading with his head.\u2019\u2019 Camera Icon Gary Corcoran isn\u2019t afraid of going biting back. (AAP Image/Glenn Hunt) Picture: AAP Corcoran said Horn constantly headbutted Manny Pacquiao in winning the WBO world welterweight title at Suncorp Stadium on July 2. He said rather than complain to New York referee Benjy Esteves Jr about Horn\u2019s style before the fight, he would deal with it by using his own remedy. \u201cI won\u2019t headbutt Jeff back \u2014 I\u2019ll bite him,\u2019\u2019 Corcoran said. \u201cI have bullied bigger boys than Jeff in previous fights. I\u2019ve trained for 12 hard rounds and he hasn\u2019t fought anyone as big or young as me.\u2019\u2019 Camera Icon Horn says he\u2019s a close fighter. AFP PHOTO/Patrick Hamilton Picture: AFP Horn denies that he is a dirty fighter. \u201cI\u2019m an aggressive fighter,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThe way I fight in close it\u2019s just natural that sometimes your heads collide. \u201cI got accused of butting against Manny Pacquiao but I was the one who came off worse. \u201cI got a bad cut over my eye when our heads banged together but the head clash was accidental. \u201cMy trainer Glenn Rushton has always taught me to fight hard but fair. But if Gary wants to turn it into a brawl with me well bring it on.\u2019\u2019 Corcoran\u2019s manager Peter Stanley said it was \u201codd\u2019\u2019 that Horn has made a \u201cbig deal about being a bullied schoolboy when he is a bully in the ring\u2019\u2019. \u201cThose headbutts against Pacquiao weren\u2019t accidental,\u2019\u2019 Stanley said. \u201cJeff knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. He jumps in head first and you have to practise to fight like that. \u201cIf he wants to turn it into a street fight, well that suits us. \u201cGary has done all the hard work and he\u2019s tapering now ready for the big night. He\u2019s calm, he\u2019s relaxed, he\u2019s focused and he\u2019s ready to beat Jeff Horn.\u2019\u2019 Corcoran went through a light workout on the punching pads with trainer Frank Greaves on Thursday. He did not show the same power or intensity of Horn or Pacquiao but he said he was just going through the motions, the hard work being already done in England. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to fight now,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI want to get it over and done with. I don\u2019t take any fighter lightly but Jeff is another one I can tick off the box. \u201cYou\u2019ll see on the night I have the power and the strength. \u201cIt means the world to me to win this fight \u2014 that\u2019s why you get into boxing to win a world title. I\u2019m a better fighter than Jeff but it\u2019s just business to me.

He shared the exciting news via social media: \nPacquiao has served for roughly 11 years in the armed forces, and made the jump up in rank from Lieutenant Colonel. He is also actively serving as a senator in his native Philippines since the summer of 2016. \nThe 38-year-old hasn't graced the ring since a 12-round unanimous decision defeat at the hands of Jeff Horn last summer. Splitting his time between training for upcoming bouts, and squaring off with the opposition in the political ring surely isn't helping him maintain his once untouchable skills. Pacquiao was clearly favoring his left hand in his last fight, a clear indication his surgically-repaired right shoulder was still bothering him. His career has been in constant decline since he lost to Floyd Mayweather Jr. in one of the most-anticipated bouts in recent history in 2015. \nPacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach, is urging the boxing legend to call it quits, but Pacquiao recently took to social media to tease a potential bout with Conor McGregor, whose boxing debut didn't go quite according to plan against Floyd Mayweather Jr. in August. \nMcGregor, the UFC lightweight champion, fell in 10 rounds to Mayweather in the highly-anticipated fight, but fared much better than most analysts and oddsmakers predicted in his boxing debut. He still came away with a cool $30 million for his efforts, though, and there's no doubt a potential clash with Pacquiao would be equally, or even more lucrative. Pacquiao has also squared off with Mayweather in the boxing ring, losing via unanimous decision back in June, 2015. \nHowever, the chances of the fight happening are slim to none, according to promoter Bob Arum . \n\u201cIf we equate boxing with fighting \u2013 because I\u2019m not talking about his ability as an MMA participant because he has been very good with that \u2013 Conor McGregor can\u2019t spell fight,\" he said. \"Mayweather carried him before he took him out. With Manny, it wouldn\u2019t be a contest, it would be a money grab. Conor McGregor is not a boxer and does not know how to box... The answer is no, I wouldn\u2019t particularly look forward to doing a fight featuring McGregor and Pacquiao.\u201d \nPacquiao will carry an incredible 59-7-2 professional record into his next fight, should he choose to continue his spectacular career. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?

Since 1906, under the Antiquities Act, presidents have had the power to unilaterally assign land to be protected as national monuments. Sixteen presidents to date have done so, creating 129 protected areas; some of them, including the Grand Canyon, have been turned into National Parks. \nIn September 1996, President Clinton established Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (over 1.8 million acres). In December 2016, President Obama established Bears Ears National Monument (over 1.3 million acres). If the Trump administration\u2019s orders come to fruition, Bears Ears will be reduced to 15% of its current size. Grand Staircase-Escalante will be slashed in half. It doesn\u2019t appear it will stop there, either. There are already recommendations to reduce four more national monuments . \nBoth Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante are widely known as some of the most diverse and beautiful public parks, not just in Utah, but in all the US. They are home to slot canyons, ancient rock art, caves, rivers, mesas, and hundreds of species of insects and animals that are endemic to the areas. With its rich history, Bears Ears is also considered sacred land by more than six Native American tribes in the area. How to join the fight to save the land \nMany have already begun fighting to reverse these threats by taking this policy to court. Five Native American tribes \u2014 Navajo Nation, Hopi, Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, Ute Indian, and Pueblo of Zuni \u2014 have joined to challenge the shrinking of Bears Ears National Monument. They claim that the Antiquities Act does not allow presidents to remove or modify national monument status, only to designate. Another lawsuit has also been filed on behalf of ten environmental groups to challenge the order to reduce Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. \nIt should be noted that never in the 111-year history of the Act have the courts had to weigh in on these matters. There have been times when presidents have reduced areas of protected land but they\u2019ve never been challenged in court. Trump\u2019s reductions are the largest in history. \nIf you want to take up the fight to stop this from happening, here are a few ways you can get involved and support the organizations who are fighting to keep the lands preserved: Contact your senator \nUse the pre-made message by the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance here to urge your senators to fight for these national monuments.

And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, will keep your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. \nThese two verses clearly, concisely and completely describe the atmosphere of a life where we acknowledge God's control.  Paul introduces this message with Philippians 4:4-5: Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice.  Let all men know your forbearance.  The Lord is at hand.  Have no anxiety about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. \nPaul then tells us how to find that peace with Philippians 4:8: Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. \n\nOur thoughts control our lives.  Our emotions, our attitudes toward ourselves and others, and our actions reflect the things we think about.  What we think about grows.

And when I think back to how busy  I felt during years past, I kind of laugh a bit at the thought of it all. Each year, each month, each day is tougher than the last. But I'm learning so much on a daily basis and moving that much closer to becoming a dentist.  On that note, I think a little dental school update is long overdue.  \n\nBrushing Up On \nAll the paperwork. For each patient that I diagnose/treatment plan, I have to write up a report and it feels as if I'm always doing paperwork. I tracked everything in a day in the life of a dental student   and was shocked to find out that I spent 4 hours of my day doing paperwork compared to only 7 hours of dentistry.  Constantly looking things up for each case and patient that I see. Really can't wait to get to the point where I just know these things, but for now it's kind of interesting to be in a place where you learn something new from every single patient encounter.  \n\nIn the Classroom \nThankfully, the majority of our time is spent in clinic with patients, but I still have a few courses that I'm taking and they are advanced.   \nI cannot express how thrilled I am to be done with the classroom component of our partial denture course. I submitted the rest of my projects last week -I've only been working on them since August!  Our main course right now that's kicking my butt is oral pathology with differentiating between all the minute details that separates related diseases. Thankfully, its almost over and our final is happening today. Wish me luck.  \nIn the Lab \nI have a love hate relationship with lab work right now. Some of it can be creative & artistic, while other parts are intense with requiring saws and blow torches. I was struggling with passing my practical on fabricating dentures and failed my first attempt. Then, I worked my butt off and was able to pass the second time around. The timing couldn't have been better as I'm planning to start for first denture patient case in the clinic.  After  a few rough days of dental school , I also found out that I passed my practical on partial dentures as well. Officially done with all preclinical practicals!  \n\nIn the Clinic \nWhat's in my Clinic Bag? See my daily essentials \nHave been spending lots of time in the Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic lately\u2026here's a glimpse of a week of dental surgery    Crossed another clinical skills assessment off my list with acing my exam on exodontia-pulling teeth. Did I mention that our clinical practicals are on live patients? More details here Guess who stopped by? The husband has been my patient several times now and the work I've done has helped me qualify for one of my clinical practicals! Gotta love it when your spouse supports you enough to be your patient.  Spent a Saturday volunteering at a free dental clinic and couldn't be more grateful for the experience of providing dental care to the underserved. A local clinic donated supplies and some of my fellow classmates and I donated our time. We are all so thankful for every opportunity to work with patients. \nIt was so surreal to share this little update of dental school and realize how much and how quickly things have changed. I definitely still remember feeling nervous about things as simple as doing a dental cleaning and now I don't think twice about pulling teeth, drilling, and grabbing a scalpel blade when needed. And it's even more surreal that this semester is coming to an end.

(that is, to bring Christ down from above:) Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach (Romans 10:6-8). \nThe phrase \u201cthe righteousness which is of faith\u201d in the verse above is a rather interesting one. It\u2019s rendered in the original Greek as \u201cthe \u2018of faith\u2019 righteousness,\u201d thus, giving personality to the word, \u201crighteousness\u201d ; and that righteousness, he says, \u201cspeaks.\u201d \u201cThe \u2018of faith\u2019 righteousness\u201d speaks. So, righteousness talks; it doesn\u2019t keep quiet.\nOften, we say, Christianity is for talkers; we speak righteousness, just as we speak wisdom. The righteousness of God is the truth of God; it\u2019s the reality concerning any situation. So when we affirm the Word, we\u2019re speaking righteousness, we\u2019re speaking God\u2019s language of faith. Romans 10:9 tells us how the \u201cof faith righteousness\u201d works. It says, \u201c\u2026if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\u201d \nThe word, \u201cconfess\u201d is from the Greek \u201chomologeo, \u201d which means to speak the same thing in agreement. It means affirming the Word of God in agreement with God; not merely repeating it exactly in the same words, but making your own affirmations in agreement with His Word. If you\u2019d confess or affirm the same things that God has said about you in His Word, they\u2019d become real in your life.\nFor example, 2 Corinthians 3:5 says, \u201cNot that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.\u201d You ought to, on the basis of what God has said, declare, \u201cI\u2019m sufficient in Christ\u2019s sufficiency; I\u2019m up to any task. I produce excellence and works of righteousness, because Christ is my ability and sufficiency.\u201d That\u2019s speaking the righteousness of God, the rightness of God about who you are, and what you can do in Christ.\nPRAYER \nDear Father, I thank you for the privilege to affirm your Word concerning my life. I declare that I\u2019m more than a conqueror, and can do all things through Christ who strengthens me! Your wisdom guides me today, and I\u2019m led of the Spirit to produce excellence and works of righteousness, in Jesus\u2019 Name. Amen.. \nFURTHER STUDY: \nHebrews 13:5-6 [Let your] conversation [be] without covetousness; [and be] content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. 6 So that we may boldly say, The Lord [is] my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.\n1 Corinthians 2:12-13 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. 13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man\u2019s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.\nDAILY SCRIPTURE READING \n1-Year Bible Reading Plan: Jude,\nDaniel 9-10\n2-Year Bible Reading Plan: John 18:19-27,\n2 Chronicles 15-16", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jude", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "corinthians", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:52.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "46fdfbd6c7543d3bd3ed6651bff6e40489151da4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOov93lz0BeiRndB8oqwj01EZf5TwdEhDh.mNdU7nbVMbc49np5xp3kDZhe.cbj7p56l.JgAOXRj2CRHzMsOa3aAmLAoFzxhHdG2vPG4JLUf5w--", "site_full": "sports321news.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://sports321news.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Sports News", "title": "All-time UEFA Youth League records", "title_full": "All-time UEFA Youth League records", "published": "2017-12-07T11:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "46fdfbd6c7543d3bd3ed6651bff6e40489151da4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOov93lz0BeiRndB8oqwj01EZf5TwdEhDh.mNdU7nbVMbc49np5xp3kDZhe.cbj7p56l.JgAOXRj2CRHzMsOa3aAmLAoFzxhHdG2vPG4JLUf5w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "noreply@blogger.com (Hr)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "All-time UEFA Youth League records", "text": "  All-time UEFA Youth League records Who has scored the most goals in UEFA Youth League history?

The Matter have announced that they have had to withdraw due to personal reasons, releasing this statement, \u2018With our biggest regret, we cannot take the obligations coming with the A Dal 2018 competition. Due to unexpected family issues, our lead vocalist Mushu [Izs\u00e1k Palmer] has to stay at Vienna in the upcoming months. Thank you for the trust, and to the jury members for seeing potential in our song and our band. Also, we wish the best for the other competing acts!\u2019 So who will replace The Matter (formerly known as Mushu)? [Update 2] It\u2019s not A Dal if there\u2019s not at least 2 line-up changes, and as expected, there\u2019s been another change. Another band has pulled out of the contest, this time it\u2019s Nemzenekar who have withdrawn due to scheduling conflicts. They\u2019ve also released a statement, saying, \u2018We met some unforeseen reasons and obligations, which make us unable to guarantee that we will be present at the scheduled rehearsals, shootings and live broadcasts in the upcoming months. With regret, we have to step back from the competition.\u2019 To replace Nemzenekar is Viki Singh who is a familiar face to A Dal, having participated twice now, inclufing 2017 with her song Rain which reached the semi-finals. Her song for 2018 is called Butterfly House and will be made available to listen to soon. The A Dal jury have already selected the band Patikadomb who will perform the song J\u00f3 szelet! If curiosity is getting the better of you, you can listen to 30 second snippets of all the songs on the official A Dal website here . Which acts are you excited for?

Well it has to do with truth . When I was in second grade, my teacher told me the truth about Santa. I went home in despair and cried and cried and cried! My mother tried to console me and tried to help me make some sense of this, but I was angry with my teacher for telling me this. I didn't think it was her place to tell me the truth.  As a child with the starts of compulsive overeating tendencies, I probably ate, because that's how I dealt with my anger rather than turning it over to Christ's capable hands, like I try to do now. \n\nThe thing is, I now value truth, because that's how I have a firm faith in Christ. Our Christian faith is built on truth , shared by people who predicted Christ's birth 100's of years before he was born. Thousands of people of all walks of life witnessed the many, many miracles that Jesus did, so people would know and believe the truth that He Is the Son of God. Jesus even predicted His betrayal, Crucifixion, death, and resurrection long before it happened, so people would know our faith is based on truth . Over 500 people saw Christ after He arose from the grave, so people would know our faith is based on truth .  \n\nI get concerned that there are some, children, youth, and adults who possible get confused about the tale of Santa and think that their faith in Jesus is a tale, as well. They need to know that there is lots of evidence about Jesus being the Son of God. Just read the blog:  How to Know Jesus Is God's Son  which has lots of Biblical evidence from eye witnesses.  Just read books by J. Warner Wallace:  Cold-Case Christianity for Kids  or  Cold-Case Christianity (for Teens and Adults)  which has even more proof by witnesses, not just Christians. Also, view the movie by Lee Strobel:  The Case for Christ   and his books for adults and for kids. \n\nBe prayerful if telling your children about Santa is setting them up to some day be uncertain about the truth of Christ being our Savior . If you choose to tell them about Santa, make sure you're prayerful about how you share it. You don't want them some day doubting the real truth about their Savior, Jesus Christ, the true reason we have Christmas ! \n\nSince I am applying these Bible Verses to my life, it may not convey the whole meaning of the verses.

PETERSON - 12/6/17 1:46 AM \nPORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 Bradley Beal had a career night, and in the process, he gave the Washington Wizards a morale-boosting rebound victory. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking way too much,\u201d Beal said after scoring a career-high 51 points in a 106-92 victory Tuesday night over the Portland Trail Blazers. \u201cTonight I was just playing freely and having fun.\u201d \nThe Wizards bounced back from a discouraging 116-69 loss Monday night to the Utah Jazz. It was the second-largest losing margin in franchise history. \nBeal made 21 field goals against the Blazers, also a career high, and the Wizards led by as many as 23 points. He hit five 3-pointers. It was the most points ever scored in Portland by an opposing player. \nBeal certainly set the tone, coach Scott Brooks said. \n\u201cYou never go into a game thinking one of your best players or best guards in the league is going to get 50, but he has the ability to get high numbers when he\u2019s aggressive,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cWe gave him space to work.\u201d \nBeal said he barely slept after the loss to the Jazz. \n\u201cI came into the game with the mindset of being aggressive, especially coming off the game last night and the way I played the last four or five games,\u201d he said. \nDamian Lillard finished with 30 points, eight rebounds and nine assists for the Blazers, who have lost three straight at home after returning from a 4-1 trip. \nPortland was hurt midway through the final quarter when center Jusuf Nurkic limped off the court and to the locker room after appearing to injure his right ankle. He had 15 points and nine rebounds before leaving. Portland said X-rays on the ankle were negative. \nPlaying without All-Star John Wall for the sixth straight game, the Wizards came out like they did not want a repeat of the night before. They went on an 11-0 run to go up 31-22 in the first half, capped by Kelly Oubre Jr.\u2019s pull-up jumper, and went on to lead 51-37 at the break. \nBeal scored 19 first-half points, and the Wizards collectively had 12 steals by the break. \n\u201cThe greatest thing about the NBA is you can bounce back the next night and that\u2019s what happened tonight,\u201d Marcin Gortat said. \nPortland, meanwhile, had 13 turnovers at the half and finished with 18 overall. \nBeal\u2019s 20-foot jumper gave the Wizards a 61-38 lead in the third quarter, but the Blazers clawed back to 63-52 on Lillard\u2019s 3-pointer and a free throw. \nLillard appeared to tweak his left hip late in the quarter, and at times he grimaced \u2014 but he had 15 points in the period to help keep the Blazers in it. \nCJ McCollum\u2019s layup got Portland within 81-72, but Beal answered with a 3-pointer that put him over his previous career high. Beal had 42 points against Phoenix on Nov. 21 last year. \nAl-Farouq Aminu made a 3-pointer that pulled Portland within 99-90 with 1:28 left, but that was as close as Portland would come. Beal dunked with 24 seconds left to punctuate his performance. \n\u201cI\u2019m not somebody that\u2019s going to get overly concerned, especially this early in the year,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cWe\u2019re just not playing well. I think it goes back to the road trip. We didn\u2019t play great but we found ways to win games. We came home and we just haven\u2019t played well offensively or consistent defensively.\u201d \nPortland coach Terry Stotts tinkered a bit with his lineup, starting Aminu and Maurice Harkless, while sending Pat Connaughton and Noah Vonleh to the bench. \nThe Blazers were coming off a 123-116 loss to New Orleans on Saturday. \nTIP INS \nWizards: It was the second of two meetings this season between the teams. Portland won the first 108-105. \u2026 Washington swept the series last season, scoring more than 120 points in each. The game was the second of a five-game trip for the Wizards. \nTrail Blazers: Evan Turner started the second half for Harkless, who stayed behind in the Blazers\u2019 locker room. The team later said he had a left quad contusion. Harkless said he expected to be ready for Portland\u2019s next game on Saturday. \nMOST OPPONENT POINTS IN PORTLAND: Beal broke the record of 49, held by Atlanta\u2019s Lou Hudson (11/18/70), Milwaukee\u2019s Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (10/18/72).

PHOTO | DENIS OKEYO | NATION MEDIA GROUP In Summary When the seller is willing to negotiate the price downwards, be wary because it could be that he built cheaply. It is a pointer to a building that will requires renovations, which adds to the cost. Engaging an agent to negotiate on your behalf might be advantageous but letting them pressure you to buy the house might work against you. By PAUL KARIUKI More by this Author \nTwo years ago, John Njenga came across an advert for a house for sale online. \nAlthough the Nakuru resident had no immediate plans of buying a house, it seemed like a good deal: with a sacco loan and his savings, he could be a proud home owner. And since the price was negotiable, he was sure he would get a good bargain. \nBut when he took an expert to help him assess the property, he changed his mind. Although the price was \u201cfair\u201d, the house needed many renovations. \u201cThis convinced me the deal was not worth it, so I began looking for another house,\u201d he says. \nREAD: How to get the best property deal \nWhile he would have derived more satisfaction from building his own home, it would have been more costly, hence the \u201ccheaper\u201d option of buying instead. Njenga\u2019s case shows that the glossy pictures of houses for sale online can end up costing one dearly. \nWhen the seller is willing to negotiate the price downwards, be wary because it could be that he built cheaply, and that the price quoted is not a true reflection of the property\u2019s value. Besides, it is a pointer to a building that will requires renovations, which adds to the cost. Related Content Agency warns over new cheap building methods \nSo, while the convenient location and cost might favour you as the buyer, you should brace yourself for disappointment. For instance, the property might not meet your specifications, or it might be of low quality. \nMr Daniel Maigwa, a housing expert and interior designer, says while building your own house can take more time than buying one since costs might exceed your budget from time to time, it is preferable because you can have everything built to your specifications. \nBesides, he adds, the drawbacks to buying are numerous. For one, the location might be a problem. \u201cIt might be in an a posh location, with high monthly bills for the attendant services,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cIt is better to look for a house you can afford, and which has all the features you are looking for,\u201d he says. \nHe suggests that buyers engage experts for advise. For instance, the price might be inflated \nLAWYER PRESENT \nMs May Wangari, a land broker and real estate agent, agrees, adding that a lawyer\u2019s presence is particularly important in any financial transaction. However, she adds that if you are not satisfied with what\u2019s on offer, look for another house. \nEngaging an agent to negotiate on your behalf might be advantageous since they know the market better, but letting the agent pressure you to buy the house might work against you, she cautions. \nMs Wangari advises against putting too much trust in an agent, unless you know them really well. \nShe also cautions against rushing a purchase saying: \u201cIt\u2019s better to bide your time instead of trying to beat other interested buyers. You might end up burning your fingers,\u201d she says. \nREAD: How to avoid land fraudsters \nShe advises that you buy a house you can comfortably afford, and cautions against becoming complacent in a house that you have not fully paid for. \nCiting the case of a customer who bought a house in a good location using a sacco loan but who was not happy because he had two debts that took long to service, she adds, \u201cDefaulting on a loan can lose you that house. The same is true in case of foreclosure if you buy using mortgage,\u201d she says. \nShe notes many houses put up for sale target a certain class of people, adding that it is better to buy a house that is a few years old rather than a newly built one whose safety standards you cannot be sure of. \nThe safest bet is getting a house that meets your specifications, is affordable and does not come with hidden costs. \u201cWhat you need at the end of the day is an investment that will satisfies you, and not a thing that drains you financially through constant maintenance,\u201d she says.

While it was the first increase for just 37 per cent of UK homeowners, this climbed to 78 per cent for those aged between 25-35. \nLondon was home to the highest number of homeowners seeing a climb for the first time at 63 per cent, with the North East being the highest region outside of the capital (55 per cent). \nWhat impact did this have on your monthly payments? But despite this first for many, when asked what impact it had on their monthly mortgage payments, 64 per cent hardly noticed, while 33 per cent saw a manageable increase. Just 3 per cent believed it had a serious impact on their monthly affordability. \n45-50-year-olds were worst hit with 5 per cent seeing a serious impact on their monthly payments, although this increased to 11 per cent for those in both the South West and North East. It was least notable in Wales, where 83 per cent of those surveyed answered that they had hardly noticed an increase. \nHas the recent increase in interest rates put you off from buying another property? Despite being the first increase in over a decade, 46 per cent of those asked remained undeterred from buying another property, with 17 per cent put off from a property sale and 13 per cent putting the idea of a purchase on hold for the time being. \nHowever, those in the first-time buyer age bracket seemed more deterred from another purchase with 56 per cent put off from climbing the ladder, 40 per cent indefinitely, 16 per cent for the time being. \nThe increase was a put off in the capital more so than anywhere, where the high price of property can mean even a marginal hike can result in a large increase in unaffordability. 60 per cent of homeowners in London were put off from another purchase by the recent increase in rates, 50 per cent completely with a further 10 per cent deterred from the time being. \nHow much would interest rates need to increase by to stop you buying another property? eMoov then asked how much rates would have to increase by to stop them from climbing the ladder. With affordability still at an almost record low, nearly half (49 per cent) of homeowners would have to see an increase of 2 per cent or more before they were deterred. 15 per cent would have to see rates climb by up to 1.5 per cent, 18 per cent by up to 1 per cent and 12 per cent by just 0.5 per cent. \nThe 55+ age bracket is best placed as a result of years of continued property price growth, with 71 per cent needing to see a 2 per cent or more increase before being put off. \nMortgage Length and Fixed Rate Availability 55 per cent of UK homeowners believe the available length of mortgage agreements should be increased, while 45 per cent also think the variable rate mortgage should be scrapped. \nFounder and CEO of eMoov.co.uk , Russell Quirk, commented: \n\u201cEncouraging signs that while many on the first rung or two of the ladder have only just experienced their first increase in interest rates as homeowners, the majority have weathered the financial implications and the marginal hike has made it easy enough to do so.\u201d \n\u201cMarket confidence remains high but understandably there is some trepidation among the younger generation of homeowners, who will have heard horror stories of consistent hikes and double-digit rates, and as a result, may be treading with caution after seeing their first increase.\u201d Q1.

The family of the Formula 1 legend has vowed to keep details about his current health state as private as possible since they believe that this is what Michael would ask them to do if he was conscious. Reports suggest that the German racing driver could be transferred to the United States for fresh hope. Mirror reported that Michael Schumacher is still weak after suffering serious head injuries in 2013. Previous reports have it that the Formula 1 legend has been receiving medications and therapies in his home near Lake Geneva, which is located on the north side of the French Alps, since he got out of the Grenoble hospital in 2014. However, Bravo claimed in September that the family of the 48-year-old racer is considering to transfer him to his cattle ranch in Dallas, Texas.Click here to continue and read more\u2026", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael schumacher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bravo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grenoble", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lake geneva", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:54.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f5a02ba14feea3452fdfd43a45ae4e7ebafc88ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU44b8gXbHJcZsboW9JMfqx5V6xU0iGpQarIlHzIqKutCGzLzLix_7_c3F9FuJyJtIT5D4OfWqTHSGTNT7Bn6JoL52JB8GFfdes7gvefaQql1AKI2LE0JoqDl", "site_full": "lesasbookcritiques.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://lesasbookcritiques.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Lesa's Book Critiques", "title": "Bill Crider and What Are You Reading?", "title_full": "Bill Crider and What Are You Reading?", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f5a02ba14feea3452fdfd43a45ae4e7ebafc88ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU44b8gXbHJcZsboW9JMfqx5V6xU0iGpQarIlHzIqKutCGzLzLix_7_c3F9FuJyJtIT5D4OfWqTHSGTNT7Bn6JoL52JB8GFfdes7gvefaQql1AKI2LE0JoqDl", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lesa (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Bill Crider and What Are You Reading?", "text": "This first note is one I hate to share. Bill Crider often posted on Thursday's What Are You Reading blog. Although he had read my blog for years, I didn't meet Bill until Jeffrey Meyerson introduced me to him at Bouchercon in Raleigh. He had already started his cancer treatment when he came to New Orleans Bouchercon, and I know so many of us were glad to see him. Before I ask what you're reading, I'm going to share Bill's message on his blog from Tuesday. I know I spent Tuesday evening and times on Wednesday crying. Here is his message. Tuesday, December 05, 2017 Update Things could change, but I suspect this will be my final post on the blog.  I met with some doctors at M. D. Anderson today, and they suggested that I enter hospice care.  A few weeks, a few months is about all I have left.  The blog has been a tremendous source of pleasure to me over the years, and I've made a lot of friends here.  My only regret is  that I have several unreviewed books, including Lawrence Block' fine new anthology,  Alive in Shape and Color , and Max Allan Collins' latest collaboration with Mickey Spillane,  The Last Stand,   which is a collection of two novellas, \"A Bullet for Satisfaction,\" an early Spillane manuscript with an interesting history, and \"The Last Stand,\" the last thing that Spillane completed.  It saddens me to think of all the great books by many writers that I'll never read.  But I've had a great life, and my readers have been a big part of it.  Much love to you all. It almost seems meaningless to ask what you're reading after Bill's post. But, considering that his post was about the books he wouldn't get to finish, I think those who want to share should. I've just started Connie Willis'  A Lot Like Christmas , an update of her wonderful collection,  Miracle and Other Christmas Stories.  If you don't know Willis, she's a science fiction author who loves Christmas and has written wonderful stories to celebrate the season. They're in a variety of genres.\n\nBut, I'm actually on a train right now heading to Chicago.

The idea behind the bill is to allow Poles to spend more time with their families and less time shopping on Sundays. How will the phasing work? \u201cThe lower house, dominated by the ruling party, voted 254 to 156 with 23 abstentions to limit Sunday shopping to the first and last Sunday of the month from March 1 until the end of 2018; only on the last Sunday in the month in 2019; and to ban it totally starting in 2020. There will, however, be some exceptions that will allow Sunday shopping before major holidays like Christmas and Easter, and on the last Sunday in January, April, June, and August. Also, online shops and bakeries are to be exempted from the ban,\u201d according to the Associated Press. This is the second time in the last two months that Poland has asserted its Christian roots and battled the European Union against measures which Poles believe will hurt its Christian identity.\nPoland\u2019s proposed ban on shopping reminded me of the 1980s and early \u201990s in Italy, Rome to be exact. (Since then much has changed in Italy, as in other European countries, and progressively shops are open and shopping is available on Sundays.) Coming from Albania, which then was still suffering under a Communist dictatorship, finding shops closed in Rome and life concentrated on rest and reverence, was a pleasant surprise. In Albania, as in other socialist East-bloc countries, where religion (especially the Catholic Church) was persecuted, Sundays were volunteer-unpaid-work days. There was hardly any possibility for anybody to observe Sabbath. Sundays were days of neighborhood and city cleaning by its citizens: a collective volunteer labor of giving back to the society and the Party.\nAlso, Sundays turned out to be social gatherings, where neighbors get to know other neighbors who lived in the massive Communist-style apartment buildings. Labor Sundays were also thought to be educational: all citizens needed to be prepared and able to handle manual labor, which included work in the agriculture or in the factory. Additionally, Sunday volunteer work was an exercise in humility especially for the intelligencia\u2014 the educated elites who were involved in academia or other intellectual fields, for every activity which contributed to building socialism was a noble activity. Volunteer work was part and parcel of building a classless society. The new socialist men ought to be kept busy, they never should be idle; idleness was punishable and an enemy in forging the Communist soul with Communist morality. By giving oneself to idleness or gossip instead of diligent work of building Communism, one was not only doing harm to oneself but becoming a distraction to others. The Communist Party members led by example: they worked on the seventh day of the week and forced others to do the same.\nThe Communist ideology behind Sunday volunteer labor was Labor omnia vincit\u2014 never-ending work conquered all things\u2014including thinking of and keeping the Lord\u2019s Day Holy. Communists wanted to annihilate God by annihilating Sabbath; annihilate Christianity by annihilating the Day of the Lord\u2014this was part and parcel of the Communist Party ideology. The party wanted people chained in a deceptive Communist heaven or as St. John Paul II puts it in his 1998 Apostolic Letter on the Lord\u2019s Day Dies Domini : \u201clocked within a horizon so limited that they could no longer see the heavens.\u201d\nSo, is Poland\u2019s phasing Sunday shopping a sound idea, or is it arbitrary to prevent people from shopping?\nPoland is keeping up with the Sacred Tradition and the third commandment which stated, \u201cRemember to keep holy Sabbath day. Six days you may labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord, your God. No work may be done then either by you\u2026 In six days, the Lord made the heavens and earth, the sea and all that is in them; but on the seventh day He rested. That is why the Lord has blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy\u201d (Ex 20:8-11). In the Old Testament, Sabbath served two purposes: rest and reverence. Consequently, rest had not only a social purpose but more importantly a religious one. God, who labored six days, rested the seventh day. Consequently, man, who was created in the image and likeness of God, is expected to imitate God and do the same: work for six days and rest the seventh day. God\u2019s \u201cwork\u201d is an example for mankind, the same is true of God\u2019s \u201crest.\u201d The Creator\u2019s rest turns out to be a joyful rest, where he enjoyed the beauty of his creation.\nIn A.D., 321 Emperor Constantine transferred the day of rest from Saturday to Sunday. Council of Orleans in A.D. 538 forbade all agricultural work on Sundays as Sunday was the feast of the Resurrection of Christ, the first day of the week and a day of rest and reverence. The Dies Domini became the Dies Christi . The Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC 2185) states: \u201cOn Sundays and other holy days of obligation, the faithful are to refrain from engaging in work or activities that hinder the worship owed to God, the joy proper to the Lord\u2019s Day, the performance of the works of mercy, and the appropriate relaxation of mind and body.\u201d So, the primary purpose of the Sunday is restful rest that allows joyful and mindful participation in the Holy Eucharist. Engaging in shopping, labor or other activities that distract from keeping Holy the Lord\u2019s Day and rest was not part of the Church\u2019s tradition. Keeping with the tradition the Church, also recognizes Sunday as a day to visit the elderly, the poor, and the infirm, which is often difficult to do during the weekdays. But above all, \u201cSunday is a time for reflection, silence, cultivation of the mind, and meditation which furthers the growth of the Christian interior life\u201d (CCC 2186).\nPoles know communism and Communist persecution first-hand. They do not want to return to what they have already suffered\u2014restless and irreverent Sundays of the Communist past. Keeping Holy the Lord\u2019s Day is keeping the faith and continuing the tradition. It does not take much to test the spirit of Poland and the Poles. Visit a church, any church, either in city-center or in the periphery, a university campus or a church run by a religious order, and you will marvel at the number of young people attending Mass or the lines of the faithful waiting for confession. In Poland, faith is vibrant among the young and the generation who still carry the wounds of Communist persecution. Poland has much to teach the old and highly secularized Western Europe. Pope Benedict XVI and St. John Paul II thought of Europe as a continent in deep crisis. For Benedict XVI the crisis in Europe and the crisis of Christianity in Europe are inherently related. He is convinced that only a rediscovery of the Christian faith and heritage can offer a remedy for the current spiritual crisis in Europe. Poland is showing Europe the way, and this begins with keeping the Lord\u2019s Day Holy and not shopping on Sundays.\nPoland is a nation with a soul. In Poland, faith has deep and meaningful roots. Maybe old Europe with empty-museum churches needs to turn East, towards the mightily tried and martyred Churches in Soviet-bloc countries to renew its faith. Europe is in desperate need of a soul, and Poland is showing her the way to get one.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

A three-judge panel of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments on Tuesday over the state\u2019s recent revisions to its 2011 voter identification law and whether those changes cure legal issues with the original law. The recent changes \u2014 which softened previous voter ID requirements considered among the toughest in the nation \u2014 were passed in response to court rulings that the 2011 law discriminated against Hispanic and black voters. Since Texas lawmakers passed the 2011 voter ID law, the state and the measure\u2019s foes have faced off several times in court. This time around, they\u2019ll largely focus on Senate Bill 5, a bill the Legislature passed earlier this year after courts found fault with the previous law. \nLast year, the 5th Circuit ruled that the 2011 law disproportionately burdened minority voters, who were less likely to have one of seven forms of identification the state required them to show at the polls. U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos upped the ante in April, ruling that the state discriminated against those voters on purpose. Her ruling raised the possibility she could invoke a section of the Voting Rights Act to put Texas\u2019 elections laws back under federal oversight. \nFollowing those rulings, Texas leaders proposed SB 5, a bill that mostly followed the lead of temporary voter ID rules Ramos put in place for the 2016 elections in an effort to ease the state\u2019s requirements.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ramos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nelva gonzales ramos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federal appeals court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "5th circuit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. 5th circuit court of appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "legislature", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "long-winding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:55.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9a1b3ac388d327349263f1014e4bb6cd5543c33c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZREav3SLRYasYc2adHWKrR6KbVKfG2Rdh8NOAEfaLPINl_MnvyXqINcumcaQalTcpI-", "site_full": "blogs.yahoo.co.jp", "site": "yahoo.co.jp", "site_section": "http://blogs.yahoo.co.jp/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Yahoo!\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0 - \u65b0\u7740\u8a18\u4e8b", "title": "\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u5b50", "title_full": "\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u5b50", "published": "2017-12-07T11:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "JP", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.jp/images/socialproducts/blog/img2/blog_fb_ogp.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9a1b3ac388d327349263f1014e4bb6cd5543c33c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZREav3SLRYasYc2adHWKrR6KbVKfG2Rdh8NOAEfaLPINl_MnvyXqINcumcaQalTcpI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u5b50", "text": ". \u4eba\u6c17\u5ea6 2017 1 2 3 5 13", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:55.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c22af4c18b0c338d42d9916e29e6d6b335eb517", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYDqSx6l4NqsvEI27puikv64", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "So... should I buy IOTA now?

CASA, psychiatrists and psychologists were all available for my son with his sexual assault and the court case that followed. And there was no acknowledgement for me, apart from the police and the court as I knew the assault was occurring but could not stop it, neither could the police due to the written letter of the law in which victims have to come forward before an investigation can occur. And because there was no services catering from the secondary/related victim, we are left with the feeling that we should be able to cope and should not be having negative feelings. Afterall, it wasn't the family that was assaulted. I do know that things in that area have improved since we went through that in 1997, but lasting impressions are made under extreme stress.\nI am now finding a very similar thing in this case with my daughters substance abuse. She is looked after, there are many services looking after her. But the rest of us are ignored. Unless, she goes missing or is uncontactable, and then the organisations and police ring me to get information and if I know where she is. But then nobody calls me back when they locate her! I call them, to be told that are unable to provide me with any information as she is an adult. So unless I am useful to them, I feel, as though I don't matter. I feel, as though I should not be feeling stressed, anxious, can't sleep, struggle to swallow, constant headaches ect.\nI did ring the mental health helpline in my state once. I was told and I Quote: as I was so shocked that I will never forget it \"Your daughter will be in an out of the psych ward, so you are better off just cutting your losses with her and getting on with your life. If you do want to talk more about it, maybe you should ring lifeline\". Safe to say I will never ring them again. But again, that type of response minimises what I am feeling and makes me question whether I am carrying on about nothing. I do see a psychologist, for the past 8 years, and at the moment the 10 sessions a year is far from adequate as this crisis has been long and continuous this year.\nThank you Sophie and Hope and love for validating how I feel. I really need that right now.\n:-)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:56.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b91fd246b5b1bbc048b557412b89bb6e51c2fee8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZiq2N497QkBEKrZtMT0Ov12LyJiIRV3UIA", "site_full": "www.beyondblue.org.au", "site": "beyondblue.org.au", "site_section": "http://www.beyondblue.org.au/connect-with-others/online-forums/supporting-family-and-friends-with-a-mental-health-condition-(carers)", "site_categories": ["health", "panic_anxiety_disorders", "depression"], "section_title": "Supporting family and friends with a mental health condition (carers) ", "title": "At what point is it ok to feel how I do? *Trigger Warning:Family Violence and Sexual Assault*", "title_full": "At what point is it ok to feel how I do? *Trigger Warning:Family Violence and Sexual Assault*", "published": "2017-11-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.126, "main_image": "https://www.beyondblue.org.au/App_Themes/standard/images/BB_FB_logo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "992888f295f758a2db1d1678883ddca99a47973e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZiq2N497QkBEKrZtMT0Ov12GspKctn8Uwr8pnJfECHzK56VbO7IoFlrLkLa4M4aGoQ", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Croix", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Dear Angusbob~\nYou said\nIn times of high stress, my rational self doesn't get much of a say as the irrational comes out to play.\nWell, I know exactly what you mean, I have to remind myself to breath sometimes:) And my decision making is 'unusual' too. The big thing for me nowadays is I realize what is happening, and can then take steps.\nI also understand your reluctance to vent your frustrations to these organizations however I think you may be being too forgiving and making too many allowances. I would not expect them to change how they treat your daughter based upon what you do.\nHave you considered going back to start, getting your GP to write/refer you as in individual? I suspect you are being lumped in with 'family' due most probably to their own limited resources - I'm guessing.\nThe other thing - once again you most probably have thought of it already - is a support group for families of those wiht a drug problem. I can't make any specific recommendations, however our Help Line (1300 22 4636) may be able to point you to something in your area. Interacting wiht other families in the same situation can't hurt.\nPosting here can be a help - even if it is only to blow off steam, which is something we all need to do when life piles up too much on us.\nCroix", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:56.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c22af4c18b0c338d42d9916e29e6d6b335eb517", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYDqSx6l4NqsvEI27puikv64", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "So... should I buy IOTA now?
