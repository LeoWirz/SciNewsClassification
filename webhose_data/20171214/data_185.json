I dunno why that is exactly that I talk like that but I can see what you mean.

Security Council have requested an emergency meeting on Jerusalem that could come as early as Friday. President Trump announced Wednesday that he would break with decades of US foreign policy and recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move the US Embassy there from Tel Aviv. The Latest on President Donald Trump\u2019s decision on recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital :. 6:25 pm. The region, we\u2019re told, will explode over President Trump\u2019s supposedly rash Jerusalem decision, so brace yourselves for turmoil and violence. President Donald Trump\u2019s standing in the Muslim community sunk to new lows this week, according to Hassan Mageid, president of the Islamic Society of Delaware. President Trump formally announced the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, saying it would advance the peace process. State officials largely cheered President Donald Trump decision to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Trump announced his administration would begin a process of moving the US embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a step expected to take years and one that his predecessors opted not to take to avoid inflaming tensions. President Trump said Wednesday that the US recognizes Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, a move that puts him at odds with the United Nations and much of the international community. Those members include the U.K, France, Egypt and Sweden.In a new poll conducted on Wednesday, a sweeping majority of Americans said they support moving Donald J. Trump to Jerusalem.

This is because finding the right legal representative is tricky especially nowadays when many people are claiming to be experts. When you have the right attorney, you will be confident that you can win the case. So, consider the following things when searching for long term disability benefits lawyer to hire\n\nJust like other professions, attorneys too specialized to handle the cases that are in the category that they feel comfortable. It would be a mistake if you choose someone to help you in the area where they are not competent. This is to say that if you have a disability benefit related case, then you must hire an attorney in that specialization. That is why you must understand the case first.\n\nThese days there are many con attorneys who will put misleading information on the internet. So, it requires one to know the areas where they are likely to find the truth. Locals bar association finds reliable information, and they post on the profile of the attorney. So, this is one of the areas where you can feel comfortable when searching. You can also inquire from people.\n\nAsking is another good and a quick source of getting the information. A reputable guy will be known by the residents around a particular area. So asking people will lead you to the right person. However, you should be vigilante when asking. Inquire from your family members who have hired a lawyer in the past and they should be able to help you out.\n\nAfter you have their contacts, call the person and arrange for a consultation. It is always prudent to meet the person before hiring them. This will give you a chance to know whether or not you will be comfortable as they work for you. As well, it will help in determining whether or not the person has the skills they are claiming to have in their documents.\n\nA meeting with your potential lawyer is vital. It is hard to know the character of someone if you never meet them. You cannot trust someone with your secrets if you are not sure that you are comfortable doing it. So, meet them face to face and see whether they are your type. When you do so, you will not make the wrong choice. The way the guy carries himself tells you a lot regarding their personality.\n\nChoose someone who has experience. Experienced individuals will not panic when they go to the court. This is because they have been there over and over until they are got used to it. A person who has just graduated will have problems for the first time no matter how knowledgeable they are. Hence, make sure that you look at the number of years they have worked.\n\nThose who have worked with a person who cannot converse well know why communication is vital. A lawyer relies on the effectiveness of their communication to argue. So, you cannot hire someone with poor communication skills and call it good. Talk to them and interview them to know how well they are good at answering the questions when asked.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are looking for information about a long term disability benefits lawyer , pay a visit to our web pages today.

Each and every single one of us has that problem in some way unless we work against it consciously at all times. Even then we fuck up.\nThe main thing though:\nThis doesn't mean you have to give up your ideals because they fundamentally go against human nature. You have those ideals explicitly BECAUSE of human nature. However, here is where some people need a lot of work, including a lot of you, and including me in the past:\nYou need to take your idealism and temper it with both -lots- of facts from actually reading up on things, and you need to also temper your idealism with a hefty and very measured conscious dose of realism. But don't let that realism make you pessimistic, but rather make it tell you what the right thing to actually do about your ideals is.\nThat thing, whether you want to believe it or not, is not actually communism\nCommunism is actually a really wonderful idea, but the thing is it hasn't been tempered by applying knowledge of how reality i.e. human nature works. But that is okay, just because you believe in that, doesnt mean youre wrong, it just means that you like many people wish this world was better, and just like I did in the past, you now go and take that and run with it, because it actually is a good idea, but the problem is, youre chasing pipe dreams and that is actually a very difficult reality to accept, and I know that from personal experience.\nHowever, all it should do is then tell you the way that you will actually be capable of applying your ideals in reality, and the thing you must realize:\nIf you hold these ideals you almost certainly have a big problem with authority for great reasons.

So, control yourself. BE the thing that helps this world not have such an authority problem, RECOGNIZE that problem when you see it in others, and do everything you can to stop it, because that LITERALLY is all that you can do, and all that you truly have the right, and arguably, the moral obligation, to do, if you hold communist beliefs.\nIt's simply a false approach, most of what is written on the matter. The funny thing is, it's actually right, except instead of applying it to society by force, you must each individually apply it to yourself. If everyone did that, and consciously fought that authority, we wouldn't need people to hit Enlightenment to have authority and not abuse it, or not abuse the fact you can literally create authority out of thin air. You don't need that. You simply need to follow your ideals and do your best to get people like you to do the same. But know that you can only apply that knowledge to yourself in practice, in that you may only rightfully control yourself and you may try to push point or pull people in the right direction, but they won't always come and it's not gonna be easy but if you try, then you are actually taking steps to obtain your ideals instead of sitting around on an imageboard discussing something that doesn't even matter because it can't happen and the way something like that coming about is only going to happen from each individual individually controlling themselves the right way.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:30.055+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d3f03fdab27b36e24fe8e218a93b5d8d45f4cf51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUt5Wzpq9cjfoqX2T7I5kEct", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/lgbt/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp; Transgender - 4chan", "title": "Why is the trans community infested by commies?", "title_full": "/lgbt/ - Why is the trans community infested by commies? - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T23:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 131, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9eb9a01b48dc82fb69ac5aa4c2e4b3e5e74acd74", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUt5Wzpq9cjfokuGrMw0ry8CyWNPErrn48U-", "ord_in_thread": 115, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T05:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>9249239\n>>9249232\nIn a nutshell:\nIf you are a communist than to be the best communist you can, or anarchist, or whatever.

They also lacked the financial assistance that comes with Hitler and Mussolini's support.\nYou're clearly a scholar of Catalonia so there's no need for me to mention what ifs about Durruti's plans to reach Basque country for it's arms industry. We also won't discuss the incentive of a free Morocco should fash get bash providing extra aid.\nI am gonna mention Stalin. True uncle joe was lending military assistance to the anarchists but at what cost? Besides 2/3s of Spain's gold. Anarchist militias were absorbed and destroyed by communist forces. Revolutionary spirit was crushed by authoritarianism. Andreu Nin got the purge on guess whose orders?\nAleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov's, but Stalin's really. Aleksandr was however the hatchetman responsible for murdering anarchists and trots.\nIt's also worth mentioning the US arms embargo that extended to the anarchist forces.\nSo on one side the anarchists were fighting fascism on the other stalinism. They lasted 3 years. How long did other nations last against fascist armies? Anarchists by definition can have NO state allies.\nAll that is just military apologetics though, I bring up Catalonia for it's success in a social revolution. Industries were swiftly collectivized and local goods were often held in common. That's my angle with Catalonia. That's why it's on that list, it's not the be all end all of anarcho syndicalism tho. Just a series of experiments.\nI agree the leadership sucked eggs btw, bourgeois sellouts.\nHave you read Rudolf Rocker's The Tragedy of Spain?

It lagged a bit behind others, in a way. It wasn't like the glorious Spain of old. It kinda was an off-to-the-side conflict, really, in the big picture considering global events at the time, and the thing is, those people in it should have been able to see that bigger picture. They could have actually done it, but I don't know if they actually would have been able to to be honest, because they were actually so disorganized, poorly lead, and had the odds stacked against them. The game was rigged from the start, and they should have known this.\nDid you expect ISIS to keep going forever? I mean, they clearly have declined and will vanish, but were they ever going to win in the first place? Hell no. Only a fool would try to piss off America - AND - Russia - and a bunch of other shit, without having nukes.\nNo nukes, no true sovereignty over your country today. That's why the media is freaking the fuck out over North Korea even though anyone who is wise enough knows as a fact, they will never lauch a nuke at any of us cause that would destroy them. We would literally have to seriously attack them first.\nThey have those nukes specifically so they can survive. Nobody mentions North Korea when they talk about communist regimes in a positive light, but in reality, while that seems to be a totalitarian nightmare I truly only know it through western media, and media is power, and power is corrupt, and media is always going to be corrupt.

IRL you can refuse to give people that power on an individual level, but in regards to countries and nations and such, you can't actually go and do that cause unlike IRL, that big mean guy you say no to is just going to have to take it, but when you say \"no\" to Germany and Russia and a whole bunch of other shit that can and will whoop your ass, that ass whooping is a fucking guarantee. Because international relationships aren't about your ideals, but rather which countries you have power over due to your superiority as a fighting force.\nThat's still happening today, btw. Loads of examples. The cold war made this really interesting, because for the first time there were a whole lot of really weird proxy wars going on, and all sorts of 4d chess stuff. Really interesting shit. But the thing it shows you is that you will be bullied as a nation if you don't play ball with the nations more powerful than you.\nYou will see this in current international relations. That is exactly why everyone is so butthurt about North Korea. They finally have made it so no nation can bully them by building themselves a MAD switch even if they can't destroy the world with it like the US or Russia can many many many many times over.

Photo: African News Agency \nMIAMI - SpaceX confirmed its CEO Elon Musk plans to blast his cherry red electric car off toward the Red Planet when the company's Falcon Heavy rocket launches for the first time next month. \nMany wondered if Musk was joking last week when he tweeted his plans for the Falcon Heavy's inaugural payload to be his \"midnight cherry Tesla Roadster playing Space Oddity,\" the classic song by the late David Bowie. \n\"Destination is Mars orbit. Will be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesn't blow up on ascent,\" the famed space enthusiast and Internet tycoon said on Twitter on Friday. \nBut SpaceX confirmed to AFP on Wednesday that the plan is for real. \nTouted as the \"world's most powerful rocket,\" the Falcon Heavy is designed to one day carry crew and supplies to deep space destinations such as the Moon and Mars. \nIt can propel 54 metric tons -- or the same as a fully loaded Boeing 737 jet -- into orbit, twice the load of the Delta IV Heavy, currently the biggest rocket in operation. \nThe Saturn V moon rocket, which last flew in 1973, was more powerful. \nThere were also two bigger rockets during the Soviet era -- the N1 which was the most powerful first stage ever built, though it failed to launch successfully; and Energia which only launched twice. \nThe Falcon Heavy is essentially three of the California-based company's Falcon 9 rockets put together, with 27 Merlin engines instead of nine. \nSpaceX says it will cost a third of what it costs to launch the Delta IV. \nA date has not yet been set for the Falcon Heavy launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, which has been delayed several times -- but SpaceX says it should happen in January 2018. \nAccording to astronomer and blogger Phil Plait, who was able to reach Musk for more details about the plan, the car won't be sent into orbit around Mars, but will enter \"an orbit around the Sun that takes it as close to the Sun as Earth and as far out as Mars.\" \nOther items may be added to the payload as well. \n\"Just bear in mind that there is a good chance this monster rocket blows up, so I wouldn't put anything of irreplaceable sentimental value on it,\" Musk was quoted as saying.

Lord Norman Foster\u2019s firm, Foster + Partners, has already been hit by Brexit uncertainty (PA) \nThe impact of lost export earnings from around the world could be \u00a373 million a year, the report claimed. \nThe study comes as the latest warning over the implications of a no deal Brexit, with sectors including the car industry sounding the alarm over the impact of a hard border and tariffs. \nBritain\u2019s architectural sector has already been hit by Brexit, with the largest player, Foster + Partners, whose projects include London\u2019s Gherkin tower, axing nearly 100 jobs earlier this year as a result of uncertainty around major builds. \nRiba is calling on the Government to take steps to protect Britain\u2019s architecture industry during negotiations. \nBen Derbyshire, president of Riba, said: \u201cWithout a Brexit deal that works for UK architecture we risk losing more of our global talent due to increased costs and economic uncertainty. \n\u201cA no deal Brexit is not an option; it would be a disaster for UK architecture and our built environment, and the Government must take this option off the table.\u201d \nThe UK\u2019s architecture sector is particularly exposed to the impact of trade and border changes due to its position as an exporter and its reliance on international talent, according to the report. \nRiba is urging the Government to ensure there is a post-Brexit immigration system to allow access to talent worldwide, continued mutual recognition of qualifications across the EU and market access without non-tariff barriers. \nIt also wants the Department for International Trade to expand its scope to support medium and small sized businesses to expand internationally. \nBut the research, called Global Talent, Global Reach, said there is potential for growth from new trade agreements outside the EU, with deals struck with the likes of China, the US, India and the United Arab Emirates estimated to be worth at least \u00a354 million in its first year. \nAlan Vallance, chief executive of Riba, said: \u201cBritish architects are the most respected and admired in the world, but we can\u2019t take this success and our \u00a34.8 billion contribution to UK economy for granted.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben derbyshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norman foster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan vallance", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department for international trade", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal institute of british architects", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foster + partners", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united arab emirates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:32.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8be805fc05d47e04468c84021b9e8bfd3f3585fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ4d_FO0gzNuLUMEewSvXHw2VRfrd9VtQ9R6Xa.da19jyWK6L4hZrIxDOLrmE_gNamzNF6_tBEka7Daa.7AcY7TRcPWZeYfWMBgcGkq_XqiuA--", "site_full": "bham.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://bham.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist birmingham, AL | personals search", "title": "Seeking a guy to keep me company!
