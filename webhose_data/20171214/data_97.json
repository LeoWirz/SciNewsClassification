But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Quick guide Hide What is modern slavery? \nAbout 150 years after most countries banned slavery \u2013 Brazil was the last to abolish its participation in the transatlantic slave trade, in 1888 \u2013 millions of men, women and children are still enslaved. Contemporary slavery takes many forms, from women forced into prostitution, to child slavery in agriculture supply chains or whole families working for nothing to pay off generational debts. Slavery thrives on every continent and in almost every country. Forced labour, people trafficking, debt bondage and child marriage are all forms of modern-day slavery that affect the world's most vulnerable people. How many people are enslaved across the world? \nThe UN's International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimates that about 21 million people are in forced labour at any point in time. The ILO says this estimate includes trafficking and other forms of modern slavery. They calculate that 90% of the 21 million are exploited by individuals or companies, while 10% are forced to work by the state, rebel military groups, or in prisons under conditions that violate ILO standards. Sexual exploitation accounts for 22% of slaves. Where does slavery exist? \nSlavery exists in one form or another in every country. Asia accounts for more than half of the ILO's 21 million estimate. In terms of percentage of population, central and south-east Europe has the highest prevalence of forced labour, followed by Africa, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean. Who is profiting? \nIn 2005, the ILO estimated that illegal profits from forced labour amounted to more than $44bn. The UN's global initiative to fight trafficking says people trafficking is the third-largest global criminal industry (pdf) behind drugs and arms trafficking. The ILO estimates that people in forced labour lose at least $21bn each year in unpaid wages and recruitment fees. Slavery also exists within global supply chains, generating huge profits for those who control this industry in free labour. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. \nThe recommended threshold is well below the $100m previously proposed by government , and would capture most large entities in Australia, the inquiry said. \nIt would force companies like Woolworths and Coles, for example, to show slavery is not occurring among its suppliers. \nThe inquiry also recommended vulnerable migrant workers should be better protected through changes to Australia\u2019s visa system, while a community hotline should be created to report modern slavery and a national labour hire licensing scheme established. \nThe inquiry also called for measures to stamp out Australian support for orphanage tourism, which exploits fake orphans for profit from tourists, often putting them at significant risk of harm. Australian companies could be forced to report on how they combat slavery Read more \nOrphanage tourism should be included in the definition of modern slavery and the Australian government has been urged to ensure foreign aid does not go to overseas orphanages. \nThe inquiry also called for aid funding to be diverted to keeping families together and caring for children through community-based care, rather than institutions. \nThe recommendations have been praised by leading orphanage tourism expert, Kate Van Doore, of Griffith University, who said it put Australia at the forefront of efforts tackle exploitation. \n\u201cThese recommendations pave the way for Australia to continue to lead the world in combatting orphanage trafficking,\u201d Van Doore told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey represent a huge step for child protection advocates who have worked tirelessly to have orphanage trafficking recognised in law.\u201d \nThe inquiry also recommended a compensation scheme for victims of modern slavery in Australia should also be created, the inquiry said, which would be funded through proceeds of crime. The government should also give victims the right to sue for modern slavery. \nThe foreign affairs and aid sub-committee chair, Chris Crewther, described modern slavery as a \u201cheinous\u201d crime that must be stamped out. \n\u201cModern slavery describes some of the greatest crimes of our time,\u201d Crewther said. \u201cThe recommendations from this inquiry make a significant contribution to ensuring that, here in Australia, we are doing all we can to eradicate these crimes.\u201d \nThe inquiry has also recommended further research on modern slavery be conducted by the Australian Institute of Criminology and that defences be introduced to protect victims of modern slavery offences who are compelled to commit a crime. \nThe government released a plan in August to make large companies file annual reports on modern slavery.

Galatians 4:4\u20135 A Matter Of Spirit As an heir of God, you have a rich inheritance. All the blessings of your heavenly Father are yours!\n\u201cWell, Pastor Prince, if it\u2019s true that I am an heir of God because I\u2019m His son, then why am I still not seeing the blessings?\u201d\nI asked the Lord the same question once. I said, \u201cLord, why is it that there are believers who don\u2019t seem to be blessed despite the fact that they are Your sons and heirs?\u201d The Lord said this to me, \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of spirit.\u201d Then, He pointed me to Romans 8:15, NIV\u2014\u201cFor you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, \u2018 Abba , Father.\u2019\u201d He was telling me that walking in His blessings has to do with having a spirit of sonship.\nHow does the spirit of sonship operate? By the cry, \u201c Abba , Father!\u201d The Holy Spirit left the word  Abba , meaning \u201cDaddy\u201d or \u201cPapa,\u201d untranslated in Romans 8:15 so that we will know that God wants us to have an intimate relationship with Him. Seeing God as Daddy and calling Him \u201cDaddy\u201d or \u201cPapa\u201d removes any distance and breaks down every barrier between you and God. It brings you into an intimate relationship with God and that\u2019s how the spirit of sonship operates.\nSo beloved, have a spirit of sonship. Don\u2019t see God as an impersonal, distant being who doesn\u2019t really care how you feel. He isn\u2019t just Almighty God, He is also your Daddy! Have this sense of intimacy with Him all the time and start to walk in a greater measure of your Daddy\u2019s blessings!\n\njosephprince.com theletgobook.com ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph prince", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prince", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "holy spirit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abba", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:15:29.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "77e9f0385321fb8fdd76510ce4165105772108fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpBxsSvCS3A1ZYyiEv507rMMqkU.zqtjCGDu7syjD.emWtL_tgP.Hkzsobgj9vPrPGpfVtNVBF28ryXGfvEY_8Y", "site_full": "blog.artparks.co.uk", "site": "artparks.co.uk", "site_section": "http://blog.artparks.co.uk/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "ArtParkS Sculpture Blog", "title": "'Dream VII (Bronze Satieated nude Kneeling Girl maquette)' by artist Edward Fleming", "title_full": "'Dream VII (Bronze Satieated nude Kneeling Girl maquette)' by artist Edward Fleming", "published": "2017-12-07T11:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "77e9f0385321fb8fdd76510ce4165105772108fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpBxsSvCS3A1ZYyiEv507rMMqkU.zqtjCGDu7syjD.emWtL_tgP.Hkzsobgj9vPrPGpfVtNVBF28ryXGfvEY_8Y", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "William de Sausmarez (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "'Dream VII (Bronze Satieated nude Kneeling Girl maquette)' by artist Edward Fleming", "text": "\n#Artist Edward Fleming's #artwork 'Dream VII (Bronze Satieated nude Kneeling Girl maquette)' http://artparks.co.uk/s8739 at ArtParkS.

During the event, players from levels 15-98 will only need half experience to reach the next level. In addition, weapons will be enhanced. It's prudent to choose which characters wisely, however, since only two characters (new or existing) can be used during the event. 3rd Jobs are set to launch on December 20th. \nPlayers will have access to many rewards, including: Unique-Grade Heroic Weapon Book of Transcendence: God's Will Transcendence Skill Slot Change Medal Secret Dungeon Entry Permit Pre-Event Badge Various Dungeon Tickets and Consumables \nYou can learn more on the Elsword site . advertisement Suzie Ford / Suzie is the Associate Editor and News Manager at MMORPG.com.

It was built focused on security issues and tricks that malware researcher have on they every day work. For those situations on where the malware has anti-analysis routines, Droidefense attemps to bypass them in order to get to the code and 'bad boy' routine. Sometimes those techniques can be virtual machine detection, emulator detection, self certificate checking, pipes detection. tracer pid check, and so on. \nDroidefense uses an innovative idea in where the code is not decompiled rather than viewed. This allow us to get the global view of the execution workflow of the code with a 100% accuracy on gathered information. With this situation, Droidefense generates a fancy html report with the results for an easy understanding. \n\u770b\u8d77\u4f86\u662f\u8f14\u52a9\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177... \u5148\u8a18\u9304\u4e0b\u4f86 XD Related ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "droidefense", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:15:29.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ba12045190493be8826763e4c5508d20ba1fe9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbdyT7Re93k71haaUwwVtwhWUqHxKw4g9ra2B7EoWEccTZE8P4Lf1Z2TLgts63Gro7fT8.8Wh8qFGpbVKHPq4EM.86F3v8XOUD3GVsyqsXEZUwqtTeEtPMVw-", "site_full": "www.expedia.ca", "site": "expedia.ca", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.ca/Endurance-City-Hotels.d6144511.Travel-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Top 10 Endurance City Hotels: Cheap Hotel Deals from C$116 | Expedia.ca", "title": "Movenpick Hotel Ibn Battuta Gate - Dubai:", "title_full": "Movenpick Hotel Ibn Battuta Gate - Dubai: 2017 Pictures, Reviews, Prices & Deals | Expedia.ca", "published": "2017-09-02T06:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6618, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81ea6a071fc9ee0403266df6006636df15b16828", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbdyT7Re93k71haaUwwVtwhWUqHxKw4g9ra2B7EoWEccTZE8P4Lf1Z2TLgts63Gro7fT8.8Wh8qFGpbVKHPq4EM.86F3v8XOUD3GVsyqsXEZUurhDYhG9CWnu.xNu8j7F4C2ANiZ9j4erZABEz5LbdOc-", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-07T08:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Excellent overall experience, went with my wife and 6 month old baby.

I got your e-mail a few days ago. I thought it was funny, that Quote: with Iggy Pop.\nQ: I thought you would enjoy it. Let's dive right in. Which albums by other groups were favorites among The Yardbirds during the '66-'68 period? Which psychedelic albums in particular?\nJM: We'd take a sort of mobile record player around with us and play things, Keith and I. A couple of the things were The Mothers of Invention's first two albums, FREAK OUT and WE'RE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY. We used to like those because they were sort of silly. REVOLVER was another one. Also Keith and I quite liked that EAST-WEST by Paul Butterfield. Another thing was that Steve Miller thing, \"Songs For Our Ancestors.\" You know, with all the tugboats on it. That was a good track. And then there was some of that psychedelic classical music like John Cage. Really weird stuff. Maybe Stockhausen.\nCD: We were listening to The Beatles for sure. We were still listening to the blues, Paul Butterfield and people like that. We were listening to what other British bands of the day were up to. You know, any of our contemporaries- The Beach Boys, Beatles again. As a band, we were listening to these other groups, but we working so much that we were introverted into our own world. Hendrix of course came roaring into the scene around then. He was very exciting and guitar-oriented like we were. He gave us impetus to continue down the road we had already been following. By that time we had Jimmy so it was getting a lot more strange from what we had been doing a few years earlier. We were aware of the music around us, but as I said we were very self-contained. We had our heads down, on our own trail.\nQ: Of course you have thirty years hindsight, but at the time were you really aware that things began to change musically? Meaning, it had been more beat oriented or R & B . . .\nJM: Definitely. I think we always wanted to get out of that heavy 12 bar format. Make it different while keeping the basis of that blues feel, but make it more interesting. That's why we did the sort of things we did. Try to build up some excitement. When Jeff came into the band he was a lot more the way we wanted to go. Eric was very blues purist. At the time anyway. Jeff wasn't like that. He had more variety about him. He played all sorts of weird sounds, electronic sounds that seemed to fit in. The first time we went to L.A. there were all these weird hippies appearing at our gigs. They thought we were all tripping on acid. But it was just our music. We hadn't done drugs yet. We were really straight still.\nQ: The States really took to you. Of course, when you started off in Britain, you had a rabid fan base when you were playing at the Crawdaddy and the Marquee. But later on it seems like the English kind of ignored you, whereas you went over really well in America.\nJM: That's true. It's a bit strange. The British market seemed to revolve around the hit single. It was very frustrating. You had to be thinking of the next single all the time. It was like being in a small box. The things we liked to do, playing live, the Americans really appreciated, especially the innovative things we did on stage.\nCD: In retrospect, it's a bit odd. I suppose it's very much of an English thing. The English kind of love you before you've broken, as it were. I think the thing in America was we got put on some very long tours. The scope was greater. The kids were much more into the type of music we were making, the embryo garage thing. The English tend to forget you if you leave the shore for too long.\nQ: Which British groups from that era, particularly '66, were good live acts? And did any of them influence you?\nJM: The Animals and The Who, I thought, were very good live. We played with The Beatles a few times. They were okay live, but they basically just played their songs and ran off stage. You couldn't hear them at all because of the screaming.\nQ: How about American groups?\nJM: The Lovin' Spoonful were very good live. And so was The Butterfield Blues Band. I saw them with Mike Bloomfield in '66, around the EAST-WEST album. They were different than us, a little more blues purist, although the song \"East-West\" was similar to our psychedelic approach. They were very good live. We saw them down in one of the Sunset Strip clubs. Maybe The Trip. I saw them later when I was with Renaissance. They had a huge horn section and the feel was quite different. They were a very good band with Mike Bloomfield and Elvin Bishop, though.\nQ: What do you think were some of the major differences between the British and American bands?\nJM: The British bands had a lot more stage presence. The American bands always seemed to be a bit more shy. We seemed to be a bit more sincere somehow. Not every band, of course. I didn't see every band. But the American bands seemed to be a bit more lame. I don't want to tread on your toes here (laughs).\nQ: Don't worry. I prefer British rock n roll.\nJM: You know like Paul Revere & The Raiders and those kinds of bands. Of course, we had some lightweight stuff like Freddie & The Dreamers and some of that Merseybeat stuff. There just didn't seem to be any kind of meaty American band at that time, except for Butterfield. And there were all those bands like The Electric Prunes and The Chain Reaction, who seemed to be doing what we were doing. When I hear these accounts of when we first came over with Beck and we were playing these gigs, people expected some kind of pop band and we were playing this freaky off-the-wall stuff that apparently blew people's minds. It seems that we inspired a lot of people to try and play in our style.\nQ: Do you think any of the live recordings with Beck, like the BBC stuff and a few bootlegs, are actually representative of that line-up's live sound?\nJM: The BBC took all the excitement out of it. That's what they were famous for, really. There's probably no live recordings with Jeff that come close. I think the singles we recorded in the States with Jeff, like \"Mister, You're A Better Man Than I,\" \"Shapes Of Things\" and \"Train Kept A-Rolling,\" were closer to our potential. We never got a live recording as such. It was funny with Jeff. It was either hit or miss. If it was a good night, it would be great. But that might be only one out of five gigs. It wasn't really uniform.\nQ: What live show stands out in retrospect? What did you think about playing with Beck and Page together?\nJM: There were a few shows that stood out as being really good. In the Beck-era we did a small residency on Sunset strip in Hollywood, a club called the Hullabaloo I believe. I remember a great atmosphere and playing really well! Another show that stands out was with Jeff and Jimmy at Cardiff on The Stones tour when the crowd just wouldn't stop screaming for an encore right before The Stones were due on! A show that happened like this was pretty rare with that line-up!\nQ: Do you remember hearing The Beatles song \"Tomorrow Never Knows\"?\nJM: Yeah, yeah. It was great. I remember hearing it in L.A. We did a gig over in Catalina Island. All these freaks came along and we played that album. We were at somebody's house and we played that album. I thought it was great.\nQ: Were you experimenting with illicit substances at this point?\nJM: Yeah, it came in a little bit slowly. We probably had a smoke for that particular song! It would have fit, wouldn't it? (laughs) It was a great track. It was a great album actually.\nQ: Did any of you play while tripping on acid?\nJM: I believe I did, but not very often! At the Fillmore we met up with Dr. Owsley who would give you handfuls of strange tablets that he had manufactured in his laboratory!\nQ: When was your first acid trip? Care to share the experience?\nJM: I'm afraid acid didn't do me much good. I had to duck out of a few gigs while suffering from the after-effects.\nQ: Chris, were you clean?\nCD: As far as I know, Jimmy Page and I were completely clean at the time. I hadn't even drunk if I remember correctly. I didn't drink, smoke or take drugs.\nQ: Did it bother you that Jim and Keith were doing drugs?\nCD: What can I say? Everybody around us was doing drugs. It was almost expected. I felt for Keith. He was never a healthy person. With the traveling and playing it affected one's health, especially mental health. So I felt concern as a friend. And I suppose you can say it was another reason why the band was no longer cohesive. I think they were kind of under the illusion that drugs can give you. Not necessarily the reality. I can't speak for Jimmy, but I seem to remember that he and I were straight and the other two weren't.\nQ: Now, Keith and Jim spent a lot of time together. Were you hanging out with Jimmy or were you doing your own thing like taking photos?\nCD: I suppose I did retreat into that a great deal actually, well spotted. I hung out with Jimmy to a degree traveling. I was always close to Jim. And at times I was close to Keith. But there was some diametrically opposed things going on. If you're not doing drugs, it's hard to hang out with people who are doing drugs. It's not that you don't want to be with them, but people who do drugs want to be with people who do drugs as well. I had my photography and other creative pursuits. And yes, I did immerse myself in that.\nQ: Where and/or when did The Velvet Underground's \"I'm Waiting For The Man\" enter your set list?\nJM: We did a few gigs with them in Detroit. We played a big festival in Detroit for a few days and they played it, too. We heard it and thought, \"This is quite a good song, isn't it?\" We probably did it because we were low on ideas and were looking around for material. We played it with the Jimmy line-up, but I think Jeff was still in the band when we played with The Velvet Underground (ed. note: Beck had already left the band). At some point we got their album.\nCD: I think that was in Detroit. We played with them there. I don't think we did it with Jeff in the band, though. Why we did it? We did that very occasionally, when odd bits of material by other artists showed up in our set. That actually might have been Jimmy who wanted to do it. Good call on his part.\nQ: Are these apocryphal stories as recounted in the book UPTIGHT about Jeff Beck intimidating The Velvets with a pistol true? And about him shooting up Sun Studios?\nJM: Never heard that. Don't know if Jeff had a pistol . . . I don't know maybe he did! (laughs) And the Sun Studios story isn't true. Going back to The Underground, though, I remember coming out of the hotel one day and there was Andy Warhol in the limo. And the guy who was sort of his tour manager said \"do you want to come along with Andy to the gig?\" So we sat there and Andy didn't speak. \"Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\" had just been released. And the guy says, \"Andy likes your new single.\" (laughs) It was weird! Andy was sitting right there and this guy was speaking for him, which was really strange.\nCD: I find that so bizarre. I don't know where that comes from. Jeff with a firearm, that's so ridiculous. He's never been into guns. He's into cars! That's rubbish. As for Sun Studios, we were all over-powered with the legend of rock n roll. The idea of Jeff shooting up Sam Phillips' studio is absolute nonsense. The Yardbirds weren't a violent band in any shape or form. In fact, we avoided conflict most of the time. We got through nearly all of our gigs unscathed, even in the Deep South. We weren't crazy looking if you look at photos from that time. But we must have been strange looking to America in the '60s, especially in the South. Even in our own country, where there's some pretty tough areas, I think there was only one time that we needed to get the local authorities to help assist us from a venue because of some aggravation. But we never really ran into much trouble. I remember one story about The Animals when they played in Montgomery, Alabama or someplace like that. They had a black road manager. They put him in a cupboard in a Holiday Inn, not even a proper suite. After the concert, everybody was hot and they went for a swim, including this guy. The next day they fumigated the pool, drained it and everything.

A couple of people have been arrested and are in police custody. \n\nThis marks a tragic ending to a nearly three week search for the 2011 Neligh-Oakdale graduate, who went missing Nov. 15 following a date with Bailey Boswell of Wilber, a female she met online. \nGeorge Loofe, Sydney's father, said the Loofe family would like to: \n\"Thank everyone that had anything to do with the search for Sydney, including praying, getting the word out, assisting with printing flyers, helping with billboards, spreading the word on social media and other assistance.

Sydney just happened to run into someone that wasn't.\" \nLoofe said the family was notified at approximately 4 p.m. Monday, Dec. 4, that a body had been found west of the community of Wilber. A phone call 90 minutes later confirmed the body was Sydney's. As the family attempted to notify family and friends, news of the situation was released by various media outlets. \nAerial and ground searches took place around the community of Wilber over the past week. Police presence near the location of Boswell's residence in Wilber was reported within three days of Sydney's disappearance. \nBoswell and Aubrey Trail, a 51-yr.-old male, both persons of interest in Sydney's disappearance, are in custody of the Saline County Sheriff's department on outstanding warrants. The two were found in Missouri last week and transferred to Nebraska. \nBoswell had a warrant for her arrest filed in 2016 when she failed to appear in Lancaster County Court on an alleged possession of drug paraphernalia charge. Trail had a warrant issued for his arrest in Saline County, one week following the disappearance of Sydney. The warrant alleged Trail was a felon in possession of a firearm and a habitual criminal. \nSydney's father said the outcome was not expected by the family, but again recognized \"good people\" in the world. \nIt is not known where the body was recovered, cause of death or if any charges have been filed in relation to Sydney's disappearance. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sydney loofe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boswell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george loofe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loofe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bailey boswell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aubrey trail", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "lincoln", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lancaster county court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saline county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nebraska", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:15:30.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a12ce365157f0d25f9bd13f910ab58f84066398", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOS_5hBLgIvVHMWWP7luZGaDig4snhMhj6w3ZrsBHipA8gS6u5IBZt11D9XFUTnBG39UXfTJX60NIkbpjCQFDR3vPEC0mpMJpQ-", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g190455-i550-Norway.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Norway Forum, Travel Discussion for Norway - TripAdvisor", "title": "Oslo-Troms\u00f8 flight in March - Norway", "title_full": "Oslo-Troms\u00f8 flight in March - Norway Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-07T09:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7a12ce365157f0d25f9bd13f910ab58f84066398", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOS_5hBLgIvVHMWWP7luZGaDig4snhMhj6w3ZrsBHipA8gS6u5IBZt11D9XFUTnBG39UXfTJX60NIkbpjCQFDR3vPEC0mpMJpQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Daniela C", "published": "2017-12-07T09:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Oslo-Troms\u00f8 flight in March - Norway", "text": "Hello everyone!

I got your e-mail a few days ago. I thought it was funny, that Quote: with Iggy Pop.\nQ: I thought you would enjoy it. Let's dive right in. Which albums by other groups were favorites among The Yardbirds during the '66-'68 period? Which psychedelic albums in particular?\nJM: We'd take a sort of mobile record player around with us and play things, Keith and I. A couple of the things were The Mothers of Invention's first two albums, FREAK OUT and WE'RE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY. We used to like those because they were sort of silly. REVOLVER was another one. Also Keith and I quite liked that EAST-WEST by Paul Butterfield. Another thing was that Steve Miller thing, \"Songs For Our Ancestors.\" You know, with all the tugboats on it. That was a good track. And then there was some of that psychedelic classical music like John Cage. Really weird stuff. Maybe Stockhausen.\nCD: We were listening to The Beatles for sure. We were still listening to the blues, Paul Butterfield and people like that. We were listening to what other British bands of the day were up to. You know, any of our contemporaries- The Beach Boys, Beatles again. As a band, we were listening to these other groups, but we working so much that we were introverted into our own world. Hendrix of course came roaring into the scene around then. He was very exciting and guitar-oriented like we were. He gave us impetus to continue down the road we had already been following. By that time we had Jimmy so it was getting a lot more strange from what we had been doing a few years earlier. We were aware of the music around us, but as I said we were very self-contained. We had our heads down, on our own trail.\nQ: Of course you have thirty years hindsight, but at the time were you really aware that things began to change musically? Meaning, it had been more beat oriented or R & B . . .\nJM: Definitely. I think we always wanted to get out of that heavy 12 bar format. Make it different while keeping the basis of that blues feel, but make it more interesting. That's why we did the sort of things we did. Try to build up some excitement. When Jeff came into the band he was a lot more the way we wanted to go. Eric was very blues purist. At the time anyway. Jeff wasn't like that. He had more variety about him. He played all sorts of weird sounds, electronic sounds that seemed to fit in. The first time we went to L.A. there were all these weird hippies appearing at our gigs. They thought we were all tripping on acid. But it was just our music. We hadn't done drugs yet. We were really straight still.\nQ: The States really took to you. Of course, when you started off in Britain, you had a rabid fan base when you were playing at the Crawdaddy and the Marquee. But later on it seems like the English kind of ignored you, whereas you went over really well in America.\nJM: That's true. It's a bit strange. The British market seemed to revolve around the hit single. It was very frustrating. You had to be thinking of the next single all the time. It was like being in a small box. The things we liked to do, playing live, the Americans really appreciated, especially the innovative things we did on stage.\nCD: In retrospect, it's a bit odd. I suppose it's very much of an English thing. The English kind of love you before you've broken, as it were. I think the thing in America was we got put on some very long tours. The scope was greater. The kids were much more into the type of music we were making, the embryo garage thing. The English tend to forget you if you leave the shore for too long.\nQ: Which British groups from that era, particularly '66, were good live acts? And did any of them influence you?\nJM: The Animals and The Who, I thought, were very good live. We played with The Beatles a few times. They were okay live, but they basically just played their songs and ran off stage. You couldn't hear them at all because of the screaming.\nQ: How about American groups?\nJM: The Lovin' Spoonful were very good live. And so was The Butterfield Blues Band. I saw them with Mike Bloomfield in '66, around the EAST-WEST album. They were different than us, a little more blues purist, although the song \"East-West\" was similar to our psychedelic approach. They were very good live. We saw them down in one of the Sunset Strip clubs. Maybe The Trip. I saw them later when I was with Renaissance. They had a huge horn section and the feel was quite different. They were a very good band with Mike Bloomfield and Elvin Bishop, though.\nQ: What do you think were some of the major differences between the British and American bands?\nJM: The British bands had a lot more stage presence. The American bands always seemed to be a bit more shy. We seemed to be a bit more sincere somehow. Not every band, of course. I didn't see every band. But the American bands seemed to be a bit more lame. I don't want to tread on your toes here (laughs).\nQ: Don't worry. I prefer British rock n roll.\nJM: You know like Paul Revere & The Raiders and those kinds of bands. Of course, we had some lightweight stuff like Freddie & The Dreamers and some of that Merseybeat stuff. There just didn't seem to be any kind of meaty American band at that time, except for Butterfield. And there were all those bands like The Electric Prunes and The Chain Reaction, who seemed to be doing what we were doing. When I hear these accounts of when we first came over with Beck and we were playing these gigs, people expected some kind of pop band and we were playing this freaky off-the-wall stuff that apparently blew people's minds. It seems that we inspired a lot of people to try and play in our style.\nQ: Do you think any of the live recordings with Beck, like the BBC stuff and a few bootlegs, are actually representative of that line-up's live sound?\nJM: The BBC took all the excitement out of it. That's what they were famous for, really. There's probably no live recordings with Jeff that come close. I think the singles we recorded in the States with Jeff, like \"Mister, You're A Better Man Than I,\" \"Shapes Of Things\" and \"Train Kept A-Rolling,\" were closer to our potential. We never got a live recording as such. It was funny with Jeff. It was either hit or miss. If it was a good night, it would be great. But that might be only one out of five gigs. It wasn't really uniform.\nQ: What live show stands out in retrospect? What did you think about playing with Beck and Page together?\nJM: There were a few shows that stood out as being really good. In the Beck-era we did a small residency on Sunset strip in Hollywood, a club called the Hullabaloo I believe. I remember a great atmosphere and playing really well! Another show that stands out was with Jeff and Jimmy at Cardiff on The Stones tour when the crowd just wouldn't stop screaming for an encore right before The Stones were due on! A show that happened like this was pretty rare with that line-up!\nQ: Do you remember hearing The Beatles song \"Tomorrow Never Knows\"?\nJM: Yeah, yeah. It was great. I remember hearing it in L.A. We did a gig over in Catalina Island. All these freaks came along and we played that album. We were at somebody's house and we played that album. I thought it was great.\nQ: Were you experimenting with illicit substances at this point?\nJM: Yeah, it came in a little bit slowly. We probably had a smoke for that particular song! It would have fit, wouldn't it? (laughs) It was a great track. It was a great album actually.\nQ: Did any of you play while tripping on acid?\nJM: I believe I did, but not very often! At the Fillmore we met up with Dr. Owsley who would give you handfuls of strange tablets that he had manufactured in his laboratory!\nQ: When was your first acid trip? Care to share the experience?\nJM: I'm afraid acid didn't do me much good. I had to duck out of a few gigs while suffering from the after-effects.\nQ: Chris, were you clean?\nCD: As far as I know, Jimmy Page and I were completely clean at the time. I hadn't even drunk if I remember correctly. I didn't drink, smoke or take drugs.\nQ: Did it bother you that Jim and Keith were doing drugs?\nCD: What can I say? Everybody around us was doing drugs. It was almost expected. I felt for Keith. He was never a healthy person. With the traveling and playing it affected one's health, especially mental health. So I felt concern as a friend. And I suppose you can say it was another reason why the band was no longer cohesive. I think they were kind of under the illusion that drugs can give you. Not necessarily the reality. I can't speak for Jimmy, but I seem to remember that he and I were straight and the other two weren't.\nQ: Now, Keith and Jim spent a lot of time together. Were you hanging out with Jimmy or were you doing your own thing like taking photos?\nCD: I suppose I did retreat into that a great deal actually, well spotted. I hung out with Jimmy to a degree traveling. I was always close to Jim. And at times I was close to Keith. But there was some diametrically opposed things going on. If you're not doing drugs, it's hard to hang out with people who are doing drugs. It's not that you don't want to be with them, but people who do drugs want to be with people who do drugs as well. I had my photography and other creative pursuits. And yes, I did immerse myself in that.\nQ: Where and/or when did The Velvet Underground's \"I'm Waiting For The Man\" enter your set list?\nJM: We did a few gigs with them in Detroit. We played a big festival in Detroit for a few days and they played it, too. We heard it and thought, \"This is quite a good song, isn't it?\" We probably did it because we were low on ideas and were looking around for material. We played it with the Jimmy line-up, but I think Jeff was still in the band when we played with The Velvet Underground (ed. note: Beck had already left the band). At some point we got their album.\nCD: I think that was in Detroit. We played with them there. I don't think we did it with Jeff in the band, though. Why we did it? We did that very occasionally, when odd bits of material by other artists showed up in our set. That actually might have been Jimmy who wanted to do it. Good call on his part.\nQ: Are these apocryphal stories as recounted in the book UPTIGHT about Jeff Beck intimidating The Velvets with a pistol true? And about him shooting up Sun Studios?\nJM: Never heard that. Don't know if Jeff had a pistol . . . I don't know maybe he did! (laughs) And the Sun Studios story isn't true. Going back to The Underground, though, I remember coming out of the hotel one day and there was Andy Warhol in the limo. And the guy who was sort of his tour manager said \"do you want to come along with Andy to the gig?\" So we sat there and Andy didn't speak. \"Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\" had just been released. And the guy says, \"Andy likes your new single.\" (laughs) It was weird! Andy was sitting right there and this guy was speaking for him, which was really strange.\nCD: I find that so bizarre. I don't know where that comes from. Jeff with a firearm, that's so ridiculous. He's never been into guns. He's into cars! That's rubbish. As for Sun Studios, we were all over-powered with the legend of rock n roll. The idea of Jeff shooting up Sam Phillips' studio is absolute nonsense. The Yardbirds weren't a violent band in any shape or form. In fact, we avoided conflict most of the time. We got through nearly all of our gigs unscathed, even in the Deep South. We weren't crazy looking if you look at photos from that time. But we must have been strange looking to America in the '60s, especially in the South. Even in our own country, where there's some pretty tough areas, I think there was only one time that we needed to get the local authorities to help assist us from a venue because of some aggravation. But we never really ran into much trouble. I remember one story about The Animals when they played in Montgomery, Alabama or someplace like that. They had a black road manager. They put him in a cupboard in a Holiday Inn, not even a proper suite. After the concert, everybody was hot and they went for a swim, including this guy. The next day they fumigated the pool, drained it and everything. But the only sort of controversy I can remember us experiencing is being refused entrance to Disney Land because our hair was too long! Click to expand... Great interview!

Guide to the Local Talent Pool", "text": "Source - pypl.github.io \nDespite its widespread use, Java is a complex language with high barriers to entry, meaning that most Java developers are professionals with a good tech education. There are many Java programmers with a .Net background because the two technologies have many things in common. You will rarely meet a good Java software developer who is self-taught or simply finished an online course to learn the language. \nDue to the growing demand for their services, Java software developers are considered to be some of the most well-paid specialists in IT industry. For example, the average Java developer salary across the US is $102,064, according to the job search platform Indeed.com. Average software developer salaries for the most popular programming languages in the US \nHowever, salaries for Java experts vary greatly within the US, depending heavily on city and state. For example, San Francisco and New York top the list of high-earners with average Java developer salaries of $134k and $122k respectively. \nWhile the average salaries for Java experts around the world are slightly lower than those in the US, the language still pays well wherever you go. Average Java developer salaries worldwide, according to Indeed.com 3 reasons to hire Java engineers in Ukraine \nWith a pool of over 53,000 software developers, Ukraine is considered to be one of the leading global outsourcing destinations. Due to high demand and competitive salary ranges, Java engineers make up a large proportion of the Ukrainian IT talent pool. \nAccording to our research, there are at least 4,499 Java developers in Ukraine . This makes Java the second most popular language among Ukrainian developers, closely following C/C++. \nWhat makes Ukrainian Java developers so special? Education \nThe growing amount of Java developers and Java software outsourcing companies in Ukraine can be attributed to the large number of technical universities located across some of the country\u2019s major cities. These educational institutions give a solid technical and mathematical background, which is recognized worldwide. \nSome of the Ukrainian polytechnic universities are listed in the QS World University Rankings 2018 . These are: V. N. Karazin Kharkiv National University Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv National Technical University of Ukraine \"Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute\" National Technical University of Ukraine \u201cKyiv Polytechnic Institute\u201d Vasyl` Stus Donetsk National University Sumy State University \nIn addition to the above-listed schools, there are plenty of other good educational institutions across the country\u2019s major IT hubs, including Lviv, Odessa, and Dnipro. Experience \nThe local Java IT talent pool is growing steadily, as developers rush to join one of the most dynamic and high-paying industries in the country. Yet, thanks to a relatively high barriers to entry, most Ukrainian Java developers are middle- or senior-level specialists. \nHowever, this statistic comes with a caveat about Ukrainian Java developers. In Ukraine, middle-level developers usually have 3-5 years of experience in the field, while senior developers get the title after 5 years. This might seem strange to outsiders, as most other countries, including the USA, require at least 5 years experience to qualify as a middle specialist, and 10+ years to get to senior level. \nHowever, what you should take into account is not the number of years in the field, but the actual practical experience and skills your developer has. If a specialist has been involved in a very complex project, progress may be a lot quicker, meaning that they can achieve a the senior level in just under 5 years. Background \nThe Ukrainian IT industry is still emergent, which is why many experienced Java developers have a background working in other domains. If a developer has switched to software engineering from a different sphere, the chances are that their background was in finance, banking, or enterprise. \nAs most financial institutions run on Java, a great number of today\u2019s Java programmers started their career as IT specialists (support/devops engineers, database administrators) at a bank. However, the Ukrainian banking industry cannot offer the competitive salaries found in the IT sphere, which makes the career switch a reasonable option for most Java developers. \nAnother common area of usage for Java is in enterprise-level products. Therefore, many Java developers have experience working with big data management and ERP systems before they begin accumulating direct experience. \nAlthough the Ukrainian IT industry is growing at a rapid pace, the amount of product companies and startups in the region is still rather low, especially compared to the large number of outsourcing companies. This means that most Ukrainian Java software engineers are currently involved in Java software outsourcing companies, where they often deal with projects in the fintech and cyber security spheres. How to hire Java developers in Ukraine? A recruiter\u2019s perspective \nWith the demand for skilled Java programmers at an all time high, hiring the best candidates can be a challenging task. Even with a help of your own professional recruitment team, you need to put serious effort into the evaluation and interview process . \nTo navigate the possible pitfalls of the IT recruitment and make a successful hire, consider the following tips. Before you interview a candidate: Choose the model that works best for you. \nAsk yourself, do you have enough technical skills and experience managing software development processes on your own, or do need professional assistance in every aspect of the process? \nIn the first case, you can hire software developers directly and manage them by yourself. However, the second situation is ideally suited for projects with Java software outsourcing companies. \nFor short-term projects, e.g. adding a feature or two to an existing project or making simple updates, hiring a freelancer might be a reasonable option. However, if you prefer hiring developers to work on-site but don\u2019t want to limit your candidate pool to the local IT talent only, consider IT relocation . \nTo make sure you make the right choice, consider the pros and cons of each cooperation model or consult with an expert. Get your requirements straight. \nMost job descriptions sound rather generic, providing little valuable information on the project and generalizing candidate requirements. This makes it difficult for candidates to understand the project requirements and see if they can meet your expectations at all. \nMake sure to specify technical requirements, as well as the soft skills/qualities you are looking for. It\u2019s better to prioritize your requirements. For example, good knowledge of the key technologies in your stack is a \u201cmust-have\u201d, while qualities such as experience in your domain, or a degree in a field relevant to your project are usually \u201cnice to have\u201d. Take into account the project specifics as well as your personal preferences (but only well-grounded ones). Help your candidate make an informed decision. \nBefore you select and interview candidates, you should provide them with as much information on your project as possible (taking into account confidentiality, of course). The more you can explain about your project specifics, the higher your chances are of getting the developer interested in your job opportunity. \nBefore you ask candidates to prove themselves worthy of your company, make sure to understand what you can offer them in return. Is it a unique tech stack they will be able to get experience in, or an innovative product they have a chance to contribute to? Do you offer a particularly competitive salary, or some other benefits? Evaluating the candidates: Read between the lines. \nCVs are a great way to pre-evaluate your candidates. It gives you an understanding of the technologies the candidate is skilled in, while providing a general overview of their experience. However, not all information can be included into a CV. For example, some of the candidate\u2019s projects can be protected by NDAs, while pet projects, personal experiments, or something that is not directly related to the developer\u2019s job might not be included at all. \nMoreover, you shouldn\u2019t reject the candidate only because you think 2 years of experience isn\u2019t enough for your project. Some developers can gain vast hands-on experience in various technologies and domains in just a year, while others can spend 5 years working on a single project with a limited tech stack. Ask for additional information. \nWhile giving a test task prior to the interview might not always be a good idea (remember, a developer\u2019s time comes at a price), you should encourage your candidates to support their CVs with any information or assets they consider suitable. \nFor example, a link to the candidate\u2019s GitHub profile, relevant code samples, list of diplomas or awards, published articles, etc., can be a valuable addition even to a less than perfect CV. At the interview: Establish and follow a solid interview process. \nHaving a consistent and standardized interview process can help you better evaluate the candidates. This is why you always need to prepare for your interviews in advance. \nTo start with, write down a list of the most important questions and topics you want to cover. In addition, you can draft possible answers to those questions to prepare for follow-ups. Get into details. \nThe information usually provided in a CV isn\u2019t normally sufficient for making a good hire. You should always ask the candidate to tell you more about the projects they have been working on recently. \nMoreover, this allows you to verify if the information in the resume is true. Make each interview a dialogue rather than an interrogation. \nInstead of simply asking questions, prepare to answer some too. If a candidate doesn\u2019t have any questions about the project or your company, the chances are that they simply aren\u2019t that interested in working for you. \nIf you don\u2019t agree with some of the points your candidates make, ask them to explain their views and voice your own opinions on the matter. Remember, the truth can spark when opposing ideas collide. \nOne more tip from us: If you like the candidate, don\u2019t think too long before making an offer. Most skilled Ukrainian developers often interview for 3-4 jobs at a time - make the call before your competitors do.

Accelerating India\u2019s Clean Energy Transition , published recently at the BNEF Future of Energy Summit in Shanghai, examines the trends in India\u2019s rooftop solar, rural mini-grid, off-grid and utility-scale renewable energy segments. India\u2019s government has set its sights on having 175GW of non-hydro renewables capacity by 2022 (made up of 60GW onshore wind, 60GW utility-scale solar, 10GW bioenergy, 5GW small hydro and 40GW rooftop solar). At present, this figure stands at just 60GW. \nIndia is accelerating development of renewable energy projects to provide cheap, reliable and clean power to its 1.3 billion people. The country\u2019s per-capita on-grid electricity consumption increased by 22% over the four years ending March 2017 due to increased industrial activity, higher uptake of electrical appliances by residential electricity users and the addition of new consumers to the grid. \nThe majority of the capacity in the 2022 target \u2013 a total of 135GW \u2013 is utility-scale (wind farms and solar parks, in particular) and does not include large hydro projects. The report estimates that India will need to invest $83 billion to build this capacity. The good news is that, because of falling capital costs per MW, that figure is $19 billion less than in BNEF\u2019s previous estimates. New renewable energy projects will exceed fossil fuel build-out for the first time in 2017, and in the years thereafter. \nBut some of the most interesting activity will be in small-scale solar. Shantanu Jaiswal, head of India research at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said: \u201cRooftop solar in India will grow inevitably with or without the support of power distribution utilities.\u201d \nThe cost of electricity from rooftop PV has halved in the last five years due to fierce competition in the market and a drop in equipment prices. In contrast, average retail electricity rates have increased by 22% in the same period. This has made rooftop PV cheaper than commercial and industrial grid tariffs in all major states in India. \nBloomberg New Energy Finance expects residential sector PV growth to pick up rapidly post-2021. At the moment, its attractiveness is being held back by the high upfront capital expenditure that is necessary, by a shortage of financing options, and the fact that grid electricity is cheaper for residential consumers with low consumption. \n\u201cNet metering is a far more important enabler for residential small-scale solar than for business-scale projects,\u201d said Itamar Orlandi, head of frontier markets at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \nHomeowners are usually drawing less power during the hours when their PV panels are producing, making self-consumption much harder. Solar projects also have a big and untapped potential to power irrigation pumps and reduce the use of back-up diesel generators. \nAshish Sethia, head of Asia-Pacific research at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said: \u201cGrowth of rooftop solar presents an opportunity for the distribution companies to diversify and start their own businesses in that area rather than lose customers to other rooftop developers.\u201d \nPower distribution companies can also work with other rooftop PV companies to provide operations and maintenance services, billing, lead generation, branding and sales support, Sethia added. \nAnnual rooftop PV installations in India \nSource: Bloomberg New Energy Finance, industry surveys, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. Note: India\u2019s financial year is from April to March. \nIndia is expected to install more renewable energy than fossil fuel power generation in 2017. Commissioned renewables projects amounted to 10GW through September, compared with 8GW for coal and gas \nEfforts aimed at rural electrification have led to a significant increase in access to electricity over the last three years. However, quality and reliability of electric supply by distribution companies in rural areas remains poor. Despite that, off-grid companies have not been able to match the rapid growth of utility-scale renewables and rooftop solar systems. \nIndia has a target of installing 10,000 rural micro-grids with a cumulative capacity of 500MW by 2021. The risk of stranded commissioned assets as a result of grid extension is the biggest concern for investors. That is impeding rapid build-out of small rural grids. Five states in India have released micro-grid policies and regulations in the last two years to promote investment and installations in this sector. \nOff-grid power consumers who use solar lanterns and home systems are now moving to larger devices, leading to up-sell and cross-sell of various small solar products in areas poorly serviced by grid electricity. Micro-grid companies are also encouraging the use of productive load equipment like rice hullers, air coolers and refrigerators in their areas, helping to boost the rural economy. \nBloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) is an industry research firm focused on helping energy professionals generate opportunities.

It was at this time that my passion for the Sterkfontein Caves and the Cradle began. To be in my role 20 years later and witness the culmination of decades of incredibly intricate work by Prof. Ron Clarke and his team is a source of great pride. \n\u201cMy team, the guides and I look forward to sharing all the new information on this incredible find with the public who visit the Sterkfontein Caves.\u201d #LittleFoot #EWN [VIDEO]The Big Reveal.

They do not publish it publicly anymore if it has been updated, but here is the last one from 2005 as example: https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ssprfs05.pdf I think you might have misread the 4473 instructions. There is an \"or\" in front of \"the person has had their civil rights (the right to vote, sit on a jury, and hold public office) taken away and later restored\" , meaning that it is merely one of the three listed remedies, any of which by itself will satisfy part (1) of the exemption. In the OP's case, the lawful \"expungement\" will fully satisfy part (1) as it would appear from a literal reading of the 4473 instructions.\nAs far as part (2), you're right. 1203.4 doesn't satisfy state's prohibition.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ssprfs05.pdf"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:15:31.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f10942391159d06f406b9c1600ea59795594b2ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU46o__BwFz6P4DKyydaaQK7r.yR.DrdzF_Dho58qe7eZvHQX9xbTMHKCnGDN_oPWVb.LujSevXo0mF5H1ORlM2Ac", "site_full": "lonestarcats.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://lonestarcats.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Lone Star Cats", "title": "Wordless Wednesday", "title_full": "Wordless Wednesday", "published": "2017-12-07T02:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6f16b0735063e1c55e2450023145431b04facd25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU46o__BwFz6P4DKyydaaQK7r.yR.DrdzF_Dho58qe7eZvHQX9xbTMHKCnGDN_oPWVb.LujSevXo0mI8IFHzNzHjx", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Lone Star Cats", "published": "2017-12-07T10:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Dey really wuz going curly crazy.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:15:31.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cf78ac85cca89f5ca24c33ee79d055fff0f26d48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_u2tlfIi70ZlEUizW5FtPWr2IB_zVHBGCCIqlT8whTJPhC9JvpPqtC90ks4c5hOYIXndNzoqxa5Q--", "site_full": "www.calguns.net", "site": "calguns.net", "site_section": "http://www.calguns.net/calgunforum/forumdisplay.php?f=349", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "How CA Laws Apply to/Affect Me - Calguns.net", "title": "Ex-felon purchasing a firearm- Expunged and Reduced to Misd.", "title_full": "Ex-felon purchasing a firearm- Expunged and Reduced to Misd. - Calguns.net", "published": "2017-12-07T03:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.163, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 16038, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8f816a773f1cf269811c004375b4349ab4a10472", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_u2tlfIi70ZlEUizW5FtPWr2IB_zVHBGCCIqlT8whTJPhC9JvpPqtC90ks4c5hOYKfy4ZnFOKhpIZ08mFkk2gOTOpslnaCiyo-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "hunterb", "published": "2017-12-07T03:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Non-violent felony?
