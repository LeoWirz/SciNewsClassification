This Airtel N1500 for 6GB data plan can be activated on Android phones, tablets, iOS etc. Actually this plan is called Airtel BB 1+1 Unlimited plan which is a blackberry plan but now works on android phones once you follow below steps accordingly. Though airtel called it special privilege plan signaling that not every customer is eligible for the offer but I have discovered that many airtel line are eligible for it and can subscribe to it. Incase you are not eligible, I will provide a Blackberry IMEI that will help you use it smoothly. Without wasting much time, let's go down to business. ELIGIBILITY As i said earlier, this plan is not for ALL airtel subscribers. You will receive a message like from Airtel stated like the one below. SPECIAL PRIVILEGE!! ENJOY 6GB WORTH OF DATA FOR JUST N1500. DIAL *440*161#. FOR 30 DAYS, USABLE ON ALL DEVICE. If you didn't receive such message, you can also checkout if you are eligible for the Airtel 6GB for N1500 plan by dialing *440*16# on your airtel sim. HOW TO ACTIVATE AIRTEL 6GB FOR N1500 DATA PLAN \u2714 Recharge at least 1,500 Naira on your SIM\u2714 Then dial *440*161# \u2714You will receive messages similar to the one below YOUR AIRTEL BB 1+1 UNLIMITED PLAN IS ACTIVE. RE-INSERT YOUR BATTERY.THIS PLAN IS FOR BB DEVICES ONLY. EXPERIENCE AND CHARGING MAY DIFFER IN CASE OF OTHER DEVICES Once you receive this message, congrats! You have successfully activated the plan and you can use it for 30 months but the service spreads till 6 months. Meaning, you will continue being eligible for six months. Isn\u2019t that great? IMPORTANT NOTE If after successfully subscription and you couldn\u2019t still browse with it, then tweak this Blackberry IMEI: 862572030086235.

So, a while ago I told you guys about this family and how much I admired their bravery, as they were going all in on bitcoin near all time high (that is considered a very low entry now). They are now laughing all the way to the bank, with a bunch of BTC to invest on other crypta, while you bunch of virgin damage control NEETs are very sad and suicidal pink wojaks. HOW DOES IT FEEL, knowing that Mr. \"all in\" Chad always wins in the end. They get in, take their profits, and leave you BETA MALES nothing but a shadow of your former selves, as you watch them ride into the sunset on their brand new harley davidson motorcycle with \"Stacy\" on the back.\n>I-it can't keep g-oing up\nThat feeling right there is why you will NEVER be as successful as the Chads. THEY lead, YOU whine and follow (but it's always too late). Weak emotional control is the major trait of the NEETs. Too afraid to take the big risks, they follow the herd and bet against the king Bitcoin (virgin losers buying CHAINLINK) and then get fucking destroyed. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH GET REKT LOSERS. You're too pathetic to succeed. You should follow this guy's family example, but you're too pathetic to take the chance of your lifetime. Get ready to live in a digital prison, in the future, watching ads for 0.1 satoshi/day, while Chads like this guy live on floating laputas. BAAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHA *inhales deebly* HAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHA HA This is too priceless. Bitcoin WILL be worth 100k in 3 months, but you're all to weak to take the risk and make 10x...again. Meanwhile, more and more Chads come in and go balls deep in it. Even normies are now following Chad and taking their piece of the cake, but the virgin NEETs who knew about it before everyone else are taking losses holding CHAIN-FUCKING-LINK...

What do you want to do?\" he said, addressing the US leader directly in one of Erdogan's most familiar rhetorical habits. \n\"What kind of approach is this? Political leaders do not stir things up, they seek to make peace!\" he added. \nThere were chants of \"damn Israel!\" and boos from Erdogan supporters gathered at the airport when the president first mentioned the US move. \nIn a speech on Wednesday, Trump overturned decades of US policy with a decision to recognise the disputed city. He also kicked off the process of moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \nErdogan accused Trump of trying to be an agitator and said the decision \"completely disregarded\" the 1980 UN resolution on the contested city's status. \nTurkey will hold a leaders' summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on Wednesday in Istanbul to discuss Trump's decision. \nTurkey currently holds the chairmanship of the OIC. \nErdogan said work continued for other events planned for after this summit but he did not give further detail. \nAround 1,500 people gathered outside the US consulate in Istanbul on Wednesday night to protest against Trump, chanting slogans such as \"down with America!\". \nErdogan said he was due to speak with Pope Francis on Thursday evening or on Friday, as well as with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Western allies including Germany. \n\"This is now not just the duty of Muslims, but also of humanity\" to oppose the move, Erdogan added. \nHe hit back at Trump saying that being strong did not mean that you were automatically right but that \"the righteous are the strong\". \nRelations between Washington and Ankara have already been strained over the Syrian conflict as well as the US failure to extradite a Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric blamed for last year's attempted overthrow of Erdogan. \u00a9 2017 AFP", "highlightText":

Previous Weeks: Week 1 , Week 2 , Week 3 (No Ranking - Hurricane Irma), Week 4 , Week 5 , Week 6 , Week 7 , Week 8 , Week 9 , Week 10 , Week 11 , Week 12 , Week 13 , Week 14 Clemson waxed Miami in the ACC Championship, setting themselves up to defend their national title. Elsewhere, 10 ACC schools are going bowling, and it seems as if the entire conference is keeping their head coaches in place going into next year. ACC Power Rankings 1. Clemson Tigers (12-1, 8-1 ACC) (Last Week: 1) Last week: vs. #7 Miami Hurricanes (10-2) - W 38-3 Bowl Game: vs. #4 Alabama Crimson Tide (11-1) Clemson left no doubt about who the best team in the ACC was, demolishing Miami and sliding into the College Football Playoffs. The third straight playoff game between the Tigers and Crimson Tide should be another classic. 2. Miami Hurricanes (10-2, 7-2 ACC) (Last Week: 2) Last week: vs. #1 Clemson Tigers (12-1) - L 3-38 Bowl Game: vs. #6 Wisconsin Badgers (12-1) It\u2019s hard to say after such a devastating loss, but Miami exceeded expectations this year and Mark Richt has this program right on track. A home game for the Orange Bowl versus Wisconsin should be just what the doctor ordered. 3. Virginia Tech Hokies (9-3, 5-3 ACC) (Last Week: 3) Last week: Bye Bowl Game: vs. #19 Oklahoma State Cowboys (9-3) Bud Foster\u2019s defense, with a month to prepare, going up against the spread-em out shoot-em up offense of Mike Gundy? This may be the best non-New Years Six Bowl out there. 4. N.C. State Wolfpack (8-4, 6-2 ACC) (Last Week: 4) Last Week: Bye Bowl Game: vs. Arizona State Sun Devils (7-5) N.C. State head coach Dave Doeren stayed in Raleigh after flirting with Tennessee, while ASU coach Todd Graham is also sticking around to coach this game despite being fired and replaced by Herm Edwards, who will take over the team after the bowl. Herm. Edwards. Man, that\u2019s got to sting for Graham, but hey, it can\u2019t be all bad knowing you escaped an incompetently run organization. What I really want to see is if Bradley Chubb spits on any logos in this game, causing Edwards to go on a rant about it post-game. Photo by Grant Halverson/Getty Images 5. Boston College Eagles (7-5, 4-4 ACC) (Last Week: 5) Last week: Bye Bowl Game: vs. Iowa Hawkeyes (7-5) The New Era Pinstripe Bowl is a fitting place to end up for these Eagles, as their offense seems to have finally entered the modern era. Over/under 200 yards for AJ Dillon ? 6. Wake Forest Demon Deacons (7-5, 4-4 ACC) (Last Week: 6) Last week: Bye Bowl Game: vs. Texas A&M Aggies (7-5) Texas A&M may have made the hire of all hires stealing away Jimbo Fisher from FSU, but he won\u2019t take over the team until after the bowl. I think John Wolford and Wake will come out with something to prove to end their surprise season on a high note. 7. Louisville Cardinals (8-4, 4-4 ACC) (Last Week: 7) Last week: Bye Bowl Game: vs. Mississippi State Bulldogs (8-4) Another ACC team going up against an SEC team without a coach: Mississippi State lost their coach to Florida and their QB to injury and now have to face-off against Lamar Jackson in the TaxSlayer Bowl. If it\u2019s truly Jackson\u2019s last game in college, well, thanks for the memories (and the highlights), #8. 8. Florida State Seminoles (6-6, 3-5 ACC) (Last Week: 8) Last week: vs. Louisiana-Monroe Warhawks (4-7) - W 42-10 Bowl Game: vs. Southern Miss Golden Eagles (8-4) Huge win for this team in beating the Warhawks on Saturday, showing the nation the Seminoles aren\u2019t just any ordinary stepping stone program and getting to a bowl game without the departed Jimbo Fisher. Derwin James couldn\u2019t get out of Tallahassee soon enough, though, and will miss the Independence Bowl to prep for the NFL Draft. FSU\u2019s motivation level of playing in Shreveport is sure to be an advantage for Southern Miss. Melina Vastola-USA TODAY Sports 9. Virginia Cavaliers (6-6, 3-5 ACC) (Last Week: 9) Last week: Bye Bowl Game: vs. Navy Midshipmen (6-5) Both Navy and UVA have lost 5 of their past 6 games coming into this game. Sick. This game should be \u201cExhibit A\u201d of why there\u2019s too many bowl games. Stop rewarding mediocrity. 10. Duke Blue Devils (6-6, 3-5 ACC) (Last Week: 10) Last week: Bye Bowl Game: vs. Northern Illinois Huskies (8-4) Duke finished the season nicely, winning their last 2 games after previously losing 4 straight. Duke has enough speed on defense to give NIU\u2019s offense fits, and T.J. Rahming and Brittain Brown will test the formidable NIU defense. 11. Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (5-6, 4-4 ACC) (Last Week: 11) Last week: Bye Bowl Game: None The Yellow Jackets didn\u2019t make a bowl game this season, so, in lieu of that, who\u2019s up for Step Durham vs. Lance Austin Round 3 ?!?! I think this would break some Pay-Per-View records, folks. 12. Pittsburgh Panthers (5-7, 3-5 ACC) (Last Week: 12) Last week: Bye Bowl Game: None The Hurricanes gave Pat Narduzzi an early Christmas present when they stunk it up in the final regular season game against Pitt, leading the school to sign Narduzzi to a 7 year contract that I\u2019m sure will definitely hold up if he goes under .500 again next year. Seriously, how can I become an AD? 13. Syracuse Orange (4-8, 2-6 ACC) (Last Week: 13) Last week: Bye Bowl Game: None It didn\u2019t quite happen on the field for the Orange this year in terms of wins and losses, but hey, my guys Ervin Philips and Steve Ishmael became the two all-time leading receivers in \u2018Cuse football history. That\u2019s gotta count for something, right? 14. North Carolina Tar Heels (3-9, 1-7 ACC) (Last Week: 14) Last week: Bye Bowl Game: None Is Nathan Elliott the future at QB for the Tar Heels? Larry Fedora better hope he is, otherwise he\u2019s going to find himself on a toasty bench come next fall.

The tutelary figure of French rock gives the French a legacy of more than a thousand titles. The Elabe Institute asked BFMTV for a representative panel of the population to answer this question: What are your favorite Johnny Hallyday songs?\n\nRespondents were asked to choose up to three songs from a list of twenty of his biggest hits. The ten most popular songs are:\n\nI promise you, acclaimed by 27% of French\nMarie (23%)\nPenitentiary and I love you, tied at 22%\nLaura, cited by 19% of people, just like Letting Fire\nPick up at night and Something from Tennessee (18%)\nRequiem for a madman (17%)\nThe Envy (14%)\n\nAlternative rankings by gender and age \n\nDifferent rankings are obtained according to the categories of respondents. Thus, women listen preferably I promise you, for 32% of the answers, Marie, for 26%, The penitentiary, for 23%. But, if the men do not decide I promise you, That I love you and The Penitentiary, with 21% of the votes, they install in the first place of their pantheon To light the fire, which does not recipe at the ladies.\n\nAge is also the case. People aged 65 and over placed the following quint\u00e9: Retains at night, with 36% of the answers, That I love you, 31%, The Penitentiary, with 30%, I forgot to live, quoted this time in 21% of the answers, and finally Marie, located at 20%.\n\n18-24 year olds have other preferences: Lighting a fire is a very strong first with 53% of the votes. That I love you and Marie are cited in, respectively, 29% and 24% of the votes. I promise you is the fourth piece most commonly cited, at 22%. Then we find the menacing and painful Ma Gueule tied with the most melancholy Something of Tennessee, with a score of 18%.\n\nSample of 1,001 people representative of the French population aged 18 and over.

I would like to start by thanking the man above, and everyone who has been involved in this process with me. Im glad to say that I\u2019ve finally made my decision!! @Left__Field__ pic.twitter.com/PMnpFSEifO \u2014 J D U B (@Jarren2Williams) December 6, 2017 \u201cI\u2019m Jarren Williams; and I\u2019m a Hurricane\u201d After having a mutual parting of ways with their former QB commit this cycle \u2014 4-star Artur Sitkowski who is physically talented but VERY raw, to say the least \u2014 Miami needed to hit a homerun with the player they got to replace him in this class, and they did. The 6\u20192\u201d 206lb Lawrenceville, GA native Williams is the kind of player that Miami wants, and needs, to have at QB. He\u2019s got good arm strength, nice accuracy, and good enough athleticism to make plays when the pocket breaks down. Williams is widely regarded as a 4-star talent who could develop into a top-end player at a key position in the future. Unlike the previous QB commit, Williams put his considerable talent and skills to good use on the field. As a junior in 2016, Williams threw for 2,618 yards with 26 TDs and 4 INTs on 59.9% completions to go along with 396 yards and 4TDs rushing. Williams improved all those stats as a senior, throwing for 3,015 yards and 28 TDs and 4 INTs while running for 504 yards and 10 TDs. Williams\u2019 road to Miami was a winding one. Initially, Williams was recruited by and committed to Kentucky. The Wildcats were the first major team to pursue Williams when he was a 3-star rated player as a HS sophomore, and that early connection was enough for him commit to the SEC team (twice, even, as he decommitted from Kentucky over the summer of 2017 before re-upping on his pledge). A finalist at the Elite11 QB camp last summer, Williams participated at Nike\u2019s The Opening in July, playing the 7-on-7 portion of that event with Miami commits RBs Lorenzo Lingard and Camron Davis, WRs Mark Pope and Brian Hightower, TEs Brevin Jordan and Will Mallory, OL Delone Scaife, DT Nesta Silvera and DBs Al Blades Jr. and Josh Jobe (yeah, The Opening was PACKED with Miami commits) on Team Savage Pro. Through the summer and early fall, based on his elite level play at camps and in games, Williams saw his recruiting profile continue to rise. His ranking rose, people started writing about him, and immediately things became tenuous, at best, for Kentucky to hold on to their prized commitment. Shortly after Sitkowski and Miami parted ways, Miami was able to get Williams to come to Coral Gables for an official visit...during Notre Dame week. The Canes rolled out the red carpet for the Georgia native, including a tour of campus, a stop by ESPN\u2019s College GameDay which was broadcast from the UC patio overlooking the lake on Miami\u2019s Coral Gables campus, and much more. Add in a 41-8 demolition of Notre Dame at Hard Rock Stadium that night, and that was pretty much a perfect visit weekend. Williams enjoyed the visit to the point that he took \u201cKentucky commit\u201d out of his twitter bio DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE GAME, and officially decommitted from the Wildcats on Sunday even after returning home to Georgia. Miami was not the only team pursuing Williams. The talented signal-caller took an official visit to Ohio State the week after he visited Miami, and was scheduled to visit Auburn for their annual Iron Bowl game against Alabama, but canceled that visit. While he did not receive the national attention of other Georgia-based QBs in this cycle (players like 5-stars Trevor Lawrence and Justin Fields immediately come to mind), Williams is every bit the top tier recruit that he\u2019s billed to be. Williams committed to Miami over 27 other offers, most notably Auburn and Ohio State, his other finalists. Now, Williams is the 21st commit in Miami\u2019s 2018 recruiting class, and likely the only QB to be signed by the Canes this year. He joins a QB room with Malik Rosier , Evan Shirreffs , N\u2019Kosi Perry and Cade Weldon at Miami. Williams will enroll at Miami in January, and hope to integrate himself into the Canes\u2019 program and push for playing time in 2018.

Wonder how many of the NFL protesters could find Iwo Jima on a map?\nEach year I am hired to go to Washington , DC , with the eighth grade class from Clinton , WI where I grew up, to videotape their trip. I greatly enjoy visiting our nation's capitol, and each year I take some special memories back with me. This Fall's trip was especially\nmemorable.\nOn the last night of our trip, we stopped at the Iwo Jima\nMemorial. This Memorial is the largest bronze statue in the world, and depicts one of the most famous photographs in history -- that of the six brave soldiers raising the American Flag at the top of a rocky hill on the island of Iwo Jima, Japan, during WW II\nOver one hundred students and chaperones piled off the buses and headed towards the memorial. I noticed a solitary figure at the base of the statue, and as I got closer he asked, 'Where are you guys from?'\nI told him that we were from Wisconsin . 'Hey, I'm a cheese head, too! Come gather around, Cheese heads, and I will tell you a story.'\n(It was James Bradley, who just happened to be in Washington , DC , to speak at the memorial the following day. He was there that night to say good night to his dad, who had passed away. He was just about to leave\nwhen he saw the buses pull up. I videotaped him as he spoke to us, and received his permission to share what he said from my videotape. It is one thing to tour the incredible monuments filled with history in Washington, DC, but it is quite another to get the kind of insight we received that night.)\nWhen all had gathered around, he reverently began to speak. (Here are his words that night.)\n'My name is James Bradley and I'm from Antigo, Wisconsin. My dad is on that statue, and I wrote a book called 'Flags of Our Fathers'. It is the story of the six boys you see behind me.\n'Six boys raised the flag. The first guy putting the pole in the ground is Harlon Block. Harlon was an all-state football player. He enlisted in the Marine Corps with all the senior members of his football team. They were off to play another type of game. A game called 'War.' But it didn't turn out to be a game. Harlon, at the age of 21, died with his intestines in his hands. I don't say that to gross you out, I say that because there are people who stand in front of this statue and talk about the glory of war. You guys need to know that most of the boys in Iwo Jima were 17, 18, and 19 years old - and it was so hard that the ones who did make it home, never even would talk to their families about it.\n(He pointed to the statue) 'You see this next guy? That's Rene Gagnon from New Hampshire\nIf you took Rene's helmet off at the moment this photo was taken, and looked in the webbing of that helmet, you would find a photograph...a photograph of his girlfriend. Rene put that in there for protection, because he was scared. He was 18 years old. It was just boys who won the battle of Iwo Jima . Boys. Not old men.\n'The next guy here, the third guy in this tableau, was Sergeant Mike Strank. Mike is my hero. He was the hero of all these guys.They called him the 'old man', because he was so old. He was already 24. When Mike would motivate his boys in training camp, he didn't say, 'Let's go kill some Japanese' or 'Let's die for our country'. He knew he was talking to little boys. Instead, he would say, 'You do what I say, and I'll get you home to your mothers.'\n'The last guy on this side of the statue is Ira Hayes, a Pima Indian from Arizona . Ira Hayes was one of those who lived to walk off Iwo Jima . He went into the White House with my dad. President Truman told him, 'You're a hero' He told reporters, 'How can I feel like a hero when 250 of my buddies hit the island with me, and only 27 of us walked off alive?'\nSo you take your class at school, 250 of you, spending a year together having fun, doing everything together. Then all 250 of you hit the beach, but only 27 of your classmates walk off alive. That was Ira Hayes. He had images of horror in his mind. Ira Hayes carried the pain home with him and eventually died dead drunk, face down, drowned in a\nvery shallow puddle, at the age of 32 (ten years after this picture was taken).\n'The next guy, going around the statue, is Franklin Sousley from Hilltop, Kentucky . A fun-lovin' hillbilly boy. His best friend, who is now 70, told me, 'Yeah, you know, we took two cows up on the porch of the Hilltop General Store. Then we strung wire across the stairs so the cows couldn't get down. Then we fed them Epsom salts. Those cows crapped all night.' Yes, he was a fun-lovin' hillbilly boy. Franklin died on Iwo Jima at the age of 19. When the telegram came to tell his mother that he was dead, it went to the Hilltop General Store. A barefoot boy ran that telegram up to his mother's farm. The neighbors could hear her scream all night and into the morning. Those neighbors lived a quarter of a mile away.\n'The next guy, as we continue to go around the statue, is my dad, John Bradley, from Antigo, Wisconsin, where I was raised. My dad lived until 1994, but he would never give interviews.\nWhen Walter Cronkite's producers or the New York Times would call, we were trained as little kids to say 'No, I'm sorry, sir, my dad's not here. He is in Canada fishing. No, there is no phone there, sir. No, we don't know when he is coming back.' My dad never fished, or even went to Canada. Usually, he was sitting there right at the table eating his Campbell soup. But we had to tell the press that he was out fishing. He didn't want to talk to the press.\n'You see, like Ira Hayes, my dad didn't see himself as a hero. Everyone thinks these guys are heroes, 'cause they are in a photo and on a monument. My dad knew better. He was a medic. John Bradley from Wisconsin was a combat caregiver. On Iwo Jima he probably held over 200 boys as they died. Boys died on Iwo Jima, they writhed and screamed, without any medication or help with the pain.\n'When I was a little boy, my third grade teacher told me that my dad was a hero. When I went home and told my dad what my teacher said, he looked at me and said, 'I want you always to remember that the heroes of Iwo Jima are the guys who did not come back. Did NOT come back.'\n'So that's the story about six nice young boys. Three died on Iwo Jima, and three came back as national heroes. Overall, 7,000\nboys died on Iwo Jima in the worst battle in the history of the Marine Corps. My voice is giving out, so I will end here. Thank you for your time.'\nSuddenly, the monument wasn't just a big old piece of metal with a flag sticking out of the top. It came to life before our eyes, with the heartfelt words of a son who did indeed have a father who was a hero. Maybe not a hero for the reasons most people would believe, but a hero nonetheless.\nOne thing I learned while on tour with my 8th grade students in DC that is not mentioned here is . . that if you look at the statue very closely, and count the number of 'hands' raising the flag, there are 13.

John Wells, 94, died Feb. 11 at the Arvada Care Rehabilitation Center in Arvada, Colorado.\nWells received the Navy Cross, Bronze Star and Purple Heart after leading his Marines in a frontal assault up the slopes of Mount Suribachi during the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II.\nHe didn't make it to the top after taking multiple enemy rounds, but continued to command, leading his men to victory. His platoon raised the first flag atop the mountain, hours before the iconic photo of the second flag raising was captured.\n\"He was a very warm, sensitive, spiritual man, all the way to age 94,\" Connie Schultz, Well's daughter, told ABC affiliate Denver 7. \"He honored and loved the Marine Corps with all his heart and soul. He loved his family, and his last words were, 'My family.' \"\nWells, as leader of the 3rd Platoon, E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, successfully conducted the Feb. 21, 1945, assault over open terrain against a well-entrenched and stalwart defender.\nThe engagement gained his platoon the distinction as the most decorated platoon to fight in a single engagement in the history of the Marine Corps.\nWith \"courageous leadership and indomitable fighting spirit,\" Wells led demolition teams from one enemy bunker to the other, knocking out at least 25 emplacements in the process, according to his Navy Cross citation.\nThe Navy Cross Award Citation.\nQuote: : John Keith Wells\nDate of death: February 11, 2016\nPlace of Birth: Texas, Lakeview\nHome of record: Lakeview Texas\nAWARDS AND CITATIONS\nNavy Cross\nSee more recipients of this award\nAwarded for actions during the World War II\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to First Lieutenant John Keith Wells (MCSN: 0-21592), United States Marine Corps Reserve, for extraordinary heroism as a Rifle Platoon Leader of Company E, Second Battalion, Twenty-Eighth Marines, FIFTH Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima, Volcano Islands, 21 February 1945. When ordered to attack across open terrain and dislodge the enemy from a series of strongly-defended pillboxes and blockhouses at the base of Mount Suribachi, First Lieutenant Wells placed himself in the forefront of his platoon and, leading his men forward in the face of intense hostile machine-gun, mortar and rifle fire, continuously moved from one flank to the other to lead assault groups one by one in their attacks on Japanese emplacements. Although severely wounded while directing his demolition squad in an assault on a formidable enemy blockhouse whose fire had stopped the advance of his platoon, he continued to lead his men until the blockhouse was destroyed. When, an hour later, the pain from his wound became so intense that he was no longer able to walk, he established his command post in a position from which to observe the progress of his men and continued to control their attack by means of messengers. By his courageous leadership and indomitable fighting spirit, First Lieutenant Wells contributed materially to the destruction of at least twenty-five Japanese emplacements, and his unwavering devotion to duty was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\nGeneral Orders: SPOT AWARD, Fleet Marine Force Pacific: Serial 51256\nAction Date: February 21,

In the few years individuals have taken into consideration the importance of a acquiring a CPR certification that is not only essential for medical technicians but also them considering cardiac arrests are bound to happen anywhere and anytime. One maybe curious on different issues such as the preparation needed before the class, the duration and what will be done before the class and during the CPR classes Greenville sc but to the surprise of many the course is very short and only requires ones dedication focus and commitment.\n\nIn this CPR courses expect the following; a manual which has a step by step process illustrating steps taken in the CPR procedure. These manuals are handed to each and every trainee by the instructor whereby he or she gives a walk-through of the manual in detail discussing each and every section.\n\nAs I had mentioned earlier additional knowledge never hurts therefore getting to add more information on what you already know is very important more so information that might help in future.CPR certification grants an opportunity to work at diverse places such as schools, hospitals and companies.\n\nit is an added advantage as for example during interviews or work selections the managers may consider someone who has taken up the course and has the certificate as he or she may become an important asset in the company during emergencies.\n\nCPR certification comes with a sense of fulfillment. Taking up such a course can enable one to be confident and ready for anything anywhere. Such incidents are bound to happen and if they happen and you administer CPR thus saving a life can render one a golden opportunity of becoming a hero and even exposing one to larger platforms.\n\nPractice and more practice makes perfect therefore after learning about the rescue procedures in the manuals and watching these procedures being performed in the video clips the instructor engages the trainees in practicing what they have learnt. This is essential in order to review how well the trainees have retained the information.It is important and thus considered the most valuable part of the CPR training.\n\nCPR classes in city Greenville usually enhance the awareness of heart related diseases that result into cardiac arrest and heart attacks. Through the training of CPR individuals are able learn about the different heart disorders that result into cardiac arrests therefore, it is important to be conversant with the different disorders that may enable one to be aware and have the necessary measures in case of such an incident.\n\nConclusively, individuals interested in taking up the CPR short courses in Greenville SC should use the opportunity given by the state county of Greenville to ensure that they enroll in these classes to enable them gain experience and be knowledgeable in this sector so as to save lives in the state county. It is important that the people appreciate what has been instituted by the county as instructors or trainers are also provided to take them through the course.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are searching for information about CPR classes Greenville SC residents can come to our web pages online today.

have to be dotted and the T\u2019s still have to be crossed as the details are finalised but the big picture remains the same at Ibrox. \nSix weeks on from the sacking of Pedro Caixinha, the Rangers board have made their move for Derek McInnes as they attempt to bring the process to a long-awaited conclusion. \nMcInnes will know exactly what he is walking in to if he puts pen-to-paper and clinches a return to Rangers in the coming days. \n \nHere, SportTimes looks at the issues the 46-year-old will face when if he assumes control and accepts the mission of bringing success back to Ibrox. \nRead more: Rangers close in on Derek McInnes after Aberdeen boss holds talks over his Pittodrie future \nRELATIONSHIPS \nBoth McInnes and Stewart Milne, the Aberdeen chairman, have previously spoken about the importance of the rapport between them and how it was key to the Dons\u2019 success in recent years. \nThat bond may have been stretched in recent days but McInnes will now look to replicate a similar situation at Ibrox. It is a matter of who that will be with, though. \nMcInnes has never worked under a Director of Football before and could be seen as more of a manager, in the traditional sense, than a Head Coach. \nSo the demarcation lines between he and Mark Allen must be made clearly. Allen has had a key role in the recruitment process in recent weeks and the working relationship that he forms with McInnes will be crucial going forward. \nBoth are ultimately working towards the same goal and with the same targets in mind but they will need to share a philosophy when it comes to player identification, the youth department and the scouting structure. \nRead more: Rangers must back Derek McInnes in the transfer market if he becomes new Ibrox boss, says Kris Boyd\u200b \nAllen will be the first point of contact for McInnes on all football matters, with the former Manchester City academy chief then reporting to Managing Director Stewart Robertson. \nUltimately, every major decision will be run by Dave King and the trust and backing of the chairman will be significant for McInnes. \nKing had differing relationships with Mark Warburton and Caixinha and he will hope to strike up a far more successful alliance with the next man in the dugout. \nSQUAD \nThe group of players that McInnes will inherit is of a greater strength and depth than the one that he leaves behind at Pittodrie. \nBut it is still some way off being capable of challenging at the top of the Premiership and it will need further surgery sooner rather than later. \nGraeme Murty has shown in recent weeks that it is possible to get more out of the players that underperformed and underachieved during Caixinha\u2019s reign and McInnes will hope he can improve the squad individually and collectively. \nEveryone on the books will see the new era as a clean slate and a chance to impress but some have more ground to make up than others and even a change in the dugout won\u2019t be enough to prolong their Ibrox careers. \nRead more: Derek McInnes is the man to transform Rangers' fortunes, says St Johnstone stopper Joe Shaughnessy\u200b \nWith the January transfer window just weeks away, time is of the essence for Rangers and McInnes will hope to quickly establish who he can work with and who will be allowed to leave. \nBUDGETS \nRangers have seen little return for their considerable outlays over the last two years and that must change if they are to close the gap to Celtic on and off the park. \nKing has already stated that funds will be made available to strengthen the squad but only time will tell how much cash McInnes feels is required next month and how much is saved for the summer transfer window. \nThe money at his disposal, both in terms of fees and wages, will increase several fold and McInnes will now be able to shop in a different market than the one he scoured at Aberdeen. \nMcInnes will be well aware of what is needed to get the Gers up to standard and will expect the Light Blues hierarchy to sign the big cheques as and when required. \nRECRUITMENT \nThe Ibrox board can\u2019t be faulted for backing both Warburton and Caixinha with significant funds but the strategy in the market can be questioned. \nIt would be no surprise to see McInnes operate a safety-first approach to the next stage of the rebuild. The likes of Kenny McLean and Louis Moult would certainly improve the Ibrox squad for relatively low outlays. \nRead more: Rangers close in on Derek McInnes after Aberdeen boss holds talks over his Pittodrie future \nThe new scouting structure implemented by Allen will be tasked with uncovering talent at both home and abroad but McInnes has already shown that he is a shrewd operator in the transfer market. \nHe will have the final say on all incomings but he will have to work with Allen to identify the characteristics of what he expects in a player. His knowledge of the club and Scottish football will certainly prove useful here. \nINFRASTRUCTURE \nMuch of this will come under Allen\u2019s remit and the appointment of Andy Scoulding as Head of Scouting was an important step for the Welshman. \nNine-in-a-row hero John Brown will scout the domestic market, while Dave Swanick will scour Europe for players and Billy McLaren will search for youngsters to bring into the Auchenhowie Academy. \nRangers have invested in the youth system in recent years and Craig Mulholland is likely to be left to continue with his blueprint for the future. It remains to be seen if Under-20s boss Murty will have a role at first team level, though. \nRead more: Rangers must back Derek McInnes in the transfer market if he becomes new Ibrox boss, says Kris Boyd\u200b \nMcInnes will inherit a significant backroom team and behind the scenes staff but will have the resources to bring his own people on board if required. \nRESULTS \nThe appointment of McInnes hasn\u2019t been universally popular with supporters but the former Light Blues midfielder will get the backing of the Ibrox crowd from the off. \nThe win for Murty\u2019s side at Pittodrie on Sunday was the first of seven fixtures the Gers will play this month and McInnes will have to hit the ground running if he is to pull away from the Dons. \nRangers won\u2019t be expected to challenge Celtic for the title but the Old Firm clash in a couple of weeks gives McInnes a chance to get a big game win under his belt early on. \nAMBITIONS \nThe goals for the remainder of the campaign are twofold for Rangers. The first objective is to finish best of the rest in the Premiership and the other is to mount a serious challenge for the Scottish Cup. \nNeither should be beyond the Gers in the coming months and ending the season with a bit of momentum will be crucial to allow McInnes to gear up for the Europa League qualifiers and his first full crack at the top flight.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st johnstone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graeme murty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billy mclaren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derek mcinnes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcinnes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warburton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stewart robertson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kris boyd\u200b  mcinnes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caixinha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louis moult", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe shaughnessy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig mulholland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenny mclean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kris boyd\u200b  allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedro caixinha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave swanick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy scoulding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stewart milne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark warburton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "light blues", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester city academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auchenhowie academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europa league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rangers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittodrie", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ibrox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittodrie", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:43.044+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f3aa0b88be851be172b1ae23bbbcea0497a3c73", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTc5xlTNwxDfqjFFWxo9n56fE0dF332wSMWWRefsxjYGr7c8VCzhXkpXT.YoKnoRDXZykg.L4fywnMcqAaTKu_kQjYZWQHWSDwSeffeX9iUS4_LkQOwbqtEBBqYFC1cRWfD", "site_full": "www.heraldscotland.com", "site": "heraldscotland.com", "site_section": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/rss/", "site_categories": ["media", "climbing", "sports"], "section_title": "HeraldScotland | Sport", "title": "Rangers: Seven key areas for the next Ibrox boss to address", "title_full": "Rangers: Seven key areas for the next Ibrox boss to address | HeraldScotland", "published": "2017-12-07T00:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7150044/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31684, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6ca0f99461391d8ca21c2cdc2da5d0607dfb9e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTc5xlTNwxDfqjFFWxo9n56fE0dF332wSMWWRefsxjYGr7c8VCzhXkpXT.YoKnoRDXZykg.L4fywnMcqAaTKu_kQjYZWQHWSDwSeffeX9iUS4_LkQOwbqtEBFo2a3TpoIu3NYKNfCWm4zA-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "colin russell", "published": "2017-12-07T16:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Sevco?

Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told the House. \n\"Every Australian had their say and they said it is fair, get on with it!\" \nThe historic reforms will commence on Saturday, when same-sex couples can a lodge a notice to marry. They will then have to wait a month before tying the knot. \nLabor opposition leader Bill Shorten hailed the passing of the bill as a uniting moment for Australia, adding: \"Now is the time for healing\". \n\"A time to build, a time to love, and is now at last a time for marriage equality,\" he said. \nSame-sex marriage campaigners converged outside parliament in the nation's capital Canberra to celebrate the historic occasion, which sees Australia join more than 20 other countries in recognising such unions. \nThe bill was tabled in parliament by the conservative government after Australians last month endorsed the reforms in a controversial voluntary postal vote. \nNearly 80 percent of eligible voters took part in the poll, and almost 62 percent of the 12.7 million people who participated chose \"yes\" on their postal ballots. \nThe ballot had been called by Turnbull, a moderate who backed gay marriage, in the face of opposition from hardliners who refused to back a national plebiscite on the issue. \nIt was opposed by proponents of same-sex marriage, who wanted direct legislative action and argued a poll would expose gay people and their families to hate speech. \nJust under five million people voted \"no\", with conservative politicians using their rejection of gay marriage as a catalyst to push for religious exemptions to be included in the bill. \nBut after lengthy debate, both houses of parliament knocked back amendments to the bill, including from former prime minister and staunch \"no\" campaigner Tony Abbott, on religious freedom. \u00a9 2017 AFP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill shorten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:43.166+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "89a4497606c2cfdb49a7e136ee44915e1144f7f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU47CRM_t5YaLQrJxgpONTnuLl_wm_Jfihr4LymK61bLNlzEqzXQXmLnllTsEeRNsoxThwNEk6jNMILMDzfJaNdffuZei7w_hvRyzCCk24wFeYROLByA0QtX1", "site_full": "livealbumreview.com", "site": "livealbumreview.com", "site_section": "http://livealbumreview.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Live Album Review", "title": "Rolling Stones Live Auctions Happening Right Now", "title_full": "Rolling Stones Live Auctions Happening Right Now", "published": "2017-12-07T11:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "89a4497606c2cfdb49a7e136ee44915e1144f7f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU47CRM_t5YaLQrJxgpONTnuLl_wm_Jfihr4LymK61bLNlzEqzXQXmLnllTsEeRNsoxThwNEk6jNMILMDzfJaNdffuZei7w_hvRyzCCk24wFeYROLByA0QtX1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2017-12-07T11:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "Rolling Stones Live Auctions Happening Right Now", "text": "  Best Live Albums / Rolling Stones Live Auctions Happening Right Now Rolling Stones Live Auctions Happening Right Now   \nYou can catch rare music finds, original recordings, home video, memorabilia, autograph and other collectible memorabilia from your favorite artist or band right now on Ebay: \nRemember you have peace of mind with Ebay: You can use PayPal to make secure payments, all purchases are covered by Buyer Protection, which covers you if you do not receive your item, and each seller has reviews so you can buy with confidence.

We got lucky.\u201d \nTwo other new species were also discovered: an iridescent fly that lives among coastal plants, as well as a species of tardigrade. \nThe survey also discovered various species that had never been known to exist in Penang, including bird, bat, orchid, algae, frog, fly, mammal, ant, mosquito, and spider species. \nMeg Lowman, who led the expedition, said Penang\u2019s forests were \u201cbursting with undocumented diversity\u201d, especially in the treetops which she said no one had surveyed before. \nThe expedition was sponsored by The Habitat Foundation. \nChief Minister Lim Guan Eng emphasised the importance of the rainforest after the conclusion of the survey. \n\u201cAll of us have a common future in our forests.

The Kapoor Haveli, situated in the Dhaki Nalbandi area in the interiors of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, was built by Kapoor's grandfather Dewan Basheswarnath Singh Kapoor in the early 20th century, who lived in the city.\nBhansali speaks fondly of late Shashi Kapoor\nCultural Heritage Council (CHC) Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa paid tributes to the Hindi cinema star, who passed away on December 4 at the age of 79. The meet was attended by several people from different walks of life, including cinema lovers. Speaking on the occasion, CHC secretary Shakeel Waheedullah said the veteran actor always remembered Peshawar as the home of his ancestors. It was the love for his roots that prompted Kapoor to visit the city back in 2000.\nShakeel added, \"Peshawarites have great love and respect for the Kapoor family and Bollywood actors belonging to the ancient city.\" Besides the Kapoor family, actors Dilip Kumar, Shah Rukh Khan, Vinod Khanna, Amjad Khan and Anil Kapoor have roots in Peshawar. Historian Mohammad Ibrahim Zia, who has penned 'Peshawar Ke Fankaar', a book on Bollywood actors hailing from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, threw light on the Kapoor clan's connection with Peshawar.\nHe said Prithiviraj Kapoor , father of Raj Kapoor, Shammi Kapoor and Shashi, used to go to Bombay (now Mumbai) from Peshawar to work in films. It was in 1942 that the head of Kapoor family sold the house and migrated to Mumbai. Despite leaving Peshawar, the Kapoors always fondly remembered the city. Raj Kapoor had even expressed desire to visit his childhood home before his demise. Zia recounted meeting the 'Junoon' actor in 2014, when he visited India and found the actor's response cordial.\nHe said that Kapoor was happy to make the acquaintance of the guests from Peshawar in his Mumbai home. \"Though he was ill at time when we met in 2014, happiness was clearly visible on his face,\" the historian recalled.

Now I see Nigerians commenting on my song. I am getting the positive feedback. I am not saying that is the best way. But that is my best way\u2026\u201d \nAsked if he is worried about the negative comments tied around his neck, he said \u2018that is how I do it. Someone sees it\u2019s a disgrace but that is my grace.\u2019 \nHe reiterated the fact that he has no beef with Wizkid but the negative feedback has made him learn most Ghanaians are unpatriotic. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything to Wizkid, I was elaborating on facts and it got me there. Those against me are not Ghanaians because they don\u2019t support their own. I can give them all they want all the time. We don\u2019t have love in the country.

Unfortunately, the affected occupants told the paper that they have since not heard anything from the deputy minister for works and housing. \nToday also established that the affected residents, who are mostly senior public and civil servants qualified and entitled to stay in government\u2019s flats, have their official allocation letters of occupancy and for which a monthly payment was effected through their salaries. \nMeanwhile, checks by Today from the Director of Communication at the Office of the Vice President, Mr Frank Agyei-Twum, revealed that the said Inspector Klutse was not known to the security detail of the Office of the Vice President. \nOur investigations also revealed that the said Araba has constantly been terrorising officials occupying government bungalows in the name of the vice president and chief of staff with the backing of the security detail at the Flagstaff House.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mahamudu bawumia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ishaq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "klutse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdulai amin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank agyei-twum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madam freda prempeh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "adc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "electoral commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accountant general department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adabraka police station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ec", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "araba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flagstaff house", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:44.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10350cb924d932f5995598e999c3b0988f0bb206", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSaEW0AN3g7ipzOjNsP.99K7prJj_bsh1oQDSwtvYEHRYtmcrKTxclYZoAnIjBe2W2m2ZDhE5bVlb0PHmfjlocmlVCG2Hn4qvChmk.GyMxHaCKtSPE6c2zT", "site_full": "durableroofingco.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://durableroofingco.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Information Regarding Roofing Permits \u2013 Durable Roofing Company", "title": "Information Regarding Roofing Permits", "title_full": "Information Regarding Roofing Permits", "published": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10350cb924d932f5995598e999c3b0988f0bb206", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSaEW0AN3g7ipzOjNsP.99K7prJj_bsh1oQDSwtvYEHRYtmcrKTxclYZoAnIjBe2W2m2ZDhE5bVlb0PHmfjlocmlVCG2Hn4qvChmk.GyMxHaCKtSPE6c2zT", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Durable Roofing Co.", "published": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "Information Regarding Roofing Permits", "text": "The blog post Information Regarding Roofing Permits was originally published to: www.chicago.durableroofing.com \nInformation Regarding Roofing Permits\nWhen considering any building work to your property it is always important to consider whether building permits are required for that particular work. Without the applicable building permits it is quite possible that the new extension, the new garage or the new roof are not legal. You may be required by county or state law to remove the building work or pay a fairly hefty fine. The state buildings department usually conducts the issuing of roofing permits and any other building permits and your builder or contractor will have more accurate details of the permits you might require and how to go about getting one. You should consult with a contractor first because this can save a lot of time and potential heartache at a later date.\nWhy is it necessary to have roofing permits?\nRoofing permits have been introduced and have become much more stringent in a lot of states to ensure that you are having a suitable roof fitted to your house that will stand up to a reasonable amount of bad weather. The roof on your house is the one thing that protects the inside of the home, the contents and the occupants from serious injury or damage in the event of storms or other prevailing weather conditions so it is important that you have the correct roofing installed to prevent this damage. Roofing permits are granted fairly easily as long as you meet these conditions.\nWhen might I require building permits?\nIf you are having repairs done to your existing roof it is very unlikely that any roofing permits will be required because you are not changing the layout or the structure of your building in anyway. However, if you are having an extra layer of shingles added to your roof then you should check whether you need roofing permits to complete this project. Also, if you are having an entirely new roof fitted you will definitely need to consult your contractor and ask whether you should obtain roofing permits.\nDifferent states have different regulations.\nUnfortunately, we cannot tell you the roofing permits you will require for your new roof because they differ from one state to the next. This is why it is so important that you do the research and find out for yourself. What could be correct for one person could be completely incorrect for the next person. Try contacting your local council or government and enquiring with them. Tell them that you are thinking of having a new roof fitted and you want to make sure that you are getting the correct roofing permits; they will be able to help you.\nThe roof on your house is your first line of defense and is a vital barrier in protecting you and the contents of your home against the elements. There will unfortunately come a time in the life of every roof when repairs become pointless and you are essentially forced to purchase a new roof. When this time does arrive you are better spending as much as you can afford on getting the best roof with the longest life. When you ask for a quote from a roofing contractor try to get an idea of the roofing permits that will be required for the work you want done because without the appropriate ones you could find yourself in a lot of trouble.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:44.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6d587c5eb4fa9ba872a21b6aa570cb7cd5ff50c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLv7Ej4RLGCzK6Iy_H6aNT3Rg.E6BLvxomedtaGgEW9YZw--", "site_full": "us.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/22813934/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Competitive Discussion - Overwatch Forums", "title": "Role Select System", "title_full": "Role Select System - Overwatch Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T14:51:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/overwatch.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f756bcdd4baa37e29dfaa3f132ec7738f052434e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLv7Ej4RLGCzK6Iy_H6aNT3Rg.E6BLvxomd05ttlOCWFLlnbl1vtcz5M", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "ILLIILLIILLI", "published": "2017-12-07T17:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "12/06/2017 11:56 PM Posted by Krig 12/06/2017 10:51 PM Posted by ILLIILLIILLI Please for the love of god can a role selection system be implemented, i got 5 dps mains every game and they have no idea how to play a tank or healer.
