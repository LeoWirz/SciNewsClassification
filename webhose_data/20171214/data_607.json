They bring a modern, high-tech atmosphere to the asset, promoting interaction among tenants and enhancing an already impressive amenity package,\u201d said Jeff Shaw , Principal with Bridge Office Fund Manager and CEO of Bridge Commercial Real Estate. \nThe Cushman & Wakefield office leasing team of Executive Director Deanna Lobinsky and Associate Chase Kulp has held the leasing assignment at BayView Corporate Tower since July 2014, when they were awarded the contract by previous ownership. They have since leased well over 200,000 square feet of space in BayView Corporate Tower. \n\u201cBRIDGE is a noted national leader in creating collaborative environments for their tenants, and the state-of-the-art amenities they are introducing at BayView Corporate Tower serve to reinforce their track record and continue to attract tenants to BayView Corporate Tower,\u201d said Lobinsky. \n\nBayView Corporate Tower is currently 80 percent occupied. Notable tenants include CHG Healthcare Services , Whole Foods and EnvisionRX . \nBayView Corporate Tower is a 412,520-square-foot, 12-story office building offering panoramic views of the Atlantic Ocean and Intracoastal Waterway, floor plates up to 33,500 square feet, an on-site caf\u00e9, an outdoor picnic area, and ample structured parking as well as on-site security and management. \nBayView Corporate Tower\u2019s location at 6451 North Federal Highway sits in the heart of Fort Lauderdale. The building is within walking distance of the myriad of dining and retail amenities along North Federal Highway as well as numerous luxury residential developments. BayView Corporate Tower is accessible to the entire region by way of Interstate 95, Florida\u2019s Turnpike and Interstate 595 and is a short drive from Fort Lauderdale-  \nAbout Bridge Office Fund Manager \nBridge Office Manager\u2019s senior management team averages 25 years of experience in the office sector and has been instrumental in the financing, acquisition, leasing and management of 274 properties in the US, completing ~$3 billion of office transactions in prior ventures. The investment team has substantial access to off-market deal flow and in three predecessor funds acquired assets at a 53% average discount to replacement cost. The majority of these transactions were sourced through Bridge\u2019s longstanding industry relationships with asset owners and the brokerage community. \nAbout Bridge Investment Group \nBridge Investment Group is a privately held real estate investment management firm with $8.85 billion in assets under management.

Seem like you have to get it connected just right. Tried some different setting and different programs and seen the Relic is different than the MXT I have for my wife as this is what we run for coin hunting, so I will have to use the coin mode when we hunt. Did some indoor test quick like to see how thing will read and sound like and have a few thing I will have to check out further, but the coins really seem to lock on good. Next the test I do with all my detectors just to see how they will handle iron close to coins as I use my bar floor that is full of nails and try different targets on top of the floor and it seem to work good with all the iron. The one test I do is find a real solid and bigger signal in all metal pinpoint and put a quarter on top of this spot to see if I can pick it up. Did a excellent job at picking it up and IDing it too as a quarter and bouncing to a dime reading. Tried it with a dime and it picked it up with a different tone and ID, but it is to be expected with a small target on top of a larger iron target.\nGot to read the owners manual more as the iron volume seems to work better off and get signals on everything metal, just a low tone on the ferrous.\nI seen there is 2 clips that came with it called the coil cable clips, but dont have any idea what they are and how you would use them as there is not mention in the manual.\nI can see it is not going to be as easy to use as the MXT and it will take more time to get to know it, but it has some good possibility, just wish it wont be for several months before I can get outside with it.\nOne thing I notice with my bad hearing and trying all the different headphone the audio is weak like it is with my Nokta Impact, so have a headphone amp ordered to try. Also for me in the 20 tones the dime sounds higher pitch than the quarter, but my son tells me he hears a big difference, so I wish I could just get some new ears.\nRick", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:33.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c8e7667e44959dcf35905719587c6156f24569f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZiCnPql74W2dhVo6bE6ebNm0Xk08PEiBND", "site_full": "www.beyondblue.org.au", "site": "beyondblue.org.au", "site_section": "http://www.beyondblue.org.au/connect-with-others/online-forums/staying-well", "site_categories": ["health", "panic_anxiety_disorders", "depression"], "section_title": "Staying well ", "title": "Do You Love Yourself?

The core is professional help, that is well accepted. Then there is non professional help like peer groups, other groups. Then there's self help and no help at all.\nWhat? No help at all? What does that mean?\nWell IMO, I have examined every moment of my recovery over 30 years. Some of those moments that clearly resulted in progress was clearing the decks, wiping the slate for a few hours to ...just living without thinking.\nThen there is the other side...dont think, DO! So when you feel like going for a walk or shopping but you are procrastinating...do. If its a bad decision when you arrive in the car park of that busy shopping centre then...return home. No big deal.\nTopic: switching mindsets- beyondblue\nEnter the world of the mentally ill where everything should be considered for treatment depending on the individual and where one of your greatest friends is your mental flexibility not regimental rules or advice that fits all.\nI have a friend, my wifes friend really and I love our chats on the topic of anxiety. I overcame my anxiety 95% in recent years after 25 years of struggle. She was chatting away and she mentioned that her techniques to overcome the condition included yoga, group relaxation and GROW (greater religions of the world) group chats. I didnt tell her that I attended a group GROW chat in 1983 and couldn't stand it, telling others face to face about my issues. Also yoga...nope! group relaxation....nope- it would make me anxious!! But later she talked about some good products she cooks in her diet like Kale, Tumeric and avocado. Avocadoes can be good for depression apparently. So I went away that day with some good advice and discounted the rest. If it doesn't work for you or worse it works against you then you are your sole judge, reject it. Yes this takes confidence so you can see the conflict.\nGuilt while having a mental illness is a big issue. Our friend is within ourselves that allows us to flow with how we feel. To do nothing but one task isn't easy. We garden, pull out weeds and we dwell on our issues, so it isn't easy achieving doing nothing or only one task. If gardening isn't working for you on one particular day, clean up the shed or mow the lawn. Do whatever is the most comfortable.\nSometimes we need a break from ourselves. That includes thinking about remedies or how we feel or not thinking at all..\nI've rambled on, sorry Nat.\nTony WK", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:33.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c8e7667e44959dcf35905719587c6156f24569f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZiCnPql74W2dhVo6bE6ebNm0Xk08PEiBND", "site_full": "www.beyondblue.org.au", "site": "beyondblue.org.au", "site_section": "http://www.beyondblue.org.au/connect-with-others/online-forums/staying-well", "site_categories": ["health", "panic_anxiety_disorders", "depression"], "section_title": "Staying well ", "title": "Do You Love Yourself?

Thank you. I think you have a point about stop thinking and just do it. Between Paul's \"be gentle to yourself\" and Mary' \"you are a worthwhile person\" I'm slowly collecting advice that really does help. So thank you.\nI think a passion is essential to loving yourself. To me it meams acknowledging myself as an individual worthy of interests, opinions, preferences and likes of my own regardless of what others say.\nYou're right about nursery work. I loved it. The downside was because I'm chatty I just kept getting put on the registers and I have limited patience with customer service. I would watch the other staff out with the plants and feel angry.

Yet there are an abundance of analogue clocks around and still being manufactured. My Lexus, a luxury automobile, has an analogue clock on the dashboard.\nI think you've glossed over the fact that the first proposal is that the analogues aren't being replaced with simple digital clocks, but more advanced and accurate atomic clocks, which either are radio-connected to a central atomic clock, as here in the USA, or perhaps with a near-future technology, actually have their own, internal atomic mechanisms for telling time. So what's being proposed is not simply a change in format, but a huge upgrade in technology such that everyone would be on the exact same time.\nThe second proposal is a quick-and-easy fix that simply puts a band-aid over the wound of people being on different times with different clocks. For the purposes of this issue, I have assumed that traditional hands are so close to each other in appearance that one cannot simply glance at a clock and tell what time it is, but actually has to stop and study the face to get the time (even assuming the clock is accurate). Painting the three hands various colours would indeed make them vastly easier to read for people with normal vision (and I intentionally chose colours that a person with red-green colour blindness could still read), but people with more profound color blindness would still be unaided.\nThe third option also has a correspondence IRL. It is possible to buy watches today that only have an hour hand, which would be more somewhat more accurate than looking at the sun, but really would still force someone using it to have supplemental time pieces (like their phones) or live a life without hard deadlines.\nI don't necessarily see this as government overreach into a problem the free market can solve. If there are issues that deal with things like a national grammar academy (like the French have IRL) so that everyone (ideally) is speaking with the same words, is such a stretch that the government would propose an upgrade that we all be on the same time?

It is often caused by organic diseases. The present case involved an appendiceal intussusception without an organic disease, and laparoscopic resection of part of the cecum was performed. Appendiceal intussusception has various causes, including malignant diseases. Therefore, diagnosis and selection of operative method are complex and could potentially lead to an excessively invasive option. By performing SILS with a multiuse single-site port, we were able to provide an appropriate, non-invasive treatment that had a good esthetic outcome.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2jo9XI5", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:35.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e96e7cbf179d5e7cb1c29c70ebdf32460e4e3370", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc93CuxQraSBSYi2DeqPsA2pjcznt46Y5.DrgS43SRfl8GWt1YbP6rGJhXxdHOu2w.01y4LsK6lCw--", "site_full": "crimesagainsthughsmanatees.tumblr.com", "site": "tumblr.com", "site_section": "http://hikergirl.tumblr.com/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Life begins at 40", "title": "crimesagainsthughsmanatees: Comic from 12-6-2013PATREON", "title_full": "crimesagainsthughsmanatees: Comic from 12-6-2013PATREON", "published": "2017-12-06T19:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://78.media.tumblr.com/40a2a150d7d70930c882c9dc7008aa1f/tumblr_p0jujcYwer1qa4karo1_1280.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e96e7cbf179d5e7cb1c29c70ebdf32460e4e3370", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc93CuxQraSBSYi2DeqPsA2pjcznt46Y5.DrgS43SRfl8GWt1YbP6rGJhXxdHOu2w.01y4LsK6lCw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T19:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "crimesagainsthughsmanatees: Comic from 12-6-2013PATREON", "text": "crimesagainsthughsmanatees posted this When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives mean the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. - Henri...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "henri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:35.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb123b903ad7d7a0b4bba57500b25ad0feb05014", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwtjCO8DAUTmKggCB53.s0xq28WrAAUHMwoNJmrj.5CJzIY5M0bsBCBtSN3XPARfACkG3ynerzYpw--", "site_full": "findingninki.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://findingninki.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "finding ninki", "title": "Spice of life", "title_full": "Spice of life", "published": "2017-12-07T11:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb123b903ad7d7a0b4bba57500b25ad0feb05014", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwtjCO8DAUTmKggCB53.s0xq28WrAAUHMwoNJmrj.5CJzIY5M0bsBCBtSN3XPARfACkG3ynerzYpw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ninki (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "Spice of life", "text": "Opened biscuits in the spice cupboard means our rich tea taste of curry - garam masala and ground coriander mostly.

Every action the baby takes produces a reaction from the environment that gets filed away in the mind. This may be brought out at a later date when faced with a similar situation. This sort of learning develops foresight and is what helps keep the baby safe. \nA robot has a basic set of instructions about how to do a job. However with the great strides being made in Artificial Intelligence, there is no surprise when you discover that researchers at the University of California \u2013 Berkeley, have come up with a design that allows a robot to develop a bit of foresight of it\u2019s own. \nThe robotic learning technology developed by the researchers allows robots to predict the future of their actions so that they can manipulate objects which they may not have seen beforehand. This is a technology which will help self driven robotic cars to drive safely when encountering out of the ordinary objects. \nThe technology developed in this science project will be able to produce even better robotic assistants in the home in the future. The robotic prototypes are currently teaching themselves simple manual moves based on autonomous play. This visual foresight will help them perform these manual tasks with less margin for error.

Unity is strength \u2013 if we were not united as a team, we would not have achieved what we have accomplished in the last two terms,\u201d she said. \nShe further reminded the councillors of the challenges that the municipality faces in providing effective, efficient and reliable municipal services to the residents of Keetmanshoop, saying the main objectives of the council come 2018 would remain the provision of affordable housing and basic services. \nThe mayor added that the focus would be on the development of infrastructure, attracting new businesses and investors and making Keetmanshoop a tourism hub.

A small fire that spreads to a Christmas tree can grow large very quickly. \nPICKING THE TREE \n\u2022 Choose a tree with fresh, green needles that do not fall off when touched. \nPLACING THE TREE \n\u2022 Before placing the tree in the stand, cut two inches from the base of the trunk. \n\u2022 Make sure the tree is at least three feet away from any heat source, like fireplaces, radiators, candles, heat vents or lights. \n\u2022 Make sure the tree is not blocking an exit. \n\u2022 Add water to the tree stand. Be sure to add water daily. \nLIGHTING THE TREE \n\u2022 Use lights that are listed by a qualified testing laboratory. Some lights are only for indoor or outdoor use. \n\u2022 Replace any string of lights with worn or broken cords or loose bulb connections. Read manufacturer\u2019s instructions for number of light strands to connect. \n\u2022 Never use lit candles to decorate the tree. \n\u2022 Always turn off Christmas tree lights before leaving home.

So he does have his own set of special circumstances.\nMy biggest piece of advice is- always remember your adjusted age. Even with the later term preemies a few weeks really can matter. And don't sweat the milestone charts. Preemies tend to figure things out in their own way on their own time. Be patient, do lots of purposeful play, take advantage of all the therapies.\nRelax.

Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Sam Onwuemeodo said the typographic error led to the naming of the Ministry as the Ministry of Happiness and Couples Fulfilment. \nIt is now called Ministry of Happiness and Purpose Fulfilment. \n\u201cThere was a typographic error in the first statement issued on the swearing in of the new commissioners. The word \u201cCouple\u201d was inadvertently written, instead of the word \u201cPurpose,\u201d we regret that. The statement went on to justify the essence of the new Ministry and its purpose in the state. \n\u201cThe real essence of life is to be happy and to fulfil one\u2019s purpose in life; Government officials are elected to address this. \nHappiness and Purpose Fulfilment Ministry therefore, is established for the lost time to correct the policy framework to guide ministries and departments on what they must do to guarantee the citizens\u2019 happiness and contribute better to the society. \n\u201cThis is the very reason people elect their leaders: to guarantee their happiness and purpose fulfilment. A great leader therefore, is one who provides happiness to the people. \n\u201cUnfortunately, this vital element of our social lives has not been properly addressed. Governments at different levels have created several ministries and departments to achieve this, yet people are bitter, angry with hate speeches which lead to crisis, war and even terrorism,\u201d the release read. \nThe statement further described the choice of Okorocha\u2019s sister, Mrs Ogechi Ololo as the Supervisory Commissioner in charge of the ministry as a wise choice considering her experience in administration. \n\u201cThe choice of Mrs Ogechi Ololo, a Masters Degree Holder in computer Science, USA who has been the Deputy Chief of Staff to the Governor on Domestic Matters and Food Security can be described as a round peg in a round hole. Before her appointment as the supervisory commissioner, she was charged with the responsibility of liaising with the Federal Government on N-Power Project, CBN Anchor project and BOI, Empowerment Projects.\u201d \nGovernor Rochas Okorocha has also created other Similar Ministries such as the Ministry of Non Formal sector and Market development to address issues of the poor state of Imo Markets and organize the non-formal sector to make them more productive. The Ministry of education was also split into three ministries, Primary and secondary, Tertiary non-Formal Education, ICT, Science and Technology.

Sep 29, 2017 at 9:18am PDT \nChristine took to Instagram today to share her worries about decorating the house this year, saying: \n\u201cI\u2019m nervous about putting a tree, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to. Last year was the most upsetting Christmas we\u2019ve had, we had just been told our twins had autism and we felt very out of our depth. \n\u201cChristmas massively affects the twins behaviour. They were extremely anxious and unsettled. The Christmas lights, trees, decorations and music\u2026 it was all too much. \n\u201cIt was very overstimulating and with so much change everywhere it was quite frightening for our children who were pretty non-verbal, they had no understanding of what was going on.\u201d Advertisement A post shared by Christine McGuinness (@mrscmcguinness) on Dec 6, 2017 at 5:47am PST \nHowever, Christine says that she is now more prepared and looking forward to helping her children enjoy the holidays. \n\u201cNow, I\u2019m fuelled with knowledge on their condition and I\u2019m really looking forward to preparing them in advance to help them understand the magic of Christmas.\u201d Read more about: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "orlaith condon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paddy mcguinness", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paddy mcgui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penelope", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine mcguinness", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:37.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c0ef142ba6f2154ff1ce95fbc947445fb3f8a6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog669nc0y8UFH_Jf1oX8QNCaYzYY7xsapGd16coXeGNSUYsLMBtyoEfNSFqYOnZyG01Zyvy.VjwaiAxW_LJFqCbHxBu9PwaTDv_qygr3fuHeY4XyBmEUNJDDg-", "site_full": "community.myfitnesspal.com", "site": "myfitnesspal.com", "site_section": "http://community.myfitnesspal.com/en/categories/nutrition-debate", "site_categories": ["health", "exercise"], "section_title": "Debate: Health and Fitness \u2014 MyFitnessPal.com", "title": "Is running in cold weather keeping me sick?", "title_full": "Is running in cold weather keeping me sick? \u2014 MyFitnessPal.com", "published": "2017-12-05T11:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.089, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 638, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f1a65af318723f33197f0dba9a40ef27fa60ea58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog669nc0y8UFH_Jf1oX8QNCaYzYY7xsapGd16coXeGNSUYsLMBtyoEfNSFqYOnZyG01Zyvy.VjwaiAxW_LJFqCbHxBu9PwaTDv_qygr3fuHeY4JW6P82jqW_p6JoY7RP.LYQ--", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "mangrothian", "published": "2017-12-07T06:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : \u00bb Quote: : \u00bb \"At body temperature, the cells responded with a sophisticated defense, sending out warning signals to uninfected cells around them. Those cells prepared an arsenal of antiviral proteins, which they used to destroy the rhinoviruses.\nBut at a relatively cool 91.4 degrees Fahrenheit, Dr. Iwasaki and her colleagues found, things changed.\nThe neighboring cells only managed a weak defense, allowing the rhinoviruses to invade them and multiply. This result pointed to an explanation for why rhinoviruses plague humans at low temperatures: In cool conditions, the immune system somehow falters.\"\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/body/scientists-finally-prove-cold-weather-makes-sick/\nAssuming this is core body temperature 91.4 degrees Fahrenheit would mean hypothermia. You have more pressing issues than viral infection at this point.\nThey're looking at lung villi and other respiratory tract lining cells rather than core body temperature (at least from what I saw in the article), which I'm thinking would have a temporary surface temperature change when running in a cold weather for an extended time. Although unless a person is running for half or full marathon times and/or spending most of the day outdoors in freezing temps, I don't see it causing signalling issues between infected/uninfected cells.\n@ OP, running with a chest infection will dislodge mucus and cause coughing and all sorts of ickies. Standard suggestion for runners and viral infections is if it is only affecting your respiratory system from the neck up, feel free to run if you're up to it. If it's from the neck down, wait until it's passed. It's better to recover before you head out the door again.

We need access to diverse funding tools with some urgency,\" LGNZ president David Cull said at a quarterly briefing in Wellington. \nCull said councils nationwide are facing \"considerable bills\" to renew things such as wastewater plants and other infrastructure, in particular as the population continues to rise. New Zealand has faced record levels of immigration in recent years and councils \"simply don't have the mechanisms to raise the debt they need or a sufficient rating base to pay for it,\" he said. \nGrowth councils including Hamilton, Tauranga, Auckland and Queenstown are particularly challenged as their debt levels are constrained and mayors have called for additional funding mechanisms, he said. \n\"Hamilton is staring down the barrel of a 16 percent rate rise because of some of these challenges,\" he said, adding the problem is not just restricted to those councils. \nThe new government, however, is reviewing local government costs and revenue \"so at least they have acknowledged there is a need to examine this,\" he said. \"We are looking forward to working with the government to develop new tools,\" he added. \nRegarding what types of mechanisms LGNZ would be keen on, Cull said local bodies are \"very grateful\" for things such as the tourism fund and a number of regional developments, but was \"agnostic about what kind of funding it might be.\" \nAll options \"are up for grabs, but they need to be appropriate,\" he said. \nCull underscored any funding mechanism needs to be sustainable and ideally needs to \"incentivise both the people we are taking the funding from and the council who is on the receiving end.\" \nWater was a case in point following yesterday's series of recommendations on New Zealand's inadequate drinking water systems, with the report failing to address the issue of cost of the significant infrastructure that will be required for things like the universal treatment of water, he said. \nThe report recommended an independent regulatory body, however, Cull said LGNZ favours a co-regulatory body. \n\"Local government owns the assets which are worth millions and therefore should have a part,\" he said. Any government decision around aggregating water bodies needs to be made in conjunction with the communities, given they own the assets, he said. \nSeparately, the briefing included an update from the Local Government Funding Authority, which sells bonds on behalf of local authorities. In the year ended Sept. 30, the LGFA accounted for 95 percent of all council borrowing. Total LGFA lending to the sector stood at $8.3 billion as at Nov. 30, up $201 million from September. \nOf that, $294.7 million was short-term lending to 20 councils and $7.91 billion was long-term borrowing by 52 councils, it said. A significant portion of the lending is to councils refinancing other debt on better terms or pre-funding December 2017 loan maturities, said LGFA chair Craig Stobo. \nOverseas investors in LGFA bonds rose 4.8 percentage points in the past three months to 35.9 percent, just below banks an unchanged 35.6 percent holding and domestic institutional investors at 25.2 percent, down 5.5 percentage points. \nStobo said the offshore interest has increased steadily as investors who have invested in government bonds have seen yields decline and are looking for improved margins. \n\"We have offered them an opportunity to switch out of New Zealand government bonds into LGFA bonds with the same maturities, same coupons but a slightly higher yield.\" \n(BusinessDesk) Got a question about this story?
