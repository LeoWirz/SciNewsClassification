It is no wonder that data science is being touted as the hottest career option of the 21st Century. And following the suit is India where the need for data scientists is definitely on an upward trend. \nAccording to market predictions, the big data market by 2021, will grow from $28.65 Billion in 2016 to $66.79 Billion (at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 18% ). The explosion of mobile devices and apps, and the burgeoning data available has paved the way for the need for big data analytics and solutions across many organizations . This, in turn, has increased the demand for data scientists all over the world. A demand that is unlikely to die down soon. \n\nAs it is with any new field, the hype factor is high. Now, tech professionals looking for a job in big data are suddenly somehow \u2018data scientists\u2019! Through this article, we articulate how mid-career tech professionals considering a career in big data can upskill themselves and look at a prosperous career in data science . This shifts the focus on techies among their mid-career techies since data scientists are the new professionals who can unlock the potential of an increasingly data-rich world. \nData scientist checklist \nSome academicians, economists, physicists, mathematicians, statisticians, data miners, and programmers are exploring careers in data science. Here are some qualities that aspiring data scientists should ideally possess: \n\nTo start with, the heart of someone who is eyeing a career in data science should be with data. Not only should the person be good at comprehending the data sets, but also should be able to visualize the outcomes and benefits of data as a first-class product. The ability to churn chunks of data into meaningful observations should be the prerequisite for any data scientist. \nSecondly, they are masters of programming and statistics, together with high domain knowledge. To become a successful data scientist, they need to be good at several subject disciplines. \nAnd lastly, technical know-how shouldn't act as a barrier for and aspiring data-scientist. Creativity sits at the heart of every data scientist, as they find newer, unexplored methods and ways to visualize information from data sets. \nA good data scientist (a powerful and rare combination of) \n= data hacker + programmer + analyst + coach + story teller + artist \nThe road to data science \nThe path to becoming a successful data scientist lies in the science behind the domain of data. So, let\u2019s start with what it takes to be in it. An ideal data scientist should be able to gather, collect, explore, group and represent data of all forms and combinations. The hard truth, however, is that there are a limited number of people who possess the skills to be an ideal data scientist. \n\nTo begin with, someone who is skilled with the ability to write a code will eventually become a data scientist. Possessing competence in programming helps in the path of becoming a great data scientist. You then must identify the gaps in your skills, whether it is programming, statistics or domain related. \n\nHere\u2019s a tip : Assess your shortcomings, and then try to work with those who possess those skills. You should pitch to get projects with a \u2018mentor\u2019, where you can get your hands dirty with data. Next, you should get on an accelerated path and explore data beyond your comfort zone. And learn about new technologies and methods as well. \nData scientist jobs \nWith more connected devices and the advent of the Internet of Things, every industry is seeing the demand for data scientists today. However, industries such as hospitality, telecom, healthcare and financial services are seeing the highest demand as of today. On the other hand, industries dependent on data, such as ad tech, will likely to have a continuous hiring demand for such skilled professionals. \nA potential checklist employers use Can the said candidate program. Being the best programmer is not the prerequisite here, however, the ability to quickly prototype algorithms is something that should be looked for. Can a candidate visualize the outcome of interpreting the data, and efficiently communicate the same findings - both visually and verbally? Do they understand the current businesses nuances and challenges of the working environment and how quickly can they deploy data analytics to solve issues? Lastly, what is their method to the madness and how do they enhance their skills with the ever-changing times? Are they keen to take professional courses to keep the skills updated and fresh ? Are they an active part of any open source community?

The government last month accused the ACLU of misleading the Justice Department during the high-profile case. In papers filed with the Supreme Court, the Justice Department said ACLU attorneys did not alert government lawyers that the teen\u2019s abortion would take place sooner than they expected. That, the administration says, deprived its lawyers of the chance to ask the Supreme Court to block the procedure, at least temporarily. The government suggested disciplinary action against ACLU attorneys might be appropriate. On Monday evening, the ACLU responded in a filing with the Supreme Court. Representing the ACLU, attorney Carter G. Phillips, himself a Justice Department official during the Reagan administration, wrote there is no basis for disciplinary action against ACLU attorneys. He said the evidence shows ACLU attorneys made accurate statements about the logistics surrounding the abortion procedure. Government lawyers failed to ask the Supreme Court to block the teen\u2019s procedure in time \u201cbased on assumptions\u201d they made about the timing of the procedure, \u201cnot on the basis of any commitments\u201d from the teen\u2019s lawyers, the brief says.

Upon receiving the notifications, the app gets put into the background and executes some code. During this code execution the app needs to access an item in the keychain that is protected with the protection level kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly . According to this SO post ( Does iOS start app in background after reboot if remote-notification defined in UIBackgroundModes and new push notification comes? ) and Apple's app lifecycle diagram , an app is in the not-running state after a device reboot and can therefore not be put into the background until the user has launched it into the foreground at least once.\nHowever, Apple also provides the protection level kSecAttrAccessibleAlways . If an app can only run in the background after it has first launched, what's the purpose of the kSecAttrAccessibleAlways attribute? Wouldn't the user first have to unlock the device in order for the app to be able to run in the background? In what cases can apps run after a device reboot but before a user has unlocked the device? Apple also provides the protection level NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication for files in the app's sandbox container. In what situations would apps even be able to attempt to access their files before a user has unlocked the device after a reboot?

Excluding Sharper Image and Southeast Asia, revenue declined approximately 7 percent in the third quarter of 2017.

The company also expects to have a non-cash tax charge of approximately 15 million dollars related to the write off of certain deferred tax assets. \nThe company expects GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations excluding the impairment charge, to be a loss of approximately 0.10 dollar compared to earnings of 0.25 dollar in the third quarter of 2016. The loss of 0.10 in the third quarter includes the non-cash tax charge of approximately 15 million dollars or 0.26 dollar per share. \nNon-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be

The company opened one full-line store and seven factory outlet stores during the past 12 months. \nThe company added that indirect segment revenues decreased 23.8 percent to 30.9 million dollars reflecting a reduction in the number of specialty accounts coupled with a reduction in orders from both specialty accounts and certain key accounts. \nGross profit for the quarter was 63.8 million dollars or 55.9 percent of net revenues, compared to 72.9 million dollars or 57.6 percent of net revenues, in the prior year third quarter. The year-over-year 80 basis point gross profit decline, the company said, was primarily related to increased promotional activity at the company\u2019s factory outlet stores and channel mix changes, partially offset by a reduction in product cost, all of which caused the gross profit percentage to fall below the low end of the guidance range of 57.1 percent to 57.6 percent. \nThe company\u2019s operating income totalled 0.5 million dollars or 0.4 percent of net revenues compared to 11.4 million dollars or 9 percent of net revenues, in the prior year third quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, the company\u2019s operating income totalled 13 million dollars or 11.4 percent of net revenues compared to 12 million dollars or 9.5 percent of net revenues, in the prior year. Review of the nine month results \nCurrent year net revenues for the nine months totalled 322.6 million dollars compared to 351.1 million dollars in the prior year. Direct segment revenues were 241.3 million dollars, a 2 percent decrease from 246.3 million dollars in the prior year. Comparable sales including e-commerce decreased 7.7 percent for the period reflecting a 6.1 percent decline in comparable store sales and an 11.4 percent decrease in e-commerce sales. \nIndirect segment revenues for the nine months decreased 22.4 percent to 81.3 million dollars from 104.8 million dollars. Gross profit totalled 179.8 million dollars or 55.7 percent of net revenues, compared to 201 million dollars or 57.2 percent of net revenues, in the prior year. The company\u2019s operating loss was 0.6 million dollars or 0.2 percent of net revenues, in the current year nine month period, compared to operating income of 23.6 million dollars or 6.7 percent of net revenues, in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, the company\u2019s operating income was 17.1 million dollars or 5.3 percent of net revenues, compared to 26.7 million dollars or 7.6 percent of net revenues, in the prior year. Vera Bradley predicts Q4 and FY18 expectations \nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company expects net revenues of 127 million dollars to 132 million dollars compared to prior year fourth quarter revenues of 134.8 million dollars, a gross profit percentage of 55.4 percent to 55.8 percent compared to 55.7 percent in the prior year fourth quarter and diluted earnings per share of 0.30 dollar to 0.33 dollars. Net income totalled 3.5 million dollars or 0.09 dollar per diluted share, in the prior year fourth quarter and excluding charges, net income totalled 10.1 million dollars or 0.28 dollar per diluted share. \nFor fiscal 2018, the company expects net revenues of 450 million dollars to 455 million dollars compared to 485.9 million dollars last year, a gross profit percentage of 55.8 percent to 55.9 percent compared to 56.8 percent last year and diluted earnings per share of 0.57 dollar to 0.60 dollars. Diluted earnings per share totalled 0.53 dollar last year and excluding charges, diluted earnings per share were 0.72 dollar last year. \n\u201cAs we discussed last quarter, we have launched Vision 20/20, an aggressive plan to turn around our business over the next three years. Vision 20/20 will restore brand and company health by moving to a less clearance-driven business model combined with a meaningful reduction in our SG&A expenses,\u201d added Wallstrom. \nThe majority of the product and pricing initiatives will be implemented beginning in fiscal 2019; management expects annualized revenues will be negatively impacted by these initiatives by 30 million dollars to 50 million dollars in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 levels. \nPicture:Facebook/Vera Bradley", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vera bradley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert wallstrom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallstrom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook/vera bradley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vera bradley", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:34.032+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "21e4f96d37f6af2a301d91b89531f739f70c9457", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFoxxFTlwO8ntgjXBI65AkrLZCnLhcslLOON773a8na1nhbYqL8kUpYl5MEbRReF1KX9LQI_ebIegyQ2ldwwtc8.Bhjt4OwOu41sE269lF0TouiJENC8Wz7h", "site_full": "ghana.watsupafrica.com", "site": "watsupafrica.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Kalybos on Ahoufe Patri \u2013 Let\u2019s Talk Entertainment (5-12-17) | WatsupAfrica - Africa's Latest News & Entertainment Platform", "title_full": "Kalybos on Ahoufe Patri \u2013 Let\u2019s Talk Entertainment (5-12-17) | WatsupAfrica - Africa's Latest News & Entertainment Platform", "published": "2017-12-06T11:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.186, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "21e4f96d37f6af2a301d91b89531f739f70c9457", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFoxxFTlwO8ntgjXBI65AkrLZCnLhcslLOON773a8na1nhbYqL8kUpYl5MEbRReF1KX9LQI_ebIegyQ2ldwwtc8.Bhjt4OwOu41sE269lF0TouiJENC8Wz7h", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T11:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "Kalybos on Ahoufe Patri \u2013 Let\u2019s Talk Entertainment (5-12-17) | WatsupAfrica - Africa's Latest News & Entertainment Platform", "text": "\nActor denies weed smoking allegations.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DOW) reached another all-time high. Interest rates in the U.S. are yielding multi-decade lows, some say multi-century lows. Trillions of dollars in global sovereign debt have negative yield and European junk bonds yield less than 10 year U.S. treasuries. \u201cOfficial\u201d unemployment is low. Borrowing is inexpensive. Things are good, so they say! I Doubt It! Do you believe the above is a fair and accurate representation of our economic world? If so, how do you explain the following? Global debt exceeds $200 trillion and is rising rapidly. This massive debt will NOT be paid back in currencies with 2017 purchasing power. Debt MUST be rolled over in continually DEVALUING dollars, euros, yen and pounds. The financial system rolls over maturing debt, adds more, and pretends repayment will not be problematic. Those who hope this will remain true ignore the lessons of history, including sky-high interest rates in the late 1970s, the Asian and Long Term Capital crises in the late 1990s, many defaults and hyperinflations in the last century and the credit-crunch-recession-market-crash of 2008. Official inflation statistics show that consumer price inflation is low \u2013 supposedly in the two percent range. However, if you pay for health care, hospital bills, prescription drugs, Obamacare, beer, cigarettes, college tuition, fresh vegetables, processed food, auto insurance, and many other necessities, you know better. The  Chapwood Index agrees with your experience. Their statistics show consumer price inflation is much higher than official numbers. National debt \u2013 the official debt of the U.S. government exceeds $20.5 trillion \u2013 more than the U.S. Gross Domestic Product. The debt has increased exponentially (straight line on a log scale chart) for the past century. \n\nInterest paid on the official national debt is approximately $500 billion per year and climbing. Congress is influenced by the financial elite and will not operate within a balanced budget. Therefore the U.S. will pay more interest each year. \n\nU.S. government expenditures increase every year. Since annual revenues are less than expenses by a trillion or so, the shortfall is borrowed. Hence national debt rises every year and interest must be paid on ever-increasing debt. \n\nDebt, out-of-control expenses, and economic craziness are universal in our current system. Race, gender, and political party make no material difference. Why should they? Corporations, politicians, lobbyists, military contractors, Big Pharma and individuals want more dollars to spend every year and the government satisfies everyone by adding to the debt load. \n\nDebt and currency in circulation rise far more rapidly than growth of the economy which must support the debt.  HENCE PRICES RISE. Rising consumer prices are essential to a financialized economy. Do you remember prices in 1970? If you don\u2019t, examine the following overview. \n\nWHAT COULD IMPROVE OUR FINANCIAL WORLD? Balanced budgets and honest accounting at all levels of government. Not likely. Honest currency units, currency units created from productive effort, not units conjured out of \u201cthin air\u201d by central banking and commercial banking fractional reserve policies. Dreaming! Global peace. Military and defense expenses could be reduced to a fraction of current levels. Redirect those resources toward more productive purposes. All but impossible! Political honesty, absence of corruption and effective, non-intrusive government. H . Maybe we should write to our congressmen. \nWHAT COULD MAKE OUR ECONOMIC WORLD WORSE, BUT WE HOPE DOES NOT OCCUR? \nWars with North Korea, Iran, Russia, China, and others. Hyperinflation in western countries, because central banks will be forced to \u201cprint\u201d an almost unlimited number of currency units to address their self-created financial problems. Derivatives implosion (remember 2008), nuclear war, electromagnetic pulse weapons, and global plague. \nPROGNOSIS: \nThe world will muddle through its problems in spite of wars, pestilence, corruption, central bankers, and self-serving politicians. Based on centuries of economic history, we should expect increasing financial trauma, periodic market crashes, devalued currencies, debt defaults, and \u2026 that someone else will be blamed. \nWHAT CAN WE DO FOR SELF PROTECTION? \nRealize that markets rise and fall. The stock markets have enjoyed a long bull market while many commodities are relatively inexpensive. Expect a reversal, perhaps soon. Buy silver and gold.  Why buy metals? They have been real money and a store of value for centuries. They are currently undervalued compared to total debt and the stock market. See below. \nGraph silver prices divided by the official U.S. national debt.  Silver prices have increased less rapidly than exponentially increasing national debt for 25 years, and are currently selling for multi-decade lows compared to national debt. National debt will increase 8 \u2013 10% per year and silver prices will rise more rapidly in coming years. \n\nGraph silver prices divided by the S&P 500 Index.  Silver prices are currently near a two-decade low when compared to the S&P 500 Index. Silver prices will rise and the S&P will correct, possibly soon. \n\nBased on decades of history, silver prices are inexpensive compared to exponentially increasing national debt and stock market prices. Silver prices will rise compared to both, perhaps soon. \nCONCLUSIONS: Debt and government expenses are excessive and too large for the economy to support. However, they exponentially increase. Positive change is possible but given the massive economic resistance from debt, central banker intrusion into markets, and over-valued stock markets, significant improvement in revenues, debt loads and balance sheets seems unlikely. Expect a reversal in stock market prices. Expect gold and silver prices will rebound much higher in 2018. Guaranteed \u2013 no! Likely \u2013 yes! Silver and gold will protect your savings, retirement assets and purchasing power from continual currency devaluations, central bank policy errors, and excessive government debt. \nPosted with permission and written by Gary Christenson, The Deviant Investor   ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gary christenson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "big pharma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:34.040+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e750d19782faf133401a9d7ef6d6e0bf9f534ee9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_lKuQFdZvPvZ0_nrwu42LypI2ToZPtgZ1AjJbyin6C3bdf6X4zsnNQ2N8TSn_j22Bjr3G_N8y401nO7OgNnhHMzN9ZkPUjTTgCC1rdjclRvCoWWuFfBs1Z", "site_full": "www.newswest9.com", "site": "newswest9.com", "site_section": "http://www.newswest9.com/Global/category.asp?C=83261&clienttype=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NewsWest9.com - News", "title": "California wind, and fire danger, hits unprecedented high", "title_full": "California wind, and fire danger, hits unprecedented high", "published": "2017-12-07T10:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://APMOBILE.images.worldnow.com/images/15576283_G.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e750d19782faf133401a9d7ef6d6e0bf9f534ee9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_lKuQFdZvPvZ0_nrwu42LypI2ToZPtgZ1AjJbyin6C3bdf6X4zsnNQ2N8TSn_j22Bjr3G_N8y401nO7OgNnhHMzN9ZkPUjTTgCC1rdjclRvCoWWuFfBs1Z", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "California wind, and fire danger, hits unprecedented high", "text": "California wind, and fire danger, hits unprecedented high 2017-12-07T08:40:55Z 2017-12-07T09:21:31Z (AP Photo/Noah Berger).

(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

(Source: KDVR/Otho E. Stuart Middle School/CNN) \nCOMMERCE CITY, CO (KDVR/CNN) \u2013 While some are saying a Colorado teacher\u2019s allegedly threatening notes to his students should be taken as a joke, others, including the school district, want the matter taken seriously. \nKris Burghart, an eighth-grade teacher at Otho E. Stuart Middle School in Commerce City, CO, was placed on administrative leave starting Tuesday. \nThe teacher allegedly typed at least two messages to his students that talk about wanting to kill children and projected them on a screen in the classroom. \n\"Silent reading ... I want to kill children but I am a loving Christian man who never would hurt a flee (sic) so please sit down and read,\" Burghart allegedly typed in one post. \nImages of the messages were sent to school administrators. \n\u201cI was really concerned for my student\u2019s safety as soon as I read it,\u201d said one mother, who wanted to remain anonymous. \nShe and other parents expressed alarm over the messages, saying they\u2019re surprised the teacher would do something like this. \n\u201cI do really feel like there\u2019s definite disciplinary action that needs to take place,\u201d the mother said. \nHowever, at least one parent feels Burghart simply reached his breaking point in a school where students reportedly often require disciplinary actions. \nStill others believe the messages were meant as jokes. \nThe school district says it is nevertheless taking the situation seriously as it investigates. Burghart is suspended indefinitely during the investigation process. \n\u201cWe all have bad days, but as a person in a position of trust with our students, it doesn\u2019t matter how bad your day is. You don\u2019t speak that way. You don\u2019t write that way. You don\u2019t put anything up for the students to read like that,\u201d the concerned mother said. \nBurghart has not commented on the matter. \nThe school principal says the students were never in any danger. \nCopyright 2017 KDVR, Otho E.

impeachment on Wednesday that could lead to President Donald Trump\u2019s removal. \nA Democratic congressman said on Tuesday that he intended to force the House to vote on Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment. \nAl Green of Texas said he would present articles of impeachment on the floor of the House on Wednesday. He argued that the president was \u201cunmindful of the high duties of his high office and the dignity and properties thereof\u201d. \n\n\u201cFor too long, we have allowed our civility to prevent us from confronting the invidious incivility of President Donald J Trump,\u201d Green wrote in a memo to colleagues on Tuesday. \n\u201cIn doing this, hatred disguised as acceptable political correctness has festered in our body politic and polluted our discourse to our detriment. It divides and damages the social fabric of our country in ways that obstruction of justice cannot. It causes unparalleled destruction to our society in the long- and short-term that will not easily heal.\u201d \nThe impeachment resolution that Green\u2019s office circulated to reporters on Tuesday did not include allegations that Trump had committed a crime or obstructed justice. But it did detail Trump\u2019s \u201cassociation\u201d with white nationalism, neo-Nazism and his incitement of hatred and hostility as evidence that he is not fit to occupy the Oval Office. \nThe congressman specifically referenced: Trump\u2019s comments after the deadly violence in Charlottesville, when Trump drew an equivalence between neo-Nazi demonstrators and liberal protesters; his decision last week to share three anti-Muslim videos posted by the deputy leader of a British far-right group; and a list of statements he has made denigrating groups and individuals, including NFL players and the congresswoman Frederica Wilson. \nDemocratic leaders have sought to temper calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment, arguing that the move would be premature given the continuing investigations into his campaign and administration led by congressional committees and the special counsel Robert Mueller. \nPushing impeachment before the investigators complete their work, they say, could undermine the prospect of bipartisan action on impeachment should the inquiries uncover compelling evidence against the president. The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, has publicly opposed the idea and recently said that if her party retook the House in the 2018, impeachment should not be a focus. \nDemocratic leaders appeared to have prevented Green from bringing an impeachment resolution in October, when the congressman ultimately stopped short of offering it. \nGreen is not the only member of Congress who has drafted articles of impeachment, but he would be the first to trigger a vote on them. \nOnly three presidents have been impeached by the House, though none were removed from office. Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were acquitted by the Senate and Richard Nixon resigned before the House voted on his articles of impeachment. \nThe resolution has no real chance of advancing in the House. Republicans are likely to vote to set aside the motion. But that would still force Democrats to take a potentially troublesome position on a symbolic vote. \nA vote to table the motion would force Democrats to explain to restive liberals eager to see Trump removed from office why they did not support an attempt to do so. But if they vote against tabling the motion, they could be forced to explain to moderate and independent voters why they acted to impeach Trump before the investigations had concluded. \nHouse Democrats are \u201coverwhelmingly against\u201d bringing this motion to the floor at this time, a Democratic aide said on Tuesday. The aide said members had raised concerns about forcing an impeachment vote during caucus meetings on multiple occasions. \nIn his letter to colleagues, Green wrote: \u201cAs I have said before, this is not about Democrats, it is about democracy. It is not about Republicans, it is about the fate of our Republic. May everyone vote their conscience knowing that history will judge us all.\u201d Advertisements Rate this: This information is free, share with friends and family. \u2022 Reach More Than 50 Thousand Nigerians Daily, Advertise With Us, Call or Whatsapp +2347068326095", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "al green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard nixon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald j trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frederica wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlottesville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oval office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:36.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "436783d17e51b642498bf8a9648e118ff8f04b70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Elf93YO2XRQgs9_5MLxrGT2CA2XGXZu9sKV2oP5z5ErGUUYKA9cCMVBpJP.DDjQ5mMfGfDGUrSAy5EWR.7nzS", "site_full": "www.capecodtimes.com", "site": "capecodtimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.capecodtimes.com/obituaries?template=rss&mime=xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Obituaries - capecodtimes.com", "title": "Elmer F.

He is survived by his wife Sandra Dethlefsen, son Matthew Kevy; son Andrew Kevy and his wife Ana-Soria Kevy, and his two grandchildren Noah and Samuel. \nHe was born in Brooklyn, NY on November 16, 1928. He attended Hobart College and the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University. \nDr. Kevy was the Medical Director of Transfusion Services and Blood Bank at Children's Hospital Boston and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, from 1961 to 1999. His contributions to the field of transfusion medicine included: the development of the current blood bags for collection and storage of blood components, improvement of anticoagulants for platelet and red cell preservation, introduction of machines for platelet apheresis, and the use of in vitro gamma globulin for treating patients with multiple recurring infections. He authored more than 50 clinical and scientific papers. \nAfter retiring from Children's Hospital, Dr. Kevy was instrumental in initiating the field of regenerative medicine using growth factors in autologous platelet concentrates. He spent 15 years actively developing methods for harvesting autologous stem cells from blood and bone marrow and promoting their use for treatment of hard and soft tissue diseases. \nA memorial is being planned for a later date. Donations in his memory may be made to the Boston Children's Hospital Trust, 401 Park Drive, Suite 602E, Boston, MA 02115. For online guestbook & obituary, visit www.ccgfuneralhome.com.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko , who was banned for life from the Olympics this week, said Moscow would support Russian athletes who opt to compete at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics as neutrals.\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Tuesday banned the Russian team from the Games after evidence emerged of an \"unprecedented systematic manipulation\" of doping procedures but left the door open for Russians to compete as neutrals if they demonstrate they have a doping-free background.\n\"For us the athletes' interests have always been the priority,\" TASS news agency quoted Mutko as saying late on Wednesday.\n\"To participate in the Olympics is an athlete's right. We will respect it and provide full-fledged support.\"\nMutko's comments came hours after President Vladimir Putin said Russia would not prevent its athletes from competing in South Korea as neutrals.\nMutko, who served as sports minister at the time of the 2014 Sochi Games, remained tight-lipped about the decision to ban him from the Olympics.\n\"I don't want to assess the IOC's decision made regarding me,\" Mutko said. \"It's not the time to think of myself.\"\nRussian authorities have vehemently denied any state support for doping and pledged to cooperate with international sports authorities to counter the use of banned performance-enhancing drugs.\nIn the weeks ahead of Tuesday's IOC decision, more than 20 Russian athletes who competed at the Sochi Games were handed Olympic life bans for having allegedly violated anti-doping rules.\nThe bans came as the result of an IOC investigation into allegations of state-backed doping among Russian competitors and sample tampering by laboratory and security officials at Sochi.\nRussia's athletics federation, Paralympic Committee and anti-doping agency RUSADA remain suspended over doping scandals.\n\n(Reporting by Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber; Editing by John O'Brien)\n(This story has not been edited by economictimes.com and is auto\u2013generated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.) 0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "putin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mutko", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vitaly mutko", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john o'brien", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabrielle tetrault-farber", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "paralympic committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international olympic committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ioc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rusada", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyeongchang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sochi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:37.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "69bbb093dca708e648eecd63f59588aaac4d02b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gfBslnDni2K3hlBBE8RYBeI-", "site_full": "us.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/1011639/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Guild Recruitment - World of Warcraft Forums", "title": "935 Frost Mage LF new home", "title_full": "935 Frost Mage LF new home - World of Warcraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T10:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.691, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/wow.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "69bbb093dca708e648eecd63f59588aaac4d02b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gfBslnDni2K3hlBBE8RYBeI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Fantay", "published": "2017-12-07T10:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "935 Frost Mage LF new home", "text": "<Blue Raid Shoes> [US-Hyjal]-[H] is a newly formed raiding guild looking to build out our core raiding group to push Antorus progression.\nCurrently we are recruiting the following DPS classes in addition to healers:\nDeathknight: Medium Demon Hunter: Medium Druid (Feral): Medium Hunter: High Mage: High Paladin (Ret): High Rogue: Medium Shaman (Ele): Medium Warlock: High Warrior: Medium\nIf you are looking to get into mythic raiding, then do not hesitate to contact us; no experience is necessary.

Called fuller's earth, it's the same clay that some people smother on their skin as a beauty treatment. \n\nBut the metal scaffolding used so far is too heavy and rigid for the dome, said Bhuvan Vikrama, the superintending archaeologist from the Archaeological Survey of India. He said they're considering other options, including designing and constructing special bamboo scaffolding. \n\nHe said there's a precedent, after bamboo scaffolding was used on the dome in the early 1940s when some conservation work was carried out. \n\nVikrama said rain was enough to clean most of the Taj Mahal in the past but air pollution over the last 25 years had taken its toll. \n\n\"It became visibly clear it was all yellow,'' he said. ``It even started becoming black in the shaded areas not washed by rains.'' \n\nHe said work on the dome would likely take 10 months, starting next year and finishing in 2019. The makeover was costing a total of about $500,000. \n\nThe work has prompted Fodor's Travel guide to include the Taj Mahal on its list of places not to visit next year. \n\n\"Unless your dream Taj Mahal visit involves being photographed standing in front of a mud-caked and be-scaffolded dome, maybe give it until 2019 at the earliest,'' the guide recommends. \n\nVikrama disagrees, saying photographs from the 1940s with scaffolding on the dome are interesting and historically important. \n\n\"If the tourism even fluctuates, we should not bother about that,'' he said. ``Tourists should also appreciate they are witnessing the work going on, the right kind of efforts for the preservation of monuments.'' \n\nThe Taj Mahal typically attracts between 7 and 8 million visitors a year. Built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, people are attracted as much by the love story as the spectacular architecture. \n\n\"It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen,'' said Kent Scheibel, a tourist from Los Angeles who was visiting the site this week.\" It's a living, breathing thing that emanates the absolute beauty of the human spirit.'' 0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vikrama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shah jahan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kent scheibel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumtaz mahal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhuvan vikrama", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "taj mahal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fodor's travel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "agra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:37.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "25b0d183a4fa2e4b5ed8944c7f43c3e171a774e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWHWxXJT3jLbW2LG5as9Qe308UOP35_meIXg0K4AcngZFdxMw5qGjrMPZ_utZ0gKrM0H1NkbI48xaS6ZMtycLkiUc5zbxGijVqVnrvpOHhaBQxOyGrqjBTZGWCKAUCcn58", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/petpet/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "PetPet Diapers With Best Price At Lazada In Malaysia", "title": "Petpet Jumbo S58 (3 + 1 FREE packs)", "title_full": "Petpet Jumbo Pack S58 (3 + 1 FREE packs) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-06-12T01:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 227, "participants_count": 200, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "76cb6c436b2028382e409f5a1007e1086d0daf2d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWHWxXJT3jLbW2LG5as9Qe308UOP35_meIXg0K4AcngZFdxMw5qGjrMPZ_utZ0gKrM0H1NkbI48xaS6ZMtycLkiUc5zbxGijVqVnrvpOHhaBQxOyGrqjBTZGGkV7llydV0epq0tl9BmMo-", "ord_in_thread": 182, "author": "Md J.", "published": "2017-11-21T11:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Very good", "text": "Very good", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:37.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "25b0d183a4fa2e4b5ed8944c7f43c3e171a774e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWHWxXJT3jLbW2LG5as9Qe308UOP35_meIXg0K4AcngZFdxMw5qGjrMPZ_utZ0gKrM0H1NkbI48xaS6ZMtycLkiUc5zbxGijVqVnrvpOHhaBQxOyGrqjBTZGWCKAUCcn58", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/petpet/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "PetPet Diapers With Best Price At Lazada In Malaysia", "title": "Petpet Jumbo S58 (3 + 1 FREE packs)", "title_full": "Petpet Jumbo Pack S58 (3 + 1 FREE packs) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-06-12T01:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 227, "participants_count": 200, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8d572ac9c0c47bfcdec730898564f4fc4b368107", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWHWxXJT3jLbW2LG5as9Qe308UOP35_meIXg0K4AcngZFdxMw5qGjrMPZ_utZ0gKrM0H1NkbI48xaS6ZMtycLkiUc5zbxGijVqVnrvpOHhaBQxOyGrqjBTZEDXjZ6DjxhpSyDjx7Tlqow-", "ord_in_thread": 186, "author": "Grace G.", "published": "2017-11-22T04:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "Received in good", "text": "Received in good", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:37.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "73a48fbea022c0c6ba5f73d491cfa6c71dd58a33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSN40BfT_2buDa3gzwK3_.SgR_79VyOgpMBFwlyXHjNMWeqMxU7qUGjd6qBrLDmY.gtvqXJeUNEmnQsw7H4UaX7ZN.LcFYNpemCcvys8e13v4IDE5RJnyR6o0JSi_8mU5jy8usqXT6bFnRb3rIHi.RNKrCLFrAxkpLlMCZu1qP8.c4__V5eOe_w", "site_full": "forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com", "site": "kerbalspaceprogram.com", "site_section": "https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/32-ksp-discussion/", "site_categories": ["video_and_computer_games", "science", "adult", "space_astronomy", "hobbies_and_interests", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "KSP Discussion -

I write down the equation of the sphere (x^2+y^2+z^2=r(Planet)) and the equation of the inclined orbital ellipse, combine both into an equation system, solve it, select the solution appropriate for the orbital direction (because there are 2 crash points, depending on whether the spacecraft is orbiting clockwise or anticlockwise) and transfer it into spherical coordinates for latitude and longitude. Alternatively, I do the same but two-dimensionally (circle + ellipse equation) and break down the coordinates to account for inclination after calculating the crash site.\nA surface strike from below to the inside of the shell is always a strait line along the vector of travel.\nHere is the reason.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation\nThe net gravity acting inside of a shell is zero (r < R shell ). Consequently, there is a direction vector from the center. The crafts position is different from the center. In this case the inside radius is r'. Current position is x, y, z from center\nand velocity is dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt. Consequently r'= ((x 0 +t i dx/dt) 2 + (y 0 +t i dy/dt) 2 + (z 0 +t i dz/dt) 2 ) 1/2 where t i is the time of impact.\nPlease do your math homework yourself.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle":

That's the case for Lorod designers Lauren Rodriguez and Michael Freels who unveiled their brand's pre-fall 2018 collection at 163 Bank Street last night. \nFor this collection, the designers took inspiration from the American West, and the nostalgia associated with such references. Stylistic references from the 1950's rockability movement were also found in the collection and translated through with statement jackets and the usage of black in several pieces. \nHelping anchor the collection came a first-ever collaboration with Manolo Blahnik; where a pair of two-toned silhouettes - a radical sling-back kitten heel and complimentary closed-toed bootie - helped narrate the brand\u2019s evolution beyond daytime separates. Lorod takes inspiration from the American West for pre-fall 2018 collection \nWestern influence was seen in patchwork prairie skirts, hand knits and denim. Rodriguez and Freels took us on a journey throughout many decades of time, rather than taking the traditional approach most designers use of harkening back to one time period. \nAlthough the brand shows a lot of casual suiting, they don't consider themselves a workwear brand. Nor are the designers interested in trends, but, rather, they are more interested in fabrics, construction and casual tailoring. \nAs they continue to work on growing their business, Rodriguez and Freels feel they are evolving as designers, and their customers are as well. \"Two seasons ago, our customer was younger, now I think she's more sophisticated, she's wearing a wool suit, she's wearing Manolo's,\" Rodriguez said. \nEven though they admit they are facing the usual growing pains of any new business, they also see advantages to being a young brand. \"We get to work with other people who are really young, which is really positive. Then, we have brands like Manolo Blahnik who want to work with us, because they are excited about young brands because we have new ideas,\" Rodriguez said. \nIn terms of where they want to take their business next, they are in no rush to grow too quickly. Rather, they are taking the slow and steady approach. \"The track we're on is good, and it feels healthy and organic. Shoes are a big step for us, knitwear is a big step for us. We just relaunched e-commerce, and we're hoping that will be a good platform for us,\" Rodriguez said. \"Widening distribution is also important to us,\" Freels added. \nThey might be taking a cautious approach to growth, but it's a smart one. photos: courtesy of Purple PR", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

Persons, two drug rehabilitation centers, two theological schools, and the Fountain of Love Orphanage. At each stop, a leader has invited me to say words of encouragement and then offer prayer. \n\n\n\nI encouraged children to study hard, to give thanks for their teachers, and to make sure to take time to play. They are joyful signs of hope despite their circumstances, and I give thanks that natural ebullience has not been dampened. \nMore difficult to address, I encouraged drug addicts to have courage and trust that God is with them as they struggle toward health. I encouraged internally displaced persons\u2014a euphemism for those driven off their land by armed conflict or having their property confiscated\u2014to not lose hope, to remember their lives have dignity even though they have lost so much. It is a daunting task to offer encouragement that does not come across as glib or perfunctory. \n\n\nWhat should one then pray? How do I voice the cry of the IDP, the orphan, and the drug addict still in the throes of withdrawal? I asked God not to forsake them, to keep pouring the supply of the Spirit into their hearts. I prayed for the resilience that hope provides; I prayed for strength and courage for them as well as for those who care for them. It is a testimony to the faith of these Baptist ministers, Central graduates, that they practice frequent and fervent prayer as a part of larger comprehensive care. \n\n\n\nAs I witnessed more trauma and despair, I found my prayers becoming more urgent, more insistent, indeed, more demanding as I petitioned God to bring justice to these so easily forgotten, at least by the government, which provides so little in terms of social services. Yet, the churches have not forgotten them. Each of these ministries\u2014the IDP camp, the orphanage, and the rehab centers\u2014are expressions of their holistic care. The Kachin Baptist Convention helps support nine IDP camps, a costly endeavor, as there are hundreds of occupants in them. \n\n\nAmerican churches could learn much from these churches as they engage the most distressing needs in their communities. Compassion shapes these ministries, and they put considerable resources toward transformative initiatives. The mission of the church in Myanmar and the US is the same: to proclaim and live the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in the power of the Spirit, to the glory of God.
