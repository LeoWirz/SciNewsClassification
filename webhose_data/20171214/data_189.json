Danielle Olavario Senior Staff Writer \nKatelyn O\u2019Riordan is a jack of all trades. Having majored in physics in college, she has gone on to work in a myriad of other industries, including architecture and sportswear fashion. Today, she is a businesswoman. When   interviewed her in the Theo + George headquarters, she had just returned from Donegal. Around Christmas, the store opens up pop-up shops all over the country, and this time, they will also have an appearance in Trinity. From Thursday, December 7th to Saturday, December 9th, the Berkeley Library will play host to her start up, the Theo + George pop-up shop. \nTheo + George is a fashion brand that prioritises not only the comfort of the women who will wear its garments, it also makes sure that each material used in every design comes from a sustainable source. \u201cSustainability is really important to me,\u201d says O\u2019Riordan, and this is no empty statement. O\u2019Riordan is surrounded by environmental awareness, with her brother working in renewable energy, and she herself having worked in sporting company Burton Snowboards for nearly 10 years, where sustainability was a huge initiative. \u201cWith global warming, there will be no snow, and with no snow, there will be no industry\u201d, O\u2019Riordan explains. Having built her career surrounded by sustainability, it was inevitable that the concept would weave itself into the fabric of her start-up. \u201cWhen you look at the figures of what the fashion industry is doing to the environment, it just seems like a no-brainer. We have to actually make a stance.\u201d \nAlthough the brand was launched in 2014 as a locally sourced business, O\u2019Riordan is relaunching Theo + George with materials sourced from abroad. \u201cI spent pretty much a year travelling and meeting and talking to new companies\u201d, O\u2019Riordan says. When she was still sourcing from Ireland, she explains that she \u201cknew who made it, I knew where it came from, I knew that everyone is getting paid for what they were doing and that everything is [being] done right. So moving out of Ireland, I felt like it was much more important that that\u2019s the basis and the foundation of the business.\u201d This meticulousness is also present in O\u2019Riordan\u2019s designs. ADVERTISEMENT \nBecause the garments are designed to be the foundation of every woman\u2019s wardrobe, each piece is meticulously crafted. Every garment goes through a panel of testers before making it into the shop\u2019s website. One t-shirt, for example, took nearly a year to put together, with O\u2019Riordan paying close attention to details that other brands might overlook. In this case, the designer paid special attention to the weight of the fabric, making sure that the t-shirt is as flattering as possible on any woman who wears it. O\u2019Riordan herself wears the t-shirt everyday. \u201cFor us it\u2019s really about working with the woman\u2019s body and trying to make it as luxurious and comfortable as possible\u201d, O\u2019Riordan explains. \nWhen the brand first launched, it was as a brand of party wear. Today, O\u2019Riordan is going back to her roots as a sportswear designer, with movement and comfort a top priority of her designs. \u201cThis is the first collection I\u2019ve designed with myself as the main user\u201d, O\u2019Riordan explains. \u201cI just created a capsule wardrobe that I would wear everyday.\u201d Having two kids, she says that the previous collections she had done \u201cdidn\u2019t sit with [her] life effortlessly, and that\u2019s where Everyday Effortless came from\u201d. \nIn the future, O\u2019Riordan hopes that the shop will have a user experience. \u201cDown the line, I\u2019d say there will be something of a physical presence\u201d, O\u2019Riordan says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s what you would consider to be a traditional retail shop today\u201d. With her expertise and innovation, there\u2019s no doubt that this new venture will be a success.

Do you think that for elderly people the resistance for new technologies (e.g. smartphones) would be smaller if interfaces were designed differently - uniquely for them?\n\nI have quite huge experience, when it comes to creating software for elderly people and I participated in hackaton like that. After variety of applications and research I believe that not the user interface is a problem but using electronically devices itself. We have created super simple interface and when we tested it, by presenting to old lady, even before trying she did not want to use it. And the reason was because she never used laptop, tablet or smartphone. The problem is device itself not the design of our work.\n\n2. Have you ever done usability study before starting product development? How did the research look like?\n\nYes I did many times. I have read a lot of books, asked specialists, created paper mockup, created clickable user interface in proto.io. We spoke with final customer, and asked a lot of questions, as well as asking about expectations.\n\n3. Whenever you develop or design a system, do you have rather fuzzy or very specific idea of your end user?\n\nIt depend, mostly I focus on backend part and just to make everything work, then on front-end.

Do you think that for elderly people the resistance for new technologies (e.g. smartphones) would be smaller if interfaces were designed differently - uniquely for them?\n\nI have quite huge experience, when it comes to creating software for elderly people and I participated in hackaton like that. After variety of applications and research I believe that not the user interface is a problem but using electronically devices itself. We have created super simple interface and when we tested it, by presenting to old lady, even before trying she did not want to use it. And the reason was because she never used laptop, tablet or smartphone. The problem is device itself not the design of our work.\n\n2. Have you ever done usability study before starting product development? How did the research look like?\n\nYes I did many times. I have read a lot of books, asked specialists, created paper mockup, created clickable user interface in proto.io.

Davis is either grossly incompetent, or someone who struggles with the truth and treats MPs with contempt. Either way, he should be out of his job.\u201d \nFormer Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron called for \u201cDexit: an exit from the duplicity and dither of David Davis\u201d as he called for the removal of a minister who he said had \u201cmisled Parliament and \u2026 turned incompetence into an art form\u201d. \nAt least two MPs \u2013 Labour\u2019s David Lammy and the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart \u2013 approached Commons Speaker John Bercow to ask whether contempt proceedings could be triggered. \nJust raised a Point of Order with the Speaker after PMQs regarding David Davis misleading Parliament.

This is appalling. The UK is about to take the single biggest economic decision ever and the UK Gov have not analysed its impact. A complete dereliction of duty. \n\u2014 Tom Brake (@thomasbrake) December 6, 2017 \nPressed by committee chairman Hilary Benn whether any impact assessment had been conducted of the implications of Brexit for the automotive, aerospace or financial services sectors, Mr Davis said \u201cno\u201d to each, before cutting the Labour MP short, saying: \u201cI think the answer will be no to all of them.\u201d \nInstead, he said, officials will, \u201cat some stage\u201d during the forthcoming second phase of Brexit negotiations, conduct work to quantify the effects of different possible outcomes, such as a free trade agreement with the EU or moving to World Trade Organisation rules. \nAnd he told Mr Benn there was no \u201cformal quantitative\u201d assessment undertaken of the likely impact of leaving the customs union before the Government committed itself to the step. \n\u201cThere was a judgment made on qualitative things, not a quantitative one,\u201d he said. Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn chairs the Exiting the EU select committee (Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA) \nMr Benn described the decision not to conduct sectoral impact assessments as \u201crather strange\u201d. \nAnd he said it was \u201cquite extraordinary\u201d that no assessment was made of the impact of leaving the customs union \u201cgiven the momentous nature of that decision\u201d. \n\u201cYou have said there are no impact assessments,\u201d said Mr Benn. \n\u201cYou were hoping that, at the October (European) Council, the door would be open to phase two of the negotiations, where the question would be asked \u2018What does the UK Government want?\u2019 \n\u201cAre you actually telling us that the Government hadn\u2019t at that point \u2013 and still hasn\u2019t \u2013 undertaken the assessment?\u201d David Davis gives evidence (PA) \nMr Davis told the committee: \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of economic models because they have all proven wrong. \n\u201cWhen you have a paradigm change \u2013 as happened in 2008 with the financial crisis \u2013 all the models were wrong. The Queen famously asked why did we not know. \n\u201cSimilarly, what we are dealing with here in every outcome \u2013 whether it is a free trade agreement, whether it is a WTO outcome or whether it is something between that on the spectrum \u2013 it is a paradigm change. \n\u201cWe know not the size, but the order of magnitude of the impact.\u201d \nHe told the committee he had tried to provide \u201cthe closest we could\u201d to what the House of Commons had demanded, subject to his responsibility not to release information which was commercially secret, market sensitive or liable to undermine the UK\u2019s negotiating position.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caroline lucas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hilary benn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom brake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuka umunna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim farron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel leal-olivas/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david lammy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pete wishart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john bercow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seema malhotra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "european) council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of commons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world trade organisation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "whitehall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green party", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:51.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ba0a72e1096ba2a0c526a71b0c04b8da6f5ed0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTKE3QmNveSUyz11rsAuhFBE8q0Koc6oO0Av.QBFL7oVrqDQEQZsCbm.Q6wIMY300NOBFnQFkmA6.SaeNfbtKMw.xlLbP2msDE-", "site_full": "saltlakecity.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://saltlakecity.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist salt lake | personals search", "title": "Party fun gurl (S.l.ut.)", "title_full": "Party fun gurl (S.l.ut.)", "published": "2017-12-07T09:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/01111_dJE3zJzTgY5_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6ba0a72e1096ba2a0c526a71b0c04b8da6f5ed0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTKE3QmNveSUyz11rsAuhFBE8q0Koc6oO0Av.QBFL7oVrqDQEQZsCbm.Q6wIMY300NOBFnQFkmA6.SaeNfbtKMw.xlLbP2msDE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "Party fun gurl (S.l.ut.)", "text": "age: 35   im 35 year old cd blond blue 5'8\" 140 lbs smooth fem body looking.

Do you think that for elderly people the resistance for new technologies (e.g. smartphones) would be smaller if interfaces were designed differently - uniquely for them?\n\nI have quite huge experience, when it comes to creating software for elderly people and I participated in hackaton like that. After variety of applications and research I believe that not the user interface is a problem but using electronically devices itself. We have created super simple interface and when we tested it, by presenting to old lady, even before trying she did not want to use it. And the reason was because she never used laptop, tablet or smartphone. The problem is device itself not the design of our work.\n\n2. Have you ever done usability study before starting product development? How did the research look like?\n\nYes I did many times. I have read a lot of books, asked specialists, created paper mockup, created clickable user interface in proto.io. We spoke with final customer, and asked a lot of questions, as well as asking about expectations.\n\n3. Whenever you develop or design a system, do you have rather fuzzy or very specific idea of your end user?\n\nIt depend, mostly I focus on backend part and just to make everything work, then on front-end.

One reason is that my priorities are elsewhere at the moment. The Roman Catholic Church is in crisis. This demands attention from the faithful with much praying, fasting and other pious works. Things have recently come to a head with the official promulgation of heretical directives from \u2018Pope\u2019 Francis. Click here for an excellent summary of the situation with links to relevant articles. \nHere are some more explanatory comments which were written in response to one of the more deluded articles . They are re-published here with the permission of the writer (Opacus): \nThe problem does not arise from Pope Francis having made his teaching magisterial but merely from his having attempted to make it so whether or not the attempt was actually a success. If anyone is a pope and invokes papal authority for a teaching then we are required to submit our intellect to it. So, by the most elementary application of logical rules, if we\u2019re not required to submit our intellect to it then either it has not been has not been taught with an invocation of papal authority or it has not been taught by a pope. Since the teaching that those in an objective state of grave sin can sometimes be admitted to Holy Communion has now been taught with an invocation of papal authority it follows inescapably that if we\u2019re not required to submit to it then the invocation cannot have been made by a genuine pope. So if we accept your argument that we are, indeed, not required to submit to that teaching because it contradicts previous settled teaching on the matter, then it follows that we have to conclude that Pope Francis is not a genuine pope whether or not we have a good explanation for how that is possible e.g. loss of office due to public heresy, electoral invalidity or whatever. Nor can one wriggle out of this by claiming that only a pope can invoke papal authority. Such invocations are purely a linguistic matter and can be made by anybody. What differs about a genuine pope is not his ability to make such invocations but his ability to do so successfully. Neither does it matter that Pope Francis has explicitly said in Amoris Laetitia that he is not changing the rules. Indeed he isn\u2019t, he\u2019s just prefacing them with a disclaimer that \u2018these are all rules of thumb, subject to exceptions in complex situations\u2019. It is not as if he thinks it is important to change the rules anyway because they\u2019re just rules and only a rigid Pharisee thinks they are ever exceptionless or pays much attention to them! So isn\u2019t it about time that you accepted that what you previously agreed about Ultramontanists \u2013 that their position is no longer tenable unless Pope Francis\u2019s teachings are not genuinely papal \u2013 now applies to traditional Catholics in general? Catholic theology does not rule out Sedevacantism so it is difficult to see why so many traditional Catholics, who loudly insist that modernists should bow to the dictates of logic, are implacably opposed to accepting its demands when it points in that direction. \nSedevacantism is the belief that there is no current pope. The term comes from the Latin phrase \u2018sede vacante\u2019 meaning \u2018the seat being vacant.\u2019 Nowadays the term most commonly refers to those Catholics who believe that we haven\u2019t had a valid Pope since Pius XII or John XXIII. However, it can apply to anyone, e.g. an Orthodox Christian, who believes in the papacy but does not believe we have a current Pope. \nOpacus writes the following in response to a comment that starts \u201cDear Sedes and Sede sympathizers, what exactly has Sedevacantism to offer? Doesn\u2019t Fr. Cekada choose which liturgical laws of Pope Pius XII he would like to obey or rather disobey?\u2026\u201d: \n\u2026what Sedevacantism has to offer is that it correctly says that the following is a valid argument: \n(1) If anyone is a genuine pope and has invoked papal authority for a teaching then a Catholic is bound to submit to it, \n(2) No Catholic is obliged to submit to the teaching of Amoris Laetitia on admission to Holy Communion for those in a state of objective grave sin, \n(3) Jorge Bergoglio has invoked papal authority for that teaching of Amoris Laetitia, \n(4) So Jorge Bergoglio is not a genuine pope. \nOne can only dissent from (4) by denying at least one of (1), (2) and (3). To his credit Dr. Shaw has gone for the jugular and denied (1). According to him a rational Catholic, given the choice of believing either that Jorge Bergoglio is a genuine pope or that we are bound to submit to papal teachings for which papal authority has been invoked, but not both, is bound to plump for the former and not the latter. What is more, he thinks that this is traditional Catholicism despite the tradition behind Canon 752 and various past papal statements to the same effect. Indeed, only an insane Ultramontanist would think otherwise! I must say that is news to me! Anyway, if you want to disagree with (4) you also have to say which of (1), (2) and (3) is or are wrong. You cannot avoid this issue by lumping together all the theological opinions of those various parties who describe themselves as \u2018Sedevacantists\u2019 and exclaiming \u2018how is it possible to believe all that?\u2019. You have merely constructed a straw man. While Fr. Cekada is well able to defend himself, nobody who accepts (4) is thereby committed to accepting his contention that there have been no popes since Pius XII. That would take extensive further argumentation. Somebody, rather, who merely accepts the argument from (1), (2), (3) and (4) might well be a short-term Novus Ordo Sedevacantist or a very-long-term Orthodox Sedevacantist and be entirely untroubled by your straw man. So at the moment you are attempting merely to throw dust in everyone\u2019s eyes and ignore the point at issue. Please tell us instead, as Dr. Shaw has, which of (1), (2) and (3) you reject so that you can deny (4).

The work of sharing God\u2019s good news with children was expanding.\u201d Olivia Yousaf presents the Queen with a posy (Victoria Jones/PA) \nThe bishop went on to say about the work of the Scripture Union: \u201cHelping children, young people and adults encounter the God who is love in Jesus, has always meant helping people read or listen to, meditate on and respond to, the scriptures. \n\u201cIt is never meant about knowing the bible better, it is always about knowing the God of the bible better, through reading and studying it.\u201d \nThe congregation were entertained by a performance dramatising the organisation\u2019s history and heard a new hymn, God of Unchanging Grace, by the prolific hymn writer Bishop Timothy Dudley-Smith. \nThe Queen, who has a strong faith which she often reflects upon in her annual Christmas address to the nation and Commonwealth, sat at the head of the congregation. \nThe Rev Tim Hastie-Smith, national director of the Scripture Union, said: \u201cIt was absolutely brilliant the Queen was able to join us, the fact that she found the time to be with us this afternoon, with a whole load of children and people celebrating God\u2019s love, is an incredible thrill.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baroness floella benjamin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olivia yousaf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rev tim hastie-smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bishop timothy dudley-smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "queen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria jones/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josiah spiers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas hughes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josiah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katherine jenkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul butler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "st mary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scripture union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commonwealth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "children\u2019s special service mission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st mary\u2019s church", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "islington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "durham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "llandudno", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:53.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "73906ca3fba1625114e0fc9a6c4cb8efb8a8b7c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl5sBfL4DnntL69iIlWON5YvNVJD1cyW6atF9wYI6SyXP_LD4C3sv.R5CT2manguwFoN.FrfWyvyC9QdnchkkdD5KLnhQl3sFFw--", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "Agents of [The Division] -

I say this so you know my next statement comes from a place of love and not hate.\nIn these types of games you should not, in any way, incentivize PvP or to be more accurate killing players. You don't need to. The number of players who will still hunt other players (even if they were penalized for it) is just big enough to make places like the DZ exciting. You want tension in a place like the DZ not full on deathmatches. You should be making a place like the DZ very, very tempting to PvEers. You should reward teamwork. Cause I promise you, you do not need to do anything to encourage PKers. Hell you could literally design a system in which PKers lose XP/levels and there will still be PKers.\nNow granted I know things have changed quite a bit of The Division and the DZ is (IMHO) pretty fine now. My statement is more a general piece of advice for games like this as opposed to a direct critique.\nIn other news, for those who don't have the DLC, all three will be free to play this weekend.

After variety of applications and research I believe that not the user interface is a problem but using electronically devices itself. We have created super simple interface and when we tested it, by presenting to old lady, even before trying she did not want to use it. And the reason was because she never used laptop, tablet or smartphone. The problem is device itself not the design of our work.\n\n2. Have you ever done usability study before starting product development? How did the research look like?\n\nYes I did many times. I have read a lot of books, asked specialists, created paper mockup, created clickable user interface in proto.io. We spoke with final customer, and asked a lot of questions, as well as asking about expectations.\n\n3.

The statement further stated that \u201cIn the records of the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development and the Nigerian Mining Cadastre Office (MCO), the BUA Group, does not have a mining lease over the contentious site No. 2541ML. Therefore, its mining activities there are illegal.\u201d It stated that \u201cThe Ministry stands by the Stop Work Order issued to the BUA Group and signed by the Permanent Secretary, dated 17th October 2017. \u201cThe letter was issued after  thorough investigation confirmed that the BUA Group was indeed engaging in illegal mining of marble/limestone at a mine pit located on Geographical Coordinates N070 21\u2019 47.4\u201d E0060 26\u2019 51.8\u2019, while the Run-of-Mine (ROM) is stockpiled at an area with geographical coordinates N070 21\u2019 48.4\u201d; E0060 26\u201937.2\u201dit read The statement further revealed that clarification provided by the Mining Cadastre Office shows that the coordinates of the Mine pit and ROM stockpile area fall wholly within the area of mining Lease No 2541ML belonging to Messrs Dangote Industries Limited. The statement recalled that the Ministry had earlier in 2015 issued a Stop Work Order on this same disputed site but the BUA Group disregarded the order and went ahead with its illegal mining activities, under heavy cover of armed soldiers, policemen and men of the Civil Defence Corps. \u201cThe management of BUA also resisted the enforcement of the latest Stop Work Order issued on October 17th , 2017 using a combination of armed militia, soldiers and policemen to obstruct the team from the ministry in effecting the Stop Work Order,\u201d it said. While BUA Group in its publication admitted the fact that a suit over the ownership of the site was pending in a court of competent jurisdiction, the Group, however continued with its illegal mining activities on the site, which in itself is subjudice to both the court and the Mining Act 2007, which guides mining activities in the country. The statement maintained that \u201cWhile the Ministry restates its commitment to promoting local and global investments in the Nigerian mining sector, it has always maintained that due process must be followed, especially in line with the provisions of the Minerals and Mining Act 2007. This, we shall not compromise. It added that \u201cWhile the Ministry does not intend to join issues with the BUA Group which has an enviable history of industrial performance, we deem it appropriate, however, to state the facts for the purpose of enlightening members of the public\u201d However, BUA Group, according to a statement signed by the Group Head, Corporate Communications, BUA Group, O\u2019tega Ogra, said: \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, BUA as a law abiding entity restricts its Obu Cement operations to mining areas covered by ML18912 and ML18913 and located in Obu Okpella, Etsako LG, Edo State. \u2018\u2018We do not have any mining activities which is specifically in OKENE, Kogi State as the ministry insinuated and as stated in the ML2541 lease given by the ministry to a competitor. (See attached, all leases and our open letter to the President). \u2018\u2018The High Court sitting in Benin asked all parties to the suits before it, including the ministry which is a part to the suit, to maintain the status quo which their spurious stop work order sought to overturn. We are therefore determined, as good corporate citizens, to follow the dictates of the court and not make further pronouncements on the issue lest we seen to be in contempt of the court. We also advise media houses to be aware of this order of the court.\u2019\u2019 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abdulsamad rabiu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammadu buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed abass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o\u2019tega ogra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mines ministry replies bua group over claim of sabotage the ministry of mines and steel development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bua cement", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corporate communications", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "messrs dangote industries limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "civil defence corps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bua group abdulsamad rabiu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mining cadastre office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stop work order", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sabotaging operations of bua cement", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "group head", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dangote group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "etsako lg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of mines and steel development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bua group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the high court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "benin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obu okpella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "okene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kogi state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edo state", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:54.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc2bb33f094943ef0fd8239bb855ba956bc0b435", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUDK9xNxIpVb.V8UFYOfkcQzNU2wTJqrjMRVclf9g.g.qSb1QBe52SBFvLOkGH.YxWtGZaD1RrAxEUhmq6pykOsDGML46Xyke4TvgV_rXX1y2eXPvE0FGdbwox2rqqSeUA--", "site_full": "www.expedia.ca", "site": "expedia.ca", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.ca/Harbourfront-Hotels.d6005298.Travel-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Top 10 Harbourfront Hotels: Cheap Hotel Deals from C$140 | Expedia.ca", "title": "Park Inn by Radisson Toronto Airport West, ON:", "title_full": "Park Inn by Radisson Toronto Airport West, ON: 2017 Pictures, Reviews, Prices & Deals | Expedia.ca", "published": "2017-10-30T21:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6618, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b253c89d9f3546833db973e5ccc74d65ff2afcbd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUDK9xNxIpVb.V8UFYOfkcQzNU2wTJqrjMRVclf9g.g.qSb1QBe52SBFvLOkGH.YxWtGZaD1RrAxEUhmq6pykOsDGML46Xyke4TvgV_rXX1y2eXPvE0FGdbOc7yvXv79M8ThTj7Y4_0M4X6sylWvQe8xX56OB5CjPw--", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-07T14:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The clerk at the front desk was soo nice and friendly.

Contrast material was injected into the urethra. There is no evidence of leakage of the contrast material from the urethra or urinary bladder.
