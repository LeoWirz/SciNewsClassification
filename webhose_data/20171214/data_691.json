The group is also pushing a second question aimed at guaranteeing paid family leave for all workers in the state.\nBarbara Fisher, a Boston resident who makes $11 an hour and a backer of the minimum wage question, said the group is sending \"a powerful message to our elected officials. It's time for them to pass $15 and paid leave, because we're prepared to take this debate straight to the voters.\"\nThe sales tax question, backed by the Retailers Association of Massachusetts, would lower the tax from 6.25 percent to 5 percent. The question would also require the state to designate a weekend in August of each year as a sales-tax free weekend for most items.\nAnother proposal backed by the Massachusetts Nurses Association would require hospitals to adhere to strict nurse-to-patient staffing ratios.\nThe group says the question would increase patient safety by setting a maximum limit on the number of patients assigned to a nurse at any one time. The Massachusetts Health & Hospital Association, which represents 78 hospitals, opposes the question saying it will drive up costs.\nAnother proposed question would create a change to the state constitution to permit Massachusetts to exclude abortion services from state-funded health care. Yet another would create a commission to recommend amendments to the U.S. Constitution to establish that \"corporations do not have the same constitutional rights as human beings and that campaign contributions and expenditures may be regulated.\"\nThe Legislature has until the end of June 2018 to act on any of the proposed questions. If they fail to take action, supporters of the ballot question proponents must collect another nearly 11,000 signatures to guarantee their question secures a spot on the November 2018 ballot.\nOne proposed question that won't be heading to the ballot would have required presidential candidates to release their tax returns from the prior six years. Supporters failed to turn in the needed signatures.\nBut the issue may not be dead. There's a similar bill before state lawmakers that would force candidates for president to turn over a certified copy of their federal income tax returns for the three most recent years to get on the state's presidential primary ballot.\nBoth were reactions to Republican President Donald Trump's refusal to publicly release his tax returns during the 2016 election.\nMassachusetts voters will also be asked on next year's ballot if they want to repeal a 2016 state law barring discrimination on the basis of gender identity in public accommodations.\nOpponents of the law, led by the Massachusetts Family Institute, said they were told last year they had submitted enough voter signatures to put the recall effort on the 2018 ballot.\nThe law allows transgender people to use bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond to their gender identity.\nAlso heading to the 2018 ballot is a proposed \"millionaire tax\" that would impose a 4 percent surtax, on top of the state's regular income tax, on any portion of an individual's annual income that exceeds $1 million.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barbara fisher", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "retailers association of massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts family institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts nurses association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "legislature", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts health & hospital association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:58.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b0e0cd0e3e3a6adfdb19b2a135235bf7d4d3cbee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT1Y0eZZDiZrF7QIgIIuZ5_0_oan0YCkH12uplez1rW5zSmSrMCMGNDKW5zlhJfJ6i.uICleHKn7g--", "site_full": "www.looktothestars.org", "site": "looktothestars.org", "site_section": "http://www.looktothestars.org/feed/rss20.xml", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Look To The Stars News: Latest", "title": "Spotlight: Fisher House Foundation's Celebrity Supporters", "title_full": "Spotlight: Fisher House Foundation's Celebrity Supporters", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/6064-fisher-house-foundation/story_half_width.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b0e0cd0e3e3a6adfdb19b2a135235bf7d4d3cbee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT1Y0eZZDiZrF7QIgIIuZ5_0_oan0YCkH12uplez1rW5zSmSrMCMGNDKW5zlhJfJ6i.uICleHKn7g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Spotlight: Fisher House Foundation's Celebrity Supporters", "text": "Fisher House Foundation Celebrity Supporters & Events \nFisher House Foundation is best known for the network of comfort homes built on the grounds of major military and VA medical centers. The Fisher Houses are 5,000 to 16,800 square-foot homes, donated to the military and Department of Veterans Affairs, where families can stay while a loved one is receiving treatment. Additionally, the Foundation ensures that families of service men and women wounded in Iraq or Afghanistan are not burdened with unnecessary expense during a time of crisis. \nLocated in close proximity to the medical center or hospital it serves, each Fisher House consists of between 8 and 21 suites, with private bedrooms and baths. Families share a common kitchen, laundry facilities, spacious dining room and an inviting living room with a library and toys for children. Fisher House Foundation ensures that there is no fee to stay in a Fisher House. Since inception, the program has saved military and veteran families an estimated $165 million in out of pocket costs for lodging and transportation. \nFisher House Foundation operates the Hero Miles Program, using donated frequent flyer miles to bring family members to the bedside of injured service members. To date, Hero Miles has provided over 25,000 airline tickets to our military and their families. The Foundation also manages a grant program that supports other military charities and scholarship funds for military children, spouses and children of fallen and disabled veterans.

The stale or frightening depictions of God in stained glass and Renaissance paintings have convinced us that He is distant, quick to anger, or disinterested. Nothing could be further from the truth; the Psalms remind us that He is caring, close, and listening (e.g., Pss 22; 23; 26 ), and He yearns for a relationship with us. Sometimes it helps to hear the words of others who have struggled with the same thing. Jeremiah provides us with such an example. He remarks, \u201cYou will be in the right, O Yahweh, when I complain to you. Even so, let me speak my claims with you. Why does the way of the wicked succeed? All those who deal treacherously with treachery are at ease\u201d ( Jer 12:1 ). Jeremiah knows that Yahweh is right in all He does, but this does not prevent him from freely expressing his concerns. \nIf we really look into our hearts, we may find that fear is preventing us from entering into an intimate relationship with Him. We\u2019re afraid of what He will say; we\u2019re concerned that He may rebuke us. Indeed, this is what He does when Jeremiah speaks to Him: \u201cIf you run with foot soldiers and they have made you weary, then how will you compete with horses? If you have fallen in a peaceful land, then how will you do in the thickets of the Jordan? For even your relatives, and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you, even they call loudly after you. You must not trust in them, though they speak kindly to you\u201d ( Jer 12:5\u20136 ). Yet within this rebuke, we also find advice\u2014and the advice is comforting. By openly communicating his concerns to God, Jeremiah now knows what he must do. He knows how he must act. \nThere is joy to be found in knowing that we have a God who listens\u2014a God who is not offended when we speak to Him but is eager for our company. What are we afraid of? After all, He already knows what\u2019s on our minds. We need to grasp the idea that God is all about relationship. \nWhat would change about your life if you went deeper into your relationship with Christ? What should you be asking God right now? \nJOHN D. BARRY \nEZC O Lord, if I dispute with thee, thou art righteous: yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments: wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? why are all they in wealth that rebelliously transgress? Thou hast planted them, and they have taken root: they grow, and bring forth fruit, thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins. But thou, Lord, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter. How long shalt he land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds because they said, He will not see our last end. If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou match thyself with horses? and if thou thoughtest thyself safe in a peaceable land, what wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan? For even thy brethren and the house of thy father, even they have dealth unfaithfully with thee, and they have cried out altogether upon thee: but believe them not, though they speak fair to thee. I have forsaken mine house: I have left mine heritage: i have given the dearly beloved of my soul in to the hands of her enemies. Mine heritage is unto me, as a lion in the forest: it crieth out against me, therefore have I hated it. Shall mine heritage be unto me, as a bird of divers colors? are not the birds about her, saying , Come, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to eat her? Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, and trodden my portion under foot: of my pleasant portion they have made a desolate wilderness. They have laid it waste, and it, being waste mourneth unto me, and the whole land lieth waste, because no man setteth his mind on it. The destroyers are come upon all the high places in the wilderness: for the sword of the lord shall devour from the one end of the land, even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace. They have sown wheat, and reaped thorns: they were sick, and had no profit: and they were ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce wrath of the Lord. Thus saith the lord against all mine evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance, which I have caused my people Israel to inherit, Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out of the house of Judah from among them. And after that I have plucked them out, I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring again every man to his heritage, and every man to his land. And if they will learn the ways of my people, to swear by my Name, (The Lod liveth, as they taught my people to swear by Baal) then shall they be built in the midst of my people. But if they will not obey, then will I utterly pluck up, and destroy that nation, saith the Lord. Thus saith the Lord unto me, Go, and buy thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water. So I bought the girdle according to the commandment of the Lord, and put it upon my loins. And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time, saying, Take the girdle that thou hast bought, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go toward Perath, and hide it there in the cleft of the rock. So I went, and hid it by Perath, as the Lord had commanded me. And after many days the Lord said unto me. Arise, go toward Perath, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there. Then went I to Perath, and dug, and took the girdle from the place wheer I had hid it, and behold, the girdle was corrupt, and was profitable for nothing. Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Thus saith the Lord, After this manner will I destroy the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem. This wicked people have refused to hear my word, and walk after the stubbornness of their own heart, and walk after other gods to serve them, and to worship them,: therefore they shall be as this girdle, which is profitable to nothing. For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I tied to me the whole house of Israel, and the whole house of Judah, saith the Lord, that they might be my people: that they might have a name, and praise, and glory, but they would not hear. Therefore thou shalt say unto them this word, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine,and they shall say unto thee, do we not know that every bottle shall be filled with wine? Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord, BEhold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon the throne of David, and the Priests and the Prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with drunkenness. And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the Lord: I will not spare, I will not pity, nor have compassion, but destroy tem Hear and give ear, be not proud: for the Lord hath spoken it. Give glory to the Lord your God before he bring darkness, and or ever your feet stumble in the dark mountains, and while you look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death and make it as darkness. But if ye will not hear this, my soul shall weep in secret for your pride, and mine eye shall weep and drop down tears, because the Lord\u2019s flock is carried away captive. Say unto the King and to the Queen: Humble yourselves, sit down, for the crown of your glory shall come down from your heads. The cities of the South shall be shut up, and no man shall open them: all Judah shall be carried away captive: it shall be wholly carried away captive: Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the North: where is the flock that was given thee, even thy beautiful flock? What wilt thou say when he shall visit thee? for thou hast taught them to be captains and as chief over thee) shall not sorrow take thee as a woman in travail? And if thou say n thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the multitude of thine iniquities are thy skirts discovered and thy heels made bare. Can the black Moor change his skin? or the leopard his spots, then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil? Therefore will I scatter them , as the stubble that is taken away with the South wind. This is thy portion, and the part of thy measures form me, saith the Lord, because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in lies. Therefore I have also discovered thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear. I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the filthiness of thy whoredom on the hills in the fields, and thine abominations. [Woe] unto thee, O Jerusalem: wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be ? Jeremiah 12:1\u201313:27 Wherefore, thou I be very bold in Christ to command thee that which is convenient, Yet for love\u2019s sake I rather beseech thee, though I be as I am, even Paul aged, and even now a prison for Jesus Christ. I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Which in times past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable both to thee and to me. Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is mine own bowels, Whom I would have received with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the Gospel. But without thy mind would I do nothing, that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. It may be that he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him forever. Not now as a servant, but above a servant, even as a brother beloved, specially to me: how much more then unto thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord? If therefore thou count our things common, receive him as myself. If he hath hurt thee, or oweth thee ought, that put on my accounts. I Paul have written this with mine own hand: I will recompense it, albeit I do not say to thee, that thou owest moreover unto me even thine own self. Yea, brother, let me obtain this pleasure f thee n the Lord: comfort my bowels in the Lord. Trusting in thine obedience, I wrote unto thee knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say. Moreover also prepare my lodging: for I trust through your prayers I shall be freely given unto you. There salute thee Epaphras my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow helpers. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, Amen . Philemon 1:8\u201325 T he foolish will believe everything: but the prudent will consider his steps. A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil, but a fool rageth, and is careless. He that is hasty to anger, commiteth folly, and a busybody is hated. The foolish do inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. The evil shall bow before the good, and the wicked at th gates of the righteous. The poor is hated even of his own neighbor: but the fries of the rich are many. The sinner despiseth his neighbor: but he that hath mercy on the poor, is blessed. Do not they err that imagine evil? but to them that think on good things, shall be mercy and truth. In all labor there is abundance: but the talk of the lips bringeth only want. The crown of the wise is their riches , and the folly of fools is foolishness . A faithful witness delivereth souls: but a deceiver speaketh lies . In the fear of the Lord is an assured strength, and his children shall have hope. The fear of the Lord is as a wellspring of life, to avoid the snares of death. In the multitude of the people is the honor of a King , and for the want of people cometh the destruction of the Prince. He that oppresseth the poor, reproveth him that made him: but he honoreth him, that hath mercy on the poor. The wicked shall be cast away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death. Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding, and is known in the midst of fools. Justice exalteth a nation, but sin is a shame to the people. The pleasure of a King is in a wise servant: but his wrath shall be toward him that is lewd .

Ken is a UCLA Anderson business school alumnus and currently resides in the Los Angeles area. \nLOS ANGELES (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nA reliable investment portfolio can be built around accumulating tax-exempt bonds for stability of principal and tax-free interest income. In addition, a portion of everyone\u2019s nest egg should be allocated in stock market equity exposure for complimentary growth of principal. This news release is an update of just such a possible portfolio as described by Ken Van Wagenen, an investment professional with some 30 years of experience in the Los Angeles area. \nThere are many ways to accomplish a balanced portfolio and often the question comes to an efficiency formula to minimize costs and maximize returns over the long haul. It is easy to buy exchange traded funds for maximum diversification, but the real returns are found by sourcing the correct equity in companies themselves. Becoming a part owner, and watching good business management grow those companies can be a rewarding experience. Oftentimes even the best companies \u201cstub their toe\u201d and temporarily underperform. These missteps are often the best opportunity to buy and hold as management corrects the course and returns to traditional upward profits and stock price momentum. This was true over the past decade when financial stocks and big money center banks were crippled during the housing crises of 2008-2009. The returns gained from such positions have been staggering. Ken Van Wagenen of Los Angeles believes the banking sector has more \u201croom to run\u201d as interest rates finally normalize and lending banks can increase loan rates and their profit margin \u201cspreads\u201d expand. \nSince the 2016 presidential election, we have noticed numerous successive all time highs in stock market performance. We have also seen the 60 day volatility for stock markets slip to below that of bonds for the first time this year. The US Treasury Bond yield curve has continued to flatten. This flattening means that the longer dated maturities return progressively less than expected for the additional risk associated with buying maturities far into the future. This yield curve anomaly typically anticipates a future sluggish economy. European high yield \u201cjunk bond\u201d debt has slipped to below 3% for the first time in 2017. It would seem everywhere we look there are \u201cbubbles\u201d in the various markets. The most pronounced run up in value can be found in the crypto currencies such as Bitcoin. This virtual currency has had a staggering tenfold rise in value in 2017 and recently broke $10,000 for the first time. \nPrudent money management dictates a focus on the higher quality names as a hedge against the certain correction that will follow in the near future. The high quality \u201cblue chip\u201d names are those that hold their value much better than marginal, more highly leveraged, equity positions in a market correction. Additionally, most blue chip large cap equities have generous yields when compared to market interest rates. When asked for advice, Ken Van Wagenen said, \"I encourage all investors to maintain equity exposure, but do not chase those investments that look 'cheap' and have not participated in the recent market uptrend.\" For this reason, Mr. Van Wagenen suggested investors consider holding and adding cautiously to such names as: Amgen, Apple, Bank of America, Caterpillar, Citigroup, Costco, Facebook, Home Depot, Netflix, Oracle, Priceline, and Raytheon. \nAlthough not all of these \u201cMagic 12\u201d stocks have generous dividends, many do offer dividend distributions that help compensate for patience in your investment holding horizon. Never forget to include a significant investment in the tax-free municipal bond market. These high quality loans with very low default rates routinely have returns exceeding that of taxable government bonds and high-grade corporate issues. \nAlthough the anticipated tax overhaul is being sold as meaningful, it appears now to have a moderated positive bias. The main benefits are chiefly based upon the notion of simplicity to individual taxpayers. Those few earning significant income and paying heavy income taxes are losing tax deductions historically relied upon. The closing of such deduction \u201cloopholes\u201d compensates to a great extent for any cut in marginal tax rates. Congress cannot seem to internalize growth in the economic \u201cpie\u201d therefore they have reduced the positive impact of a tax cut by insisting that the cut must be \u201cpaid for\u201d by reducing or eliminating tax deductions. It would be preferable to shrink the size of government and benefit from an expanding economy. The real upside momentum still may come from the corporate tax cuts which will hopefully provide meaningful momentum to business hiring and profitability in 2018. \nKen Van Wagenen anticipates 2018 to be another strong year. Barring political instability, there should be a few insignificant corrections as is expected in a growing economy and a \u201ctoppy\u201d volatile marketplace. Mr. Van Wagenen encourages the savvy investor to stay invested and disciplined and watch your portfolio grow. \nMr. Van Wagenen\u2019s opinions are his own and do not represent solicitations or recommendations to buy or sell. All investments should be transacted with the input from a competent investment professional familiar with your particular investment horizon, situation and risk tolerance. \nMore about Ken: Ken Van Wagenen currently resides in Los Angeles, California as a retired investor.

The state-of-the-art turf field was put in by Mid-America Sports Construction, a certified AstroTurf installer. \nWARRENSBURG, Mo. (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nThe Mules raced out to a fast start this year with the help of the newest member of the football team. The University of Central Missouri\u2019s Walton Stadium received brand new, cutting edge athletic turf this summer from AstroTurf\u00ae. The state-of-the-art turf field was put in by Mid-America Sports Construction, a certified AstroTurf installer. \nWalton Stadium at Kennedy Field now features AstroTurf\u2019s RootZone 3D3 Blend synthetic turf system. The RootZone 3D3 Blend is a premium product that combines slit film and monofilament fibers for optimum durability and structural integrity. It is highlighted by AstroTurf\u2019s patented RootZone sub-layer, a texturized fiber that stabilizes infill and improves shock absorbency. The new stadium turf combines exceptional performance with game day good looks, as double alternating panels give the field an eye-popping design. \n\u201cWhen it came time to replace the artificial turf at Walton Stadium, we wanted to get the best product possible,\u201d said Scott Thomason, the assistant athletic director of facilities. \u201cAstroTurf and their partners enabled us to put in an incredible field, stress-free, in plenty of time for opening kickoff. Their continued excellence in customer service and support separates AstroTurf from their competitors.\u201d \nCentral Missouri\u2019s procurement of the brand new football field was made possible by AstroTurf\u2019s association with National IPA. National IPA is the nation\u2019s leading cooperative purchasing organization. They offer a portfolio of competitively solicited contracts that have been awarded based on industry best practices and maximum value. It saves institutions like Central Missouri time and money by eliminating the administrative costs and hassles of running competitive solicitations on their own. \nHead Coach Jim Svoboda and the Mules football team seem to be enjoying their new home field advantage, as UCM finished 4 and 1 at Walton Stadium, including three wins where the offense has scored over 50 points. The Mules finished 9-3 capping off an excellent season with a 38-28 victory over Minnesota-Duluth in the Mineral Water Bowl. \nAbout AstroTurf\u00ae For athletes and sport enthusiasts, AstroTurf\u00ae has redefined the way the game is played. The brand offers advanced, state-of-the-art, multi-sport and specialized synthetic turf systems with proprietary engineered technologies. A growing number of high schools, colleges, professional sports teams and municipalities continue to select AstroTurf-branded products for their premium quality, technical superiority, and safety.

Senator Tammy Baldwin in her bid for re-election. \n\u201cWe were proud to stand with Senator Baldwin when she made history in 2012, and today we are thrilled to enthusiastically endorse her bid for a second term in the U.S. Senate,\u201d said HRC President Chad Griffin. \u201cA true trailblazer, Senator Baldwin has been at the center of every battle for full equality, fighting tirelessly on behalf of Wisconsin and the American people. Her leadership and voice remain crucial in the effort to advance equality and we look forward to continuing to work with her in the U.S. Senate.\u201d\u201cI am honored to have HRC\u2019s endorsement and proud to be their long standing partner in this fight,\u201d said Senator Baldwin. \u201cEvery Wisconsinite and every American, no matter who they are, should be able to have a fair chance to earn a living, provide for their families, and live free from fear of discrimination. I will continue fighting for these ideals every day as a U.S. Senator and work to ensure full federal equality for everyone.\u201d \nBaldwin is the first openly gay U.S. senator and the first woman elected to the chamber from Wisconsin. Throughout her public service, she has been a pioneer for equality: Senator Baldwin was a leader in the repeal of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d an early supporter of marriage equality, a champion for federal hate crimes protections, and co-author of the Equality Act, crucial legislation that would extend comprehensive federal protections to LGBTQ Americans. In addition to Baldwin\u2019s strong civil rights record, she has been a voice for middle class Wisconsinites, leading the fight for quality, affordable health care access and an economy that works for everyone. She has defended the Affordable Care Act and is a leader of Buy American reforms to fuel job growth in the United States. \nIn July, HRC announced the earliest, largest grassroots expansion in its 37-year history ahead of 2018 with the launch of HRC Rising \u2014 a campaign to accelerate progress in states from coast-to-coast, resist the politics of hate, fight anti-LGBTQ legislation, and fuel pro-equality candidates and initiatives. HRC has thus far announced six priority states, which include Wisconsin, Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, HRC has identified more than 560,000 Wisconsinites as likely \u201cEquality Voters\u201d\u2014 those who are strong supporters of policies that advance LGBTQ equality, including marriage equality and other measures prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. HRC engaged Catalist, a data and analytics firm, to create a voter equality model that predicts every registered voters\u2019 likelihood to support LGBTQ equality. This model has allowed HRC to identify and direct outreach to millions of \u201cEquality Voters\u201d in crucial battleground states, moving them to action in support of pro-equality issues and legislation, as well as our endorsed candidates.

Save \nMICHIGAN CITY \u2014 The Michigan City Police Department partnered with several area organizations to provide Shop with a Cop, an event where MCPD officers shop with disabled and handicapped members of the community, on Monday. \nThis is the fifth year the MCPD has participated in the event. It was held at Walmart, off Franklin Street, in Michigan City. \n\"We bring together children and adults who are learning disabled, handicapped, and have disabilities,\" said MCPD Chief Mark Swistek. \"It's a great opportunity for us to give back to the community, and also partner with all the adults and children here today to have an experience where we can take them out shopping.\" \nSwistek added that each person gets about $75 to spend at Walmart on whatever they want, and that those participating seemed more than excited about the event. \n\"At the same time we are providing them lunch, deserts, and soft drinks,\" Swistek said. \"These people are often forgotten about, and it's our way of giving back. It's very heart warming to be able to do this.\" \nSgt. Chris Yagelski of MCPD, who played a major role in organizing the event, concurred with Swistek's sentiments about giving back to the community through Shop with a Cop. \n\"This group of individuals sometimes gets overlooked,\" he said. \"We want to make sure that they are taken care of, so we have Shop with a Cop with them. They truly, truly love this. It's a great event. They have their list made out weeks and months in advance. They even buy gifts for their families. So, it's just a great, great feeling at Christmas time to do this for our community.\" \nBoth Swistek and Yagelski said the event is well received by the MCPD officers who participate as well. \n\"It's awesome to see the officers donate themselves to shop with these challenged individuals, that really truly deserve a special treat occasion. We want to be proactive when it comes to our community events.\" \nSwistek concurred. \n\"I had been walking around the store for a good hour, and people were asking what was going on, I was explaining to them what the program is, they were so enlightened to hear what were doing out here today,\" he said. \"It's just a great group of people to be able to help out.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ben davis - staf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris yagelski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yagelski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark swistek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben davisdetective marty corley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa sopher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben davismcpd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jillian ashley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swistek", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan city police department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcpd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "franklin street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:59.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0fcea85127557f6e9bfe86bb49f8e66306748d0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7isP1zfmxVBAsXTaCJyFS9OEzqVuHS5ZC.SJlTggr0lrX5Y9QgohngbS83ELdBQgVCxQWTe2RpcpndhKYkNrswruHH073d8hCos2l_m5u_ipasxtwn9RFWM1ZoCMUGqT7NVEfm4voJGWXxlF3Co7rjkraaHbhUVDk-", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/more-sports/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "More Sports Board | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "NBA Board 12/6: tKing vs tQueens; Stephless; Nuggets/Pels; '13 finals; ESPN.

In total, five national monuments will see their size reduced, for a total rollback of 1.2 million acres that previously were under the federal government\u2019s protection. \nIn the proclamation announcing the redrawn boundaries of Bears Ears, President Trump claimed that the move was necessary due to \u201cthe lack of a threat of damage or destruction to many of those objects.\u201d \nThe decision to rescind federal protection for five national monuments was made despite a months-long public relations campaign launched by various public lands preservation supporters. REI\u2019s former CEO and Interior Secretary Sally Jewell was among many who gave an impassioned plea to maintain all of Bears Ears\u2019 lands as a national monument: \n\u201cIn the past century, tribal leaders have witnessed looting of grave sites, irreparable harm to petroglyphs by vandalism, sacred places torn up by indiscriminate off-road-vehicle use, and damage to a unique, intact landscape. I have seen these impacts myself \u2013 and as an American, I am ashamed we have let this happen.\u201d \nNevertheless, Patagonia is one organization that will not let this reversal move forward without a fight . The outdoor clothing and gear manufacturer said it will join forces with environmental organizations, Native American groups and other businesses to keep those lands protected. \nAccording to AdAge , Patagonia plans on suing the Trump Administration, joining forces with groups including Friends of Cedar Mesa , the Native American group Utah Dine Bikeyah and Archaeology Southwest . Their action will reportedly follow in the footsteps of the Inter Tribal Coalition, which filed its own lawsuit on Monday evening in a District of Columbia federal court. \nPatagonia has also launched an online petition to encourage the general public to express their views about the fate of Bears Ears. \nThe outdoor retailer has been opposing the Trump administration\u2019s public lands policies since the transfer of power from Barack Obama\u2019s presidency in January. In protesting Utah politicians\u2019 alignment with the Trump White House, the company withdrew from a lucrative outdoor clothing trade show that was an regular event in Salt Lake City for over 20 years. Other companies followed suit, and the event will be held in Denver starting next year. This summer, Patagonia launched a TV advertising buy for the first time ever in an effort to rally public support for public lands protection. \nPatagonia\u2019s argument for preserving public lands is as much an economic argument as it is an environmental and moral one. The company cites statistics estimating that the outdoor recreation industry employs 7.6 million jobs and generates $887 million in economic activity \u2013 outpacing the jobs and spending generated by the U.S. fossil fuels sector. \nImage credit: Bureau of Land Management/ Flickr", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sally jewell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "inter tribal coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bureau of land management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interior", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "friends of cedar mesa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah dine bikeyah and archaeology southwest", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "patagonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "district of columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salt lake city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:00.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f5479eec35c3ab50d3b8659f9db5659bc0acb66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvBhR_HdRdi0C2xokzzYZbEaUHdEZIxTUcukEbXQWX0fhgPz_qwzTbcN9Hw1kHD64U.G.pKUFJAZQ--", "site_full": "juantomasfrutos.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://juantomasfrutos.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "CONFESIONES A LA LUNA Y A LAS ESTRELLAS (BLOG DE JUAN TOM\u00c1S FRUTOS)", "title": "Refrendas", "title_full": "Refrendas", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f5479eec35c3ab50d3b8659f9db5659bc0acb66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvBhR_HdRdi0C2xokzzYZbEaUHdEZIxTUcukEbXQWX0fhgPz_qwzTbcN9Hw1kHD64U.G.pKUFJAZQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jtomas@um.es (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "Refrendas", "text": "Reservamos.\n\n...\n\nNos hemos visto.\n\n...\n\nConsideras.\n\n...\n\nNos ablandamos.\n\n...\n\nRefrendas.\n\nJuan T.

Against the euro, sterling GBPEUR, +0.5548% bought \u20ac1.1383, turning higher compared with \u20ac1.1353 in the prior session. \nWhat\u2019s moving markets: The EU reportedly gave U.K. leader May until midnight on Sunday to put forward a solution to the dispute over the Irish border after Brexit\u2014the last of three issues that have to be resolved before withdrawal talks can move onto the next stage of trade and transition arrangements. \nEU leaders are meeting Dec. 14-15 in Brussels, where they will decide whether the U.K. has made \u201csufficient progress\u201d in the negotiations to enter the second phase of exit talks. A dispute with May\u2019s Northern Ireland political allies over the issue of whether to have a \u201chard\u201d or \u201csoft\u201d border scuttled a potential deal on Monday. \n\u201cWith Theresa May expected to present another deal to the Irish, market hopes have pushed the pound higher this afternoon,\u201d said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, in a note. \n\u201cUnfortunately, as Monday highlighted, the ability of Theresa May to appease all sides with a deal is going to be a tough ask, with the DUP\u2019s opposition likely to prove a stumbling block,\u201d he said. \nIn other news, the International Monetary Fund has called for banks in China to bump up their capital buffers in the wake of a credit boom in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. In a review of China\u2019s financial system, the IMF said lenders may not have enough capital to weather potential losses from those credit risks. \nMining stocks in the U.K. can be sensitive to developments in China, where companies are big buyers of precious and industrial metals. \nData from Halifax showed U.K. house prices rose 0.5% in November from October, marking a fifth monthly rise. But annual growth in house prices in the three months to November slowed to 3.9% from October\u2019s 4.5% reading. \nStock movers: In the basic materials sector, which makes up a roughly 8% weighting on the FTSE 100, shares of Rio Tinto PLC RIO, -1.66% RIO, -0.84% RIO, +0.92% fell 1.7% and Anglo American PLC AAL, -0.70% lost 0.7%.
