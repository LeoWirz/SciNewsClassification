But that\u2019s not the whole story. A new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. Experts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. Call it Medicaid\u2019s health care challenge. A federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama\u2019s health law, it\u2019s become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama\u2019s expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \u201cWe now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\u201d said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who\u2019s also a practicing physician. \u201cThis really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\u201d In small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don\u2019t take matters into my own hands,\u201d said Rose, who\u2019s in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \u201cInstead of waiting on everyone else, this time I\u2019m going to do it for myself,\u201d said Rose. Thirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. The Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. In other findings: \u2013 Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \u2013 Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \u2013 Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. Still, survey director Dan Witters said that\u2019s only half the story. \u201cJust because they smoke more, doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t have an interest in their health,\u201d Witters said of those with Medicaid. \u201cTheir interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups\u2026although I think they are swimming upstream.\u201d Having a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. In one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who\u2019ll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. In theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \u201cThe Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\u201d said Salo. \u201cIt is people who have health conditions.\u201d Salo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \u201cDepression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\u201d he said. Some states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some figuring out to do,\u201d Salo said. The Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. For the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

Activation of the IFN-\u03b3 and its downstream interleukin-12 (IL-12) pathway can correct these diseases. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is a cytokine signaling inhibitor that blocks downstream pathways of IFN-\u03b3 by blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathways. Oxymatrine (OMT), a quinolizidine alkaloid extracted from the herbal medicine Radix Sophorae flavescentis , is used to treat allergic skin diseases in China. The non-cytotoxic concentrations of OMT in HaCaT cells were determined through 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 were used to stimulate HaCaT cells, and OMT was added to this system with tacrolimus (FK506) as a positive control. The mRNAs of cytokines, MDC, ICAM-1, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, and IFN-\u03b3 receptor (IFN-\u03b3R)\u03b1 were detected by RT-PCR. Western blot analyses were performed to assess activation of the MAPK (p38, Jun N-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and Akt signaling pathways. OMT increased the mRNA levels of the IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3R\u03b1, reduced the mRNA levels of ICAM-1, MDC, and SOCS1. But FK506 increased the mRNA levels of IL12 and inhibited the expression of ICAM-1 mRNAs and had no effects on the IFN-\u03b3R\u03b1, MDC, and SOCS1 mRNA in HaCaT cells stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. Thus, the mechanisms through which OMT and FK506 ameliorate allergic skin diseases differ.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2BHtnOL", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "downregulates mdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mdc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:40.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "903ad2876eb9adc466978846d89c8344e41a2a29", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR2TEbumAkaPGiSmD7O3skGc2eZyRAVKMW9PeOOLEEnSaGPWZRkWWvsHDwCpEw9j75v1DPPOZYe8jM6rX.yHfByQhtE9Aa8et1d4c4ULCxRaQ--", "site_full": "www.downloadha.com", "site": "downloadha.com", "site_section": "http://www.feed.downloadha.com/downloadha-feed", "site_categories": ["tech", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0644\u0648\u062f \u0647\u0627 \u2013 \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0644\u0648\u062f \u0631\u0627\u06cc\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0631\u0645 \u0627\u0641\u0632\u0627\u0631\u060c\u0628\u0627\u0632\u06cc\u060c\u0641\u06cc\u0644\u0645 \u0648 \u0633\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0644", "title": "\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0644\u0648\u062f \u0641\u06cc\u0644\u0645 \u0622\u0645\u0648\u0632\u0634 \u0622\u0647\u0646\u06af \u0633\u0627\u0632\u06cc \u0622\u06a9\u0648\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u06a9", "title_full": "\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0644\u0648\u062f \u0641\u06cc\u0644\u0645 \u0622\u0645\u0648\u0632\u0634 \u0622\u0647\u0646\u06af \u0633\u0627\u0632\u06cc \u0622\u06a9\u0648\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u06a9", "published": "2017-12-07T10:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img5.downloadha.com/Behnam/2017/December/Cover/Acoustic-Songwriting.-Create-your-own-original-songs-Cover.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2826, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "903ad2876eb9adc466978846d89c8344e41a2a29", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR2TEbumAkaPGiSmD7O3skGc2eZyRAVKMW9PeOOLEEnSaGPWZRkWWvsHDwCpEw9j75v1DPPOZYe8jM6rX.yHfByQhtE9Aa8et1d4c4ULCxRaQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "\u0628\u0647\u0646\u0627\u0645", "published": "2017-12-07T10:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0644\u0648\u062f \u0641\u06cc\u0644\u0645 \u0622\u0645\u0648\u0632\u0634 \u0622\u0647\u0646\u06af \u0633\u0627\u0632\u06cc \u0622\u06a9\u0648\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u06a9", "text": "\u2013 \u062c\u0630\u0628 \u0637\u0631\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u06a9\u0633\u0628 \u062f\u0631\u0622\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u0648\u0633\u06cc\u0642\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u062f\u2013 \u0646\u062a\u06cc\u062c\u0647 \u06af\u06cc\u0631\u06cc ( \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0639\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0635\u0644\u06cc \u0631\u0648\u06cc \u0639\u06a9\u0633 \u06a9\u0644\u06cc\u06a9 \u0646\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u06cc\u062f ) Requirements You will need to have a guitar, paper and pen. That\u2019s it. Description TOP RATED, WORLD CLASS MUSIC FUNDAMENTALS COURSE ON UDEMY \u2013 UPDATED CONTENT for songwriting December 2015 Write your own songs My course does exactly what the title describes in a simple, relatable way. I help you to create and perform your own music \u2013 whether you\u2019re a beginner musician looking to get started with your songwriting or you\u2019re a seasoned professional I will go through the process of acoustic songwriting \u2013 learn guitar (chords, scales, finger picking), vocal exercises and ranges, lyrics, building confidence, performing and much more. Why you need this course Creating your own songs isn\u2019t all that easy. On your own it can be quite confusing, difficult and frustrating. I\u2019ve been through the process myself, and with the help of lifelong musicians who have helped me I know the ins and outs of songwriting and performing across a range of genres. I want to share this with my fellow beginners, musicians, with you. What you will get out of this course I will give you straightforward instructions, advice, insights and resources for you to take simple steps to create your first three songs in the genres of your choice. I personally provide support within the course daily, answering questions and giving feedback on what you\u2019ve created so far. I don\u2019t just throw you in at the deep end \u2013 I provide you with the resources to learn and develop what you need and then help you stroll through to the finish line. My course integrates all of the aspects required to be a successful acoustic songwriter. I teach and I preach, with a live performance of a relevant original song by me at the end of each section! Why $99? As a professional songwriter, performer, and teacher for over ten years I have helped hundreds of people to learn to play guitar, sing and write their own songs. Face to face I charge $50 per hour for a student. To complete everything a student would learn in this course it would cost them between $500 \u2013 $1000 for the lessons. To reach more people than I could face to face I decided to create this course. As I add more content I intend to raise the price but for now I\u2019ve decided on $99 \u2013 the cost of just two lessons. By paying a small cost for this course I believe you will get your value back, with a lot more by the time you have completed it. Ask yourself \u2013 how much is learning to write songs worth to you? How long will it take? Although everyone is different, on average it has taken existing students between 4 \u2013 6 weeks to complete the course, whilst developing their skills and knowledge along the way. Who this is not for This course is not for anyone looking for a one-click fix. Although I provide you with a path walked enough times that it can be a relatively smooth journey it still requires a lot of time and effort from you to make it happen. If you\u2019re not interested in putting in your own energy to become a songwriter then this may not be the right course for you. Is there a money back guarantee if I\u2019m not happy? Absolutely. I am confident that my course will bring you more value than you spend on the course. As one of the top featured Udemy Music Instructors my motto is \u2018your success is my success\u2019. If within the first 30 days you feel my course is not going to help you to achieve your goals in creating your own songs then you get a no questions asked, full discount straight away. What materials are included? The majority of my lectures I have chosen to be in video format so that you can hear and see me when we\u2019re going through each and every area of the course. Aswell as the course lectures, presentations, audios, pdfs and quizzes the course will soon also offers: A workbook to track your progress A template for creating your own work timeline with goals and milestones My full support as an instructor to answer questions, provide feedback and support Interviews with other successful musicians I will be constantly adding more valuable content and resources to the course as time goes by. Keep checking back here if you\u2019re not sure right now and feel free to send me a message with any questions or requests you may have. So go ahead and click the \u2018Take this course\u2019 button at the top right of your screen. I look forward to seeing you on the course. Feedback from my current students: \u201cWow, I\u2019m a complete beginner..got this as a christmas present from my boyfriend. I loved it! I\u2019ve already written three songs with help from the instructor and he\u2019s even given me feedback on my songs. Thank you.\u201d\u2013 Hamza mubarik, India \u201cI\u2019ve paid hundreds and hundreds of dollars on lessons and then John comes along with this course and I can learn, practise, and even get quick feedback for a fraction of the costs. I\u2019d say there are still a few things the course could be improved \u2013 like maybe an interview with a famous songwriter? But this still stands well above any teacher or course I\u2019ve ever used for guitar.\u201d\u2013 Liam Jacob, Miami, United States Who is the target audience? Anyone with a dream to write their own songs Existing songwriters looking to learn more in-depth about the process Teachers of guitar or singing who are looking to learn and provide their students with more If you play a different instrument the concepts I teach are transferable and can still be a lot of help Courses:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "\u2013 hamza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aswell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liam jacob", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:40.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "77938ed159b31f81da217900027a2b266d6ff8e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXSCDqzOPf.s8Rgbb41g0DhMhI8uKVklRqG6FCmuMc7aVttX.puRLbeTdszZ3UI3sanKdFAZ2jpckrRxCDUh6Y35xxTy4XPapE-", "site_full": "newsbooster1.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://newsbooster1.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "news booster", "title": "Avisering fr\u00e5n Google \u2013 single", "title_full": "Avisering fr\u00e5n Google \u2013 single", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "77938ed159b31f81da217900027a2b266d6ff8e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXSCDqzOPf.s8Rgbb41g0DhMhI8uKVklRqG6FCmuMc7aVttX.puRLbeTdszZ3UI3sanKdFAZ2jpckrRxCDUh6Y35xxTy4XPapE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Top news of the day (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "Avisering fr\u00e5n Google \u2013 single", "text": "single Direktuppdatering \u22c5 7 december 2017 WEBB BLACKBOOK PREMIERE: Sofi Tukker's Groovalicious Remix of Their Hit Single BlackBook It's been a whirlwind seventeen months for the duo of Sophie Hawley-Weld and Tucker Halpern since, as Sofi Tukker, they released their debut EP Soft Animals in July of 2016 \u2013 including a Best Dance Recording Grammy nomination for their single \"Drinkee\" and placement of a couple of tracks in the ...

Received: 26 October 2017 / Revised: 27 November 2017 / Accepted: 2 December 2017 / Published: 7 December 2017 No Abstract Clustering of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) by polyvalent antigens is transmitted through the SYK tyrosine kinase to the activation of multiple intracellular pathways that determine the physiological consequences of receptor engagement. To explore factors that modulate the quantity and quality of signals sent by the crosslinked BCR, we developed a novel chemical mediator of dimerization to induce clustering of receptor-associated SYK. To accomplish this, we fused SYK with E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR), which binds the small molecule trimethoprim (TMP) with high affinity and selectivity and synthesized a dimer of TMP with a flexible linker. The TMP dimer is able to induce the aggregation of eDHFR-linked SYK in live cells. The induced dimerization of SYK bound to the BCR differentially regulates the activation of downstream transcription factors, promoting the activation of Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) without affecting the activation of NF\u03baB. The dimerization of SYK enhances the duration but not the amplitude of calcium mobilization by enhancing the extent and duration of its interaction with the crosslinked BCR at the plasma membrane.

Received: 21 August 2017 / Revised: 3 November 2017 / Accepted: 7 November 2017 / Published: 7 December 2017 No Abstract Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) plays an essential role in regulating corticosteroid hormone production, which has important functions in a myriad of critical physiological functions. In this proof-of-concept study, a miniaturized immunosensor was developed for the highly sensitive detection of ACTH using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in connection with disposable screen-printed gold electrodes (SPGEs). A film of 3,3\u2032-dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidylpropionate] (DTSSP) was prepared to immobilize anti-ACTH antibodies covalently on the nanostructured SPGE surface. The surface-immobilized anti-ACTH antibodies captured the biotinylated ACTH (biotin-ACTH) and non-labelled ACTH for the competitive immunoassay. After coupling of a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Streptavidin-ALP), the bio-catalysed precipitation of an insoluble and insulating product onto the sensing interface changed the charge transfer resistance (R ct ) characteristics significantly. The detection limit of 100 fg/mL was determined for ACTH in a 5 \u03bcL sample volume, which indicated that this versatile platform can be easily adapted for miniaturized electrochemical immunosensing of cancer marker biomolecules. High selectivity and sensitivity of our immunoassay to detect ACTH in real samples demonstrated its promising potential for future development and applications using clinical samples.

LLOY if they pay a special div like last year and with div already paid they could possibly pay 3.2p and yield would be about 4.9% and over the coming years Lloyds will have so much capital that it will repay it in dividends. Note often as a company increases their dividend the share price increases to bring the overall yield down to normal levels, so in my opinion over a 2 to 3 year time frame looking at substantial capital growth.\nSMT if same dividend then yield would be 0.69% and very little room for capital appreciation.\nBP (assuming no major oil spills which I would hope not) and dividends remain the same yields over 6% but you are exposed to the dollar GBP exchange rate and price of oil (fortunately oil is increasing) so potential for capital growth.\nPLP yields about 2.86% and has potential for capital growth but I do not know much about this company.\nI would be pointing my daughter at RDSA and RDSA as yield is 6% potential for more and possible both shares will combine to permit voting rights. Substantial capital growth likely.\nI apologise to the regular guys and girls on this BB for discussing other shares but as we only ever seem to discuss BTL (a Canadian share traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange) and I do not see my daughter as often as I would like (except when GBP are requested) I thought you may allow me on this occasion.\nDeagle: Raymond k both at gmail dot com\nDYOR\nRKB", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:40.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45adcf8bb915bcd4c242b2da12c1f3f07884a774", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWdWE0mW2CNc8FpGC_ji2_srTj4X4D8g1QiMV8xhgM4qtJUpFa0uLULlIy3Mh4Vnl7ouLS.dKiXHZxDSVpGHocYXk1esl5YzJ0d40w5Peu_P65PDLX9ySra0RhG_snbHXBIWsAjinA2pY9verqj9eU97Yd.kfiYWuS", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-mens-care/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Buy All Men's Care Products at Best Prices | Lazada Malaysia | Free Shipping", "title": "Philips Multigroom Series 1000 Ultra Precise Beard Styler MG1100 ( MG1100/16 )", "title_full": "Philips Multigroom Series 1000 Ultra Precise Beard Styler MG1100 ( MG1100/16 ) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2000-12-31T18:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 43, "participants_count": 39, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "31a0375df70ea010c9474b498bc5852b143fd8fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWdWE0mW2CNc8FpGC_ji2_srTj4X4D8g1QiMV8xhgM4qtJUpFa0uLULlIy3Mh4Vnl7ouLS.dKiXHZxDSVpGHocYXk1esl5YzJ0d40w5Peu_P65PDLX9ySra0RhG_snbHXBIWsAjinA2pY9verqj9eU97JfCF0P0YaZTLd8finELHQ-", "ord_in_thread": 39, "author": "Mohammed R.", "published": "2017-11-28T01:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "good protect", "text": "very good", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:40.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a06cde39ba61ee431d2141d5d4d75d7f85195fe8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLtZqyWX0qjG7Hq9T7xwJfRvfhNY_g5dHo67ikoBLQLuDlwNa9XkZSYa9z8a6X1l3MQ8AKpmtVHSLVtcSeSenXAyiBTshhqaw9RkF2WlvnQfNZ218eoQjbPL", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html?sort=newest&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'html' Questions - Stack Overflow", "title": "html - how to rotate a \"triangle down\" to a \"triangle up\" using css and jquery", "title_full": "html - how to rotate a \"triangle down\" to a \"triangle up\" using css and jquery - Stack Overflow", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6287bcaf438e05c689ac60b589f8809afd880010", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLtZqyWX0qjG7Hq9T7xwJfRvfhNY_g5dHo67ikoBLQLuDlwNa9XkZSYa9z8a6X1l3MQ8AKpmtVHSLVtcSeSenXAyiBTshhqaw9RkF2WlvnQfNUnDz9gT.5O9", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Amani", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Here You can use the follwing snippet using css transition ,by toggling a css class :\n$(\".triangle\").click(function() { $(this).toggleClass(\"triangle-up\");

(AP) \u2014 Dr. Byron Maas surveys a supply of marijuana products for dogs that lines a shelf in his veterinary clinic. They\u2019re selling well. \u201cThe \u2018Up and Moving\u2019 is for joints and for pain,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe \u2018Calm and Quiet\u2019 is for real anxious dogs, to take away that anxiety.\u201d People anxious to relieve suffering in their pets are increasingly turning to oils and powders that contain CBDs, a non-psychoactive component of marijuana. But there\u2019s little data on whether they work, or if they have harmful side effects. That\u2019s because Washington has been standing in the way of clinical trials, veterinarians and researchers say. Now, a push is underway to have barriers removed, so both pets and people can benefit. Those barriers have had more than just a chilling effect. When the federal Drug Enforcement Administration announced last year that even marijuana extracts with CBD and little or no THC \u2013 marijuana\u2019s intoxicating component \u2013 are an illegal Schedule 1 drug, the University of Pennsylvania halted its clinical trials. Colorado State University is pushing ahead. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned companies that sell marijuana products online and via pet shops and animal hospitals that they\u2019re violating laws by offering \u201cunapproved new animal drugs.\u201d The FDA threatened legal action. But, seeing potential benefits of CBDs, the American Veterinary Medical Association\u2019s policy-making body said last summer it wants the DEA to declassify marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug \u201cto facilitate research opportunities for veterinary and human medical uses.\u201dIt asked the board of the national veterinarians\u2019 organization to investigate working with other stakeholders toward that goal. The board is awaiting a recommendation from two group councils. \u201cThe concern our membership has is worry about people extrapolating their own dosages, looking to medicate their pets outside the realm of the medical professional,\u201d Board Chairman Michael Whitehair said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis is an important reason for us to continue the research.\u201d Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a conservative Republican, became an unlikely champion of this push when he introduced a bill in September that would open the path for more clinical research. While Hatch said he opposes recreational marijuana use, he wants marijuana-based drugs, regulated by the FDA, produced for people with disorders. \u201cWe lack the science to support use of medical marijuana products like CBD oils, not because researchers are unwilling to do the work, but because of bureaucratic red tape and over-regulation,\u201d Hatch said. Dawn Boothe, of Auburn University\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine, is waiting for federal approval to begin a study of marijuana\u2019s effects on dogs with epilepsy. The classification of marijuana products containing CBD as a Schedule 1 drug, the same category as heroin and LSD, creates a \u201cmajor, major, major, terrible roadblock\u201d for researchers, Boothe said in a phone interview. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine were studying CBDs\u2019 effects on dogs with osteoarthritis and pruritis, or itchiness, until the DEA released its policy statement. \u201cThe ambiguity in this process has really brought us to a screeching halt,\u201d said Michael DiGregorio, director of the university\u2019s clinical trials center. \u201cIt is research that needs to be done, because there are a lot of CBD products out there.\u201d When it clarified that marijuana CBD extracts are Schedule 1 drugs, the DEA said it was assigning a code number to those substances to better track them and to comply with international drug control treaties. DiGregorio complained that researchers seeking federal approval to study CBD products are told to provide certain data, but that data isn\u2019t normally available until the study is done. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the data, you can\u2019t get the registration to do the work,\u201d he said. On a recent morning, Maas took a break from seeing four-legged patients in the Bend Veterinary Clinic. A stethoscope dangling from his neck over green scrubs, Maas said his clients have reported CBDs help relieve pain, arthritis, anxiety, loss of appetite, epilepsy and inflammation in their pets. \u201cUnfortunately there\u2019s not a lot of research out there, especially on animals, on CBD compounds,\u201d Maas said. \u201cThe research is really necessary to help us understand how to actually use these compounds on our pets.\u201d Veterinarian Janet Ladyga of the Blue Sky Veterinary Clinic, also in Bend, said she doesn\u2019t recommend marijuana products because of the unknowns. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of evidence right now, so we don\u2019t know the toxicity or the safety profile \u2026 and we don\u2019t have any good evidence to show either if it\u2019s safe or efficacious,\u201d she said. The study at Colorado State University aims to provide some data. The roughly two dozen dogs in the arthritis study and the 30 in the epilepsy tests are given either CBD oil or a placebo.

Photo: Tiziana Fabi/AFP AFP 7 December 2017 10:01 CET+01:00 Naples' pizza twirling joined Unesco's list of \"intangible heritage\" on Thursday, securing the coveted status alongside a host of cultural treasures. \nThe art of \"pizzaiuolo\" \u2013 which has been handed down for generations in the southern Italian city \u2013 was given the nod by the UN cultural body's World Heritage Committee, who met on the South Korean island of Jeju. READ ALSO: This map shows where to find the very best pizza in Italy \nIt comes after some two million people joined a petition to support Naples' application, according to Sergio Miccu, head of the Association of Neapolitan Pizzaiuoli \u2013 no doubt buoyed by his offer of complimentary pizza if the age-old culinary tradition joined the prestigious list. \n\"We'll be giving out free pizza in the streets,\" Miccu earlier told AFP. \nThe custom goes far beyond the pizzaiuolo's spectacular handling of the dough \u2013 hurling it into the air in order to \"oxygenate\" it \u2013 to include songs and stories that have turned pizza-making into a time-honoured social ritual. \n\"Victory!\" Maurizio Martina, Italy's minister for agriculture, food and forestry, wrote on Twitter. \"Another step towards the protection of Italy's food and wine heritage.\" \nAlfonso Pecoraro Scanio, a former agriculture minister who attended the proceedings in Jeju, said in a video posted on Twitter: \"Long live the art of Neapolitan pizzaiuolo!\" READ ALSO: Italy wants new law to protect the art of pizza-making \nThirty-four candidates were seeking to join the list of intangible heritage, created in 2003 mainly to raise awareness, although Unesco also sometimes offers financial or technical support to countries struggling to protect their traditions. \nThe list already included more than 350 traditions, art forms and practices from Spain's flamenco dancing to Indonesian batik fabrics, to more obscure entries such as a Turkish oil wrestling festival and the Mongolian coaxing ritual for camels. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "unesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miccu", "sentiment":

He is particularly known as a \u201cNature Poet\u201d because of his consistent and constant use of Natural scenes, elements and his expressions of sensuous pleasures he derived from nature. One such poem of his is called \u201cOctober\u201d which is an Ode to Autumn and it goes as follows;\nO hushed October morning mild,\nThy leaves have ripened to the fall;\nTomorrow\u2019s wind, if it be wild,\nShould waste them all.\nThe crows above the forest call;\nTomorrow they may form and go.\nO hushed October morning mild,\nBegin the hours of this day slow.\nMake the day seem to us less brief.\nHearts not averse to being beguiled,\nBeguile us in the way you know.\nRelease one leaf at break of day;\nAt noon release another leaf;\nOne from our trees, one far away.\nRetard the sun with gentle mist;\nEnchant the land with amethyst.\nSlow, slow!\nFor the grapes\u2019 sake, if they were all,\nWhose leaves already are burnt with frost,\nWhose clustered fruit must else be lost\u2014\nFor the grapes\u2019 sake along the wall.\n\n\n\nAutumn calls for hearty and healthy dishes that are rustic, robust and comforting in flavours. It\u2019s just the season I tell you; autumn demands cordial, earthy and soupy recipes, that will warm your soul. Autumn foliage is in its full glory during this time of the year, with amber, rust, gold, caramel and blazing fiery colours spread across wherever Autumn breathes. It\u2019s phenomenal, the Mother Nature, where your whole being recognizes and understands the chill of the weather yet your sight is seeing a canvas of fiery ablaze. It\u2019s a gorgeous sight to see.\nThis gorgeous Amber Gravy is exactly that, autumn in a bowl with its perfectly spiced curry encompassing a soupy character, once swallowed, it warms your soul to the core. Believe you me! not only will you be enjoying this with rice or Naan bread, you will be slurping it down like soup as well. The curry is Exuberantly luscious and the colours of the dish is caramel glory. The caramelized onions in the dish cooked with yogurt adds a caramel tang to the gravy aided and imbedded with mulled spices like, cinnamon, cloves, black peppercorn and all spice. The kick to the gravy, however, comes from the green cardamoms which is quite outstanding in the whole dish. Therefore, those little green pods are essential for that exquisite aroma to the gravy while also packing in a punch of flavour, don\u2019t leave it out.\n\nThe recipe is quick and easy where once all the ingredients are added, it\u2019s one of those dishes that cook themselves. The perfect compliment to the dish is a brown onion salad; washed and soaked in salty water for 10 minutes and that\u2019s it, just raw onion with a sharp tang is this gravy\u2019 s best friend. This is a family favourite in my house and one of the very first dishes I learned to cook when I first started out cooking. It holds a lot of memories that I hold dear of my aunt who is no longer here but in a better world than here. This dish is her legacy. That\u2019s how I remember her, always hearty and happy, cooking and innovating with a big heart for hospitality, her food was as warm as her love.\n\nThe dried red chilies that bless this curry with its spicy kick are not just pretty to look at but also fiercely fragrant and flavoursome. There are two different types of dried red chilies used in the Indian Cuisine i.e. Whole round dried red chilies which when grinded gives you the red chili flakes and the other one are these dried finger red chillies which when grinded gives you powder or used as pastes. These are an integral part of the curry which cannot be substituted or omitted.\n In my family this soupy curry is known as \u201cSoul Curry\u201d just because of the reason I mentioned above. This is one of my daughters most favourite of curry which she innocently calls \u201cSoul Soup\u201d as she dips her naan bread into the curry and soaks it explicitly before diving into it. I have actually learned that from her, those soaked Naan Bread pieces are extremely delectable to eat. Needless to say, this will give your taste buds a warm soulful feel.\nThis sensuously striking dish will be the heart of your dinner table on a cold chilled night. It is a perfect autumn dish.\n\nServes 4-6 \nCooking time \u2013 30 minutes \nIngredients ~ \n1. Chicken on the bone \u2014 1 kg\n2. Naan Bread \u2014 To server with\n~Gravy Whole Spice Mix~ \n1.

Received: 31 October 2017 / Revised: 1 December 2017 / Accepted: 4 December 2017 / Published: 7 December 2017 No Abstract Tajikistan has abundant copper\u2013tin resources. In this study, mineralogical analysis of copper\u2013tin ores from the Mushiston deposit of Tajikistan indicates that tin mainly occurred in mushistonite, cassiterite, and stannite, while copper mainly occurred in mushistonite, malachite, azurite, and stannite. The total grades of tin (Sn) and copper (Cu) were 0.65% and 0.66%, respectively, and the dissemination size of copper\u2013tin minerals ranged from 4 \u03bcm to over 200 \u03bcm. Coarse particles of copper\u2013tin minerals were partially recovered by shaking table concentrators with a low recovery rate. Based on the mineralogical analysis, flotation recovery was used for the first time on the fine particles of copper\u2013tin minerals, including mushistonite, from shaking table tailings. Single factor flotation experiments, open circuit flotation tests, and closed circuit flotation tests were performed to determine the optimized flotation conditions. Results indicated that benzohydroxamic acid (C 6 H 5 CONHOH) and lead nitrate could effectively recover the mushistonite, cooperating with other depressants. The final concentrate contained 13.28% Sn, with a recovery rate of 61.56%, and 18.51% Cu, with a recovery rate of 86.52%. This method proved effective for the exploitation and use of this type of copper\u2013tin resource in Tajikistan.

Before investing make a clear picture in duration you want to reap the money. Either short term or long term. Investment can be of many types; depending upon one\u2019s knowledge and surroundings. Above all there is also much risk involved in few investments which are made. So upon patience; calculating the risk factor and finally preparing the mind; outplays the satisfaction of your investment.\nWhile handling money and doing something with it; please have these terms in mind:-\nCash in flow, Cash out flow, Assets and Liabilities:\nCash which comes in, is cash in flow and which goes out is cash out flow.\nAsset is something which pays you out of it, but Liabilities is something which costs you.\nFor example, when you buy a car and think that as your asset, but it is not \u2013 the month EMI cost, fuel cost, servicing cost is making you cost for it, it is a liability. But when you buy a land, the rent which comes out is your asset.\nSo in simple saying something which cost you is Liabilities and which pays is asset. \n1. Make some investment on online trading platform\nWhen you were well versed with online trading and stock market knowledge; you can put a small amount there. The knowledge can be gained by reading news daily and keep watching the company invested for its daily news; there profit and turnover for every quarter announcements they make. By this way the prediction can be made to each and every company we watch out.\nThis is purely luck and wise decision making in each and every company being invested.\nThe categorization involves Oil&Gas, Banking, Aviation, Power etc, so upon watching news on various areas helps in determining the behavior of the stock.\n2. Investing on Gold \nInvesting on gold also seems to be a good option; the price of the gold quite increasing, will be a good asset for future. When monthly gold chits are paid; at the end of the year the wastage and the GST will be levied; this will save around 15% of your total amount. It is one of the oldest and evergreen investment products, as the value of gold increases quickly.\n3. Investing on Land \nLand is a kind of multi jackpot thing if invested on a right place at a right time. Mere study is necessary before taking a decision. Visiting the land directly, predicting the development of the area, noting down the surrounding, everything counts for a effective decision on investing a land. This will be a great asset if it is done on the right place.\n4. Investment in Bonds\nIf you feel uncomfortable in investing in mutual funds and direct equity market investments, then you can try investing in bonds. Investing in bonds can be one of the best investment options since there are many good bonds which actually provide a high rate of return on investments. There are bonds that are under the regulation of government, for example, a bond for 10 years which is currently giving a rate of interest of 7.70%.\nSo, think, research, understand and decide the best saving investment option to stabilize your future", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "befo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:42.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e60934b57cb113cff4552c44eb161e4fa6399fea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBIjeZEZxOhGZ7Cd6DdiZ9cFMPSuV51iUxgLcVswa83izIsTYyW25si4paX79s4YPKh2jlazJebSSZ", "site_full": "www.lse.co.uk", "site": "lse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.lse.co.uk/share-chat.asp?page=239", "site_categories": ["united_kingdom", "travel", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Share Chat on London South East.

I wonder are they selling it cheap because they want to letgo all the rejected tins or what. If yes, just stated in the product details (be Honest please), So that we know what to expect when we receive the items! If lazada tells all the details that we are going to receive the rejected one, it is up to us. Because we choose to buy that.

But with a full no-trade clause in his deal, Stanton can choose where he wants to go. \nBased on his social feeds, choosing the Bay Area over the midwest seems like a no-brainer.

Just a few weeks ago he posted a picture of him hanging out with G-Eazy. \nWell being that Eazy is a Berkeley native, coming to San Francisco would give Stanton the chance to maybe start a bromance with the Bay Area rapper. \nStanton would also ultimately run into another Bay rapper in E-40. Whether it\u2019s behind home plate at AT&T Park, or sitting courtside at Oracle Arena, 40 loves his Bay Area teams. \nWho knows, maybe he could even give Stanton a shout-out on one of his upcoming songs?
