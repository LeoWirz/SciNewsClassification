But now it's just a cesspool of broken mechanics and oversights. It's highly reliant on RNG to get the right legendaries, relics, and trinkets, and encourages doing PVE to supplement ilvl and chances at BIS gear. There is a direct correlation between the amount of PvE you do and your viability in WPvP. (Only mitigated by the gear very few people earn pushing rating in PvP.)\nInstanced PvP is better, but ilvl still matters. It won't make or break every match or fight, but everyone's had moments where someone lives with a sliver of health or dies a second away from a CD being available. It's not rewarding to think disparities in ilvl contributed to a match in any capacity. PvP should be about player skill and team coordination.\nConquest gear was a good system, the only issue was it was too difficult to start out.

To stay alive we had to scamper for safety and the best place was the bush,\u201d he said. \nA police source, who confirmed the incident, said it was quite unfortunate because a lot of people were injured in the process of running to safety. \nHis words: You have to understand that it will take a while before I can authoritatively give you accurate information on the number of casualties and current situation in the area. Getting to the area is a challenge as you will have to either travel to Akwa Ibom first before linking up the place through the river in Itu.\u201d \nWhen contacted, police Public Relations Officer in the state, ASP Irene Ugbo confirmed the incident and said they were on top of the situation. \n\u201c We are aware of the matter and we are on top of the situation because there is no cause for alarm.

Visegrad Castle - After the Mongol invasion, King B\u00e9la IV of Hungary and his wife had a new fortification system constructed in the 1240-50s near the one destroyed earlier. The first part of the new system was the Upper Castle on top of a high hill. The castle was laid out on a triangular ground plan and had three towers at its corners. In the 14th century, at the time of the Angevin kings of Hungary, the castle became a royal residence and was enlarged with a new curtain wall and palace buildings. Around 1400 King Sigismund also had a third curtain wall constructed and enlarged the palace buildings. At the end of the 15th century, King Matthias Corvinus had the interior part of the castle renovated. The Upper Castle also served for the safekeeping of the Hungarian royal insignia between the 14th century and 1526.

The hospital said in a statement that several dozen patients still remained there Thursday.\nA volunteer passes supplies donated to Thomas fire evacuees in Ventura, Calif., on Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017. As many as five fires have closed highways, schools and museums, shut down production of TV series and cast a hazardous haze over the region. About 200,000 people were under evacuation orders. No deaths and only a few injuries were reported. (AP Photo/Noah Berger)\nA woman was found dead in a wrecked car in an evacuation zone near the city of Santa Paula, where the Ventura County fire began Monday night, but officials could not immediately say if the accident was fire-related.\nTo the west, firefighters prevented another disaster at tiny La Conchita, a seaside hamlet below coastal bluffs that in the past have unleashed destructive landslides, including one that killed 10 people in 2005.\nA short distance up the coast, evacuations were ordered in Santa Barbara County for several hundred residents of the beach city of Carpinteria.\nOfficials intermittently closed U.S. 101 for more than a dozen miles along the coast, cutting off the major route for several hours as fire charred heavy brush along lanes.\nIn tiny Faria Beach, homeowner Steve Andruszkewicz and his wife used a garden hose to spray palm trees to keep them from burning.\n\"We're leaving,\" he said. \"We've been packed up since Tuesday. We left Tuesday night and stayed down at our son's house. We came back yesterday, stayed the night, but this has got me worrying because of the blowing embers.\"\nWorkers from the Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power walk past a home destroyed by wildfire along Via San Anselmo in the Sylmar area of Los Angeles Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017.

And I didn't think it was no big deal, but it's coming back to burn what it didn't burn yesterday.\"\nSouthern California has been hit hard by four major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow.\nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Wednesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive.\n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\"\nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered Wednesday night in Ojai, a small town with resorts, galleries, eateries and wilderness activities that serves as a getaway destination.\nThe Getty Center is seen after a wildfire swept through Los Angeles' Bel Air neighborhood Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017. The Getty Center, the $1 billion home to the J. Paul Getty Museum and related organizations, stands on the west side of Sepulveda Pass. The fire did not immediately cross the wide expanse of the pass to the Getty side, but if it had, the facility is prepared. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon)\nIn the exclusive Bel Air section of Los Angeles, where multimillion-dollar houses give the rich and famous sweeping views, authorities tallied four homes destroyed and 11 damaged by a fire that erupted before dawn Wednesday. Firefighters watched for remaining hotspots Thursday.\nFlames there also burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said.\nAcross the wide Interstate 405 freeway from the Bel Air fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were cancelled at 265 schools Thursday.\nTotal damage tallies for all of the wildfires have lagged as fire agencies have focused on battling the flames. Early on, authorities in Ventura County said 150 structures were destroyed there, but that number was expected to increase substantially.\nDamage assessments also remained incomplete for two fires in northern Los Angeles County. Losses from one of those fires included more than two dozen horses that became trapped in a barn in the Sylmar area of Los Angeles.\nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

It can happen easily and innocently. \nA child is hurt, playing sports, or otherwise. And the injury requires pain meds. Advertisement \u00e2\u0080\u0093   \nWhat was once no big deal, is now a major cause for concern: That opioid prescription can lead to addiction. \nSo parents gathered at La Salle Institute Wednesday night to find out more about the family of drugs destroying families and taking lives. \nRobert Bourgeois was there with his 8th grade son. \n\"And I think that's the scary thing. They think it's not going to happen to them, or it's not going to hurt, or I'm only going to do it one time. I'm just going to try this,\" said Bourgeois, who lives in Green Island. \nThe stats are scary. And getting scarier. One in three become addicted. \n\"This is the worst I have seen,\" said Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple who told the audience that drugs will usually wane in popularity. Not heroin. \n\"We have this wheel. I always say wheel of misfortune, and it's got all your marijuana and everything. And usually the drugs will fall off and this drug is just stuck on there like glue.\" \nSo the jails are crowded. The sheriff's office uses a rolling exhibit, a converted bus, complete with a jail cell, to remind kids and others of where the drug can lead them. \nLa Salle Middle School Principal Steve Sgambelluri set up the heroin town hall meeting. \n\"It's trickling down into our kids. And they're getting younger and younger. Unfortunately it's here and It's a problem we want to face head on,\" said Sgambelluri. \nAnd facing it head on begins with prevention. If kids don't try it, they won't become addicts. \nApple says In addition to watching your kids like a hawk, keep track of their medicines. \n\"Monitor the prescription that they're getting. Mom or dad should hold them and dispense them as appropriate.\" Credits Updated: December 06, 2017 11:29 PM Created: December 06, 2017 10:41 PM Copyright 2017 - WNYT-TV, LLC A Hubbard Broadcasting Company Advertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert bourgeois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bourgeois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve sgambelluri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sgambelluri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la salle institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la salle middle school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "llc a hubbard broadcasting company advertisement", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "green island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albany county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:48.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "113a54df3d3d8c9086418ef1453163eee38c0725", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw37pM0ts6wjUDYlgl5D4Rz2n6lk53GSFtuGeyG9Ubm3PLaeSR1zWKjLRyn4RMnHbQCJBfmpvahlJaECs1T9Bij7YOVLVlUTHhnNRchEghRC8c3GhahfACZAh7YKHLqXYmJd0lSLy0lSVSPseptc4zIJrCamYT06zttyK9AyDj3JGy27OieX27", "site_full": "www.gumtree.ie", "site": "gumtree.ie", "site_section": "https://www.gumtree.ie/s-services/maintenance/page-4/v1c9q0p4", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Maintenance Services | Gumtree Classifieds Ireland | P4", "title": "Abrasive Wheels course in Dublin 12 in Polish and English language 217380391", "title_full": "Abrasive Wheels course in Dublin 12 in Polish and English language | Dublin | Gumtree Classifieds Ireland | 217380391", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.092, "main_image": "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDgwMA==/z/koUAAOSwHNxaKQBu/$_20.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 62533, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "113a54df3d3d8c9086418ef1453163eee38c0725", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw37pM0ts6wjUDYlgl5D4Rz2n6lk53GSFtuGeyG9Ubm3PLaeSR1zWKjLRyn4RMnHbQCJBfmpvahlJaECs1T9Bij7YOVLVlUTHhnNRchEghRC8c3GhahfACZAh7YKHLqXYmJd0lSLy0lSVSPseptc4zIJrCamYT06zttyK9AyDj3JGy27OieX27", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "gumtree.ie", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "Abrasive Wheels course in Dublin 12 in Polish and English language 217380391", "text": "50 euro Abrasive Wheels course in Dublin 12\nDuration: 3h\nVenue:Ireland T&T Ltd, 11C Parkmore Industrial Estate, Long Mile Road, Dublin 12, D12 RH39\nOnly 50 euro.\nDiscounted price if you book 3 or more people - only 45 euro pp.\nPrice includes booklets and refreshments.

I'm going to be annoying and repeat that within this article but I really think that it's important to know that.\nLoving someone doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a couple, there are many different forms of love. Friendships, family, loving your animals, etc. All very different forms of love, but alas it's still considered love. Love is about your bond with a person, and sometimes because you love someone who was once your significant other doesn\u2019t mean that you both should be together.\nYou\u2019re able to love someone and care about what happens to them. You have the best interest for them and want them to succeed in life. It's normal to feel love towards someone, but not want to be with them anymore. It's called being in love with someone or just loving someone. There is a difference.\nSometimes being with someone physically can be toxic, you don\u2019t click how you should or how you feel you\u2019re supposed to. Sometimes the person you love can be someone that isn\u2019t good for you, and guess what? That\u2019s okay.\nBy this, I mean don\u2019t hold yourself to the standard of having to date someone because you love them. Some people work better as friends than lovers, but you can still have that love. You still care. You can still create a bond that will never be broken, but it doesn't mean you have to marry that person.\nIf someone is toxic, even if you love them, don\u2019t feel ashamed of letting them go. You always have to do what\u2019s right for you, even if sometimes your heart gets broken in the process. You're allowed to let people go who you once felt everything for but if they're no longer making you happy, there's no point in continuing, even if you feel some sort of love is still present.\nI can promise you\u2019ll have a better and happier life loving someone, who once was a toxic relationship to you, from afar or by just being a friend. You\u2019ll be happier being able to disconnect romantically and love them as a person and friend.\nBecause you love someone, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re meant to be together. I think that\u2019s an important statement that we all need to remember and follow, no matter how hard it may be.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:48.050+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "91fe9c406f9eb3360c9b5fcd013fd4b0e3121032", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9DYT627iGtYJ20XiWvy47.HlQ1kHOXlLfQVOh8OEh4Ck73xKcc5EH4RbA50YM.Z9CrrVJJBLVwxg--", "site_full": "www.carigold.com", "site": "carigold.com", "site_section": "http://www.carigold.com/portal/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=157", "site_categories": ["investing", "non_standard_content", "finance", "adult"], "section_title": "HIGH RISK SECTION - READ FORUM DISCLAIMER CAREFULLY BEFORE JOIN ! - CariGold Forum", "title": "HashLimited - hashlimited.com", "title_full": "HashLimited - hashlimited.com - CariGold Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T22:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.233, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29476, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "91fe9c406f9eb3360c9b5fcd013fd4b0e3121032", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9DYT627iGtYJ20XiWvy47.HlQ1kHOXlLfQVOh8OEh4Ck73xKcc5EH4RbA50YM.Z9CrrVJJBLVwxg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "masforex", "published": "2017-12-06T22:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "HashLimited - hashlimited.com", "text": "Im not admin,\nAbout Us,\nQuote: : HashLimited.com is a U.K. based company, We've spent the past three years trying to make PrimeForex LIMITED into one of the most advanced companies in the field of Forex Trading.

Be aware of the right of first refusal - Talking Property Law", "text": "Posted on 07th December 2017 by Gateleyblogs \nMany prudent developers who construct residential blocks of flats may seek to maximise their returns by selling the freehold reversion to an investor. However, whilst such sales may sound attractive, they can often become protracted and complex \u2013 and one of the principal reasons is the right of first refusal granted to long leasehold tenants under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 (the Act ). \nThere are many investors in the market who are interested in buying the ground rents of such blocks, particularly for large-scale developments. Such a sale can make good sense to a savvy developer as it can result in a cash injection to off-set construction costs and also offers a clear exit strategy from the development site. The timing of any sale can very important in the light of the requirements of the Act. \nUnder the Act, where a landlord intends to sell its freehold interest in a property which comprises multiple flats, the landlord may not make the sale until it has served an offer notice on 90% of the \u201cqualifying tenants\u201d as defined by the Act. Qualifying tenants include not only those tenants who have completed purchases of flats but also those who have exchanged contracts \u201coff plan\u201d. Where more than 50% of flats in a building are held by qualifying tenants, the offer notices under the Act (called section 5 notices) must be served which would allow the tenants to purchase the freehold interest instead of the intended buyer on the same terms. \nIn practice, the service of section 5 notices can cause considerable delays to a freehold reversion sale. The section 5 notices must set out the terms on which the landlord intends to sell the property and must provide the qualifying tenants with a timescale within which to decide whether to exercise their right of first refusal and step into the shoes of the freehold buyer. The shortest timescale which can be stipulated in a section 5 notice is two months. In the intervening time between the serving of the section 5 notices and the expiry of the prescribed timescale, the landlord may not exchange contracts for the freehold sale. \nWhilst the delays to the transaction and logistical and administrative effort of serving section 5 notices on qualifying tenants are troublesome, landlords should also be aware that failure to comply with the Act is a criminal offence subject to an unlimited fine. \nThere are some exemptions under the Act, such as where corporate landlords sell the freehold interest to a company which is associated with them and the onward freehold sale then takes place via a share sale of the associated company rather than a straight forward property sale. It is also possible to avoid the need to serve section 5 where blocks do not yet contain 50% qualifying tenants. \nIt is therefore paramount for landlords to consider their freehold sale options at the outset of a development and to seek specialist legal advice as early as possible. \nThis blog post was written by Residential Development solicitor, Rachel Waugh.

It's a nice goal and the record is important, too. I'm delighted.\" \nRonaldo had scored 11 group-stage goals two seasons ago, the most ever in the competition. He also holds the record for most Champions League goals in a season after scoring 17 in 2013/14. Earlier this year he became the player with the most penalty kick goals in Champions League history, with 12, one more than Lionel Messi. \n\"Any football fan enjoys watching players like Ronaldo,\" Dortmund coach Peter Bosz said. \"His presence and desire to score is so great. He's aggressive. It's brilliant for any football fan to watch.\" \nRonaldo had several other chances to score a second goal and had a strike disallowed for offside near the end of the game. Ronaldo celebrates putting Real Madrid 2-0 up against Borussia Dortmund \nThe Portugal forward has been struggling in the Spanish league, with only two goals in 10 matches, but has scored nine times in his six Champions League games. \nMadrid was in control throughout the match on Wednesday, but Dortmund threatened in counterattacks with their speedy forwards. \nMayoral put the hosts ahead eight minutes into the match with a close-range shot after a move that started with a pass by Ronaldo to Isco inside the area. \nAfter Ronaldo had doubled Madrid's lead, Dortmund pulled a goal back just before halftime with a diving header by Aubameyang following a cross from the left by captain Marcel Schmelzer. \nAubameyang equalized early in the second half with a shot over Keylor Navas after his initial attempt was stopped by the Madrid goalkeeper. \nVazquez' winner came with a low shot from just outside the area after being set up by Theo Hernandez with a header. \n\"We didn't start well enough,\" Bosz said. \"We need to show that we can compete at this level and we did that in both halves. I think that's good for our confidence.\" \nWith nothing to play for in the final group game, Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane rested some regular starters, including Karim Benzema, Luka Modric and Marcelo. He also added some youngsters during the match, including Marcos Llorente, Dani Ceballos and Marco Asensio. \nMadrid defender Raphael Varane left the game before halftime because of an apparent injury. \n\"Varane got injured and things got more difficult,\" Zidane said. \"We changed the setup and system. The final half hour was great, we changed tactics again and things worked out.\" Also See:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ronaldo cristiano ronaldo", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "vazquez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zinedine zidane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronaldo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karim benzema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raphael varane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aubameyang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cristiano ronaldo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dortmund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zidane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bosz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pierre-emerick aubameyang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luka modric", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter bosz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dani ceballos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mateo kovacic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marco asensio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcel schmelzer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcos llorente", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcelo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theo hernandez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucas vazquez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lionel messi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keylor navas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "group h winners tottenham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "borussia dortmund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "real madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dortmund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "borja mayoral", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "santiago bernabeu stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portugal", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:50.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b65ee9b39450d894e7dc551fff75ed06569529aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqrGNRgIF_8DPwrd3_reTjPUao1BXt_aGCa_Ku_m0Y_KXg.2Sp2AWL50wIn4LXaJUkGPf0fiY9idS8gQmES7KNPi0cjKIewlU9bDx2eDfUw8b7ci3RPoaV", "site_full": "healthunlocked.com", "site": "healthunlocked.com", "site_section": "https://healthunlocked.com/couchto5k", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "HealthUnlocked | The social network for health", "title": "HealthUnlocked | The social network for health", "title_full": "HealthUnlocked | The social network for health", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5912, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6e2b6c8cc7766c7f2acacc7e8dde1182ea3323e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqrGNRgIF_8DPwrd3_reTjPUao1BXt_aGCa_Ku_m0Y_KXg.2Sp2AWL50wIn4LXaJUkGPf0fiY9idS8gQmES7KNPi0cjKIewlU9bDx2eDfUw0EoXOeEcsZlXCr22lfYCOI-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Millsie-J", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Nice to hear from you again doubletap!

I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for David Sedaris and his quirky essays ( here\u2019s a review from a while back.) Of course, his humor and tone aren\u2019t for everyone (as evidenced by the friend to whom I loaned Me Talk Pretty One Day who was UNIMPRESSED by the casual drug usage.) Not every writer is for every reader, but if you are a Sedaris fan, you were probably pretty stoked to hear that he was released a new book of his diary entries called Theft by Finding: Diaries (1977-2002) . *I received a complimentary copy of this book through NetGalley and have been hideously tardy in supplying a review for which I apologize. I haven\u2019t accepted any more galleys in recent days given my sporadic (at best) blogging presence.* \n\nLuckily, I found a kindred spirit in my neighbor/book club member/friend Catherine (remember when we threw her a bookish baby shower ?) She is the sweetest, and shares my penchant for both David Sedaris and NPR. Which is why when she found out Sedaris was coming to our little corner of Illinois for a speaking engagement and to promote Theft by Finding , she texted me right away and plans were made.\n\n\nYes, we paid $40 for 2nd balcony tickets and we\u2019d do it again!\n\n\nI insisted on getting tickets in the balcony because the main floor seats in this theater have no center aisle and crawling over people whilst I was 25 or so weeks pregnant sounded AWFUL. Of course, the best laid plans were all for naught, because we still ended up having people crawl over us, but I digress. The fact that I was hauling around a sizable belly and already had swollen ankles (nope, no complications, I just retain water like WOAH) also meant that we opted out of waiting in line for the book signing. Plus, I\u2019m totally intimidated by authors I admire and figured I\u2019d say or do something awkward enough to land me in a future Sedaris anecdote.\n\nThe reading was mostly segments of Theft by Finding and if you\u2019re a fan of Sedaris\u2019s work, it\u2019s a treat. All the weirdness you love about his essays are presented in real life snippets of diaries he\u2019s kept for his entire adult life. The sardonic slice of life observations will delight his fans, and hearing them in his own voice is even better. If you\u2019ve not yet indulged in Sedaris\u2019s self-narrated audio books, I HIGHLY recommend you do so.\n\nThe long and short of it is, if you dig Sedaris, you\u2019ll like Theft by Finding . Go out and grab yourself a copy, bonus points for the audio book. And, should you discover Sedaris is coming to your town, you won\u2019t be disappointed by attending one of his events (if it\u2019s in your budget.) May you be braver than I and get your book signed. He\u2019s rather creative with his inscriptions, I\u2019m having some regrets that I didn\u2019t wait in that line.

Alex Wong / Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 10:54 am \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Strzok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order. Copyright 2017 NPR.

Must have been doing this for 3 years or so. In January I took out a NUBA card from MBNA with a deal for 30 months interest free on purchases and balance transfers. I applied for this using MSE's credit card eligibility checker and all went well. In July I applied for another card - also from MBNA and also offering 30 months interest free. In September I started using it, but noticed a small interest charge on my October statement. My November statement now shows an interest charge of \u00a325. Strange I thought, as I pay off the minimum by direct debit - as I have done with so many other cards in the past.\nSo I contact MBNA and find this... in the small print is a clause which states that whilst the card is interest free on purchases for 30 months - that only counts on purchases made within the first 3 months.\nI have both MBNA card contract booklets and acceptance letters and they are identical save for this very small detail. This second card with the new style of \"30 months interest free\" headline but actually only meaning on the first 3 months purchases was also made through the eligibility calculator. I've just gone through it again and it does not state anywhere the extra terms.\nFrankly, I feel stupid for not treble-checking the details - I'm normally financially savvy. However, in this instance the text is not obvious.\nI am raising a complaint with MBNA and will also contact MSE about their tool and this new type of catch.

After that, you pay for your own college\u2026 Tapos na ako sa iyo [I\u2019m done with my obligations],\u2019\u201d Paw recounts. His father held very decided views, believing that college was not necessary for one to survive. He did not place a premium on education the same way other parents did. \nSays Paw: \u201cI think he was just wired that way, because he wasn\u2019t supported by his own parents. He thought it was fine that I go through the same (experience).\u201d \nThe boy was understandably upset at having to fend for himself. \u201cAt the time, I felt that it was incredibly unfair. My classmates\u2019 only problem was deciding where to go, while there I was thinking of how and where I could get money to pay for tuition.\u201d \nDespite the unusual situation, Paw remained eager to enter college. He asked a cousin, who owned a company distributing basic toiletries, to hire him. He would earn his keep and school money by working on half-day shifts. He started off as the employee who compiled the inventories and later moved on to sales. \nBorne out of necessity That feisty youngster has evolved into a tech magnate with several business brands such as Beyond the Box, Digital Walker, and Baseus under his company Digits Trading. The journey, he relates, was borne out of the sheer necessity to survive. What helped tremendously was his knack for turning a profit, displayed even at a tender age. \n\u201cWe came from a lower middle-class family, but the school I went to was a little higher-end, so all of my classmates got to travel and they had the money to buy the latest shoes and newest toys. The only way I could afford the same luxuries was by making my own money,\u201d explains Paw. \u201cHindi ko kaya humingi nang toys or pera sa parents ko, so gumawa ako ng paraan para sa sarili ko [I couldn\u2019t ask my parents for money or toys, so I became resourceful].\u201d \nThe enterprising tyke began his \u201ccareer\u201d as a junior entrepreneur by selling G.I. Joe action figures and Transformers to friends. When Friday rolled around, he would take orders and payments from classmates, and then with his mom Anita head to Divisoria to buy the playthings. His earnings allowed him to buy as well his own action figures. \u201cI learned everything by instinct. There really wasn\u2019t anyone who taught me how to do business.\u201d \nPaw used this same strategy and diskarte (resourcefulness) to put himself through college \u2013 this time assembling computers, which were the \u201cnew toys of the big boys.\u201d He says: \u201cI didn\u2019t have money as well to buy a computer, so I befriended Arnold Yuen, the owner of PC Corner (the business then was under another name), working out an agreement with him to pay for my PC by installment.\u201d \nAs a working student, Paw spent his spare time hanging around the computer shop, learning by observation how everything worked and was put together. Yuen, noticing Paw\u2019s interest, urged him to assemble and sell computers to his friends. It was a win-win for both men, with Paw as the producer/salesman and his mentor as the supplier of components. Charles Paw is a self-professed techie and gadget geek. \n\u201cI thought it was a great idea! Because after doing the sums, I saw that I could pay for my tuition by selling three to four computers a month,\u201d Paw says. The business inspired grander and more ambitious ideas. Eventually Paw set up Digits Trading, the mega company behind Digital Walker, a one-stop tech accessory store, and Beyond the Box, the local Apple purveyor. He also recently unveiled his newest tech concept, Baseus, which provides an array of more affordable yet quality tech accessories. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking that big in the beginning; I didn\u2019t even have a plan for the next five to 10 years. I just did what I needed to do at that time and diniskartehan ko lang [I found a way to make the business grow].\u201d \nWith almost 60 branches in Metro Manila, Paw has proven himself to be one of the smartest and most successful entrepreneurs in the country \u2013 a stark difference from how his father\u2019s concern panned out. \nPaw relates: \u201cMy dad (who had died several years ago) had his own business, but it was very small because he was a very conservative businessman. He never had staff, never hired employees. He did everything. He was the agent, the salesman, the employee, the collector. It was very small-scale.\u201d \nThis served as an important lesson for Paw. \u201cYou cannot grow if you\u2019re thinking small-scale.\u201d This self-discovered tenet is what he now applies, not only to his tech brands, but his burgeoning food service empire as well. \nDigital to dining A few years ago, Paw dipped his feet into the food and beverage field with his first dining concept, Ramen Bar. \nHe says: \u201cI like to eat. So, whenever I travel, my schedule revolves around where we\u2019re gonna eat and when we\u2019re gonna eat.\u201d At the time, he was ravenous for ramen and was always disheartened to return home, unable to find an authentic Japanese eatery serving his favorite meal. Out of frustration, coupled with spotting a prime opportunity, Paw put up his own noodle hub. Paw with his wife Annabelle in Iceland; Paw meets renowned Michelin-starred chef, Bj\u00f6rn Frantz\u00e9n \nThe reception to the delicacy proved encouraging. Since then, Paw\u2019s drive to satiate the appetites of adventurous foodies also grew. He introduced a gallery of exciting dining concepts under his company, the wittily named Tasteless Food Group. Today, he oversees some of Metro Manila\u2019s most popular dining destinations including Le Petit Souffle, Scout\u2019s Honor, Freezer Burn, Wrong Ramen, Hole in the Wall, Fowlbread, Bad Bird, Ping Pong Diplomacy and The Beef. In addition, the company also operates franchised brands such as Hanamaruken Ramen and Kushikatsu Darumo. \nNew dining propositions such as an \u201conly sausages\u201d outlet and a UK-inspired pizzeria are heating up in the pipeline and ready to be introduced by year-end. An avid traveler, who is thrilled by the vibe and eat-about-town activities of Japan and the UK, Paw is forever cooking up new food scenarios. \nPaw\u2019s diverse business portfolio and aggressive approach to growing his concerns, launching several stores at a time and introducing new service concepts every season, may lead the public to mistake him for being just another power-hungry profiteer. But this is not the case at all. \nAn unassuming fellow \u2013 dressed down in jeans and a simple polo shirt and sporting his signature cross-body bag \u2013 Paw explains that he\u2019s just so driven and bursting with a raft of novel schemes. Great ideas are hard to come by, so why waste them? \nPaw revels in his hectic lifestyle but confesses to challenges, saying: \u201cWith so many things going on, it does get a bit confusing. It\u2019s wrong, I know, but I\u2019m learning how to better manage everything. I\u2019m thankful that I have my brother Howard, who is working with me, and my wife Annabelle, who is more organized, as well as a great, hardworking core team.\u201d \nThe next phase of development, he says, involves putting \u201cmore order\u201d into their network. \u201cWe will be focusing on scaling up. We\u2019re weeding out the ones (the businesses) that aren\u2019t doing well and scaling up those that are.\u201d \nHow does Paw determine what will fly and what won\u2019t? \u201cIt has to be profitable, of course,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that the most profitable enterprises \u2013 food or otherwise \u2013 are those that cater to a larger denominator. If you want to be successful, go for the basics.\u201d \nFor newbie concepts, Paw follows one rule of thumb. He is willing to invest at most P15 million and gives the business two years to earn its ROI (return on investment). \u201cI now only choose those business ideas, which I can envision growing to at least 10 to 12 stores.\u201d Digital Walker now has 30 branches across the metro \nBut it can be dicey at the start to gauge a concept\u2019s future, admits Paw. One of his most memorable \u201cfailures\u201d involved Shop 88, which sold homeware and other knick-knacks for P88. \u201cI learned a little too late from that particular business idea, I had to have several branches open at a time, minimum 20, because sukis (patrons) always wanted something new. Which is hard if you just have one branch.\u201d Different businesses need different strategies, he says. \nReflecting on the string of successes and failures experienced in the past, Paw declares: \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to say which business ideas will fly and which will flop. But I\u2019ve always been a positive thinker. \n\u201cThis has paid off tremendously because the success of those that flew definitely has made up for losses I\u2019ve incurred with the \u2018failures.\u2019 So when it comes to business, my advice to aspiring entrepreneurs is don\u2019t be afraid to take risks.\u201d \nPaw is obviously game for life\u2019s adventures. \nBETWEEN GOOD AND GREAT The tech mogul and restaurateur shares the qualities he believes spells the difference between a good businessman and a great entrepreneur. \n\u2022 HAVE PASSION As clich\u00e9 as it sounds, being passionate about your business is what will carry it over from something that\u2019s simply sustaining your lifestyle (survival) to a brand worth building. If you don\u2019t have a singular passion, go into something that\u2019s at the very least interesting to you. \n\u2022 MAY DISKARTE Be intuitive, resourceful and be creative in the ways you think of solutions to problems. Get things done! \n\u2022 KNOW HOW TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS I learned from my cousin that good business is founded on mutual trust and respect. Learn how to build and maintain relationships. It\u2019s a fundamental in business. \n\u2022 BE A POSITIVE THINKER If you think positively, that\u2019ll allow to become a bigger risk taker.

information at a brokerage house in Shanghai, China November 24, 2017. REUTERS/Aly Song More By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rose to its highest level in two weeks on Thursday over optimism the United States would successfully push through tax reforms, while world shares rebounded after two straight days of losses. The U.S. currency slipped against the safe-haven Japanese yen on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel - a move that imperiled Middle East peace efforts and provoked widespread condemnation. But amidst a broader climb in global stocks on Thursday, the greenback rose 0.3 percent against the yen to trade at 112.60 yen (=JPY), and hit a two-week high against a basket of peers. (.DXY) The MSCI World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent. Underpinning some of the dollar's gains analysts said was some cautious optimism on progress over U.S. tax reforms. U.S. Senate Republicans agreed to talks with the House of Representatives on sweeping tax legislation on Wednesday, amid early signs that lawmakers could bridge their differences and agree on a final bill ahead of a self-imposed Dec. 22 deadline. \"The dollar is fighting back a little bit but there\u2019s still some caution, as it could still be a few weeks until we know the outcome of the tax reform bill,\" said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley, in London. \"The yen will be sensitive if geopolitical tensions rise again, and I think there\u2019s an inevitability to that, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be too much updside for dollar/yen in this environment,\" she added. Upbeat U.S. private-sector employment data released on Wednesday also provided some support to the dollar. But strategists said the currency would trade in narrow ranges until the release of the closely watched non-farm payrolls report on Friday. Bitcoin soared to a record high of more than $14,500, up almost 7 percent on the day and continuing a staggering surge from less than $1,000 at the beginning of the year. STOCKS RECOVER European stock markets appeared to take their cues from a general recovery in tech stocks overnight in Asia and Wall Street. The pan-European STOXX 600 (.STOXX) was up 0.2 percent with tech stocks (.SX8P) initially up 0.5 percent. Financials, industrials and healthcare shares also added points to the index. \"We have seen some aggressive moves in Asia, whereas Europe seems to be a bit more subdued,\" said David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets in London. \"It's almost like European markets look for an excuse to selloff but it takes them a lot to be convinced to actually push higher.\" Shares in the energy sector, which weighed on shares earlier in Wall Street and Asia, rose in Europe, as oil prices recovered from a big fall on Wednesday. [O/R] U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLc1) traded at $56.13 per barrel in European trade, up 0.3 percent on the day. Brent futures (LCOc1) gained 0.4 percent to $61.45 per barrel. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> edged up 0.2 percent as some technology bellwethers rebounded, with Tencent <0700.HK> rising over 3 percent and Alibaba (BABA.K) more than 2 percent. In Japan, the Nikkei (.N225) jumped 1.5 percent, recouping much of its 2.0 percent loss the previous day, which was its biggest fall since late March. The price of copper, seen as a barometer of global economic health because of its extensive industrial use, also fell sharply earlier this week, raising worries about the world growth outlook. Copper (CMCU3) traded at $6,576 a tonne, up 0.5 percent on the day and above a two-month low of $6,507.5 touched on Tuesday.

(AP) - They ran for their lives by the thousands when the devastating wildfires raced across a huge swath of brush-covered Southern California hillsides, and they survived even if their homes didn't. Some lost everything. Others returned to find their homes still standing but put in danger a second time when flames that had seemed to spare them returned, pushed back in their direction by unpredictable winds. Here are some stories of evacuees. \n___ Advertisement \u00e2\u0080\u0093   \nSteve Andruszkewicz and his neighbor Joseph Ruffner returned to their Faria Beach Colony homes just north of Ventura on Thursday to discover the flames that appeared to have spared the houses were threatening them once again. \n\"I thought we were done yesterday,\" Ruffner said, adding he and his family returned to their home in the morning to see a wall of fire that seemed to be a safe distance away. But then it moved in, spraying hot embers onto the neighborhood. \n\"It's coming back to burn what it didn't burn yesterday,\" he said. \nFirefighters urged people to leave the beachfront community, where electricity was out. \n\"We're leaving,\" Andruszkewicz said as he and his wife sprayed palm trees with water from garden hoses first. \n\"We left Tuesday night and stayed down at our son's house,\" he continued. \"We came back yesterday, stayed the night. (But) this has got me worried because of the blowing embers.\" \nRuffner said he was staying put this time. \n\"I bought a generator yesterday so at least I can see on TV what's going on,\" he said. \n___ \nMarolyn Romero-Sim wept as she sat on a cot at an evacuation center recounting how the modest RV her family called home was destroyed by the largest and most destructive Southern California wildfire. \n\"Everything is ashes. Everything. We don't have a place to live. We lost stuff we can't get back,\" she said. \nShe said her husband, Hugo Romero-Rodriguez, was wracked with guilt that he couldn't get inside to rescue anything - including their beloved little dog, Coqueta. She was trapped in a crate inside when the vehicle erupted in flames. Romero-Rodriguez suffered cuts on his leg and hand and a burn on his arm trying to get inside to save Coqueta. \n\"He was sitting there in the driver's seat and he couldn't move,\"Romero-Sim said Wednesday, recalling how she, her husband and their 9-year-old daughter, Milagros, sat in their truck, watching the RV burn before finally realizing they had to flee their Ventura County neighborhood. \n\"He just kept watching and he feels so guilty that he couldn't save it,\" she continued. \"I told him he did everything he could and he did what he had to save our lives.\" \nRomero-Rodriguez makes a modest living as a jewelry salesman and he lost the pearls, earrings, bracelets and watches that made up his inventory. \n___ \nRogers reported from Los Angeles.
