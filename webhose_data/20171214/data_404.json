The only thing that does not work, and never has since I have had the machine, is apparently the LT-5 engine can be rocked using the flippers when the third multiball is captured for extra points. In this machine it does not rock, but it does not effect game play at all. The multiball works completely. I have been told that since these machines are over 20 years old, very few of the machines have the 'engine rocking' feature that works.\nThe machine is a ton of fun and it also makes a fantastic, stylish decor piece in your home.

Batchelder", "text": "  \nS. DENNIS - Nancy Ober Batchelder, 84, one of life's nicest and caring people, died on December 4 at the Cape Cod Hospital. She leaves her husband Earle, with whom she enjoyed 58 years of love, laughter, an occasional tear, and a totally loving family. \nNancy was born and raised in Beverly, MA, the daughter of Edward and Evelyn Ober. She attended Beverly schools, the Walnut Hill School in Natick, and Colby Junior College in NH. Born into moderate affluence, she grew to be remarkably unaffected, enjoying friendships with people from all walks of life. \nIn 1959, she married Earle Batchelder and moved to Bradford, MA, where they had their first two sons, Mark and Peter. In 1962, they moved to Natick, where they spent thirteen happy years, Earle as Headmaster of the Walnut Hill School. During that period, they added Douglas and Edward to the family. Nancy performed enthusiastically not only in her role as mother and wife, but also as friend, counselor and hostess to students, faculty, alumnae, trustees, trades people, and visiting dignitaries. \nIn 1975, Nancy and Earle moved to Cape Cod, where Earle joined the administration of the Dennis-Yarmouth School System. Three years later, they moved to Erie, PA, and Nancy became Director of the Girard Senior Center. Again, her capacity to relate warmly to people of all walks of life endeared her to all who came to know her. Nancy and Earle's next move was to Longmeadow, MA, where Nancy continued her work in senior services, as a case worker, director of volunteers, and unofficial morale booster for the Greater Springfield Senior Services. Here again, her indomitable good spirit prevailed. \nNancy and Earle retired to the Cape in 1999. Since that time, Nancy enjoyed golf, bridge, poker, and many social get-togethers, both formal and informal. Her smile and her cheerful attitude will be remembered by many fortunate enough to have known her. \nShe is survived by her husband, Earle, their sons and their families: Mark, his wife, Robin, and their daughters Hannah and Haley; Peter, his wife, Kim, and Owen and Lily of Amherst, NH; Douglas, his wife, Erin, and Joshua, Evie, and Nason, of Topsfield; and Edward, his wife, Wendy and Hayden of Bridgewater, all of whom adored her. She is also survived by her sister-in-law, Virginia Ober, of Fort Lauderdale, FL, a nephew, Scott Ober, and his wife, Stacy, and a niece, Elizabeth (Marney) Ayres, of Medina, OH. \nRelatives and friends are invited to attend a funeral service on Saturday, December 9, 2017 at 1:00 PM in the Dennis Union Church, Route 6A, Dennis, MA followed by a celebration of her life at Encore Restaurant, 36 Hope Lane, Dennis. \nIn lieu of flowers, those who wish to remember her are encouraged to give to the charity of their choice, or to the Cape Cod Needy Fund, in her honor.", "highlightText": "",

Born in San Francisco, CA in 1948 to her late parents, John and Mildred \"Mims\" Kessler, Sandie spent her early years living in many places in the US and Europe, as the daughter of a US Air Force Officer. \nSandie graduated from Northeast High School in Lincoln, NE in 1965, and then returned to Massachusetts, where the majority of her extended family lived. She attended Bridgewater State University and graduated as an English major in 1969, later moving to Cape Cod in 1975. She spent the majority of her career working for the Town of Harwich at the Water Department. \nSandie was known to so many by her bright smile and kind heart, and knew just how to make people feel special. She never forgot a birthday or a special occasion, and sent cards with heartfelt hand-written messages. She shared a very special bond with her daughter, Amy, and when they laughed together it was contagious. Known to many as \"Amy's Mom\", especially to the D-Y Track and Cross Country teams in the late 1980's, Sandie was always attending meets, cheering on the Dolphin runners, and bringing her famous home-made cookies and brownies for the team; she was their biggest fan. \nSandie loved the Red Sox, the first Captain Frosty's meal of the season, and going out for ice cream - all of which indicated that summer was here. She delighted in an uncrowded beach, and watching the sunset over the bay. Over the years, Sandie and her husband John traveled to Marco Island, Florida, and especially looked forward to their trips out to visit their daughter Amy in Colorado, and Amy's visits home to the Cape. \nSandie leaves behind her loving husband John Pope, her daughter and best friend Amy Hennessey, and her brother John Kessler and his wife Susan. She will also be greatly missed by her niece, nephew, stepsons, cousins and their families. \nMemorial donations may be made in Sandie's name to: VNA of Cape Cod Hospice and Palliative Care, 434 Route 134, Suite D-3, South Dennis, MA 02660 or online at: www.capecodhealth.org/give or to Cape Abilities, c/o Nancy Noble, 895 Mary Dunn Road, Hyannis, MA 02601 or online at: www.capeabilities.org \nRelatives and friends are invited to join us in celebrating Sandie's life on Sunday, December 17th, from 1:00 to 4:00pm at The Dennis Inn, 25 Scarsdale Road in Dennis, MA. A burial at the Massachusetts National Cemetery in Bourne is planned for a later date.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

But for every partition, there is some segment of the partition which contains $x = 1$ for which the lower sum is then zero, and the upper sum is one. We need to show that this difference can be made less than epsilon for all epsilon. But this is fairly simple, because we simply make the interval containing $x=1$ very small, depending on the value of epsilon. For example, if we are trying to \"challenge\" $\\epsilon/2$ then we can make the interval containing $x=1$ less than $\\epsilon/3$ and we meet the integrability criterion.

In this Sept. 30, 2014, file photo, Garrison Keillor talks with Daily Circuit host Tom Weber in the studios at Minnesota Public Radio in St. Paul, Minn. \nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - The president of Minnesota Public Radio told employees the decision to dismiss Garrison Keillor resulted from \"multiple allegations\" covering an extended period of time, but an attorney for the former \"The Prairie Home Companion\" host disputed that characterization and said the humorist wants MPR to \"set the record straight.\" \nMPR President Jon McTaggart held an off-the-record meeting with employees Wednesday, a week after the organization cut ties with Keillor. Reporters from Minnesota Public Radio News did not attend because the meeting was declared off-the-record, but compiled an account from employees who did attend. \nMPR News reports McTaggart said he alone made the decision to break with Keillor, who retired as \"Prairie Home\" host last year. Keillor told the Star Tribune he touched a woman's bare back as he tried to console her, and that he apologized.

(AP) - The Latest on Southern California wildfires (all times local): \n10:30 p.m. \nA surge from the biggest of the wildfires burning in Southern California has forced several thousand more people to evacuate in a community of artists and resorts. \nVentura County sheriff's Sgt. Eric Buschow says flames have been creeping closer and slowly surrounding the town of Ojai (OH'hi), and on Tuesday night increasing winds brought them close enough to expand evacuation orders there. \nFlames, now about 4 miles away, were visible from the city's downtown for the first time on Tuesday night, and ash was raining down. \nParts of Ojai were already under evacuation orders, and the entire valley surrounding it had been under a voluntary evacuation advisory since the fire broke out on Monday. \nThe new evacuations meant most of the town of about 7,000 people was under mandatory orders. \nNearly 30,000 people are under evacuation orders for the fire. \n___ \n7:50 p.m. \nThe largest and most destructive wildfire in Southern California has grown to 140 square miles and fire officials say the worst may be yet to come. \nThe 90,000-acre fire burning in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles has swept through ridges and canyons to the sea and Santa Ana winds that drove it are expected to return with a vengeance overnight. \nState fire director Ken Pimlott says winds that eased in the afternoon could return with gusts up to 80 mph Thursday that would make it impossible to fight the fire. \nDozens of homes have burned since the blaze erupted Monday. Nearly 1,800 firefighters and a fleet of aircraft are fighting the flames but the blaze is only 5 percent contained and an estimated 12,000 buildings are in danger. \n___ \n6:20 p.m. \nA wildfire in a wealthy western area of Los Angeles has reached the estate and winery owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch. \nRoxanne Langer at Moraga Vineyards in Bel Air says a temperature-controlled wine storage shed burned after the fire erupted before dawn Wednesday but it's unclear how much wine was lost. \nShe says firefighters stepped in to douse the flames with the aid of helicopters and that other storage sheds, the winery itself and the estate's unoccupied house are not damaged. \nThe winery has been evacuated. \nMurdoch bought the property for about $30 million in 2013. \nLanger says it appears the 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines suffered only slight damage and the grapes already had been harvested. \nIn a Facebook statement, Murdoch says some neighbors suffered heavy losses and his thoughts and prayers are with them. \n___ \n3:45 p.m. \nFirefighters have stopped the spread of a wildfire that has destroyed homes near the world-famous Getty museum in Los Angeles. \nDeputy Fire Chief Charles Butler says firefighters and aircraft stopped the growth of the 475-acre (192-hectare) blaze in the Bel Air neighborhood. \nThere are currently few visible flames and crews are concentrating on the southwest corner of the fire. \nButler says four homes have been destroyed and 11 damaged since the blaze erupted before dawn Wednesday in an area that includes many hilltop mansions. \nAbout 700 homes, an apartment building and a school have been ordered evacuated. \nNortheast winds driving the flames eased by afternoon but are expected to return in full force Wednesday night. Firefighters are struggling to ring the blaze before that happens. \n___ \n3:15 p.m. \nCalifornia's top firefighter says the state is in for the worst Santa Ana wind conditions it's ever seen. \nKen Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, says the wind wildfire threat to Southern California for Thursday is purple. The has color has never been used before, means there is extreme danger and that fires that erupt will burn uncontrollably. \nBelow that is red, meaning high danger of fires that burn rapidly and intensely and are difficult to control. \nPimlott says the winds could hit 80 mph (129 kph) and make it impossible to fight Southern California wildfires that have destroyed at least 200 homes and buildings. \nFive wind-driven flames continue to threaten homes in Ventura and Los Angeles. Some 200,000 people are under evacuation orders. \n___ \n1:25 p.m. \nThe University of California, Los Angeles, has canceled classes for the rest of the day due to difficult traffic problems stemming from a wildfire. \nThe university's website says many students, faculty and staff have been unable to reach the campus Wednesday, so classes from noon onward are canceled. \nThe athletics department says a night men's basketball game and all other team workouts and practices are canceled. \nThe fire erupted before dawn in the Sepulveda Pass, just up Interstate 405 from UCLA. The fire has destroyed some homes as it spread into the Bel Air area. \n___ \n10 a.m. \nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti says at least four and possibly six homes have been destroyed by a wildfire in the city's Bel Air area. \nThe fire erupted before dawn Wednesday in Sepulveda Pass, a major commuter route between the west side of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to the north. \nThe fire burned up hillsides on the east side of the pass into expensive neighborhoods that are now under evacuation orders. \nThe mayor says the fire is now 150 acres with zero containment. \nSome 500 firefighters are battling the fire along with water-dropping helicopters and airplanes laying down streams of fire retardant. \nThe dangerous Santa Ana winds that have fanned fires across Southern California this week have diminished over the new LA fire but conditions are very dry, with just 9 percent relative humidity. \n___ \n9:15 a.m. \nPresident Donald Trump says his thoughts and prayers \"are with everyone\" in the path of California's latest wildfires. \nTrump in a tweet is also encouraging everyone \"to heed the advice and orders of local and state officials\" and thanking first responders for their \"incredible work!\" \nWind-driven fires have raced through California communities for the second time in two months, leaving hundreds of homes feared lost and uprooting tens of thousands of people. \nThe most damaging fire is in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, where more than 100 square miles (259 sq. kilometers) and numerous homes have burned. \nDeadly fires tore through Northern California earlier this year. \n___ \n8:03 a.m. \nThe biggest and most destructive of several wildfires burning in Southern California has scorched more than 101 square miles. \nState fire authorities say the fire burning in Ventura County about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles is also considered a threat to 12,000 structures Wednesday. \nDozens of homes have burned since the fire erupted Monday amid fierce Santa Ana winds. \nA new fire burning among ridges and canyons on the west side of Los Angeles has also burned several homes while snarling morning commuter traffic. \n___ \n7:35 a.m. \nTwo homes are burning in a wildfire that has erupted in an exclusive ridge-top neighborhood in Los Angeles, the latest to hit fire-plagued Southern California. \nThe fire broke out before dawn Wednesday on the east side of Interstate 405 in the Sepulveda Pass and raced up steep slopes into neighborhoods at the top. \nThe Los Angeles Fire Department has deployed hundreds of firefighters and called in helicopters and airplanes. \nEvacuations have been ordered and a wider area has been told to be ready for orders to leave. \nIt's the same region of Los Angeles where hundreds of homes burned in the famous 1961 Bel Air Fire. \n___ \n6:52 a.m. \nMandatory evacuations have been ordered in an exclusive ridge-top neighborhood in Los Angeles as a dangerous new wildfire burns in Southern California. \nThe fire erupted before dawn Wednesday on the east side of Sepulveda Pass, which carries heavily traveled Interstate 405 through the Santa Monica Mountains on the city's western side. \nHelicopters are making water drops and more than 200 firefighters are battling flames close to homes. \nIn addition to the mandatory evacuations, Los Angeles Fire Department spokeswoman Margaret Stewart says a wider area on the east side of the pass has been advised to get ready in case of evacuation orders. \n___ \n5:35 a.m. \nA brush fire has erupted on the west side of Los Angeles along Interstate 405 in Sepulveda Pass. \nFire Department spokesman Margaret Stewart says the fire was reported at 4:52 a.m. Wednesday and is burning uphill, driven by topography rather than winds. \nStewart says 47 firefighters are on the scene, setting up protection for homes at the top of the steep slopes. Two firefighting helicopters have been assigned. \nSepulveda Pass carries heavily traveled Interstate 405 through the Santa Monica Mountains between the western neighborhoods of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to the north. \n___ \n12:40 a.m. \nThe same vicious winds that made three Southern California wildfires so destructive are also making the firefight itself more difficult. \nThe water-dropping planes and helicopters essential to fighting massive fires have been mostly grounded because it's too dangerous to fly in the strong gusts. \nCommanders hoped to have them back in the air on Wednesday morning, but all indications are the winds will be whipping then too. \nThe blazes brought evacuation orders for nearly 200,000 people, destroyed nearly 200 homes and have remained mostly out control. \nThe largest and most destructive of the blazes, an 85-square-mile wildfire in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, had nearly reached the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday night after starting 30 miles inland a day earlier. \n___ \nThe 5:35 a.m. entry has been corrected to say west side.

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

During eating periods, you should eat whole, natural foods, but still eat normally, without worrying about calories. When you fast, you can (and should) drink plenty of water, as well as coffee and tea. It\u2019s a great alternative to continuous, daily calorie-counting. Your overall calorie consumption decreases without you having to worry about it, thanks to your regular periods of fasting. There are several different intermittent fasting methods you can try, so you can find one that works with your body\u2019s natural appetite and eating pattern. If you have a chronic condition, however, you should check with your doctor before you start. Many people find intermittent fasting to be a sustainable weight-loss plan, so here are 5 ways to lose weight using intermittent fasting. 1. Reduce calorie intake. \nThe biggest way in which intermittent fasting helps weight loss is that it reduces the number of calories that you consume. When you eat fewer calories, you lose weight. 2. Increase level of human growth hormone. \nHuman growth hormone helps your body burn fat and build muscle, and it increases when you fast. OUR LATEST VIDEOS 3. Increase release of norepinephrine. \nNorepinephrine is another powerful fat-burning hormone, and your nervous system sends it to your fat cells when you fast. 4. Improve insulin response. \nInsulin helps regulate blood sugar. People with lower sensitivity to insulin are at a higher risk for obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Some studies have shown that intermittent fasting can improve insulin sensitivity. 5. Use a sustainable method. \nA weight-loss program has to be sustainable to be effective, and intermittent fasting is sustainable. Once you get used to your eating schedule, you can stop thinking about it. You should still be eating healthy foods, but you shouldn\u2019t obsess over what you eat.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:41.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b09a714708b2f94e83efa90881c59a453b118cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye9kEXllFDlY3bq92pHHGuPt", "site_full": "texasfishingforum.com", "site": "texasfishingforum.com", "site_section": "http://texasfishingforum.com/forums/ubbthreads.php/forums/27/1/", "site_categories": ["saltwater_fishing", "freshwater_fishing", "fly_fishing", "sports"], "section_title": "Kayak Fishing | Texas Fishing Forum", "title": "380 greenbelt", "title_full": "380 greenbelt | Kayak Fishing | Texas Fishing Forum", "published": "2017-12-05T01:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "50a9887c47e5a1b299596ef39c696d4883519941", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye9kEXllFDlY3VB.XnvU6cFMs2TiLjDzleg-", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "kdub#1", "published": "2017-12-06T16:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "yessir sending a pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:41.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b09a714708b2f94e83efa90881c59a453b118cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye9kEXllFDlY3bq92pHHGuPt", "site_full": "texasfishingforum.com", "site": "texasfishingforum.com", "site_section": "http://texasfishingforum.com/forums/ubbthreads.php/forums/27/1/", "site_categories": ["saltwater_fishing", "freshwater_fishing", "fly_fishing", "sports"], "section_title": "Kayak Fishing | Texas Fishing Forum", "title": "380 greenbelt", "title_full": "380 greenbelt | Kayak Fishing | Texas Fishing Forum", "published": "2017-12-05T01:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6614c2f18ea21028a29cf24c5d5940e5d982577", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye9kEXllFDlY3VB.XnvU6cFMaHSq1oGxpfI-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Joe Slab", "published": "2017-12-05T03:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I hear ya.

Huge study putting 3-D scans to the test 2017-12-07T09:00:46Z 2017-12-07T16:42:20Z (Montefiore Health System via AP). In this Nov. 21, 2017, photo provided by the Montefiore Health System, Dr. Tova Koenigsberg at The Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care in New York shows an example of a traditional mammogram scan. \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.
