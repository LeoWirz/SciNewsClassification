Also, the anti-graft agency has  arrested  a retired Appeal Court judge, Justice Mohammed Tsamiya, for allegedly demanding a N200m bribe in exchange for a favourable judgment in a National Assembly election case that was pending before the Imo State Judicial Division of the Court of Appeal. The ICPC said in a statement by its spokesperson, Mrs. Rasheedat Okoduwa, that many, who bought government properties, had yet to make full payment while some others were secretly renting the properties to private citizens. The anti-graft agency said most of the culprits were in the Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation and the Federal Housing Authority. The statement read in part, \u201cIn recent times, the ICPC has been inundated with petitions from patriotic Nigerians, drawing the attention of the commission to allegations of widespread abuse of the policy by beneficiaries and some government workers. \u201cThe commission, while acting on the petitions, discovered through preliminary investigation that a number of civil servants in the OHCSF, who benefited from the policy had not paid for the houses since 2005. While some had completely defaulted, others owe the government a sizeable amount of the money. \u201cThe investigation further revealed that 32,305 houses were captured by the committee on the sale of government properties while 24,345 were eventually sold to beneficiaries. \u201cHowever, civil servants in some government agencies, notably OHSCF and the Federal Housing Authority, have allegedly turned the policy into a shoddy business with the aim of defrauding the Federal Government.\u201d The ICPC said it also found out that some public servants and government agencies were concealing government properties and collecting rent on same without the consent of the Federal Government. This, the agency noted, flouted the intent of the policy that primarily focuses on divesting government\u2019s interest from providing housing for its employees. The commission said an employee of the OHSCF allocated some of the houses to undeserving beneficiaries who were not public servants at the time of the exercise and some of the properties had yet to be allocated. It added, \u201cThe investigation has so far yielded fruitful result with the recovery of N18, 031,000 from some civil servants and a host of companies including Montgomery & Campbell Ltd. and SICCONS, which has been paid into the coffers of the government.\u201d The ICPC vowed that anyone found to have contravened the law would be prosecuted upon conclusion of the investigation. Meanwhile, the commission says it has arrested a retired Justice of the Court of Appeal, Justice Mohammed Tsamiya, for allegedly demanding N200m bribe from one Mr. Nnamdi Orji, in exchange for a favourable judgment in a National Assembly election case that was pending before the Imo State Judicial Division of the Court of Appeal. The ICPC said the offence, which violates Section 10 of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000, was alleged to have been committed in 2015, when the retired Justice asked Orji, who was the candidate of the All Progressive Grand Alliance for the Arochukwu/Ohafia Federal Constituency, to give him N200m to enable him to influence the court\u2019s decision in his favour. Orji had approached the Court of Appeal, Imo State Division, to seek redress in a case involving an alleged inflation of the result of election in the Arochukwu Local Government Area of Abia State, which he had earlier lost to his opponent, Mr. Nkole Ndukwe, at the National Assembly Election Petition Tribunal. The retired judge was alleged to have assured the appellant of getting a favourable judgment from the court upon the payment of the money. \u201cJustice Tsamiya has since been granted bail by the commission upon the fulfilment of his bail conditions even as investigation continues,\u201d the ICPC added.

I understand why supporters are upset.Certainly, the club is issuing the warning in regards of a warning issued to them from a county body that \"has the power to revoke the club`s safety certificate\".I have followed football long enough and seen enough games outside of England, of which on any given day you have supporters being stabbed in the stands, to personally state that the current situation is almost comical.Carrow Road is indeed one of the safest grounds in England, and probably would top the safety list in the world - only losing closely against the soccer grounds in the United States some of which are comparable to going to Disneyland.Yes, standing is not allowed after the Hillsborough disaster in any of the top two divisions. Nevertheless, evolution is essentially work in progress, and the club board plus the fans agree that \"safe standing\" is achievable - maybe necessary.What is it expected from supporters? I fear that at some point lights will be installed in the back of every seat to alert the stewards when someone stands up. Or in the near future supporters will be asked to wear a neck collar - like the one Windom Earle installed on Leo Johnson in nineties TV show Twin Peaks - so if you stand up during the match a burst of electric current will shock you.But my main worry is that if Mr. Farke`s pupils don`t perform at the weekend, things could actually get a bit nasty, I`m afraid to say.OTBC", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "windom earle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leo johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "farke", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "carrow road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leeds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillsborough", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:25.037+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba356b4a92ed01f6dc1ca5d154f39b5cb7bd0d5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRlC6L2XJZCIj5B152kwWH8QLxo2P57EhCLuoCe.HBIK.3uLRgxLrFIHVRbI9Tb1I1pJ2b7ICtd26WBHUubC_wWH4yCIMC4Bbn76t90Vr7AJSJ2FF12Ro28kHIRURLxjbXm0900hMTzuCI.kzUGrUZQnvUpUhbHPvtEV.DTl7u1qDD7u5Cq9V9b", "site_full": "www.chevyhhr.net", "site": "chevyhhr.net", "site_section": "https://www.chevyhhr.net/forums/specific-technical-discussion-23/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Specific Technical Discussion - Chevy HHR Network", "title": "Anybody noticed the bolt size change on the TTR Rear Sway Bar", "title_full": "Anybody noticed the bolt size change on the TTR Rear Sway Bar - Chevy HHR Network", "published": "2017-12-05T20:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f367a42fd59dd31272b6980b490faa35c699845c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRlC6L2XJZCIj5B152kwWH8QLxo2P57EhCLuoCe.HBIK.3uLRgxLrFIHVRbI9Tb1I1pJ2b7ICtd26WBHUubC_wWH4yCIMC4Bbn76t90Vr7AJSJ2FF12Ro28kHIRURLxjbXm0900hMTzuCI.kzUGrUZQnvUpUhbHPvtEV.DTl7u1qE3PE290chiONTZ4O5uqk3o-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Cat Man HHR", "published": "2017-12-05T21:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Don't need to let it sit.

The sheet he had wrapped her body in, bin and her clothes, were dumped nearby. \nTango was arrested on March 28 and, when police did a background check on him, they found that he had been arrested twice before on accusations of rape, in cases that date back to 2008 and 2012 respectively. \nThis left questions over whether Stacha\u2019s death could have been avoided. \nIn the 2008 allegation of rape, a 14-year-old girl had a child as a result of what Tango, who is now in his early thirties, claimed was consensual sex. \nThe alleged victim lived with Tango for three years after that. Tango said in his plea agreement that she withdrew the case against him after consultation with her mother. The child is 8-years-old now. He denies that he raped the child\u2019s mother. \nProsecutor Maresa Engelbrecht said that the teen sometimes gave consent and sometimes not, and regarded her whole situation as \u201cnormal\u201d. \nIn the other case, a teenager had gone off with Tango to smoke dagga. He claimed they had consensual sex and that he did not rape her as alleged. \nTango\u2019s defence lawyer, Koos Smit, accused the State of dredging up old allegations just to make their case against Tango stronger. \nJudge Robert Henney posed extensive questions to investigating officer Leslie Dahlmini over why those cases fizzled out and were withdrawn. \nHenney said that the complainants had testified that they were waiting to be contacted to go to court. \nDahlmini told him that he battled to track them down and get them to court as witnesses, in spite of leaving several messages and going to their homes. \nIn one of his attempts, he was told the complainant had gone on holiday with Tango. \nEventually, the prosecuting authority decided to withdraw the cases against him. \nHenney reserved judgment until Thursday. \n[Source: News24 ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "randy tango", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dahlmini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert henney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maresa engelbrecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koos smit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leslie dahlmini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stacha arends", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stacha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henney", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western cape high court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "matroosberg street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stacha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitchells plain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:26.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b44be8ed301bdb7ef92b4f5f766be7d8e743df45", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB6x2uybzHMbgi.nHkHj.Y5AcX6VZIOr_vlZ7N.ctmM0_SvQxt_J2j2tktfFyGh_M8QDno.mwLB3VMDMmU9Qqlqj", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "1968 Yardbirds sessions to see release?! | Page 52", "title_full": "1968 Yardbirds sessions to see release?! | Page 52 | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T01:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/67/67053.jpg?1512631401", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b44be8ed301bdb7ef92b4f5f766be7d8e743df45", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB6x2uybzHMbgi.nHkHj.Y5AcX6VZIOr_vlZ7N.ctmM0_SvQxt_J2j2tktfFyGh_M8QDno.mwLB3VMDMmU9Qqlqj", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Zack", "published": "2017-12-06T01:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "1968 Yardbirds sessions to see release?! | Page 52", "text": "notesfrom said: \u2191 I hear bits of 'Over The Hills' in the 'White Summer's.

U.S. health of... \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

First part can be found on page 50, post #1237\nHappenings Ten Years Time Ago part 3\nQ: Once again, myth says that when you played live \"Glimpses\" would involve a light show and movies being projected behind the band. True?\nJM: We tried to get those things together, but we never got around to it. I remember that we had this incense burner, one of those metal things you carry around, that Keith would swing. And we\u2019d have candles. We didn\u2019t actually have a light show. Some of these gigs we played had light shows anyway. So we didn\u2019t have to worry about carrying them around.\nQ: Did you notice a difference in the British and American light shows?\nJM: I can\u2019t really remember. There was a club called UFO in London that had a light show. I remember going to the Fillmore to see the Airplane. It was the woman before Grace Slick (ed. note: Signe Anderson). I thought, \"Oh, this is great.\" It was the first light show I\u2019d ever seen. All this sort of moving things, dancing around, this great big blob and all these films going.\nQ: Speaking of the UFO, you saw Syd Barrett\u2019s Pink Floyd, right?\nJM: It was at Hammersmith Olympia. Hendrix was on as well. It was a bit of a flip out! I can\u2019t remember. We were probably tripping out! (laughs) I actually bought the single \"See Emily Play!\"\nQ: What do you consider the band\u2019s best psychedelic song?\nJM: It would have to be \"Happenings.\"\nQ: Chris, what do you think were the best Yardbirds songs from that era?\nCD: By that time we had probably become, because it was a four-piece, a slightly heavier band than the preceding versions. We did quite a lot of different arrangements of material. But I would still say \u201cShapes Of Things\u201d along with \u201cDazed And Confused\u201d and \u201cHappenings Ten Years Time Ago.\u201d\nQ: I think your best bass playing is on \u201cDazed And Confused.\u201d Speaking of which, how long did it take you to switch from rhythm guitar to bass.\nCD: About half an hour actually. (laughs) When Jeff left, we had commitments. I had to go on the bass straight away. But I loved the bass. All that energy.\nQ: What\u2019s your favorite psychedelic song by another band?\nJM: \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" would have to be one of the greats, wouldn\u2019t it? And some of that Donovan stuff. \"Season Of The Witch\" and \"Sunshine Superman.\" It\u2019s not outright psychedelic, but it\u2019s kind of trippy. That whole album really. Jimmy\u2019s guitar work (ed. note: Page played on many of Donovan\u2019s sessions) on that album is really good.\nQ: How did your studio recordings differ from your live performance during the later years? Like on LAST RAVE-UP IN L.A., you were really stretching things out. Probably just to keep yourselves from getting bored.\nJM: I think we got to the point that we lost the creative impetus about a year before we split up. We were working so hard and we\u2019d been doing it for so long, we didn\u2019t really have the time and space to create good things. Listening to the stuff now, like CUMULAR LIMIT, it doesn\u2019t sound too bad. But at the time it felt like it was throwaway material. We were trying too hard to get another \"Shapes Of Things\" or a hit. It\u2019s a bit difficult to get good songs together. So, we\u2019d go around to \"Smokestack Lightning\" again and think of a new way of doing it.\nQ: It seems like you were still pretty dynamic on stage, though.\nJM: Yes, we could be. We always really went for it. We always tried to create an excitement.\nQ: Chris, in a previous interview with me, you told me, and I Quote: , \"Live as a four-piece, when Jimmy was playing guitar, I think those were some of our best shows.\u201d\nCD: Yes, I still back that. I quite liked it as a four piece. It was a strong band as a four piece. It was moving in interesting directions.\nQ: It seems that it was a little more consistent live at least.\nCD: Yes.\nQ: Maybe you didn\u2019t catch your potential in the studio, but you certainly could still storm on stage.\nCD: Live was great, I would agree with you. The studio was our problem at that time. Part of that was because we didn\u2019t have Paul (Samwell-Smith) anymore. Paul was always a very cohesive factor in the studio. We weren\u2019t really in control of our destiny in the studio, which was a great shame. The band should have come off the road and spent more time in the studio. Mickie (Most) was assigned to us. He was the designated hit maker and did produce some wonderful stuff. But he wasn\u2019t right for us. It was the wrong marriage.\nQ: What drums were you using around this time, Jim?\nJM: I played Ludwig. Later I played a Premier. I got a concession. But I never thought the Premiers were as good as Ludwig.\nQ: You probably weren\u2019t even miking the bass drum when you played live then, were you?\nJM: No. I don\u2019t think we miked anything except for the voice.\nQ: What were you playing, Chris?\nCD: There were a lot of guitars, but usually a 335 (Gibson). With amplifiers it was a mixed bag, especially on those American tours. We did a sponsorship for a while with Jordan amps. Unfortunately, we had a bit of a problem with them. They were all transistor and we blew them up all the time. They were completely wrong for us. And then we got a deal with Fender. That was probably the best equipment we had. I remember me and Jimmy got invited to the Fender factory and literally chose what we wanted. They were really good. We had two each and we\u2019d split them across the stage.\nQ: That was the Epiphone Rivoli bass you had once you switched over?\nCD: That bass went from Paul to Jimmy to me. Everybody\u2019s blood was on it. I\u2019m not sure what happened to it. When we quit some of the equipment got stuck with Zeppelin. But John Paul Jones played a (Fender) Jazz bass. Don\u2019t know where ours went to.\nQ: Besides a fuzz box, what else were Jeff and Jimmy using on their guitars?\nJM: Jeff would have used a sustain pedal on \"Shapes.\" I\u2019m not sure if he had a volume pedal. He would have used the volume knob on the guitar to swell the volume up and down with his little finger.\nQ: In the studio, Jimmy of course used an acoustic on \"White Summer.\" But when you played it live, did he use a Danelectro on that?\nJM: Probably. He\u2019d swap guitars because of that special tuning.\nQ: Yeah, D-A-D-G-A-D.\nJM: That\u2019s the one. He wouldn\u2019t tune his Telecaster down, so he\u2019d swap guitars.\nQ: Do you remember the first time he brought the violin bow in to use on a guitar? What did you think?\nJM: Oh, dear. He didn\u2019t do it with Jeff. But I can\u2019t remember when he did start. It was a good idea because it was another sound. It wouldn\u2019t have been with Jeff. Without Jeff he felt like he could do a bit more, have a bit more space to establish his identity.\nQ: In retrospect, how do you feel about the LITTLE GAMES album now?\nJM: It\u2019s not as good as ROGER THE ENGINEER. Some of it\u2019s quite good. It\u2019s interesting in a weird way. Now and then I hear it and I say, \"That\u2019s actually quite good.\" It\u2019s weird. A bit hodge-podge really.\nQ: Do you have any favorite cuts off it?\nJM: (starts laughing) \"I Remember The Night.\" It came up during those sessions, though it wasn\u2019t released until years later. Mickie Most said, \"Oh, we don\u2019t want to do a silly song.\" It was left off the album. It\u2019s quite funny they put it on later. It\u2019s got John Paul Jones on piano and Jimmy Page played on it as well.\nQ: I can\u2019t imagine Zeppelin doing it!\nJM: (laughs) No!\nQ: Any others?\nJM: I think \"Drinking Muddy Water\" was a good song. I liked doing it live.\nQ: You\u2019d do \"Smile On Me\" live, too, wouldn\u2019t you?\nJM: Yeah, that was good. \"Glimpses\" was good live, too. We\u2019d do that freaky violin bow and the incense.\nQ: Would that go over as well in Britain as in the States?\nJM: No, it wouldn\u2019t have been quite the same. We played some freaky gigs in England, but that would have been in the cities. In the small towns they would have wanted to hear our hits. We\u2019d have to be in the right sort of club to play the trippy arrangements.\nQ: What were some of your favorite places to play at that time?\nJM: The Marquee for sure. And the Roundhouse maybe. I can\u2019t remember. They had light shows. I saw The Doors and The Airplane there.\nQ: Is the Anderson Theatre (ed. note: released as the star-crossed LIVE YARDBIRDS! FEATURING JIMMY PAGE) show fairly representative of the band at the time?\nJM: Pretty well, yeah. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the best show we did on that tour. But it\u2019s good. The usual thing is that they made such a big thing out of recording the show that we got a little nervous and that seized it up a bit. Doesn\u2019t sound too bad now.\nQ: Chris, how do you feel about the Anderson show?\nCD: Now as a historical piece, with the arrangements and the excitement, I think it\u2019s a valid piece. At the time, you could argue that the recording could have been a lot better. But in retrospect, with the arrangements going on, it was a surprise when I heard it again recently. It\u2019s very exciting. It\u2019s very interesting.\nQ: ROGER gets the acclaim, but as far as dynamics go, LIVE YARDBIRDS! FEATURING JIMMY PAGE is my favorite album you guys did.\nCD: Is it? (surprised)\nQ: It\u2019s a loud and brutal album. Very dark and moody.\nCD: I think you\u2019re right really. God knows what all the realities are behind that particular album, but it\u2019s a wonderful piece of the band at the time and where we were taking things. Personally, as a piece of musical history it\u2019s very important. You can feel the energy with the Anderson show. When I got my hands on the bass (laughs) there was so much energy. It\u2019s ragged here and there, but hell, listen to Jimi Hendrix sometimes. It could have been a better performance and it could have been a worse performance. But in terms of innovativeness and sheer energy it was good.\nQ: What was your role in arranging and expanding the Jake Holmes song \"Dazed and Confused\" (ed. note: originally on Holmes' LP THE ABOVE GROUND SOUND OF JAKE HOLMES, 1967; the Yardbirds\u2019 version is on the Anderson Theatre recording)?\nJM: We played with Jake Holmes in New York and I was struck by the atmosphere of \"Dazed and Confused.\" I went down to Greenwich Village and bought his album and we decided to do a version. We worked it out together with Jimmy contributing the guitar riffs in the middle. Don\u2019t you think he\u2019s the riff-master?\nQ: Are you happy with the material on CUMULAR LIMIT, especially the songs from the last studio session?\nJM: The funny thing about that later stuff is it seems to get better. As time goes by it seems to sound better. At the time it sounded a bit lame compared to ROGER. It\u2019s not as bad as we always thought.\nQ: Who were your biggest rivals in Britain at this time?\nJM: The Stones weren\u2019t really rivals. They were too big. The Pretty Things, The Animals and The Moody Blues.\nQ: Would you try to blow any of these other bands off stage?\nJM: Yeah, we were very competitive. Oh, yeah and The Kinks. We toured with them in \u201966. Dave Davies and Mick Avory got into a fight on stage. Dave kicked over Mick\u2019s crash cymbal. And then he picked up the stand and bashed it over Dave\u2019s head. Then Mick disappeared. Dave fell, his head was bleeding. They pulled the curtain. That was in Cardiff. They pulled the curtain and we had to go back on because The Kinks couldn\u2019t play anymore. Mick Avory ran off.\nQ: What did you think of The Pretty Things at the time? What did you think of their album S.F. SORROW?\nJM: I liked The Pretty Things. I saw them play at the Albert Hall and once had a drink with Viv Prince. I\u2019m afraid S.F. SORROW passed me by at the time, but I like it now.\nQ: Did you feel any competition with the American bands or were they too far behind you at that point? Ever see The Byrds?\nJM: I remember when they came over on their first tour. I thought they were just copying Bob Dylan and playing 12 strings. No great shakes for me. They made some nice records.\nQ: At the time, were you aware so many of these American bands were imitating you?\nJM: Oh, yeah. Often we\u2019d play with these support bands in America and they\u2019d play all our songs! (laughs) That was really frustrating. We\u2019d have to go on and play the same songs. And all those records by bands like The Count V, all these garage bands, they sounded like us.\nQ: That must have been frustrating. The Count V\u2019s \"Psychotic Reaction\" came out soon after \"Happenings\" . . .\nJM: And it was a big hit! (laughs)\nQ: And it was actually kind of retro, because it\u2019s what you guys sounded like a year earlier!\nJM: I know! Really weird. I suppose it was quite nice, very flattering. All these bands were playing like us.\nQ: These support bands that opened for you, using your material, did you ever take the stage and show them who those songs really belonged to?\nJM: Yeah. We played with this German band not too long ago. They were these young guys and they had that 60s look. And they played \"I Ain\u2019t Done Wrong\"! Just like the old days. Our opening band was playing our material! (laughs)\nQ: Speaking of young bands, there\u2019s this great Swedish band right now that are influenced by you guys. They\u2019re my favorite new band. They\u2019re called The Strollers. They named themselves after your song, \"Stroll On\"! The more things change, the more they stay the same; you had bands like The Nazz naming themselves after your songs 35 years ago and here it is 2001 and it\u2019s still happening.\nJM: Funny thing is I was in a band called The Strollers back in school! (laughs)\nQ: Was there really this Swinging London we\u2019ve been led to believe after the fact?\nJM: Like in THE SPY THAT SHAGGED ME and that? (laughs)\nQ: Exactly.\nJM: I used to buy stuff in Granny Takes A Trip. It was better than Carnaby Street. Carnaby Street was a bit naff. Granny and Dandy were really good. Dandy had those jackets with the big collars. Sort of an Edwardian jacket. I remember going in there one time and The Beatles came walking in to pick up some jackets. They had just made SERGEANT PEPPER\u2019S. We used to speak to them at this club called the Speakeasy. We\u2019d all hang out, having a drink with Keith Moon and Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon. That was actually a bit psychedelic itself. But we\u2019d stay at home and get stoned before going out around midnight. Then go out to the club and see a band or hang out with people from other bands. Or maybe try and pull a chick! (laughs) And come home at five or six in the morning.\nQ: Did you have any troubles pulling birds? Especially since you were a Yardbird!\nJM: I didn\u2019t have much trouble, even though I was a bit modest about telling people I was in a band. I remember I was in Hollywood one time and I went to see a film. I had these really weird shoes on. I\u2019d had them made in Camden Town. They were sort of Indian shoes. They were in this double color, leather two-tone. I was standing and waiting to get the tickets. And this guy came up to me and said \"Wow, man. Those are cool shoes. You\u2019re a cool dude. I bet you\u2019re in a band like The Seeds.\" (laughs) And I said, \"No, I\u2019m in The Yardbirds.\" And he nearly fell down fainting! (laughs loud) I was a bit modest and a bit shy about all that.\nQ: Chris, tell me about the break-up and the subsequent role you had during Zeppelin\u2019s formation.\nCD: Basically Jim and Keith left the band. They informed us during the American tour that that was it for them. In fact that was one of our best tours because you knew where you were going. Where you were going was ending the band, so it was a bit of a relief. It took the pressure off. We were able to relax and have a bit more fun. And it showed in our playing. By that time I had been through enough with everybody else that it was nice to be able to wake up and not rely upon anybody else, especially three or four other people who were not necessarily going in the same direction. I made the decision that I was going to move into photography, which had always been a passion of mine. I stayed friends with Jimmy and Peter Grant for some years. I wasn\u2019t intending to carry on playing unless it was with The Yardbirds. But I think they wanted my opinion and wanted me to accompany them to see Bonham and Plant for their first audition. I didn\u2019t have an intention to carry on playing, like I\u2019ve said. I had by that time made the very conscious decision that I was going to wake up in the morning and whatever I did was going to be my own responsibility.\nQ: Please clear up the confusion over the name Yardbirds and whether Jimmy ended up with the rights to the name.\nCD: The reality of it was that Jim and Keith informed us they were going to leave The Yardbirds. There were some outstanding contracts to fulfill (ed. note: a Scandinavian tour in September, 1968). After coming back from that American tour there was going to be no more Yardbirds. Jimmy started putting together the players who became Zeppelin. Those dates were available. Jimmy had only been in the band for a year or so. I\u2019d had enough. It seemed unreasonable to try to piece something together again, with all the changes we\u2019d had, to continue as The Yardbirds. I do remember through my own lawyer just reminding Peter (Grant) that I had in no way given up moral rights to the name itself whether I was a photographer or a dentist or whatever. I certainly didn\u2019t hand it over to Jimmy Page. On the other hand, I stayed friends with Jimmy and saw Led Zeppelin play several times. There is no acrimony on that score. I was just concerned at the time about them using the name The New Yardbirds. I thought that was wrong. I wasn\u2019t going to give up any moral rights to my status and what the band was. And through my lawyer I informed them of that. It was nothing heavy, but it\u2019s interesting that they became Led Zeppelin fairly quickly. (laughs) And whether that was coincidence, I don\u2019t know. By this time I\u2019d gone into photography and a completely new life. I had no intention to carry on as a musician after the death of The Yardbirds. But I was obviously concerned and I wasn\u2019t going to hand it over to complete strangers.\nQ: As always, thanks for your time. I hope these questions were a little bit more interesting to you.\nJM: Thank you.\nCD: Thanks. Click to expand... Thanks for posting these here.

There is a link at the end of the blog as a resource for more help. The Anxiety Centre advises that anxiety causes the body to produce the stress response (also known as the fight or flight response). The stress response changes how the body functions and adversely affects the nervous system, which is responsible for sending and receiving nerve impulse information from the nerve endings and sensory organs in the body to the brain, and back again. When stress responses occur infrequently, the body can recover relatively quickly from the physiological, psychological, and emotional changes the stress response brings about. When stress responses occur too frequently and/or dramatically, however, the body has a more difficult time recovering, which can result in the body remaining in a semi hyperstimulated state, since stress hormones are stimulants. A nervous system that becomes stress-response hyperstimulated can act erratically and more involuntarily than normal. This erratic and more involuntary behavior can cause a wide variety of odd and unusual sensory and nerve related sensations and symptoms, such as numbness anywhere on the body. http://www.anxietycentre.com/anxiety-symptoms/numbness.shtml", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.anxietycentre.com/anxiety-symptoms/numbness.shtml"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:27.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b44be8ed301bdb7ef92b4f5f766be7d8e743df45", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB6x2uybzHMbgi.nHkHj.Y5AcX6VZIOr_vlZ7N.ctmM0_SvQxt_J2j2tktfFyGh_M8QDno.mwLB3VMDMmU9Qqlqj", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "1968 Yardbirds sessions to see release?! | Page 52", "title_full": "1968 Yardbirds sessions to see release?! | Page 52 | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T01:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/67/67053.jpg?1512631401", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae7ce77efc4f996cccf3ea1466c1ee30bce1d360", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB6x2uybzHMbgi.nHkHj.Y5AcX6VZIOr_vlZ7N.ctmM0_SvQxt_J2j2tktfFyGh_M8QDno.mwLB3VJN_JZ_.ohMYTyyajjg3sdw-", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "tmtomh", "published": "2017-12-05T23:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "FloydMaui said: \u2191 Doesn't that still leave \"something\" out ?

I need to reclaim some DVD/Blu-ray shelf space on titles that aren't getting watched more than once ... and that includes some imports.\nAfter recently researching, my understanding is that you can't commercially sell any titles/discs that don't have a BBFC rating. Does that also include private individuals just selling on their (now second-hand) import on ebay or elsewhere? Doesn't seem to go into that kind of detail on the BBFC FAQ page. Do car boot sale laws make things different for the private individual selling it second hand?\nIf it's not legal, my question is, what does everyone else do when clearing out imported discs?

It is a back issue of Ugly Things magazine #20. The earlier McCarty & Dreja interview posted here was also from the same issue. Part two to follow.\nIMAGES IN SOUND: The Yardbirds Final Flight 1966-68\n\"When The Yardbirds started getting high, that was the turning point.\u201d\u2013 Rick Brown, The Misunderstood\nLift Off\nYardbirds \u2013 the name still elicits awe 33 years after the group\u2019s demise.\nBesides the similarly monikered Byrds, no other band embraced as many styles as did the English group. The Yardbirds mastered stone-cold blues, moody pop and jet-propelled rockabilly. They almost single-handedly pioneered psychedelia and its bastard stepchild, heavy metal. Further, an unreleased track from their last studio session affirms that they were on the cusp of inventing country-rock. Their influence on garage-rock subculture was equaled by few and surpassed by none.\nBest known as the springboard for the Holy Trinity of Guitar\u2013 Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page all served stewardships in the group \u2013 The Yardbirds were actually a marvelous musical unit, albeit an unstable one in the personnel department.\nThe band\u2019s history has been well documented in the past. Consequently, this article does not examine the group during Slowhand\u2019s tenure or its Golden Age under Jeff Beck. However, the group\u2019s kamikaze final flight with Jimmy Page at the controls usually gets short shrift. Over the past two years, unreleased Page-era studio tracks as well as a legendary live show have been issued, demanding a reassessment. This article attempts to do just that. So, climb into the way-back machine and hit rewind.\nBeck & Page\nThroughout 1966, The Yardbirds had experimented with painting in tonal colors. Exploiting Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page\u2019s dual lead guitar abilities to their utmost, Keith Relf felt confident in describing the group\u2019s music as \u201cimages in sound.\u201d The Yardbirds made good on that boast, recording psychedelia\u2019s siren song in July 1966. Unfortunately, \u201cHappenings Ten Years Time Ago\u201d was to be the first and last single released by the Beck and Page lineup.\nThe song would peak at #30 in the American charts the following autumn. Along with The Byrds\u2019 \u201cEight Miles High\u201d and The Beatles\u2019 \u201cTomorrow Never Knows,\u201d The Yardbirds\u2019 magnum opus issued a call to hallucinogenic mayhem that few could resist.\nThe 45\u2019s non-U.S. flipside, \u201cPsycho Daisies,\u201d featured a rare vocal appearance by Jeff Beck. Basically a super-charged Eddie Cochran adaptation, the tune found Beck confessing his devotion to his Hollywood girlfriend, Mary Hughes.\nLater in the year, a searing rewrite of \u201cTrain Kept A-Rollin\u2019\u201d appeared in the Swinging London movie, BLOW UP. Entitled \u201cStroll On,\u201d the tune showcased the band in a nightclub scene with Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page on dual lead guitars. As Beck smashed his axe, Page smirked nefariously, his face wreathed with Beelzebub-like muttonchops.\nThe Paul Butterfield Blues Band was venturing into the same territory at the time with their two guitarists, Michael Bloomfield and Elvin Bishop. The American group\u2019s magnificent EAST-WEST album found the duo swapping solos and forging raga rock in a slightly similar manner to The Yardbirds. However, Bloomfield and Bishop exchanged lead duties throughout the title song \u201cEast-West.\u201d Bishop would solo as his band-mate provided rhythm guitar and vice versa.\nBeck and Page, on the other hand, would play the same lead lines in tandem. In live situations, the duo spit out stereophonic clusters of synchronized notes on hits like \u201cOver, Under, Sideways, Down.\u201d The effect, to say the least, was devastating. Sadly, this potential was to remain untapped and largely unrecorded. The three aforementioned Yardbirds tunes are the only ones to showcase the star-crossed Beck and Page configuration in the studio. Jeff Beck\u2019s initial enthusiasm at having Jimmy Page in the band slowly turned to insecurity. Beck was an emotional wildcard, playing a brilliant gig one night and then three disastrous shows in a row.\nPage, on the other hand, had been Britain\u2019s premier studio guitarist (playing on Kinks and Who sessions among many others). Honed in the hit-making factories of London, Page knew that one must deliver the goods upon demand if one was to be paid. Jimmy Page was never less than startlingly competent, if not quite reaching the stellar heights Beck could scale on occasion. Page\u2019s professionalism and reliability exacerbated the already tenuous situation. Further, Beck felt that his territory was being encroached upon. He wanted to do all the guitar parts, apparently forgetting that he had been the one to offer Page an invitation to join the band in the first place.\nBeck stopped showing up for gigs, leaving the band to soldier on as a four-piece. When he did actually bother to make an appearance, he was as apt to smash his axe as he was to play it. The Yardbirds had already played at least 150 shows in 1966 before even embarking upon their autumn American tour. The stress was becoming too much and things quickly came to a head. Jeff Beck\u2019s behavior bordered on the bizarre. As an example, during a gig at The Comic Strip in Worcester, Massachusetts, Beck destroyed an amplifier out of frustration. One must keep in mind that the guitarist had just turned 22-years-old. The enormous pressure was too much to bear for a sensitive young man.\n\u201cIt was on that Dick Clark tour \u2013 there were a few incidents. One time in the dressing room I walked in and Beck had his guitar up over his head, about to bring it down on Keith Relf\u2019s head, but instead smashed it on the floor,\u201d Jimmy Page recalled years later. \u201cRelf looked at him with total astonishment and Beck said, \u2018Why did you make me do that?\u2019 ****ing hell. Everyone said \u2018My goodness gracious, what a funny chap.\u2019 We went back to the hotel and Beck showed me his tonsils, said he wasn\u2019t feeling well and was going to see a doctor. He left for L.A. where we were headed anyway. When we got there, though, we realized that whatever doctor he was claiming to see must\u2019ve had his office in the Whiskey. He was actually seeing his girlfriend, Mary Hughes, and had just used the doctor bit as an excuse to cut out on us.\u201d\nObviously, things could not continue. To make a long story short, the band fired Jeff Beck. This left Page in an uncomfortable position. He was best of mates with Beck, yet after years spent laboring as a session musician he found himself relishing life with a functioning band. Beck pressed his friend to leave with him. Page opted to stay the course. With the abrupt dismissal of their wildcard guitarist in November 1966, five live Yardbirds were no more.\nThen There Were Four\nJeff Beck was only the latest casualty in the ongoing rock n roll wars. The Yardbirds had lost Top Topham, Eric Clapton and Paul Samwell-Smith since 1963. Fortunately, Beck\u2019s departure wasn\u2019t quite as debilitating as it could have been. After all, the band had gotten used to carrying on as a quartet whenever the Moody One had stalked off during the ill-fated American tour.\nHowever, only the most resilient of groups can lose four members in a three-year period and continue with a sense of cohesion. Once again, only a Byrds comparison is analogous. It\u2019s downright stupefying that these two bands could suffer so many departures and boldly continue to map out uncharted territory. Compare their situations to The Beatles, who in sharp contrast were blessed with one producer and no personnel changes after issuing their first single, \u201cLove Me Do.\u201d\nObviously, with Jeff Beck\u2019s exit musical elements changed within The Yardbirds. Whereas McCarty, Samwell-Smith and Beck had provided harmony vocals in the band\u2019s classic lineup, only McCarty now filled the breach. He revealed himself to be a triple-threat: superb drummer, gifted songwriter and fine backup singer. In retrospect, it is interesting to note that even guitar-dominated bands of the time featured vocal harmonies, something sadly lacking in modern rock n roll.\nRegardless, this stripped-down lineup also found Keith Relf stepping up. Over time, he began contributing rhythm guitar when the occasion warranted as well as his accustomed lead vocals and harmonica playing. Relf has been routinely criticized for his apparent shortcomings as a singer. One must take into account the fact that he suffered from debilitating asthma and had to use a bronchial inhaler in-between songs when they played live. He had suffered a collapsed lung in 1963 that had hospitalized him for six weeks. His flat and sinister tone suited The Yardbirds\u2019 material perfectly however. A more gifted and authentic blues vocalist like an Eric Burdon or Van Morrison would have overwhelmed nefarious vehicles like \u201cShapes Of Things.\u201d Finally, Keith Relf\u2019s harmonica work reveals him to be a master of the instrument. Within the realm of \u201860s white blues, nobody is a more passionate harp player.\nAll these elements would rewire the group\u2019s makeup over the coming months as they attempted to grapple with the new dynamics. The first order of business was fulfilling contractual obligations and getting in the studio.\nWith Beck gone, the band finished their scheduled fall tour of America. While in Detroit, The Yardbirds shared the bill with a new group out of New York, The Velvet Underground. A Lou Reed original, \u201cI\u2019m Waiting For The Man\u201d, immediately captivated the Englishmen. The New Yorkers had not as yet released their debut album, THE VELVET UNDERGROUND & NICO. Soon, The Yardbirds would be one of the first to purchase it.\nBack in England, The Yardbirds entered the studio for the first time as a four-piece. Unfortunately, they had very little material to record. This should not have come as a surprise. Having recorded their classic ROGER THE ENGINEER album barely six months previously, the group had since embarked on another punishing schedule, playing at least 120 dates throughout the world. They were only able to snatch a one-day breather to record in their busy itinerary before embarking on another eight-day tour of the States.\nOn December 22, 1966, The Yardbirds entered Olympic Studios in London to lay down some tracks. The band tried to catch lightning in a bottle once more by doing another Graham Gouldman composition, \u201cYou Stole My Love.\u201d This was to be their fourth cover of his material. They attempted to recreate the magic of the \u201cFor Your Love\u201d sessions by bringing in ex-Yardbird Paul Samwell-Smith to produce said session. Things did not go smoothly. Samwell-Smith had already produced (Gouldman\u2019s own band) The Mockingbirds\u2019 version and did not realize that The Yardbirds intended to cover it. Samwell-Smith was not happy with the group\u2019s choice of material and he was further annoyed that the musicians hadn\u2019t even worked out an arrangement. Jimmy Page was actually teaching Dreja the necessary changes in the studio. Further, Samwell-Smith and Page clashed immediately. Fifteen takes were attempted, but the song never progressed to the point where Keith Relf laid down a vocal. A piano-drum duet, \u201cL.S.D.\u201d was also composed on the spot, but is only of interest to the completist. Paul Samwell-Smith was not amused with the proceedings. He finally had enough and stormed out of the studio. Needless to say, neither song came to fruition. The two tunes would finally be issued in 1992 on the LITTLE GAMES SESSIONS & MORE compilation.\nThe title of the latter song makes it apparent that hallucinogenic drugs were tightening their grip on certain members of The Yardbirds. Relf and McCarty had been experimenting with marijuana and acid for some time. Dreja and Page steered well clear of drugs. This division would have a profound effect on the band over the next 18 months.\nAnd that was it for studio work in 1966. Once again, The Yardbirds were faced with a daunting number of worldwide gigs that would take them well into the New Year. 1966 alone had witnessed nearly 200 documented gigs. It was taking its toll. Band members were falling by the wayside like GIs on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.\nBrave New World\nSurely 1967 would be a better year. For one thing, the group had a new manger, its third since 1963. Gone was the egotistical Simon Napier-Bell. Enter Peter Grant. Grant was a hard-nosed and fearless character who looked out for his charges. Under his direction, the band finally began making money, which surprised them to no end.\nA January and February tour of the Pacific with Roy Orbison found the band settling comfortably into the four-piece format. Orbison was not impressed, however. Night after night, The Yardbirds delivered a blistering version of \u201cHappenings Ten Years Time Ago.\u201d It failed to move the elder statesman of rock n roll. Orbison regarded it as little more than an audio triage clinic. To put it bluntly, The Yardbirds were too loud and wild for his taste.\nJimmy Page also introduced a new element into the band\u2019s sonic alchemy at this time. In his studio days, Page had experimented with using a violin bow on his guitar.\n\u201cI had used it before I joined The Yardbirds. It was suggested to me by a session violinist. I didn\u2019t think it could be done at first \u2013 bowing a flat necked instrument \u2013 but I took his advice and got a bow and started having a go and I could see the possibilities in it,\u201d he said.\nJimmy Page could only bow two strings at a time to produce a melody. When he ran the bow across all six strings, a strange whooping sound was produced. With Beck safely out of the way, Jimmy Page pulled this striking gimmick out of his bag of tricks. As well as providing new tonal textures, it was an effective visual device. It\u2019s been asserted that Page actually got this idea from Eddie Phillips of The Creation. However, many guitar players from David Lindley to Syd Barrett appear to have used a violin bow at the time. Who came up with the idea in the first place doesn\u2019t really matter. Obviously, Page was determined to evolve. After all, that\u2019s what this particular group was famed for.\nIn March 1967, the band finally entered the studio for the first time in four months. However, things had changed dramatically. For one thing, they were given a producer they\u2019d never worked with before: Mickie Most. Most was well respected in the recording industry, having guided lightweight entities like Herman\u2019s Hermits to chart success. Page was well acquainted with Mickie Most, having provided guitar work at the aforementioned act\u2019s sessions. The pairing of pop producer Mickie Most with iconoclastic visionaries like The Yardbirds was an ill-conceived decision to say the least.\nGroundbreaking singles like \u201cShapes Of Things\u201d and \u201cHappenings Ten Years Time Ago\u201d were not to be the order of the day anymore. The #30 U.S. peak of their last single, \u201cHappenings Ten Years Time Ago,\u201d was considered a major disaster. The powers-that-be decreed that there would be No More Taking Chances. Self-penned material would be relegated to album tracks. Therefore, Most assigned the group a song to record for release as a single. The first order of business was to tackle a charming ditty called \u201cLittle Games.\u201d\nWhile the song did feature a cello arrangement by Most session-crony John Paul Jones and a nifty solo from Page, it was certainly not on par with the group\u2019s earlier revolutionary singles. The 45\u2019s flipside, \u201cPuzzles,\u201d was solid, but still not up to snuff. However, it did boast a sizzling solo courtesy of Jimmy Page.\nIn April, \u201cLittle Games\u201d was released. It went over like the proverbial lead balloon, struggling to #51 in America. It didn\u2019t even make an appearance on the British charts.\nIn the interim, Epic had released a greatest hits package in the States in March. Unsurprisingly in the Brave New World of 1967, the groundbreaking material on this album slaked American fans\u2019 thirst for vintage volume. With gems like \u201cOver, Under, Sideways, Down\u201d and \u201cStill I\u2019m Sad\u201d nestling against psychedelia\u2019s crown jewel, \u201cHappenings Ten Years Time Ago,\u201d the LP climbed to #28 during a 37-week residency in the charts. Further, it was to become The Yardbirds best selling album during their existence.\nEmboldened by this response, Most pushed on with recording a new Yardbirds album. Of course, he totally misread the signs. Instead of allowing them to return to their earlier innovative material, he still hoped to furnish them with a perfect pop vehicle.\nFrantic touring was still the order of the day, however. The group entered the studio only when they could shoehorn the time into their demanding schedule. In April and May, the band bounced in and out of the studio to lay down tracks for what became their final studio album. Recording conditions were ridiculous. Page was still fuming about it years later and rightly so.\n\u201cIt was so bloody rushed. Everything was done in one take because Mickie Most was basically interested in singles and didn\u2019t believe it was worth the time to do the tracks right on the album. Stu [Ian Stewart] from the Rolling Stones played piano on those tracks, and when we finished the first take of the first track we were recording he said, \u2018That\u2019ll sound much better the second take.\u2019 Mickie Most was sitting in the control booth, and all of a sudden he said, \u2018Next!\u2019 Stu couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Jimmy Page said.\nStarting with the recording of the \u201cLittle Games\u201d single, session players began making frequent appearances on The Yardbirds\u2019 recording sessions, which makes no sense except from a ruthless economic point of view. Of course, the band was more than adept at playing whatever material was demanded, even if it was assigned and not to their liking. However, with their crushing responsibilities on the road, The Yardbirds were allotted very little studio time. When they were able to find time off to record, they would enter the studio only to find that Most\u2019s session hacks had already laid down basic tracks. Often, only Page\u2019s guitar and Relf\u2019s vocals were needed to complete these recordings.\nUnfortunately, Page\u2019s production expertise from his session days wasn\u2019t brought to bear at this time. It\u2019s unsettling that Page\u2019s uncanny ear would allow him to participate in some of the dubious fodder that was foisted on the band by Most. Perhaps Page was simply intimidated by the producer, whose reputation packed an enormous wallop. After all, it\u2019s hard to argue with a man who steered countless singles to the top of the charts.\nFurther, it slowly became apparent that Samwell-Smith\u2019s departure left a huge hole in the songwriting process. Beck had also been a major catalyst, although he didn\u2019t write songs per se. Relf and McCarty still contributed material, but it was slowly beginning to veer towards a lighter feel than they\u2019d previously exhibited. The newest member, Jimmy Page, was still in the embryonic stages of songwriting. Dreja was good for the odd riff or lyric when he could be coaxed out of his shell.\nAlthough the sessions were nominally approached with the intent of recording an album, Mickie Most was always on the look out for 45s.\n\u201c\u2018No Excess Baggage\u2019 was something Most suggested as a single, but we did it as an album session. There could\u2019ve been a lot better stuff on the album,\u201d Page declared. \u201cI remember him saying to me once, about guitar solos, \u2018They\u2019re something you stick in the middle of the single where there isn\u2019t any vocal.\u2019 He didn\u2019t share my view that a guitar solo, like the ones on the Ricky Nelson records, for instance, could be an uplifting experience.\u201d\nObviously, The Yardbirds\u2019 producer was totally clueless and unsympathetic to their true nature. Regardless, by May the album was in the can. In light of this arbitrary recording schedule (the lead track, the \u201cLittle Games\u201d single, was recorded in early March and the last track during the first of May in-between numerous gigs), it\u2019s striking that the album sounds as organic as it does. Highlights from the album include two blues rewrites, \u201cDrinking Muddy Water\u201d and \u201cSmile On Me.\u201d\nFortunately, there was also original strong material sprinkled throughout the LP. Jimmy Page\u2019s Middle Eastern showpiece, \u201cWhite Summer\u201d (inspired by Davey Graham), and the delirious violin bow extravaganza \u201cGlimpses\u201d illuminated the band\u2019s psychedelic bent. Keith Relf\u2019s elegiac \u201cOnly The Black Rose\u201d showed the influence of English folk music. Said tune is one of the most underrated chestnuts in the band\u2019s repertoire. The original \u201cTinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor\u201d was stark raving mod while \u201cNo Excess Baggage\u201d was a bruising and effective cover. Less essential is the humorous jugband nick \u201cStealing, Stealing.\u201d Downright dated and rickety is \u201cLittle Soldier Boy,\u201d which no amount of rationalization will excuse.\nThe album didn\u2019t quite meet commercial expectations. When it came out in America in July, it tanked at #80. Initially slated for an autumn release in Great Britain, the LP was eventually withheld from the group\u2019s homeland altogether.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:27.036+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b44be8ed301bdb7ef92b4f5f766be7d8e743df45", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB6x2uybzHMbgi.nHkHj.Y5AcX6VZIOr_vlZ7N.ctmM0_SvQxt_J2j2tktfFyGh_M8QDno.mwLB3VMDMmU9Qqlqj", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "1968 Yardbirds sessions to see release?! | Page 52", "title_full": "1968 Yardbirds sessions to see release?! | Page 52 | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T01:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/67/67053.jpg?1512631401", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b4ede9cf06ca1032d2a2f74ded88b60dfd06262", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB6x2uybzHMbgi.nHkHj.Y5AcX6VZIOr_vlZ7N.ctmM0_SvQxt_J2j2tktfFyGh_M8QDno.mwLB3VJN_JZ_.ohMYfM2JHYmN84s-", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "YardByrd", "published": "2017-12-06T15:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Part two - part three to follow\nOn The Road\nHaving gleaned their very name from Beat Generation bard Jack Kerouac\u2019s writing, it\u2019s poetically appropriate that The Yardbirds spent most of their time performing in new and exotic locales. While the band was irked with the recording situation in the studio, gigs were another matter. The Page-led group still pushed the envelope onstage. \u201cTinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor\u201d found Page using his violin bow on a Vox 12-string guitar.\n\u201cIt continued developing with Jimmy,\u201d Keith Relf said.\nActually, they were far more consistent than they had been with Jeff Beck. The Aquarian Age was upon them and the young men were excited. They racked their collective brain, experimenting with anything that would propel them into the unknown. As an example, they quickly embraced the new aural elements that rock n roll was exploring in live situations.\n\u201cAll I remember with that is that we were the first group to use backing tapes. Y\u2019know, bombs dropping and newsreels \u2013 musician\u2019s concrete \u2013 as a backdrop to the music,\u201d Page related.\nThis was sometimes augmented with visual elements, i.e. scenes from World War Two being projected behind them. The wildcard eclecticism of the Beck days was far from over. The group was still in the hands of a showboat guitarist who harbored audacious ideas and sartorial sense to boot. All of the members dressed in ruffles, silk, crushed velvet and suede. The effect was marvelous, crossbreeding the Edwardian look with pop-art aesthetics to create a psychedelic dandy image. The young men weren\u2019t the only ones undergoing cosmetic adjustments. Jimmy Page\u2019s Telecaster sported small silver discs, which reflected and refracted the stage lights, creating rainbow hues. It was a long way from the suit-and-tie days of the Crawdaddy.\nBlues standards still figured in The Yardbirds\u2019 set, although they were now drenched in Technicolor. Their old warhorse, \u201cI\u2019m A Man,\u201d began to mutate as a result. Page took to caressing his guitar with a violin bow as Keith Relf recited impromptu poems.\nChris Dreja, in the meantime, had turned into a go-for-broke bass player. Whereas in the past his underrated guitar playing had allowed Clapton and Beck to snake in and out of his rhythm patterns, Dreja\u2019s bass work simply surged and throbbed. While perhaps not as melodic as Samwell-Smith could be at times, Chris Dreja brought an energy and recklessness to the instrument that complimented Page\u2019s playing perfectly.\nThroughout the spring, The Yardbirds had played all over Europe. They recorded sessions for Swedish radio and the BBC as well as appearing on German and French television, all the while trying to cobble together the LITTLE GAMES album at De Lane Lea Studios in London!\n\u201cSometimes we didn\u2019t know whether we were coming or going,\u201d Jim McCarty laughed ruefully.\nUnfortunately, in June Mickie Most concocted another single with the aid of session musicians. There was very little Yardbirds participation at the sessions. This time the result was the dreadful \u201cHa Ha Said The Clown.\u201d This song had just been a major hit for Manfred Mann. Most\u2019s famed pop sensibilities were questionable on this one. What chance would The Yardbirds have of topping a single that had recently reached #3 in the British charts? Indeed. However, it never was issued in the U.K. Not that it did much better by being released in the States, where it rose no further than #45.\nThe band\u2019s split personality was evident to listeners who bought the singles and also attended the shows. The band was also aware of the dual nature of their recording persona and their stage identity.\n\u201cYou see, like towards the end in \u201967 or \u201968 we were playing the Fillmores. We were more into the psychedelics. That was the thing that was happening for us,\u201d Relf said. \u201cWhatever happened in the studios was the producer\u2019s idea of what the band should be. What we were actually doing was getting off on sound and feedback \u2013 just letting it go.\u201d\nMagick & Mysticism\nIn the summer of 1967, The Yardbirds landed in the United States again. Many fans were unaware that Jeff Beck had left the group. Some were initially skeptical of the new guitarist. Jimmy Page didn\u2019t disappoint the majority of them. The band was strong enough musically to bear up under the scrutiny of the press and fans.\nRelf and McCarty continued to dabble in drugs. Often, they would room together and get high while listening to their favorite psychedelic albums.\nJimmy Page was sufficiently independent and had a strong ego, which allowed him to spend time by himself practicing guitar or checking out other musicians. Apocryphal stories also have him roaming dusty old stores, looking for grimories of black magick or artifacts that had belonged to the Great Beast, Aleister Crowley.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t pay it much mind. Jimmy was very quiet about it. We were aware of his taste for, ah, perversions. De Sade and that lot. As for his interest in magick, that wasn\u2019t unusual. After all, Keith and I were studying Eastern mysticism at the time,\u201d Jim McCarty said.\nChris Dreja was the odd man out. He had formed the band with Relf and McCarty and had a strong sense of loyalty to them. Yet he was confused by their drug intake. Dreja immersed himself in photography to while away the off-hours. A rift was slowly developing that the members weren\u2019t quite aware of, being unable to see the forest for the trees.\nSound And Silence\nTowards the end of their summer tour in America, the group was slated to appear in New York City. They appeared on a local radio show and talked about plans for recording a new studio album (it never materialized). The band also mentioned that they would be performing a gig a few days later with The Youngbloods and Jake Holmes. On August 25, 1967 The Yardbirds played said show at The Village Theatre in Greenwich Village. Jim McCarty was immediately transfixed by their opening act, the acid-folk artist Jake Holmes. Holmes played acoustic guitar along with an electric guitarist Teddy Irwin and bass player Rick Randle. The trio delivered a devastating original song entitled \u201cDazed And Confused.\u201d Featuring a dramatic descending bass line, the tune was rife with spooky caesuras and smeared with menacing washes of fuzz guitar. Years later, this author asked Jake Holmes if he remembered that particular gig.\n\u201cYes. Yes, and that was the infamous moment in my life when \u2018Dazed And Confused\u2019 fell into the loving arms and hands of Jimmy Page,\u201d he said.\nOf course, Holmes was referring to the fact that Led Zeppelin eventually turned his song into a heavy metal monstrosity, giving him not credit for penning it. However, it was The Yardbirds who were the first to notice the tune\u2019s potential. After all, the group had never been shy about taking another artist\u2019s song and arranging it to their style. Jim McCarty sought out the LP it appeared on, THE ABOVE GROUND SOUND OF JAKE HOLMES, the very next day. A longtime Village resident, John Alusick has said that he witnessed Page buying it also. Regardless, McCarty is quick to point out where the song actually comes from.\n\u201cI went down to Greenwich Village and bought his (Jake Holmes\u2019) album and we decided to do a version. We worked it out together with Jimmy contributing the guitar riffs in the middle,\u201d he recalled.\nRelf tinkered with Holmes\u2019 original lyrics as Page added sonic elements to it. For one thing, the song was tailor-made for his violin bow. \u201cDazed And Confused\u201d was obviously a keeper. Subsequently, it would change the course of rock n roll forever.\nMadcap Ideas\nDespite having a strange and exciting new song in their arsenal, it was business as usual in the studio. In September, Most once again coerced the band into doing a cloying pop tune by an outside songwriter, in this case Harry Nilsson\u2019s \u201cTen Little Indians.\u201d Once again, Dreja and McCarty\u2019s participation appears to be non-existent. Anyway, the results were predictable.\n\u201cOur producer Mickie Most would always try and get us to record all these horrible songs. He would say \u2018Oh, c\u2019mon, just try it. If the song is bad, we won\u2019t release it.\u2019 And, of course, it would always get released! During one session, we were recording \u2018Ten Little Indians,\u2019 which was an extremely silly song that featured a truly awful brass arrangement. In fact, the whole track sounded terrible. In a desperate attempt to salvage it, I hit upon an idea. I said, \u2018Look, turn the tape over and employ the echo for the brass on a spare track. Then turn it back over and we\u2019ll get the echo preceding the signal.\u2019 The result was very interesting \u2013 it made the track sound like it was going backwards,\u201d Jimmy Page said.\nNo amount of studio tomfoolery was going to propel this turkey into the Top Ten. Indeed, it barely scraped to #96.\nReturning to New York in November, The Yardbirds performed their version of \u201cDazed And Confused.\u201d It was becoming a regular feature of their stage show. Audiences reacted enthusiastically, which was noted by all the band members, especially Jimmy Page.\nJake Holmes had no idea that the group was in town or that they had adapted his tune. He was to remain blissfully clueless as to what consequences his song had wrought until it showed up on Led Zeppelin\u2019s debut album well over a year later.\nOther madcap ideas buzzed around the moribund Yardbirds, like flies drawn to a carcass. One ridiculous concept was for the band to provide music for a ballet to be performed by Pan\u2019s People in Paris in December. Thankfully, this never came off.\nThink About It\nJanuary 1968 found The Yardbirds back in England. There was lot to think about. All their singles the previous year had failed dismally. Mickie Most willfully ignored the fact that the market had evolved into an album-oriented format (how does one miss the impact of SERGEANT PEPPER\u2019S six months previous?). Fans were looking for more adventurous platters, not pop swill. Only the most ignorant could be unaware of what inroads Cream and Jimi Hendrix were making at the time. More significantly, these groups were breaking out of the beachhead that The Yardbirds themselves had established two years earlier. The Yardbirds still played that type of music live, but their studio material was different altogether. Could a band survive as two diametrically opposed entities?\n\u201cYou see, the band was pretty schizoid through the changes of personnel. So, you got a pretty schizoid kind of sound. I mean the band can\u2019t undergo those changes without bearing some sort of shock \u2013 without direction being sort of blurred,\u201d Keith Relf said.\nThis schism continued to widen, not only between the band\u2019s studio identity and live persona, but also within their very ranks. Relf and McCarty yearned to embrace a gentler type of music, which was in keeping with their drug-addled consciousness. Simon & Garfunkel\u2019s style, in particular, appealed to the duo. Further, Relf was simply tired of competing with loud guitars after all these years. The two began dropping hints that they might leave the band. Jimmy Page, on the other hand, was fully turned on by the idea of volume. Chris Dreja was caught in the middle. While he owed personal loyalty to his longtime band-mates, he felt that Page\u2019s guitar-heavy vein was the one to mine.\nFunnily enough, it needn\u2019t have been such a black-white choice. Page\u2019s guitar playing was as informed by the acoustic work of Bert Jansch as it was by rockabilly icons Cliff Gallup and Paul Burlison. He was just at home eliciting Arabic tones on his ravishing showpiece \u201cWhite Summer\u201d as he was issuing a greasy hard-nosed solo on \u201cSmile On Me.\u201d He was more than willing to follow Relf and McCarty down whatever road they wished to strike out upon.\n\u201cI told them we\u2019d be able to change within the group format; coming from a sessions background I was prepared to adjust to anything. I hated to break it up without even doing a proper first album,\u201d Page said.\nRelf and McCarty wanted out, though. The brand name \u201cYardbirds\u201d was associated with loud, guitar dominated rock n roll. They were having none of it. Now, they just had to gear themselves up for the divorce.\nTheir final single summed up the situation the best. The \u2018A\u2019 side was a jaunty ode to a prostitute, \u201cGoodnight Sweet Josephine.\u201d The lyrics were a trifle risqu\u00e9, but it was a pure pop confection. Relegated to the underside, however, was the true heir to \u201cHappenings Ten Years Time Ago.\u201d The flip was the majestic \u201cThink About It.\u201d\n\u201cThe other element of the band, the essential element of the band, was surviving on the \u2018B\u2019 sides at that time,\u201d Relf said.\nPenned by McCarty, Page and Relf, the song opened with a ringing, hypnotic riff courtesy of the guitarist. Relf\u2019s sinister lyrics resonated with any listener lucky enough to actually turn the 45 over. Even the biscuit-tin drumming added to the tune\u2019s appeal. A wonderful howl from Keith Relf summoned the bridge where at last Jimmy Page fully came into his own on a Yardbirds studio piece. An incredible treated rhythm guitar track tolled underneath a flurry of notes that featured snatches of the solo that Page was using on \u201cDazed And Confused.\u201d Backward percussion and a harmonica fade finished \u201cThink About It\u201d off in grand style. It was certainly a fitting Last Will And Testament. The single was the final official release by the group during their existence.\n\u201cI suppose that was the other side of The Yardbirds still trying \u2013 \u2018Think About It,\u2019\u201d Relf remembered later.\nUnfortunately, listeners were unaware of either \u201cGoodnight Sweet Josephine\u201d or its dynamic \u2018B\u2019 side. The song didn\u2019t so much as dent the Top 100 in America and it wasn\u2019t even issued in England. Sadly, \u201cThink About It\u201d was the right song at the right time. But after four successive singles featuring bubblegum, nobody was buying anymore.\nOn a brighter note, Most had been relived from production duties before the single came out. Manny Kellem had been appointed as The Yardbirds A&R man and producer by label head Clive David before the spring of 1968. Unfortunately, nobody seems to have noticed at the time that \u201cThink About It\u201d had been squandered.\nThis is the type of material that The Yardbirds still excelled at in live situations, though. And while fans might not have been buying the singles, they were still flocking to see the group perform. In particular, the underground scene in America had embraced them as psychedelic ambassadors. This would have shocked Eric Clapton, who only three years earlier dismissed his former bandmates as purveyors of pop and nothing more.\nAlthough The Yardbirds boasted three of the greatest guitarists ever, it should be noted the group never indulged in gratuitous soloing. By \u201968 it had become expected due to Cream\u2019s influence for bands to engage in lengthy improvisations, whereas instrumentalists traded solos ad infinitum. While The Yardbirds were stretching out numbers (one must bear in mind they had been doing this as early as 1963 anyway), they never noodled a la The Grateful Dead. Rather, the instruments weaved a pattern of sonic threads, hues and textures, i.e. images in sound. Nobody ever soloed needlessly. These sonic segues were augmented by a stage show that sometimes included candles and incense censers.\nAt this point, Page\u2019s Telecaster boasted an appropriately swirling and luminous paint job. He had taken his sartorial sense to its logical conclusion. He was resplendent in knee-length embroidered coats and silk shirts. Dreja, too, kept pace on the fashion front. Not so the other two. Keith Relf often sported a walrus mustache and looked quite slovenly in grungy leather jackets. McCarty also dispensed with any pretence to being a Beau Brummel, wearing faded football shirts. The schism within the band ran deeper than their taste in clothing.\nRelf and McCarty were burned out. The Yardbirds were reaping dividends monetarily but the hippy duo felt artistically inhibited. Quite frankly, they\u2019d had enough. Drugs were also draining their psyches. Somewhere along the line Jim McCarty had had a particularly bad acid trip, which plunged him into a long depression.\n\u201cIt took me years to recover,\u201d he said simply.\nFootage of The Yardbirds during their last stage often reveals a tired McCarty, who sighs throughout the performance. Not that he ever contributed less than his fair share on drums. He was quite simply a young man worn to a frazzle by the demands of a hungry business. Drugs only exacerbated the exhausting situation.\nOn March 2, 1968, Relf and McCarty again expressed their desire to quit. Page and Dreja weren\u2019t surprised, just disappointed. They persuaded the two to stay through the end of the upcoming American tour at least.\nA week later, The Yardbirds made an appearance on a French television show, \u201cBouton Rouge.\u201d They played three songs, \u201cTrain Kept A-Rollin\u2019,\u201d \u201cDazed And Confused\u201d and \u201cGoodnight Sweet Josephine.\u201d The quartet might have been in its death throes, but the music was as spectacular as ever. Page, in particular, was a commanding presence as he wielded his violin bow, shining like a 1,000 suns in ruffles and assorted psychedelic threads.\nBe that as it may, the end of the road was in sight.

The Yardbirds were suffering from jetlag, having landed in America two days previously. They had spent the interim battling a springtime blizzard and playing gigs spread out over New York State.\nEpic Records was aware of their forthcoming demise. Consequently, the record company was determined to squeeze one more album out of them. The group was shocked when they were told that their Anderson Theatre show at Second Avenue and Fourth Street was going to be recorded.\nRegardless, the doughty band took the stage before an audience of devotees. The resultant show is where the crux of the Jimmy Page-era Yardbirds\u2019 legend lies. The group stormed into a version of \u201cTrain Kept A-Rollin\u2019\u201d that bore little resemblance to its rockabilly forefather. Instead, Page used an electric cattle prod to whip the song through its paces as Relf\u2019s harp bleated like a mad cow.\nHeavy metal was here for better or worse. They then surged into a hallucinatory version of \u201cMister, You\u2019re A Better Man Than I,\u201d complete with aural washes from a wah wah that dripped like quicksilver before erupting into a staggering \u201cHeart Full Of Soul.\u201d Next up was their reworking of Jake Holmes\u2019 tune. It was an overwhelming showpiece and the very heart of their gigs now.\nThroughout the song, The Yardbirds experimented with liberal dashes of silence amid the sound, creating a disconcerting aural collage that left the audience aghast. \u201cDazed And Confused\u201d glistened nightmare white, sweating sex and suicide. It was psychedelia at high tide.\nAfter delivering said tune, the group realized they couldn\u2019t one-up themselves. Rather, they strutted their soul inclinations on a cover of \u201cMy Baby.\u201d Jimmy Page once again showed off his mastery of the Crybaby pedal.\nThe Yardbirds ran through the rest of their repertoire, featuring hit singles and selected material from the LITTLE GAMES album. Knowing that this tour was to be their last, the band appears to have enjoyed themselves for the first time in years. Just before \u201cShapes Of Things,\u201d Relf gently chided Page, introducing him as the \u201cgrand sorcerer of the magick guitar.\u201d Then, Jimmy Page hoisted his Danelectro and proceeded to better The Byrds\u2019 \u201cRenaissance Fair\u201d by conjuring images of a Moroccan bazaar on \u201cWhite Summer.\u201d The Yardbirds ended the show with an extended take on \u201cI\u2019m A Man,\u201d during which Page dropped to his knees and Quote: d the riff from \u201cOver, Under, Sideways, Down.\u201d\nThe Yardbirds stayed in New York for a few days after the show, enjoying some well-deserved rest and relaxation. At some point, Epic played them tapes of the Anderson Theatre gig. The band was unhappy with the recording. Years later, Page complained in particular about the A & R man who ordered the recording of the gig, Manny Kellem.\n\u201cHe had one mike on the drums, which was unthinkable, and he miked the wrong cabinet for the guitar so that the fuzz-tone which gave it all the sustain wasn\u2019t picked up,\u201d Jimmy Page said.\nThe band rejected the live tape in early April 1968, insisting that Epic couldn\u2019t release said recording. It wasn\u2019t the last they would hear of the show, though. More later.\nThe record company played their last card, suggesting a studio session with Manny Kellem. The powers-that-be hoped that at least one more single could be released. Kellem was another strange choice as a producer, since his previous experience had been with easy listening-type material.\nThe Yardbirds entered Columbia Studios in New York and laid down five tracks between April 3 and 5, 1968. While Kellem wasn\u2019t an ideal match for the group, the results were a little more interesting than under Most\u2019s direction.\n\u201cAvron Knows\u201d was a mod-styled rocker, reminiscent of The Small Faces in polyesterday shirts and chocolate trip trousers. The Yardbirds also laid down a nice take of a song that was a regular feature in their live repertoire, Garnet Mimms\u2019 \u201cMy Baby.\u201d They had just played this at the Anderson Theatre a few days previously. However, this was the first time the backing vocals were properly recorded. Both were crackerjack performances.\nLess essential was \u201cTaking A Hold Of Me,\u201d a riff-rocker that featured a guide vocal courtesy of Jim McCarty. Given more studio time, this tune might have developed into something interesting. Downright strange was \u201cSpanish Blood,\u201d a cowboy curio that found McCarty play-acting his way through a Spaghetti Western, reciting a poem to Jimmy Page\u2019s Spanish guitar.\nThe most significant song recorded at the sessions was an original number called \u201cKnowing That I\u2019m Losing You.\u201d Once again, The Yardbirds were on the cutting edge of rock n roll. This wouldn\u2019t be apparent at the time, though. The Byrds\u2019 mythic album, SWEETHEART OF THE RODEO, has often been heralded as the origins of country-rock. The Yardbirds were breaking similar ground four months before said LP was even released. \u201cKnowing That I\u2019m Losing You\u201d is meandering hippy country, smacking of Buffalo Springfield. Keith Relf\u2019s high lonesome lyrics are matched by his yearning and heartbreaking vocal. Jimmy Page brought a down-home flavour to the proceedings with a steel guitar. Strangely, there seems to be a Quote: from \u201cCrimson & Clover\u201d in the song! Be that as it may, the tune is as remarkable as any that appeared on The Byrds\u2019 legendary album.\nHowever, while listening to playbacks, none of the recordings were deemed to have chart potential. They were filed away and remained a vague rumour for three decades. These sessions will be discussed later.\nUnfortunately, the group\u2019s most powerful song was not caught on tape at Columbia in New York City.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been one of my greatest regrets that we never recorded \u2018Dazed And Confused\u2019 in the studio,\u201d Dreja said. \u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant epitaph actually. We were feeling very dazed and confused at that point!\u201d\nLast Rave-up In L.A.\nAfter New York, the band plunged into a long tour of America. They trudged across the continent for two months. Finally, they arrived in California, where they played a last stand in Los Angeles at the famed Shrine on May 31 and June 1. D.C. Cole attended these two performances, smuggling a tape deck into the auditorium under his girlfriend\u2019s maternity dress. The resultant recording became one of rock\u2019s most treasured bootlegs, LAST RAVE-UP IN L.A. The Yardbirds\u2019 performance is breathtaking, but unfortunately the sound itself is abysmal. Cole\u2019s recollections of the event do shed significant light on some of the very last shows the group ever played, though.\n\u201cThe 1968 shows at the Shrine were amazing. Their music had developed to such a point that some of it was the most advanced rock n roll ever done. It was like electronic Stravinsky,\u201d Cole remembered.\nThis is especially significant, considering Cole had seen them on three separate occasions during the previous year. At that time, he had been disappointed in Page\u2019s performance.\n\u201cI was frustrated with the band in 1967. I\u2019d been following them since their very first American tour. Obviously, Beck was incredible. Page was a let down on their first tour as a four-piece. He carried on valiantly without Beck, playing both lead and rhythm. But his tone was muddy, not like Beck\u2019s sultry sound. On their last tour, Page had got it together and was stunning,\u201d Cole said.\nAt this point, the band could segue effortlessly from pop to blues to psychedelia to heavy metal. The volume of their live shows was simply overpowering. A listen to \u201cI\u2019m A Man\u201d during the Los Angeles gig reveals a girl yelling at the pinnacle of the song \u201ccan\u2019t they play it more quietly?\u201d The Bo Diddley number had been with them since their Crawdaddy days in 1963. Of course, it was now a barely recognizable acid casualty.\nThe Yardbirds\u2019 song list in Los Angeles was very similar to the one they had played two months earlier in New York. However, there were a few additions to their repertoire that they didn\u2019t perform at the Anderson show. The old whipping post, \u201cSmokestack Lightning,\u201d at this point was a surrealistic medley that would dissolve into a cover of \u201cI\u2019m Waiting For The Man.\u201d The Velvet Underground song had shown up in the Yardbirds\u2019 set at various times during the previous year. On their final tour, it had been transformed beyond recognition. The original was a perverse pop song that buzzed and shimmered with an antiseptic ether-glow. The Yardbirds pushed it into the Interstellar Delta, resulting in a post-apocalyptic homage to white noise, i.e. a rave-up that reeked of Stockhausian dissonance. The Brits\u2019 thrashing cover certainly would have felt quite at home on The Velvet Underground\u2019s sophomore album.\n\u201cThat\u2019s another one we probably should have recorded in the studio,\u201d Dreja said.\nThis show also featured a harmonica workout by Keith Relf on \u201cBye Bye Bird.\u201d This was a strange choice indeed, being a straight blues cover with Relf playing solo harp. D.C. Cole explained why this Sonny Boy Williamson song made a seemingly arbitrary appearance.\n\u201cThere was a reason for that interlude. Jimmy Page had broken some strings and his hand was bleeding,\u201d Cole said. \u201cHe sat down on the edge of the stage, sobbing. Relf played harmonica until Page got it back together.\u201d\nEmotions were obviously running high as the band reached the end of the road. Relf and McCarty were experiencing a sense of relief. Page, on the other hand, must have been frustrated beyond belief, knowing they were throwing away vast potential.\nIn early June, The Yardbirds played their last American gigs at a speedway in Montgomery, Alabama. Soon, they returned to England and on July 7, 1968 played their final gig at Luton Technical College. It was officially over. Or so they thought. The fallout is still being felt three decades later.\nPhoenix From The Ashes\nKeith Relf and Jim McCarty indulged in their acoustic fantasies for a brief time as a duo called Together. Nothing came of it, so they formed an outfit called Renaissance, which attempted to marry rock to classical. This peculiarly English fascination with legitimising rock n roll by adding classical motifs also came to naught after an eponymous debut album. One listen to said LP and it\u2019s obvious that Relf and McCarty were shell-shocked survivors of the rock n roll wars. Nothing else can explain their decision to pursue this type of music after the sheer audacity of their earlier work. Ironically, a few years later Relf was involved in a heavy metal band, Armageddon. Their one and only album features some of Relf\u2019s best vocals and harmonica work. Sadly, he was electrocuted to death in his private recording studio in 1976. He was only 33-years-old.\nJimmy Page and Chris Dreja had initially planned on continuing The Yardbirds. However, Dreja soon dropped out. John Paul Jones entered the picture on bass and vocalist Robert Plant and drummer John Bonham rounded out Page\u2019s new quartet. Contrary to accepted myth, the band never called itself The New Yardbirds. The real Yardbirds had contractual obligations to fulfill in Scandinavia in September of 1968. Page\u2019s new band (with Peter Grant still managing) made the trip instead. Advertisements bill them either as The Yardbirds or The Yardbirds With Jimmy Page. The only time the band was ever billed as The New Yardbirds was on one side of a Marquee flyer for their British debut in October 1968. The other side of the same announcement portrayed them as The Yardbirds, however. Within a few days, the group changed their name to Led Zeppelin. Page continued to derive mileage from his Yardbirds past, making a reputation for himself on the back of \u201cDazed And Confused.\u201d\nIn retrospect, it\u2019s obvious that Jimmy Page made the right choice financially. However, a comparison of \u201cDazed And Confused\u201d as played by his two bands is quite telling. The Yardbirds\u2019 version is alternately delicate and threatening while Led Zeppelin\u2019s is shrill and devoid of spontaneity as well as lacking significant tonal shading. The piece\u2019s real author, Jake Holmes, shares that evaluation. He received a copy of The Yardbirds\u2019 reading of his song in the spring of 2001. Previously he had been unaware that the band had even covered it.\n\"The Yardbirds\u2019 \u2018Dazed And Confused\u2019 is really good. I understand what \u2018garage\u2019 people see in all this craziness. I like their version much better than Led Zeppelin\u2019s,\" Jake Holmes said.\nJimmy Page was still delving into his bag of leftovers on Led Zeppelin\u2019s third album. The band re-recorded one of the songs The Yardbirds had done in April of 1968, \u201cKnowing That I\u2019m Losing You.\u201d Led Zeppelin called it \u201cTangerine.\u201d The arrangements are almost identical. The song was attributed solely to Jimmy Page, with no mention being made of Keith Relf, who had written a significant chunk of the lyrics that appeared in Led Zeppelin\u2019s version.\n\u201cHe (Keith Relf) should really be given a credit for that one,\u201d Jim McCarty said, referring specifically to the second verse\u2019s lyrics in \u201cKnowing That I\u2019m Losing You,\u201d which appear intact as the first verse in \u201cTangerine.\u201d\nThe two versions both feature a steel guitar courtesy of Page. Once again, The Yardbirds\u2019 version is superior. Relf\u2019s vocals are heartbreaking and McCarty\u2019s drums much lighter. Their take has a prominent Morricone touch and the massed vocals at the end take it to new heights. Led Zeppelin\u2019s version simply pales in comparison.\nAs for Chris Dreja, he quickly settled into life as a professional photographer. He basically abandoned music until hooking up with ex-Yardbirds Jim McCarty and Paul Samwell-Smith (who had spent the intervening years as a producer of Cat Stevens and Jethro Tull among others) in the \u201880s as Box Of Frogs. McCarty had stayed busy in the music scene through the \u201870s. His valiant struggle with drugs is documented in an autobiographical album released in 1994, OUT OF THE DARK.\nIn 1992, The Yardbirds were inducted into The Rock n Roll Hall Of Fame. It was vindication of sorts for Jim McCarty and Chris Dreja, since neither of them had reaped the rewards or recognition that their former colleagues had. The duo reformed The Yardbirds in the mid-1990s. This latter day version of the band is logging as much travel time as the \u201967 incarnation. That\u2019s another story, though.\nFinal Approach\nIt\u2019s slowly becoming apparent that the Yardbirds\u2019 final years were far more artistically successful than has been generally conceded. Some of the \u201967-\u201968 material matches up to anything the Beck-era produced. Witness especially \u201cWhite Summer,\u201d \u201cOnly The Black Rose,\u201d \u201cGlimpses,\u201d \u201cThink About It,\u201d \u201cAvron Knows,\u201d \u201cKnowing That I\u2019m Losing You\u201d and \u201cDazed And Confused.\u201d These songs are all as innovative and dynamic as anything produced by the band in its previous incarnations.\nAs for albums, LITTLE GAMES has always been in the shadow of its big brother, ROGER THE ENGINEER. The Page lineup\u2019s studio album itself is aging surprisingly well. Some of ROGER THE ENGINEER\u2019s blues retreads are badly dated unlike the blues rewrites on LITTLE GAMES. A back-to-back listen finds the two albums of similar quality.\nUnfortunately, of the six albums put out in the United States during the band\u2019s existence, only two of them were recorded as actual albums. Of course, those are the two aforementioned LPs. Amazingly, the band was given less than a week\u2019s time to record the fabled ROGER THE ENGINEER. Even then, there were significant obstacles to overcome. The band didn\u2019t even have material composed, so they were forced to improvise on the spot, laying down basic tracks as Keith Relf wrote lyrics in the vocal booth! As for LITTLE GAMES, the haphazard circumstances surrounding its difficult delivery were examined in this article.\nThe other four albums were ad hoc single compilations, live recordings and a greatest hits collection. Yet even with this erratic approach, The Yardbirds have garnered a posthumous reputation that any band would envy.\nIn retrospect, it\u2019s mind-boggling that a group could experience so many cataclysmic changes and still revolutionize music as The Yardbirds did. Swapping lead guitarists like socks and losing four members along with enduring three managers in the space of five years would have sunk any other band. In comparison, The Byrds were the epitome of stability compared to their feathered British cousins. Given a stable management situation and a producer with vision, it\u2019s impossible to contemplate what might have been.\nHowever, that\u2019s not the way it went down. As for this article, it\u2019s a re-evaluation of the Page-era, not revisionism. \u201cHa Ha Said The Clown\u201d is still a truly horrendous song. But let\u2019s not forget that the Beck line-up was also capable of producing dreck like \u201cMy Girl Sloopy.\u201d\nThe critical reception given LITTLE GAMES upon its initial release was generally favorable. As the years went by, though, its stock fell. By the late 1980s, the Jimmy Page-era Yardbirds were regarded as having squandered a colossal amount of potential. The balance was redressed to a certain extent in 1992. A compilation was issued, joining that configuration\u2019s album with unreleased studio recordings and the singles with their essential \u2018B\u2019 sides like \u201cThink About It.\u201d Entitled LITTLE GAMES SESSIONS & MORE, the Page line-up finally reclaimed some of what was due them in the first place.\nUnfortunately, a complete reassessment of this era rests in the hands of the one man who should care about it the most, Jimmy Page himself. How so? The story stretches back to April 1968. At that time, the group rejected the Anderson Theatre recordings. In 1971, Epic Records decided to sneak the show into the marketplace. The record company obviously hoped to ride on Jimmy Page\u2019s long coattails, what with the massive success Led Zeppelin was experiencing. The New York City gig was issued as an album called LIVE YARDBIRDS! FEATURING JIMMY PAGE. \u201cDazed And Confused\u201d was erroneously called \u201cI\u2019m Confused\u201d on the release, a title the band never used. Jimmy Page had it suppressed immediately.\n\u201cThe Anderson Theatre show I didn\u2019t think was too bad. Jimmy says Keith had a bad night. I think it was more a case of doing \u2018Dazed And Confused\u2019 pre-Zeppelin that made him withdraw it,\u201d Jim McCarty said.\nPage was also rightfully incensed that crowd noises had been overdubbed on the performance. Instead of brooding silences throughout \u201cDazed And Confused,\u201d a listener could now hear cocktail glasses clinking.\nIn 1976, the album was released yet again. Once more, Page halted its release. The show has been available in different pirate configurations ever since. Its first official CD release occurred in the summer of 2000 when Mooreland Street Records issued a version. This particular CD also had an afternoon sound check of \u201cTrain Kept A-Rollin\u2019\u201d and \u201cDazed And Confused,\u201d which were taken from an audience member\u2019s recording. Critics instantly hailed the release as a major lost classic. Unfortunately, Jimmy Page had his lawyers issue a \u201ccease and desist\u201d order within weeks.\nMuch has been made of why Page doesn\u2019t want this album out. Funnily enough, he has said he thinks the group\u2019s performance is substandard. Comparing said show to Led Zeppelin\u2019s officially sanctioned mediocre live opus, THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME, begs the question: is he serious?\nIn retrospect, Jim McCarty and Chris Dreja are quite content with the Anderson Theatre performance. Strangely, they insist the band played better gigs. If that\u2019s true, one can\u2019t begin to fathom what The Yardbirds sounded like on a good night. As it is, the performance in question is the best live show caught on tape in rock history. \u2018nuff said.\nJimmy Page ordered Epic to destroy the masters, parts and lacquers of the Anderson gig in 1977. Things get murky at this point. Files also show that all tapes were \u201creturned to client\u201d (whom the record company believed to be Jimmy Page, not The Yardbirds). Records are inconclusive as to whether this was actually done, though.\nAs for the Columbia sessions recorded by the band in April 1968, that is also a complex story. Four of the songs were released on a compilation in the summer of 2000. Entitled CUMULAR LIMIT, the package of Jimmy Page-era material was issued by NMC. Fans were alternately elated and disappointed. The sessions had been a vague rumor for years. Once issued, copies of the album were snapped up quickly. The four songs satisfied expectations. Further, there was a version of \u201cDazed And Confused\u201d (properly credited to Jake Holmes as arranged by The Yardbirds) from their appearance on French television in March 1968. As with all things Yardbirds, though, fans were left only half-satisfied.\n\u201cKnowing That I\u2019m Losing You\u201d was nowhere to be found on CUMULAR LIMIT. Jim McCarty had hinted that it would be included on the compilation in an interview prior to the release. At the last minute, McCarty and Chris Dreja (who had participated in the project) instructed NMC not to include that particular song out of deference to Jimmy Page\u2019s delicate sensibilities. Specifically, they didn\u2019t want to upset their former guitarist by including a song he had made famous with Led Zeppelin. It made no difference. Page issued a legal challenge. The record company is no longer pressing copies of the album.\nMcCarty, Dreja and Keith Relf\u2019s widow, April, would like to see both albums re-released and have attempted to negotiate with The Yardbirds\u2019 former guitarist, but to no avail. Issuing LIVE YARDBIRDS! FEATURING JIMMY PAGE along with all five songs from the last studio sessions would finally give the \u201967-\u201868 line-up its richly deserved desserts.\nPage has been unfairly blamed for the apparent shortcomings of the band\u2019s recorded repertoire during his tenure. Let\u2019s not forget that he shouldered the burden of playing sole guitar in a group that was designed for two guitarists. Ironically, Jimmy Page himself has contributed to his tenure\u2019s lack of critical acclaim. By suppressing LIVE YARDBIRDS! FEATURING JIMMY PAGE and the songs from the final Columbia sessions (especially \u201cKnowing That I\u2019m Losing You\u201d), he has kept some of the band\u2019s finest work out of the hands of the public. It behooves Jimmy Page to . . . nay, it\u2019s his responsibility to rehabilitate the reputation of his beloved Yardbirds. This is an open plea to him from fans all over the world to give his consent to releasing the material in dispute.\nIn the meantime, what recordings do you need from the band\u2019s final configuration? Try and track down LITTLE GAMES SESSIONS & MORE, LIVE YARDBIRDS! FEATURING JIMMY PAGE and CUMULAR LIMIT. Indeed, as far as albums go, LIVE YARDBIRDS! FEATURING JIMMY PAGE is the best platter the band ever recorded. Dynamically speaking, that is. While it\u2019s a bit ragged in places, it still packs a potent punch that is matched by few albums in rock n roll history. Unfortunately, that album and CUMULAR LIMIT will be difficult to obtain at this point, what with the scarcity of said product due to legal scuffles. It will be well worth your time and efforts. That\u2019s a promise. Happy hunting and Yardmerizing!\nAll Chris Dreja, Jim McCarty, Jake Holmes and D.C. Cole Quote: s are from interviews conducted with the author.

(AP Photo/Danny Moloshok) \nBy Rishi Iyengar \nNEW DELHI (CNNMoney) -- Google is going on a hiring spree to try to stamp out offensive videos and comments on YouTube. \nThe company is recruiting thousands of reviewers to reduce the amount of \"problematic content\" on its video platform. It's also introducing tougher restrictions on advertising and making greater use of smart technology. \nBy 2018, Google aims to have more than 10,000 people \"working to address content that might violate our policies,\" YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said in a blog post. She did not say how many people currently monitor YouTube for offensive videos. \n\"Some bad actors are exploiting our openness to mislead, manipulate, harass or even harm,\" Wojcicki said, adding that YouTube's trust and safety teams have reviewed nearly 2 million videos for violent extremist content over the past six months. \n\"We are also taking aggressive action on comments, launching new comment moderation tools and in some cases shutting down comments altogether,\" she said. \nYouTube has grappled with a series of controversies this year concerning videos available on its platform. It was forced to adopt additional screening measures last month on its kid-friendly platform, YouTube Kids, after reports showed many of the videos there contained profanity and violence. \nCompanies such as Etihad Airways, Marriott and Deliveroo pulled their advertisements in June -- as did the U.K.'s Labour Party -- after finding they were appearing alongside videos made by a hate preacher. \nWojcicki said YouTube was taking a \"new approach to advertising,\" with more manual curation, stricter criteria for videos eligible to show ads, and a greater number of ad reviewers. \n\"We want advertisers to have peace of mind that their ads are running alongside content that reflects their brand's values,\" she said. \"Equally, we want to give creators confidence that their revenue won't be hurt by the actions of bad actors.\" \nThe company isn't just banking on more human intervention, however. Its machine learning algorithms have helped remove more than 150,000 videos from YouTube since June that depict violent extremism. \nWojcicki said 180,000 people would have had to work 40 weeks to assess the same amount of content. \n\"Because we have seen these positive results, we have begun training machine-learning technology across other challenging content areas, including child safety and hate speech,\" she added. \nWhile most of the new hires are content reviewers, Google is also recruiting for related jobs, including engineers and policy specialists to work on refining its machine learning technology. \nTM &\u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

(Source: Sydney Isenberg/Cronkite News) \nBy Sydney Isenberg, Cronkite News \nPHOENIX (CRONKITE) - Firefighters routinely work on staying in shape with training that goes beyond running or doing situps \u2013\u2013 think of punching a hole in a ceiling or carrying 100 pounds up the stairs. \nThe Tempe Fire Department requires firefighters to do physical training at least an hour per day while off duty and, like firefighters in the Phoenix Fire Department and other fire agencies across the United States, pass an annual physical fitness test. \nPaul Nies, assistant chief at Tempe Fire Medical Rescue, said preparing to fight fires or help people in a medical emergency is serious business. \n[RELATED: More than 100 Arizona firefighters sent to battle wildfires in southern California ] \n\u201cIf you are Tier Four, the least physically fit, we will remove you from front line service,\u201d Nies said. \nAerobic fitness and resistance to muscle fatigue are key to firefighters passing a physical fitness test, according to a 2010 University of Maryland study, as written in EHS Today. \n\u201cYou can go to the gym, and you can work out, and you can be physically fit, but as soon as you put on a pair of turnouts and start working with various tools that firefighters work with, it\u2019s a whole other ball game,\u201d said Leigha Graziano, a firefighter with the Glendale Fire Department. \nFirefighters own and operate the Great Ape Gym in Phoenix, designed to get current and aspiring firefighters in shape. \nFirefighters \u2013 or those working to become firefighters \u2013 drag tires across a yard, punch holes into an \u201cattic\u201d to ventilate smoke, carry 75 to 100 pounds of gear on their back as they walk up and down stairs, pound sledgehammers on cars to mimic swinging an axe and practice opening and closing fire hydrants. The moves build endurance, muscle and grip strength as they practice skills needed in the field. \n[READ MORE: Mesa firefighters finish Christmas decorating after ladder accident ] \n\u201cIt first just started really small \u2013 just a couple firemen in the backyard of somebody\u2019s house working, and more people kept showing up,\u201d said Chris Fleming, a firefighter for seven years and one of the five owners of the gym. \n\u201cThere\u2019s no real place for us to go to hone these skills except for something like this,\u201d Fleming said. \n\u201cFrom lifting, cardio and doing the skills courses, those help prevent those injuries from occurring,\u201d Zabek said.Zachary Zabek, who is applying to several fire departments, said firefighter-focused training gives him a competitive advantage over other candidates and helps him stay safe. \nNies said working out requires balance between exercise and rest, so the department limits physical training. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our firefighters to expend themselves in physical training and not be able to respond physically to calls,\u201d Nies said. \nCopyright 2017 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).

He was a couple of hours late in seeing the video through an app on his phone, and by the time he called 911, the entire house was ransacked. \nEven presents under the Christmas tree were stolen. \nPolice say the woman broke in through an unlocked window with help from a man who managed to keep his face off camera.

I wanted to share my experience about a trade where I initially thought this was going to be a long-term investment. This one had a tech analysis component to it but it was also a mental battle about whether I could be objective, and deal with the realities of trading and being active on media like reddit or stocktwits, investorhub, discord etc. We're not trading in isolation, we're always inundated in a sea of outside commentary and influences.\nSo for the ticker I'll just put in the image since it's on the pump and dump stock list here: https://imgur.com/AZedMP7 . I put the snapshot from my statements to show that you can recognize these patterns and act on them in realtime and not in hindsight. At the time I had a third of my funds that were settled (small portfolio, poor guy just starting out this year) and I jumped in on FDA approval news.\nFor some context, I think HMNY and a few other stocks had gone on insane runs somewhere in this timeframe. So I had this mentality that this is going to my HMNY. Why not? FDA approval, only 1 incumbent competitor, reasonably funded, instant huge moat. If a junk company can be pumped up a couple 100%, a legit robosurgery one should be able to run no problem, right?\nIt was at $5 for a few minutes (first and so far only time I was ever up 100% on a stock while holding it), then immediately turned bearish. There was that scientist with the ridiculous pump job thread. I backed up another poster here calling him out, but I still thought 'wait and see if the stock can absorb the dilution from the warrants. It's reasonable for the stock to sell off at $5. Let the profit-takers get out of the way.\"\nEventually I did catch on. I annotated the chart here: https://imgur.com/oAxp77k . I scalped it again for another 15% off the 20MA bounce so I don't feel as bad about missing the 100%. I didn't consciously choose to let the pumpers influence me (obviously), but this stuff happens especially if you're new to this. Are my thoughts on the direction of the stock my own, have they been influenced by someone else? And if so, to what extent? That's what I try to remind myself to assess.\nAnd obviously cost-basis matters. For me on Oct 24th given an entry of 2.5 I understood I can get in at that entry or lower so I have no ' reinvestment risk' . So by not selling, I'm burning money for no reason. But someone at 1.50 looking to hold long term, if they sell, they probably won't be able to buy back there for a while so their optimal move is closer to hold longer-term instead of selling and rebuying was for me. But they are incentivized to pump the stock, they hope you become a bagholder instead of taking profit, then put a limit sell on your shares so they can't be borrowed to be sold short while you're stuck waiting for the next catalyst. Meaning we can't go mix-and-matching advice that's good for other people but makes zero sense for our own position.\nA more recent one I was watching was CTRV https://imgur.com/SPR67m3 . Same patterns, except there was more price history and there's a fakeout I annotated. It is my first hat trick stock so I checked up on the chart, and was tempted to get back in since it had returned to its base at 0.47-0.48. But, again, descending triangle, so didn't take the trade. If I was a fundamental investor who knows the company and drug and the science and all that checks out, I'd have waited for the break and move down before buying.\nI have one more, https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_102090285.PNG?1511199579 . This one immediately broke the lower trendline by not putting in further higher lows, so I just sold flat. No problem, don't need to turn it into a ' okay, let's hold and see what happens ' gamble-play. Kind of the flip side to CTRV where a bullish pattern is developing and fizzles out on low volume.\nIn conclusion, you'll likely be in a situation where you'll have that inkling in the back of your mind that goes against the grain. You'll face conflict between the instinct that's made you money and what the rest of the people are telling you. You should listen to the first thing.\n submitted by /u/BannerlordAdmirer\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://imgur.com/SPR67m3", "https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_102090285.PNG?1511199579", "https://imgur.com/AZedMP7", "https://imgur.com/oAxp77k"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:29.000+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15132908, "moreResultsAvailable": 15132808, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512638549000&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 774}
