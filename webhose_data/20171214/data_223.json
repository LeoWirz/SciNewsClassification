It was for this reason why, as Lord Chancellor, he took such an active interest in the colonization of America, and why he sent his son to Virginia as one of the early colonists. For it was in America, through the pen of Thomas Paine and the writings of Thomas Jefferson, as well as through the revolutionary activities of his many Rosicrucian-Freemasonic followers, most prominent among whom were George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, that he hoped to create a new nation dedicated to his political philosophy. In his  Secret Destiny of America , Manly Hall, Bacon's most understanding modern scholar, refers to the appearance in America, prior to the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, of a mysterious Rosicrucian philosopher, a strict vegetarian who ate only foods that grew above the ground, who was a friend and teacher of Franklin and Washington and who seemed to have played an important role in the founding of the new republic. Why most historians failed to mention him is a puzzle, for that he existed is a certainty. \nHe was known as the \"Professor.\" Together with Franklin and Washington, he was a member of the committee selected by the Continental Congress in 1775 to create a design for the American Flag. The design he made was accepted by the committee and given to Betsy Ross to execute into the first model. \nA year later, on July 4, 1776, this mysterious stranger, whose name nobody knew, suddenly appeared in Independence Hall and delivered a stirring address to the fearful men there gathered, who were wondering whether they should risk their lives as traitors by affixing their names to the memorable document which Thomas Jefferson wrote and of whose ideals Francis Bacon, founder of Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism, was the true originator. \nThe flag unfurled at Cambridge, Mass. in 1775, which the Professor designed, symbolized the union of the colonies; it was called the Grand Union Flag, and its design was as follows: In the blue field of the upperleft-hand corner was the white diagonal cross of St. Andrews. Imposed on this was the Red Cross, which was given the name of St. George. The thirteen stripes, seven of red and six of white, alternating in the flag, represented the thirteen colonies. The flag was used for some time, but owing to its similarity with the British flag, which supposedly symbolized the unity of England and Scotland, considerable controversy arose over it. In order to overcome this objection, in 1776 it was decided to design another flag which would follow the spirit of the original design; and the inverted triangle over the upright triangle, generally known as the St. Andrew's Cross, a Masonic symbol of Kabbalistic origin and denoting that the originator of the flag was a Freemason and Rosicrucian, was preserved by using a six-pointed star, placed in irregular fashion on a blue back-ground in the form of a new constellation. \nWhen General Johnson and Doctor Franklin visited Mrs. Elizabeth Ross, otherwise known as Betsy Ross, to get her cooperation in making the flag, the five-pointed star appealed to her as being more beautiful than the six-pointed star of the Professor's original design which the committee accepted. Hence, out of deference to her sense of beauty, the five-pointed stars were used instead, and thirteen of them were placed in a circle on a blue field with the standard seven red and six white stripes completing the flag. \nThis sample flag was made just before the Declaration of Independence, although the resolution endorsing it was not passed by the Continental Congress until July 14, 1777. A second time did this mysterious stranger, the \"Professor,\" whose name and origin was unknown, pay a vital role in American history. This time it was at the signing of the Declaration' of Independence. It was on June 7, 1776, that Richard Henry Lee, a delegate from Virginia, offered in Congress the first resolution declaring that the United Colonies were, and of right ought. to be, free and independent states. Soon after Mr. Lee introduced his resolution, he was taken sick and returned to his home in Virginia, whereupon on June 11th, 1776, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman and Robert Livingston were appointed as a committee to prepare a formal Declaration of Independence. \nOn the first of July, 1776, the committee made its report to Congress. On the second of July, Lee's resolution was adopted in its original words. During the third of July, the formal Declaration of Independence was reported by the committee and debated with great enthusiasm. The discussion was resumed on the fourth, Jefferson having been elected as chairman of the committee. \nOn July 4th, there was great suspense throughout the nation. Many were adverse to severing the ties with the mother country; and many feared the vengeance of the king and his armies. Many battles had been fought already, but no decisive victory had been won by the rebel colonists. Each man in the Continental Congress realized as Patrick Henry did that it was either Liberty or Death. A rash move could mean death. After all, they were not free but subjects of a king who considered them as rebels and could punish them accordingly. They could be convicted for treason and put to death. \nJust what connection did the mysterious stranger who designed the American flag and encouraged the signing of the Declaration of Independence have to Francis Bacon or Count Saint-Germain? Writing on this subject, Manly Hall says: \n\"Many times the question has been asked, Was Francis Bacon's vision of the \"New Atlantis\" a prophetic dream of the great civilization which was so soon to rise upon the soil of the New World? It cannot be doubted that the secret societies of. Europe conspired to establish upon the American continent 'a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.' Two incidents in the early history of the United States evidence the influence of that secret body, which has so long guided the destinies of peoples and religions. By them nations are created as vehicles for the promulgation of ideals, and while nations are true to these ideals they survive; when they vary from them, they vanish like the Atlantis of old which had ceased to 'know the gods.'\" In his admirable little treatise, \"Our Flag,\" Robert Allen Campbell revives the details of an obscure, but most important, episode of American history\u2014the designing of the Colonial flag of 1775. The account involves a mysterious man concerning whom no information is available other than that he was on familiar terms with both General Washington and Dr. Benjamin Franklin. The following description of him is taken from Campbell's treatise: \"Little seems to have been known concerning this old gentleman; and in the materials from which this account is compiled, his name is not even once mentioned, for he is uniformly spoken of or referred to as 'the Professor.' He was evidently far beyond his threescore and ten years; and he often referred to historical events of more than a century previous just as if he had been a living witness to their occurrence; still he was erect, vigorous and active\u2014hale, hearty and clear-minded, as strong and energetic every way as in the prime of life. He was tall, of fine figure, perfectly easy, very dignified in his manners, being at once courteous, gracious and commanding. He was, for those times, and considering the customs of the Colonists, very peculiar in his method of living; for he ate no flesh, fowl or fish; he never used for food any 'green thing', any roots or anything unripe; he drank no liquor, wine or ale; but confined his diet to cereals and their products, fruits that were ripened on the stem in the sun, nuts, mild tea and the sweet of honey, sugar and molasses. [  Editor's note: The Comte de Saint Germain's same abstemious behavior regarding food was well documented in Europe. ] \"He was well educated, highly cultivated, of extensive as well as varied information, and very studious. He spent considerable of his time in the patient and persistent scanning of a number of very rare old books and ancient manuscripts which he seemed to be deciphering, translating or rewriting. These books, and manuscripts, together with his own writings, he never showed to anyone; and he did not even mention them in his conversations with the family, except in the most casual way; and he always locked them up carefully in a large, old-fashioned, cubically shaped, iron-bound, heavy oaken chest, whenever he left his room, even for his meals. He took long and frequent walks alone, sat on the brows of the neighboring hills, or mused in the midst of the green and flower-gemmed meadows. He was fairly liberal\u2014but in no way lavish\u2014in spending his money, with which he was well supplied. He was a quiet, though a very genial and very interesting member of the family; and he was seemingly at home upon any and every topic coming up in conversation. He was, in short, one whom everyone would notice and respect, whom few would feel well acquainted with, and whom no one would presume to question concerning himself\u2014as to whence he came, why he tarried or whither he journeyed.\" \n\"By something more than a mere coincidence, the committee appointed by the Colonial Congress to design a flag accepted an invitation to be guests, while at Cambridge, of the family with which the Professor was staying. It was here that General Washington joined them for the purpose of deciding upon a fitting emblem. By the signs that passed between them, it was evident that General Washington and Doctor Franklin recognized the Professor, and by unanimous approval, he was invited to become an active member of the committee. During the proceedings which followed, the Professor was treated with the most profound respect and all his suggestions immediately acted upon. He submitted a pattern which he considered symbolically appropriate for the new flag, and this was unhesitatingly accepted by the six other members of the committee, who voted that the arrangement suggested by the Professor be forthwith adopted. After the episode of the flag, the Professor quickly vanished; and nothing further is known concerning him. \n\"Did General Washington and Doctor Franklin recognize the Professor as an emissary of the Mystery School which has so long controlled the political destinies of this planet? Benjamin Franklin was a philosopher and a Freemason\u2014possibly a Rosicrucian initiate. He and the Marquis de Lafayette\u2014also a man of mystery\u2014constitute two of the important links in the chain of circumstance that culminated in the establishment of the original thirteen American colonies as a free and independent nation. Dr. Franklin's philosophic attainments are well attested in  Poor Richard's Almanac , published by him for many years under the name of Richard Saunders. His interest in the cause of Freemasonry is also shown in his publication of Anderson's  Constitutions of 'Freemasonry . \"It was during the, evening of July 4, 1776, that the second of these mysterious episodes occurred. In the old State House in Philadelphia, a group of men were gathered for the momentous task of severing the tie between the old country and the new. It was a grave moment, and not a few of those present feared that their lives would be the forfeit for their audacity. In the midst of the debate a fierce voice rang out. The debaters stopped and turned to look upon the stranger. Who was this man who had suddenly appeared in their midst and had transfixed them with his oratory? They had never seen him before, none knew when he had entered; but his tall form and pale face filled them with awe. His voice ringing with a holy zeal, the stranger stirred them to their very souls. His closing words rang. through the building, 'God has given America to be free!' As the stranger sank into a chair exhausted, a wild enthusiasm burst forth. Name after name was placed upon the parchment: the Declaration of Independence was signed. But where was the man who had precipitated the accomplishment of this immortal task\u2014who had lifted for a moment the veil from the eyes of the assemblage and revealed to them a part at least of the great purpose for which the, new nation was conceived? He had disappeared, nor was he ever seen or his identity established. This episode parallels others of a similar kind recorded by ancient historians attendant upon the founding of every new nation. Are they coincidence, or do they indicate that the divine wisdom of the ancient mysteries still is present in the world, serving mankind as it did of old?\" \nThe End To read 'The Professor's' speech to the Continental Congress go here: The Speech of the Unknown:   An electrifying speech given by an unknown man, galvanizing the reluctant signers of the Declaration of Independence into action. \n\nhttp://www.thelivingmoon.com/ \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "germain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franklin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard henry lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick henry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john adams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert livingston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elizabeth ross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. george", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin franklin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bacon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard saunders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger sherman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raymond bernardthroughout", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manly hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas jefferson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert allen campbell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marquis de lafayette", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jefferson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "betsy ross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas paine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francis bacon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colonial congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red cross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mystery school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "campbell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. andrews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united colonies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "continental congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "st. germai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "independence hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mass.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manly hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:45.036+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "605e82abaa3e6494fef02f80a55e49a018a1c310", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvUKSDDBPfaC4F_mmxdXcpDDsBo4ZdSq93hlpzI.cE8.0yGmYw1IQqHWoWK6dM3GuxKUUVFo8mQy9fqP2TQT9MLqQpNmBf4gOBtqh6ZncfrlKVFE1HNaVEToh9_HBh6O9.URyNB_I24PsfQTXOF44Gr3dslLAFGwhtojUGHN..snny6fz0Pv3IFsJIZ5NpEwgcdbT0tjNCMXNeSp4w70rq5w--", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news -

If the standby was just a transformer offering too low a voltage to overcome friction I think it could work. From memory the drive train is the same running or stopped. Not so the Garrard where it could get a flat spot. If so it could be a cheap solution with real merit. What happens here is the motor inductance and DC resistance are in series. If not the motor would take huge current. Even when not rotating the inductance is the dominant quality. At circa 80 Vrms ( 160 V rms UK ) I would imagine the turntable would stop rotating yet still draw a reduced current. I would guess when taken up to full voltage the warm up time would be about 3 minutes. If you say to +/- 0.1% it might be instant. I imagine 5 watts of heating would be available at 80 V. It would be interesting to know the DC resistance of the motor.\nI know what you mean about the Denon. I bought JVC L3 and L5 mini DD for friends. I think they work better than a LP12 Ekos I was using ( DL110 ). Looking at all the details they are not what they look to be. JVC TT71 shares parts. Alas they need constant little fixes to keep them working. Mostly cleaning things. The rock solid images can make an LP12 sound like it's AR cousin. As someone said who had a LP12, slightly drunk. I would say no CD player I have heard puts the little JVC's to shame. No CD player makes me not go to bed. The JVC's go well past 2 in the morning. The arm design copes very well with warps, not plastic as it looks. The PU seems an AT95 type device. Some say JVC made the very best DD's. The Technics designs may well be JVC. My friend ex of JVC thinks so. He was involved with the Mobile Fidelity project. JVC X1 pioneered many aspects of modern pick ups. Diamond shape to track CD4 imformation well above 20 kHz.

That's an excellent idea. I built a very crude low cost auto using a boost transformer. If we take the USA mains to be 115Vrms nominal ( in the past 117V I am told ) we could risk 6Vrms boost. I would guess 7Vrms from a lightly loaded 20VA type. If the usual voltage is lower a 9Vrms type. I often have to build something like this to test an idea. I never had a problem. Auto transformers I have played with seem to be made this way. Keep an eye on it and if happpy buy a real one. I don't think you will have a problem. The buck version would be good for an early Garrard 301.\nAs I think is clear the transformer adds it's 6Vrms output to the real mains 115Vrms. If you get it wrong it will buck the voltage. If you have any doubts find someone who knows ( wise even if you think you do ). If you feed 115 Vrms directly into the 6Vrms side you will get fire. The fuse is about what I think should do the job. I suspect that is the best place for it. Another to the input 115V side would be wise. It \" might \" be 250 mAT. If you fuse at 200 mAT you might blow the fuse on start up. You might need 500 mAT. If you think you might feed it into the 6V side add a 500 mAT output fuse ( 3 x 500 mAT looks ideal, one in and one out in addition to my drawing, all on hot H side , as always unplug if changing fuses). Trial and error has always been so with fusing if at reasonable cost in a design ( if not using a starting timer and serries resistance ). Reduce the real risks is what engineers do. Often the fuse in an amplifier is vastly larger than the transformer rating. It is likely fault testing showed it was safe. I have drawn the colours roughly as I think they are.

The Joint Committee is consulting all the stakeholders on the provisions of the FRDI Bill. \nThis Bill is similar to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, which was enacted last year in May. Both of these are about issues that can arise when companies go bankrupt or insolvent, except that this Bill deals only with the companies that are in the financial sector. The insolvency code Act deals with companies in all other sectors. The FRDI will provide a comprehensive resolution framework to deal with bankruptcy situations in financial sector entities such as banks and insurance companies. \nPresently, each depositor of banks can be only protected up to a limit of Rs. 1 lakh by the guarantee of the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC). Remaining deposits (i.e. beyond Rs. 1 lakh of deposits in a bank) do not have any deposit protection guarantee and are treated, at par with claims of unsecured creditors as of now. \nBesides providing similar protection / guarantee of Rs. 1 lakh to depositors, as it exists today, the rights of uninsured depositors are being placed at an elevated status in the FRDI Bill compared to the existing legal arrangements over the unsecured creditors and even Government dues. \nHighlights of the Bill: \n-The Bill establishes a Resolution Corporation to monitor financial firms, anticipate risk of failure, take corrective action, and resolve them in case of such failure. The Corporation will also provide deposit insurance up to a certain limit, in case of bank failure. \n-The Resolution Corporation or the appropriate financial sector regulator may classify financial firms under five categories, based on their risk of failure. These categories in the order of increasing risk are: (i) low, (ii) moderate, (iii) material, (iv) imminent, and (v) critical. \n-The Resolution Corporation will take over the management of a financial firm once it is classified as \u2018critical\u2019. It will resolve the firm within one year (may be extended by another year). \n-Resolution may be undertaken using methods including: (i) merger or acquisition, (ii) transferring the assets, liabilities and management to a temporary firm, or (iii) liquidation. If resolution is not completed within a maximum period of two years, the firm will be liquidated. The Bill also specifies the order of distributing liquidation proceeds. \nFRDI Bill 2017 seeks to protect customers of financial service providers in times of financial distress. \nIt also aims to inculcate discipline among financial service providers in the event of financial crises, by limiting the use of public money to bail out distressed entities. \nThe Bill would help in maintaining financial stability in the economy by ensuring adequate preventive measures, while at the same time providing the necessary instruments for dealing with crisis events. \nThe Bill aims to strengthen and streamline the current framework of deposit insurance for the benefit of retail depositors. \nFurther, it seeks to decrease the time and costs involved in resolving distressed financial entities. \nOnce enacted, a resolution corporation will be setup to strengthen the stability and resilience of the entities in the financial sector. \nThe FRDI Bill is far more depositor friendly than many other jurisdictions, which provide for statutory bail-in, where consent of creditors / depositors is not required for bail-in. \nThe FRDI Bill does not propose in any way to limit the scope of powers for the Government to extend financing and resolution support to banks, including public sector banks. Government\u2019s implicit guarantee for public sector banks remains unaffected. \nIndian Banks have adequate capital and are also under prudent regulation and supervision to ensure safety and soundness, as well as systemic stability. The existing laws ensure the integrity, security and safety of the banking system. \nIn India, all possible steps and policy measures are taken to prevent the failure of banks and protection of interests of depositors (e.g. issue of directions / prompt corrective action measures, capital adequacy and prudential norms). \nThe FRDI Bill will strengthen the system by adding a comprehensive resolution regime that will help ensure that, in the rare event of failure of a financial service provider, there is a system of quick, orderly and efficient resolution in favour of depositors.

The emails contain links that allow the scammers to install malicious malware on users computers. BBB says the scams look like legitimate emails, and con artists use those emails to access banking and financial information. \nAccording to a Deloitte survey , UK consumers are the most active online spenders in Europe, spending nearly \u00a31bn a week online. With various reports citing upwards of 50% of people shop online during working hours, and given that many more may be inclined to do so in the run up to Christmas, these well-timed phishing scams could inadvertently impact an organisation\u2019s network. Eyal Benishti, CEO and Founder at IRONSCALES commented below. \nEyal Benishti, CEO and Founder at IRONSCALES: \n\u201cThis campaign is just another example of how fraudsters will impersonate a legitimate company, in order to exploit end users into giving them access to their machines, and consequently their personal details. Impersonation and spoofing techniques such as these, executed well by the attackers, make it virtually impossible for every individual targeted to spot threatening emails, and as a result, they are more likely to be lured into a false sense of security, and fall victim to the scam. \nAs these techniques increasingly succeed, attackers will continue to use this attack vector so it is vital organisations help their users spot and correctly act upon nefarious emails, before they endanger not only their own information, but the organisation as a whole, or even compromise partner businesses. To spot the anomalies common in spoofing and impersonation techniques, user behaviour analysis and mailbox segmentation can be employed, alongside running mailbox level detection, and utilising context based mail alerts, which, by allowing quick reporting via an augmented email experience, will help users make smarter decisions. \nIt goes without saying that users must be aware of the risks and reminded that they should never click a link in an email they believe could be illegitimate. If in doubt, the advice is to call the company directly for clarification, or if at work, contact the IT Department immediately- it could prevent them from falling victim, and protect the organisation from a potential cybersecurity crisis.\u201d In this article ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eyal benishti", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "paypal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "information security buzz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ironscales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "better business bureau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "it department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deloitte", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:45.080+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "87f25240df32f921a02b5e7cabf05b38755b8a12", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.VIRytHIYOgbDvN33F2c6T88fF8V3OH2erLJvr.w9b0nJZDGbqBNLHHBd70D0zgmI-", "site_full": "www.statueforum.com", "site": "statueforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.statueforum.com/forumdisplay.php?f=12", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Comics - Statue Forum", "title": "All-star Batman", "title_full": "All-star Batman - Statue Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T06:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "87f25240df32f921a02b5e7cabf05b38755b8a12", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.VIRytHIYOgbDvN33F2c6T88fF8V3OH2erLJvr.w9b0nJZDGbqBNLHHBd70D0zgmI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "nbr3bagshotrow", "published": "2017-12-06T06:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "All-star Batman", "text": "Yes.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:45.090+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "529e60c478269a2f73dc345b0b4314fdba77c0e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_BayCMY.tbR1WYT2KVw45D9m60N4viIAMpG8yEBA9y9AS30d.Bw2r2Oh38tXPJnr1P4J_9.NRx7TwfkXo9XW_OYjYgBAKzBFYlE4PPlfqrMg--", "site_full": "www.displayalliance.com", "site": "displayalliance.com", "site_section": "http://www.displayalliance.com/da-open/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "Open Section", "title": "How you can Find Out About Tantric Massage", "title_full": "How you can Find Out About Tantric Massage", "published": "2017-12-07T08:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "529e60c478269a2f73dc345b0b4314fdba77c0e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_BayCMY.tbR1WYT2KVw45D9m60N4viIAMpG8yEBA9y9AS30d.Bw2r2Oh38tXPJnr1P4J_9.NRx7TwfkXo9XW_OYjYgBAKzBFYlE4PPlfqrMg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Maddison Zara", "published": "2017-12-07T08:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "How you can Find Out About Tantric Massage", "text": "Share Article If you have read about erotic massage madrid e before then you know that is one of finest means to loosen up at the end of a long and also tough day.

Modernising the once 'silent night\", Melbourne Central will also welcome Yacht Club DJs for the precinct's very first silent disco. Having conducted research into the holiday habits, routines and preferences of millennials, Melbourne Central has uncovered results about the holiday period and crafted the ultimate event from Monday 11 December until Sunday 24 December.Research reveals that more than 44 per cent of millennials think Christmas is more about culture than religion; 25 per cent believe Christmas is just another day and very importantly, 53 per cent of millennials love Seinfeld.To meet the whole gamut of millennials' holiday needs, Melbourne Central has designed a festival packed with socialising, food, beauty and community causes, underpinned by the hilarious Festivus anti-Christmas theme covered in the hit-show's 1997 episode, The Strike. Melbourne's very own Festivus will see visitors and customers to Melbourne Central air their grievances (just as as Frank Costanza did), as well as celebrate the holiday spirit with an array of activities that will allow them to spend time with their buddies, backing up the friend-trend: a staggering 58 per cent of millennials choosing to spend Christmas Day with friends, rather than family.This 14 day fusion of food, dance, culture, beauty and fun pop culture, foodie haven, beauty is proof that Festivus miracles do occur, just ask Kramer!

We first met Faith when Billy was a baby. Her husband was a distant relative, linked to Adrian\u2019s grandma through some distant family history in Tewkesbury. We met up with her and another distant relative one day when Billy was a little baby (there was no Oscar yet). We love Tewkesbury. It\u2019s a pretty place, but a branch of Adrian\u2019s family tree lived there for several generations so we have come to love the place as we have visited a learned more about their lives there. One of the family lines were connected with bell-ringing and their names are on the peal boards in Tewkesbury Abbey. One of them, Josiah Wathen, was a hand bell expert and taught hand bells at a local school. His original hand bells are still in the family (we have learned to play a tune or two on them). The other side of the family were non-conformists who worshipped in the Baptist chapel in Tewkesbury.

He didn't ask friends or family but instead called upon his considerable readership. \nMark Manson : People who were happily married for 20-plus years - all of them said communication's overrated; it's all about respect. \nI'm a blogger and author. I've been blogging for nine years. \nWhen Mark was about to get married, he asked some of his happily married readers what lessons they could share. More than 1,500 people responded. \nI see this as crowdsourcing human wisdom. \nHe also asked the divorced to explain what went wrong. \nMe and my assistant started to notice after about 500 emails, most of the people who talked about their divorce focused on communication. They basically said communication is the problem and the thing you need to fix is communication. \nThe people who were happily married for 20-plus years - all of them said communication's overrated; it's all about respect. \nBasically, the argument was, if you're going to spend decades with a person you're going to miscommunicate, you're going to misunderstand each other, you're going to have situations where you don't get where the other person is coming from or you make the wrong assumptions. \nThis is just normal. If you spend enough time with anybody it happens all the time. \nSo they said, what's actually more important is having base-level respect. So that even when you misunderstand the person, you don't assume that they're like this awful, horrible person for disagreeing with you. You respect their differences. You respect that they may see things differently. \nOr you respect that they disagree with you, or have a problem that you don't understand.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark manson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:47.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "88f9ed0f997bf39f028fb196f0be1bd96a99d922", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmlN8MQld0wHZFVBgeJU9Ud8OJSDH4U153_jN1sqiZ_BYV2KTV_FSY85zsGKNQGfEDI-", "site_full": "rssfeeds.wlbz2.com", "site": "wlbz2.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.wlbz2.com/_/20/107061862/wlbz/207", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "WLBZ - 207", "title": "Flower Power", "title_full": "Flower Power", "published": "2017-12-07T02:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://content.wcsh6.com/photo/2017/12/06/Waban%20Flower%20Power_1512582488863_11885855_ver1.0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "88f9ed0f997bf39f028fb196f0be1bd96a99d922", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmlN8MQld0wHZFVBgeJU9Ud8OJSDH4U153_jN1sqiZ_BYV2KTV_FSY85zsGKNQGfEDI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "Flower Power", "text": "Students at USM's Gorham campus de-stress before finals week Students at USM's Gorham campus de-stress before finals week Rob Nesbitt , WCSH 7:17 PM.

CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nGORHAM, Maine (NEWS CENTER) -- College students all over the state are taking end of the year tests during finals week, including at the University of Southern Maine (USM). Its Gorham campus helped kids prepare by pulling them away from studying for some relaxation. \nDuring the school's stress relief event, put on by the Gorham Campus Activities Board (GCAB), around 300 students lined up to take part. There were ten minute massages, manicures free of charge, pinatas to get frustrations out, as well as two therapy dogs available to bring students comfort. \n\"It's all adding up,\" said GCAB member Dylan Edwards. \"All the papers are finally due and it's stressful, so events like this are kind of important.\" \nThe most popular stress relief of the evening, was that of the four legged variety. Two therapy dogs who seemed to enjoy the attention as much as students enjoyed petting them. Having a three year old Golden Retriever like Maisy bury her face into your lap and lick your face is a type of therapy that students like Freshman Samantha Brownrigg enjoyed the most. \n\"They are just really nice to pet,\" said Brownrigg. \"They are just so loving and they give you so much affection.\" \nThe last day of finals for students at USM is December 15th. Students will be back from Christmas break to start the spring semester on January 22nd. \n\u00a9 2017 WCSH-TV", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "diana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diana dubay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maureen harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob nesbitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris heywood", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "flower power close flowers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flower power", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern maine agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shaw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fraser-ford child development", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sanford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holly holland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:47.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6c6051c92bf647365f3d1125a47d820d8e60c39f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg93Ai8AfUnTTWWv6q.A_lmGoVcalzvUXs8EzqgVU4_5CqbgpIG2hHAoXivSg9tnWbPYpCJgXQXCnMqFYXvXWSeN3cVNdBdbTfzRWp.6xUw0IM7ZjBZDaO9iNitoePSllTK4mQN0Pbdoy1P6tCTHJWvs", "site_full": "www.ebay.com", "site": "ebay.com", "site_section": "http://www.watchinga.com/il/shopping/food.rss?utm_source=watchinga&utm_medium=categorypage&utm_term=gowatchinga_food&utm_content=shopping&utm_campaign=rssfeed", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Food & Drink Shopping on Watchinga", "title": "1pc Decorative Decoration Plastic Hot Carrot Food Vegetable Table Home New", "title_full": "1pc Decorative Decoration Plastic Hot Carrot Food Vegetable Table Home New", "published": "2017-12-07T05:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTQ5WDU1Mw==/z/za4AAOSwxixaKQaa/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6c6051c92bf647365f3d1125a47d820d8e60c39f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg93Ai8AfUnTTWWv6q.A_lmGoVcalzvUXs8EzqgVU4_5CqbgpIG2hHAoXivSg9tnWbPYpCJgXQXCnMqFYXvXWSeN3cVNdBdbTfzRWp.6xUw0IM7ZjBZDaO9iNitoePSllTK4mQN0Pbdoy1P6tCTHJWvs", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T05:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "1pc Decorative Decoration Plastic Hot Carrot Food Vegetable Table Home New", "text": "1pc Decorative Decoration Plastic Hot Carrot Food Vegetable Table Home New Condition: Estimated Dec. 25- Jan. 26 From:China Dec. 25 - Jan. 26 Est.

Due to the reliance on genetically modified foods and poor exercise plans, many have opted for personal Trainer Jersey City rather than joining gyms and other facilities to work on improving their health. Numerous advantages come with taking this step and here are just but a few of them.\n\nWhether you are a novice to exercising or used to it, there comes a time when you need someone to assist you and give you motivation. These coaches provide the necessary push needed to overcome all challenges of training. Most people expect rapid results when they start a training program and failure to this they withdraw from the schedule. When working with a coach, they encourage you to keep on putting work even when change is gradual.\n\nWhen having a private coaches for starters, be assured of assistance whenever needed. They will help in putting up a fitness chart and the exercises that are suitable for you. This will be quite helpful to a beginner since most of them will quit along the way and feel they are straining a lot hence, having assistance will enable them to know what to do and how to do them.\n\nMost people who enroll in private training tend to be busy hence finding less time or no time at all to exercise. Having a private coaches is beneficial in that they will be able to find the time and make a suitable workout plan that will not interfere with your normal day to day activities. This is an efficient way of keeping fit and also being able to do their daily routine.\n\nRegistering in a gym to most people can be difficult either due to their busy lives or they may have social anxiety concerning their body. A personal coach assures comfort to their client in many different ways. This may either be by working with you at your home or finding a suitable location that suits you. Besides improving your fitness, they also work to improve on how you view yourself and increase confidence in your body.\n\nDue to the familiarity between the coach and the trainee, a good coach understands your limits and does not push you too hard. If a client has injuries or any chronic health problems, the coach puts this into consideration when putting up a training schedule. Exercising with you over time also gives them an understanding of when you are too tired to continue therefore giving you breaks when need be.\n\nWhen working with a private coach, it is important to cater for accountability and credibility at the end of the training period. Most people have a fear of hiring a personal trainer as they assume that they are only meant to steal from them or exploit them financially. When you have a good personal trainer, they will deliver their services in bettering your health more than focusing on the financial gain.\n\nA personal coach is a guarantee to receiving the best help available and to your satisfaction for starters and the veterans.
