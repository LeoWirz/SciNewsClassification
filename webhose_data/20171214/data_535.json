Cipher Resources Inc. 0.082 and high of 0.082.\nGerman Stock Exchange: Shaping World Trade\nAccording to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Germany is the largest exporter worldwide. What plays a big role in this feat is the German equity market. And this fact allows Cipher Resources Inc. to survive any economic crisis.\nStock Exchanges Germany is Europe\u2019s largest economy and without a doubt, the German Stock Exchange is also one of the biggest and most influential stock exchanges in the region. The economic success of Europe over the past decades can mostly be attributed to the German Stock Exchange.\nCipher Resources Inc. ability to show constant income gives it a lot of trust among German market players. The major components of the German Stock Exchange are the B\u00d6AG B\u00f6rsen AG, the B\u00f6rse Berlin-Bremen, Frankfurt Stock Exchange or FWB Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse, and the Stuttgart Stock Exchange or B\u00f6rse Stuttgart.\nThe B\u00d6AG B\u00f6rsen AG, overseeing trade in Hamburg and Hanover, was established in September 1, 1999 following the consolidation of the Hamburg Stock Exchange and the Hanover Stock Exchange.\nOn the other hand, the B\u00f6rse Berlin-Bremen, overseeing trade in Berlin-Charlottenburg, was established in 2003 following the consolidation of the Berlin Stock Exchange and the B\u00f6rse Bremen.\nMeanwhile, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, overseeing trade in Frankfurt, is the largest among all components of the German Stock Exchange. Roughly 80% of the total market capitalization in the country is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.\nLastly, Stuttgart Stock Exchange is the next biggest component. Most of the prominent financial companies in Germany are listed on the Stuttgart Stock Exchange. There is also a space for Cipher Resources Inc..\nPrimary Index The German Stock Index, commonly known as the Deutsche Aktien Xchange (DAX) 30, is the benchmark index in the country.\nDAX 30 weighs 30 German blue chip stocks in terms of market capitalization. Because it tracks the 30 biggest companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, DAX 30 is one of the most valuable economic indicators in Germany. Not only does it attest to the health of national economy but it is also very telling of investor sentiment. It is an efficient tool in predicting equity market movements as well.\nDAX 30 has a base value of 1,000. Its movement is in 0.50 increments. The margin requirement is usually 2% while the trade size requirement is always at least one index. The main trading currency on DAX 30 is euro.\nPresently, XETRA, an electronic trading calculator, computes index prices after every second.\nThere are two versions of DAX 30 Quote: d in the present\u2014 the price index and the performance index.\nThe price index had reached its all-time high of \u20ac8,736 in 2013. Meanwhile, its all-time low of \u20ac3,589 had been recorded in 2009\u2014 shortly after the onslaught of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.\nIn March 2015, the performance index had hit the 12,000 mark. By the following month, it had posted its best intraday high of 12,390.75. During that session, it had closed at its all-time high of 12,374.73. The performance index has an all-time low of 372.30, a level not seen since 1974.\nWith the DAX 30 being the future of the European economy, it only makes sense for investors to invest in DAX 30 stocks. That is why Cipher Resources Inc. sees its bright future with DAX. Betting on a global economy giant is definitely a key to success.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://quicksense.net/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter erickson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cipher resources inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamburg stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "b\u00f6rse bremen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "german stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world trade organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fwb frankfurter wertpapierb\u00f6rse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankfurt stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanover stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuttgart stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "b\u00f6ag b\u00f6rsen ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "b\u00f6rse stuttgart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche aktien xchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hanover", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin-charlottenburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankfurt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:05.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a30fc9f902083e0e5aff887eed40d3b19ce656c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJ_vAuYBJRoeO74EJyStI0JBCAIrSBIqGC79U4dU4RHBong04vqqI3IzXam5TidZprOTaJDMQIyb8eRLCC5q2x3PY1M2RJ3gKh.eiCkumsFzxNXCpkDszP7SLp2AsiN06y", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Appliances-Microwaves-Over-the-Range-Microwaves/N-5yc1vZc3pa/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Frigidaire 30 in. 1.6 in Stainless Steel-FFMV1645TS", "title_full": "Frigidaire 30 in. 1.6 cu. ft.

However in the past two years, two rather detailed speculations were made public. They looked into address, profession, other written works and even financial records to give a detailed reasoning as to why Anita Raja and Domenico Starnone are most likely Elena Ferrante 's real identity.\nSince then there has been worry that Elena might not return as she claimed her anonymity was key to her writing. In an interview with Vanity Fair in 2015 she explained that she wanted to be free \"from the anxiety of notoriety\" going on to elaborate,\"I have gained a space of my own, a space that is free, where I feel active and present. To relinquish it would be very painful.\"\nBut buzz is that Elena Ferrante might be putting pen to paper again. In an interview with her publishers (translated in The Guardian ), the Italian literary newsletter Il Libraio found that Ferrante is writing again. \"I know she is writing, but at the moment I cannot say anything more,\" said publisher Sandro Ferrari , who adds there are no plans for a novel to come out next year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "elena ferrante", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "domenico starnone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandro ferrari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anita raja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ferrante", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "il libraio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elena", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "times of india", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "vanity fair", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:05.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a30fc9f902083e0e5aff887eed40d3b19ce656c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJ_vAuYBJRoeO74EJyStI0JBCAIrSBIqGC79U4dU4RHBong04vqqI3IzXam5TidZprOTaJDMQIyb8eRLCC5q2x3PY1M2RJ3gKh.eiCkumsFzxNXCpkDszP7SLp2AsiN06y", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Appliances-Microwaves-Over-the-Range-Microwaves/N-5yc1vZc3pa/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Frigidaire 30 in. 1.6 in Stainless Steel-FFMV1645TS", "title_full": "Frigidaire 30 in. 1.6 cu. ft.

It is not typically recommended, however to use it as a stand-alone to generate trading signals. Since it is time and price based it is not adept at measuring the actual strength of a trend, merely its direction and duration. It is a good idea to use it in conjunction with additional indicators that can help determine the trend\u2019s strength. \nCurrently, Wisdomtree Invstmnts (WETF)\u2019s   14 day Williams %R is resting at -40.37. Values can range from 0 to -100. A reading between -80 to -100 may be typically viewed as strong oversold territory. A value between 0 to -20 would represent a strong overbought condition. As a momentum indicator, the Williams R% may be used with other technicals to help define a specific trend. \nWisdomtree Invstmnts (WETF) presently   76.98. Typically, the CCI oscillates above and below a zero line. Normal oscillations tend to stay in the range of -100 to +100. A CCI reading of +100 may represent overbought conditions, while readings near -100 may indicate oversold territory. Although the CCI indicator was developed for commodities, it has become a popular tool for equity evaluation as well.

One of the most popular time frames using RSI is the 14-day. \nMoving average indicators are commonly tracked by technical stock analysts. Many traders will use a combination of moving averages with multiple time periods to help spot stock trend direction. One of the more popular combinations is to use the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Investors may use the 200-day MA to help smooth out the data a get a clearer long-term picture. They may look to the 50-day or 20-day to get a better grasp of what is going on with the stock in the near-term. Presently, the 200-day moving average is at 9.70, and the 50-day is 11.15.

With a mountain of cash in the system, we expect deal flow to be significantly enhanced in 2018. We are anticipating plenty of activity in transport, power, agriculture, large house building and educational establishments, plus \u2013 in Africa\u2019s more developed economies \u2013 we expect rising consumer spending to drive retail, tourism and lifestyle businesses. \n\u201cThere will be stiff competition among GPs chasing the best deals which will squeeze up project valuations. The GPs with the strongest networks on the ground and solid project availability, as well as transparency on their fee structures and performances, will win the lion\u2019s share of the work. \n\u201cWe expect even stronger momentum among PE investors for reliable comparison data on what were once the \u201csofter\u201d issues such as corporate social responsibility. Environmental concerns are also going to be foremost, particularly energy consumption, but frankly all aspects of ESG have never been more important to fund managers.\u201d \nGlobal Equity Markets \n\u201cAfter a nine-year bull run, it\u2019s likely there will be some loss of upward momentum in the major equity markets. On the whole, we support the views of respected international fund manager Jeremy Grantham who raises the possibility of a market correction but only over the medium term.\u201d \nPaul Boynton agrees with Grantham that should company PERs begin to come under pressure in 2018 from either lower company profit margins or rising inflation, or possibly both, a correction at some point later in 2018 is a possibility.

Germany's DAX gained 0.2 percent to 13,028.86. Futures augured flat opening on Wall Street. Dow futures remained unchanged while S&P futures added 0.1 percent. \nASIA'S DAY: Asia closed mixed. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5 percent to 22,498.03 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.5 percent to 5,977.70. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed earlier losses, adding 0.3 percent to 28,303.19. Most other regional benchmarks fell. The Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.7 percent to 3,272.05 and South Korea's Kospi lost 0.5 percent to 2,461.98. Stocks in Southeast Asia were mixed. \nANALYST'S VIEW: \"Asia equity investors found themselves standing in a sea of pain at yesterday's market close and are likely breathing a sigh of relief that both EU and U.S. equity investors appear a bit more level-headed for the time being,\" said Stephen Innes, head of trading at OANDA. \nTAX: The U.S. Senate voted to begin negotiation with the House to reconcile their two tax bills on Wednesday in a sign that they can iron out differences. Republican leaders are pushing to send a final blended package to President Donald Trump to sign before Christmas. \nGEOPOLITICAL ISSUES: Market reaction was muted to President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, ending decades of unwavering U.S. neutrality on the issue. In other global developments, the British and Irish prime ministers spoke, seeking to overcome a logjam in Brexit talks, but there was no sign of an imminent breakthrough. \nU.S. JOBS: A report from payroll processor ADP showed private employers added 190,000 jobs last month, slightly better than expected. The report comes two days before a government jobs report, among the last key economic indicators before the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. \nOIL: Benchmark U.S. crude recovered slightly. It added 7 cents to $56.13 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Wednesday, the contract sank $1.66 to settle at $55.96 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 29 cents to $61.51 per barrel.

I just had the idea of it in addition to healing, the augment could restore 2-5% of his Warding Halo perhaps, It may mitigate some of Warding Halo's weaker points along with making Blazing Chakram see some more use.\nCould something with it's healing, it's too short of range to be effective for healing allies and his 3rd augment is more effective for protecting allies. It's not reliable enough to save him from dying (aiming it and killing enemies in a burst heal) in a way that is really meaningful. If it had healing over time or had a damage dealt to armor gained conversion of some sort, I could see a good augment somewhere in there.\nThe teleport is also kinda unreliable/annoying to track for and doesn't give an already highly mobile Nezha too much extra mobility. We could use a tracker for when it's thrown so it's easy to gauge distance & direction. If there was an augment related to this... idk all I can think of is leaving a clone/decoy of some sort at the teleport location (instead of teleport or left at previous location, I think either could work) I don't favour this idea as much though.\nI don't see much in terms of adding damage or CC as a potential augment for Blazing Chakram.\nI think it'd be best to primarily focus on tweaks for Nezha's second in this thread, just so we can stay on topic for clear lines of thought. Try to avoid talking about other abilities or frames unless you bring it back to the context of his second, and please save your full rework ideas for your own thread Thanks :)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:08.000+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15103987, "moreResultsAvailable": 15103887, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512640448000&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 401}
