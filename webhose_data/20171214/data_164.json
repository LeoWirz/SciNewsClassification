But the Red Lions drew parity again minutes later through Amaury Keusters.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://comments.bharatiweb.in/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "indi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harmanpreet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loick luypaert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john-john dohmen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas briels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanasch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vincent vanasch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chikte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sunil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akash chikte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rupinder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gurjant singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amaury keusters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gurjant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suraj karkera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harmanpreet singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rupinderpal singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "indians", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red lions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hockey world league", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhubaneswar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:29.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1c22c9a572a67dfde236a127254146914f0cbe33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSNW0WXnB3CGd3og0dwkDL41lpP4_La.P3_4c0miA1PqVWlCKaiybO2Y8Je6d7l6QXRMOuFAn15yBCbv.jOsZkwYbY9CiO6jo-", "site_full": "www.phcorner.net", "site": "phcorner.net", "site_section": "https://www.phcorner.net/forums/smart-talk-n-text-sun.135/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Smart, Talk 'N Text, &amp; Sun \u2022 PHCorner Community", "title": ".ehi - Smart \u2605ultra fast, lowping and stable\u2605", "title_full": ".ehi - Smart \u2605ultra fast, lowping and stable\u2605 \u2022 PHCorner Community", "published": "2017-12-07T09:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.447, "main_image": "https://cdn.phc.onl/data/attachment-files/2017/12/400515_Screenshot_2017-12-07-05-55-19.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "208fe0f8e7827aacf33f65becf793e8cf1c353ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSNW0WXnB3CGd3og0dwkDL41lpP4_La.P3_4c0miA1PqVWlCKaiybO2Y8Je6d7l6QXRMOuFAn15yBCbv.jOsZkmlo5FiI3dHmI0uYmxpVIpQ--", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "nhake001", "published": "2017-12-07T20:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "keep sharing pre..", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:29.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc8f19cedfcaa520a1188ee31afb48cb4560cf7d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_wmJaOvNKBkrVi2qH2ayfCVsapo.Bel3dbSm4PA7Vos2AhD.zjGChUaOQNoOkM3o34o.zEhQ_DEw--", "site_full": "www.mantisbt.org", "site": "mantisbt.org", "site_section": "http://www.mantisbt.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=3", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Forums - Mantis Bug Tracker \u2022 View forum - Help", "title": "trouble in 'import issues'", "title_full": "Forums - Mantis Bug Tracker \u2022 View topic - trouble in 'import issues'", "published": "2017-12-04T11:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 91526, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "229ce6de60d7c41ce0dc0a3bfd4ab63b2696c3d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_wmJaOvNKBkrVi2qH2ayfCVsapo.Bel3dbSm4PA7Vos2AhD.zjGChUaOQNoOkM3o3gYyJ23Ut_5g--", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "hfare2018", "published": "2017-12-07T11:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : Did you follow the installation instructions https://github.com/mantisbt-plugins/csv ... s-importer ?\nEspecially the step \"Rename the folder to Csv_import\"\nyes,I've.below is my directory screenshot.

Courtesy: Leadership Conference Mesa PD Scorecard. Courtesy: Leadership Conference PHOENIX (3TV/CBS 5) - \nMany U.S. police departments are now using body cameras, but how transparent are they being about how the technology is used? \nIn a November report, the 'Leadership Conference,' a Washington D.C.-based civil rights group, looked at 75 of the biggest agencies around the county, including two in the Valley. \nIt analyzed things like how easily the public can access the video, video storage and whether or not officers can view the video before making their reports. \nThe results look bad. \nThe survey failed both Mesa and Phoenix police in several categories. In fact, no department it looked at received a perfect rating. \nIts goal was to show how these devices could potentially be abused. \n\u201cAs more police departments utilize body-worn cameras, they must not be taken as the last word for police accountability,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference. \n\u201cOur scorecard shows that many police departments are failing to adopt adequate safeguards for ensuring that constitutional rights are protected and our report shows that unrestricted footage review places civil rights and liberties at risk, and undermines the goals of transparency and accountability. Without carefully crafted policy safeguards in place, there is a real risk that body-worn cameras could be used in ways that threaten civil and constitutional rights and intensify the disproportionate surveillance of communities of color.\u201d \nMark Spencer with Judicial Watch , a government watchdog group, questions the merit of the survey. \n\"I think there's limited value when non-police personel, or non-police agencies, are generating policy. They're making rules for a game they've never played,\" said Spencer. \nThe scorecard dinged Mesa for not publishing its policy online and for allowing its officers to view video before making official reports, except for during serious incidents. \nMesa PD says it was never contacted about the survey. Saying in an emailed statement: \"We are constantly evaluating our policies regarding current best practices and industry standards. Our Body Worn Camera program is evaluated in the same manner. Although camera programs have been around for several years, they are still very new in the realm of policy and best practices,\" - Det. Nik Rasheta, Mesa Police Department \nThe study penalized Phoenix PD for not making its footage easily available for review by individuals filing complaints, and for its vague policy on deleting footage. \nThe Phoenix police department says the survey was 'filled with inaccuracies' saying: \"The Phoenix Police Department continues to be industry leaders in the use of body worn camera technologies and policies. We work closely with the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Justice Assistance to ensure our policy is consistent with, and in fact leading, national standards.\" - Sgt. Jonathan Howard, Phoenix Police Dept. \nSpencer says one thing the survey does show is a lack of uniform policy between departments within Arizona and around the U.S. \n\"We all need to be on the same page or we'll lose evidence. And when we lose evidence in court, I don't think the community is served very well,\" said Spencer. \nCopyright 2017 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation). All rights reserved.

The box is quite fitting for the figure, and I\u2019m a fan of transparent boxes, so I particularly like this one. \nThe figure needs some assembly to be ready for display \u2013 nothing complicated, but Flare provides instructions so things are even easier. \nSamurai\u2019s torso comes off to allow a humble castoff option and also to be able to remove protective plastic to prepare the figure for display. The skirt comes off, so that Samurai can be displayed without it and only wearing her white, well-sculpted and detailed panties. \nHer hand, the one holding the sword, can be removed, too; this is needed to put the figure on the rock-like base, to which Samurai is fastened with a peg that goes right into the foot of her bent leg. \nSamurai then sustains her weight on the base with her free hand, which is not attached to the base but just placed on it; the other foot simply rests on the second, clear plastic base the figure is provided with. \nSpeaking of supports for this figure, Flare was quite generous. We have the sculpted rock with pinkish flowers on it, where Samurai is placed directly, and then an additional thin, round piece of plastic. This one is designed to be used with the three cardboard pieces the figure is provided with, each with a different design from the game. \nThe clear plastic base just goes onto the cardboard circles, without any particular assembly needed. I appreciate the additional base pieces, though I prefer to display my copy of this figure just with the rock base. But that\u2019s just a matter of personal taste. \nDisplayed with or without the additional base, Samurai needs to be placed on the rock-like base before she\u2019ll be ready for our cabinets. That\u2019s easily done by detaching her arm and then placing the tip of the sword in the little hole in the rock. It has to reach a certain point on the second layer of the base, so be careful not to push too hard or you\u2019ll risk to break the sword\u2019s fragile tip. \nOnce the sword is in place we can put its handle in Samurai\u2019s hand, and then put the figure on the base. Samurai is now ready for display. \nQuality wise, this figure is stunning. I can\u2019t see anything wrong with it, not a single flaw. The sculpt is sublime, and so is the paintwork. The details are magnificent and quite plentiful, and the figure has a wonderful overall appearance. \nThe rock-like base is completely gorgeous, too. The sculpt is very realistic and, once again, without any flaws. This little piece of plastic really looks like broken concrete, and I completely love how perfect it is for Samurai. \nAs I said, the figure is overall perfect, and if I had to pick a favorite part of this little jewel I wouldn\u2019t really be able to choose.

Apparently, missed repairs, overlooked maintenance and prolonged delays on the solutions are the top factors why cars suffer from a problem. On top of that, procrastination could also create an adverse effect on vehicles.\n\nThere are so many ways that we can shield our car against inclement weather and accidents. One is through the installation of a durable auto glass Denton . Tinted ones in particular, are tremendously helpful for protecting the interiors and the passengers against outside threats. Of course, there could be plenty of associated benefits when you decide to install one. Check out these upsides and figure out whether such option is an ideal and investment worthy choice.\n\nCar Protection. First things first. Having a durable type of glass could give protection to your vehicle. There are plenty of objects and entities which travel across air and might likely infiltrate on seats or machines. For that, engines become susceptible to damage and an interior suffers from dust and dirt. To top it all, stains and some ugly elements might be found on materials which are either hazardous or unappealing.\n\nReduce the Effects of UV Rays. The sun has some harmful rays which could leave a burnt effect on your precious materials. Should the interiors of a car is totally exposed to the sunlight, this could lead to episodes of prolonged problems and serious inconvenience. Unable to install a glass for effective protection could make your travel turn bad and less ideal.\n\nBlocks Dust and Dirt. Without a doubt, there are millions of entities that travel anywhere. When they get inside the car air conditioner and systems, this could result to episodes of breakdown and damage which could last for a long time. Rather than worrying on the problem, providing preventive measure such as the installation of such material can make a big difference.\n\nDiscourage Thieves. A vulnerable and unprotected car can attract a lot of thieves. No matter how strong or resilient the locks yet you forget to place durable and tainted type, thieves would still discover ways to get properly through the belonging. This is one smart reason why its crucial to conduct the smart thing and arrive with practical decision.\n\nProtection From Accident. Another key factor why you need to have such thing installed on your precious vehicle is that it avoids serious injuries. It would be the one which would receive cracks and impacts. Even though some shards could hurt and sting, you would still be protected against heavy and harmful objects which could hurt you and as well as the passengers.\n\nSafety from people who throw hard objects. This might rarely happen, but it cannot be denied that some individuals commit mischievous acts. One way that you can protect everyone, including the passengers is to have a durable and strong glass which would receive the hits.\n\nThe repairs, upkeep and installation of such glass need to be performed by experts apparently. Remember that experts know best. Select the best person who fits for the task.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can get valuable tips on how to choose an auto glass Denton company and more information about a reliable company at http://www.asapmobileautoglass.com/denton right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sandra roberts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:31.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cac9e811cff0aa1185e5a7700a0b587281989113", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS7qymNfQA8Gv12pKQMteM3myxlhsddoaaVHU3Ok1t2NUE8JZOZe8H0dke4kW6MP6Pfgaiu_8WHDRT7DiPR0EgopxtipQMfxeE2cIp6mIUbvFbFWcZjqdNvw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Australia", "title": "Final count in Townsville delivers Labor a 48th seat #qldvotes @qldpol", "title_full": "Final count in Townsville delivers Labor a 48th seat #qldvotes @qldpol : australia", "published": "2017-12-07T05:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 74, "participants_count": 53, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.227, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f90a4d9ee4bfe48131f5d5d0236d67dd5d9f7e6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS7qymNfQA8Gv12pKQMteM3myxlhsddoaaVHU3Ok1t2NUE8JZOZe8H0dke4kW6MP6Pfgaiu_8WHDRT7DiPR0EgopxtipQMfxeE2cIp6mIUbvGKnV._gvQxtphHvFVHZsBpff1mNbzDOhk-", "ord_in_thread": 74, "author": "no_pancakes", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "As to the size of the win, it's a context thing.

AZFamily went to interview the property owner and take a look at that video when this story takes an unusual turn. \nWhile in the middle of interviewing the property manager, Christen Testo, her boyfriend saw a guy passing by on a bike that looks similar to the thief. Well, he caught up with the thief and brought him to apologize to Testo. \n\"Never in a million years would I think that would happen, especially with you guys here,\" Testo said. \nAZFamily caught the encounter on camera as the thief apologized and promised to return the stolen camera. He left the area and Testo called the cops and filled out a report about the encounter. They left and a short time later the suspect shows back up with camera in hand. \n\"I'm surprised he showed his face on our property at all to be honest,\" Testo said. \nThe suspect left before police arrived again. Testo hopes she never has to the see the suspect again. \nCopyright 2017 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation). All rights reserved.

The reality is if they are playing a top team in Europe they won\u2019t get the time and space, they won\u2019t get those opportunities. \n\u201cIf you know this game then you understand they have so much bigger and tougher tests coming up.\u201d \nOn RT\u00c9, meanwhile, another ex-Ireland international Damien Duff took a more optimistic view, suggesting Liverpool are contenders to win the Champions League (see below).

I'd probably not feel like people are salty if my most recent memories of the Destiny thread were circa the release of Dark Below :p\nPSN,Steam,Live | CptHamiltonian", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/642/n4RMRZNCZ8068.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:32.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a75cdab66e8f7bb92a4ab484625d9c7567b8ec6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_HiFnD5SLvW5AZC8JykYzkNAj3jBo0oNghyEv42DRa7CEKVgsxLrxAQ96rrCrqkiSaKEpbzip0jbl.Nn_hW6Ivf.mrHSz9QPEjNm37idHhwLKzct2vLvqwJJQ.yiG5_C0-", "site_full": "www.azfamily.com", "site": "azfamily.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Watch: These are the top YouTube videos that went viral in 2017 - Arizona's Family", "title_full": "Watch: These are the top YouTube videos that went viral in 2017 - Arizona's Family", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.706, "main_image": "http://MEREDITH.images.worldnow.com/images/15575396_G.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27137, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0a75cdab66e8f7bb92a4ab484625d9c7567b8ec6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_HiFnD5SLvW5AZC8JykYzkNAj3jBo0oNghyEv42DRa7CEKVgsxLrxAQ96rrCrqkiSaKEpbzip0jbl.Nn_hW6Ivf.mrHSz9QPEjNm37idHhwLKzct2vLvqwJJQ.yiG5_C0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Spencer Ernst", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Watch: These are the top YouTube videos that went viral in 2017 - Arizona's Family", "text": "(Source: CNN) \n(CNN/Meredith) -- YouTube's top viral video in 2017 was a singing man in an oyster costume. \nThe masked performer was a contestant on Thailand's aptly named singing competition show \" The Mask Singer .\" The man in the mask sings \"Until We Will Become Dust,\" which starts out as a ballad and eventually breaks into a rap. \nThe video has more than 182 million views on YouTube. \nYouTube determined its top trending videos based on time spent watching, sharing, commenting, liking and other metrics.

This time, it was his debut on James Corden's \" Carpool Karaoke ,\" in which we learned Sheeran could stuff 55 Maltesers into his mouth at one time and that he doesn't own a cellphone. \n-- A hilarious, bad lip reading of Donald Trump's inauguration . \n-- A history of the entire world .

Destiny 1 wasn't perfect at launch or even 2 expansions in, but we can't cut them slack on mistakes they shouldn't be making after this long.

Here are the highlights: A first-ever benchmarking survey finds that most US college administrators feel their institutions could better engage with international alumni Survey respondents reported a lack of dedicated staff support and inadequate budgets as their main impediments to expanding international alumni networks Even so, more than 50% of responding administrators said that they felt that global alumni management was very important to their international recruitment and branding efforts \nA majority of US college administrators say that their institutions are not doing enough to connect with international alumni, and nearly two-thirds report having no dedicated staff time for global alumni relations. \nThese are some of the top-line findings from a new study released today by Academic Assembly and Intead . Global Alumni Management for U.S. Institutions: The State of the Field in 2017 gathers responses from 103 administrators at American colleges and universities for a first-ever national benchmarking survey of best practices in international alumni relations. \nThe overarching observation in the study is that there is considerable room for institutions to improve their engagement with international graduates. As the following chart reflects, most respondents do not rate their institution\u2019s current efforts very highly. \nSurvey respondents\u2019 self-assessment of their institutions current global alumni engagement efforts. Source: Academic Assembly/Intead \nThe survey respondents most commonly cited \u201cinsufficient time\u201d (51%) and \u201cinadequate budget\u201d (28%) as the main impediments to expanding their institution\u2019s global alumni engagement. Nearly one in three respondents (30%) also noted \u201cinsufficient internal leadership support\u201d as a significant issue. \nIf these results represent a baseline for international alumni relations in the US, they come as no surprise to Mitch Leventhal, former vice chancellor for global affairs at the State University of New York, and now chairman at Academic Assembly: \u201cIn my decade serving as a senior international officer I never once heard a colleague indicate anything close to satisfaction with their alumni outreach efforts, while I heard many bemoan the seemingly disinterest of their president and/or alumni association in investing any resources into leveraging this valuable asset.\u201d \nAt the same time, the survey respondents identified strong awareness of a number of key benefits to greater engagement with international alumni. Chief among those, as reflected in the following table, was the role that alumni can play in international recruitment. Indeed, more than 50% of responding administrators said that they felt that global alumni management was \u201cvery important\u201d to their international recruitment and branding efforts. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not just what happens to [the student] as a 22-year-old graduate,\u201d says Gretchen Dobson, one of the primary authors of the report and the vice president of alumni and graduate services with Academic Assembly. \u201cIt\u2019s about their lifelong relationship with the institution.\u201d \nRespondent perceptions of the value that global alumni offer to the institution. Source: Academic Assembly/Intead \nOther important benefits noted by respondents include: increased fundraising opportunities and expanded connections to employment opportunities and professional networks for alumni and students. \n\u201cThe purpose of international alumni relations is to leverage the support of this potential group of brand ambassadors,\u201d says the study report. \u201cThe cumulative effect of this will increase your global brand projection, boost enrolment and fundraising, and create new employment opportunities for current students and recent graduates. It\u2019s about making good use of the powerful resources you already have.\u201d The way forward \nMs Dobson, who led international alumni efforts at Tufts University for a decade and now consults and writes widely on the subject today, offers a straightforward path to better global alumni relations. \nFirst, put some good, basic data systems in place to capture information about international graduates. Next, start small and build from there \u2013 in other words, do what you can but make international alumni part of what your institution does. Finally, recognise the importance of buy-in from senior leadership. \nThe study picks up the question of data management in calling for an entirely new classification for foreign graduates: transnational alumni, a term that recognises that international graduates may go on to further work or study in the US, in a third country, and/or return to their home country over time. \u201cCapturing this kind of nuance requires a commitment to internationalising your [data] systems and annually inviting alumni to update their contact information,\u201d says the report. \nThis is a distinction that makes a lot of sense to Anne Hayner, the associate director for alumni relations with the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies . International networking and engagement with foreign graduates are both central to the institute\u2019s programmes, and Kroc has a long-established and active network of global alumni as a result. \nEven so, Ms Hayner points out that any institution can begin to strengthen their efforts in this area, even with modest budget or staff resources. \u201cStart with the students you have [on campus] now,\u201d she says. \u201cConnect with them and make sure they feel connected to you. Then have a way to capture and update contact information over time whether that\u2019s a simple Google Form or whatever else.\u201d \nOn the question of engaging with an alumni network, Ms Hayner again offers a straightforward approach: \u201cAsk people what they need or want,\u201d she suggests. \u201cFor example, part of my job is to help the students professionally network. So we keep them advised of what people are doing in the field through professional or alumni profiles, and we help them to stay connected to faculty or research resources so that they can stay on top of contemporary scholarship in the field.\u201d \nThe benchmarking study echoes the value of starting small and demonstrating success as a means of building linkages within the institution as well as the buy-in of institutional leaders. In practice, global alumni initiatives may originate from different points within the organisational chart, most often from the international office or the alumni or advancement office. The report cautions, however, that, \u201cInternational alumni relations can\u2019t be managed in a vacuum\u2026Reasonable expectations must be set for interdepartmental cooperation, and a reasonable budget must be allocated. Ideally, a cross-functional team from admissions, advancement, international programmes, and career for grassroots alumni engagement.\u201d \nNeedless to say, the study is focused on the current context for global alumni relations in the US. However, readers in many other host countries will no doubt recognise many of these same characteristics and perspectives within their own institutions. With that in mind, it is fair to say that the findings and recommendations in the benchmarking report offer important insights for international educators around the world. \nFor additional background, please see: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gretchen dobson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ms dobson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anne hayner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ms hayner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch leventhal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hayner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kroc", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "academic assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tufts university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of notre dame\u2019s kroc institute for international peace studies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state university of new york", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:33.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e91958c5da0d7c583b474721261891ea8f1172f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl3uRssPHEeLTfUG2y4kaaz2MXkivJHJx0GstR3KQRdEeI16f7tzOFbOeXReZac0dF7Ik6TmUzDKNedIbTsc9LNTaLcSBvAGrE8.5285MBPns", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[Destiny 2] Curse of Osiris out now!

Nuclear Medicine   Growing from simple scanners to solutions that involve advanced informatics and systems, the field of nuclear medicine has evolved significantly over the past few years. Nuclear medicine is one such significant discovery. It uses radioactive materials (radiotracers) for observing bodily functions and for diagnosing and treating various diseases. These materials are generally inhaled, swallowed, or injected into the bloodstream. Doctors track the path of these materials with the help of specially designed cameras. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scans are the two major imaging modalities in the nuclear medicine technology.\nRequest A Sample Copy Of This Report @: www.radiantinsights.com/research/global-nuclear-medicine-industry-2017/request-sample?utm_source=briefingwire&utm_campaign=Mukta_07Dec2017 \nRecent Innovations in Nuclear Medicine: \nValue-based care has changed the way healthcare companies provide care delivery, thereby increasing the need for faster, user-friendly, and accurate imaging technologies. With molecular imaging doctors can make accurate decisions based on the particular cellular and molecular patterns of a disease. \nRoyal Philips recently launched their latest solutions and technologies that may drive the future of nuclear medicine. \nVereos Digital PET/CT: \nIt is the first ever fully digital PET/CT system. Incorporated with the company\u2019s proprietary DPC tech, it can enable better characterization and detection of small lesions.

But recently, something went wrong that left the choreographer-director fuming. \nUnaware about what exactly transpired? Scroll down to read more... An Angry Farah \nShe took to Twitter and slammed each and every person out there who don't think the need of giving her a call and just send a WhatsApp message, which she refers to a \u2018Janta Invite', for attending a premier, preview or party. Cryptic Tweet \n\"Dear Mannerless people, if you want me to attend your premiere/preview/party DON'T send me a \"Janta invite\" on WhatsApp! You are not doing me a favor! The least you can do is make a personal call. If you can't find the time for it what makes you think I have time to get ready and come for you.\" People Assumed It Was Kapil Sharma \nWhile Farah had refrained from taking any names, Twitteratti began the guessing game and many felt that the tweet was aimed at Kapil Sharma whose film Firangi was slated to release that week. When Farah Was Asked About It \nShe told Spotboye, \"It was not just Kapil Sharma. There were two to three other events happening on the same day. I was referring to all of them.\" Kapil's Reaction \nWhile the entire internet went crazy over this issue, Kapil recently opened up, \"In whatever way, I thought correct I had invited all my friends from the film industry (sic). We had a show on Thursday.In whatever way I thought correct I had invited all my friends from the film industry. It was mostly attended by cast crew and our friends and family.\" Did He Take A Jibe At Farah Khan? \nHe further added, \"I hope my big powerful friends in the film industry will see the film later.\" Director's Outburst \nConcreting Kapil's statement, 'Firangi' director Rajeev Dhingra defended Kapil and said, \"I don't understand this negativity surrounding Kapil.

Asking for upped LL != asking for the removal of the vanilla LL. The difficulty slider/picker is already a solved problem in the game.\nAt the end of the day I'm not part of the pitchfork crowd demanding a refund but I am very much in the on-the-fence crowd where the, I guess lack of goodwill, is a push in the wrong direction.\nI doubt it's a lack of goodwill so much as a \"Wait, you are still playing but didn't buy the expansion? Huh?\".\nI've seen your arguments and chosen not to engage. I'm chalking it up to a subjective problem. You may be fine (or at least accepting) with losing content after ~1 month and I'm not going to try to change your mind. For me losing it after ~3 months is a big con in the decision of where my hobby monies continue to flow.\nI said before, I think that's fine. I think that's a totally valid view and I got no problems with it. People don't wanna ride the constant payment train of one of these type of games, I get it. Especially when you find the game deeply flawed. I just see this as totally expected too. Which is why I mentioned that this is likely just not considered by Bungie when they made the decision because they kinda figured everyone was on board with how this shit works. They figure their player base either thinks the expansion is worth the money and sticks around or they don't and they stop playing. People not buying the expansion but sticking around anyway is probably some weird edge case to them. Especially considering their seeming blindspots when it comes to community management. They seem to have been completely unprepared for backlash or expectations management and are scrambling.\nThere was a reddit thread today or yesterday or whatever who's title was basically \"Curse of Osiris feels like a subscription to continue playing Destiny 2\" and my thought was basically \"Well .... yeah.

The actor is seen donning a blue shimmery sweatshirt with black trousers by Dior Homme Official which will make you yawn. He paired the attire with red and black shoes by Christian Louboutin which fail to impress us. The attire the actor is seen donning blends with the background and fails to stand out.

That\u2019s because we couldn\u2019t figure out what exactly is the \u2018point\u2019 here. Also, it isn\u2019t unlike anything we have seen before. In fact, at the recent Filmfare Style and Glamour Awards, Shahid was seen posing in a similar manner on the red carpet so that everyone can pay attention to his sneakers which read \u2018King\u2019. While the actor looks dapper like always, we wish the cover had something new to offer. By now Shahid has graced many covers of leading magazines. Hence, we expect every cover to be distinct.
