December 2017 Inuit: Bears \u2018Catch Seals Even If The Ice Is Really Thin\u2019 Scientists: \u2018Unlikely Polar Bears Are At Risk From AGW\u2019 Image source: York et al., 2016 , Journal of Ecology and Evolution. \nMost of the world\u2019s polar bears live in Canada. Hunters and elders from northern Canada\u2019s native communities have been immersed in studying polar bear ecology for centuries. \nIn two   published in the journals Ecology and Evolution and Polar Record , scientists record the observations and experiences of Canada\u2019s polar bear \u201cexperts\u201d\u2014 the community members who live side-by-side with these \u201csea bears\u201d ( Ursus maritimus ). \nAccording to scientists, no study has indicated that there is reason to presume that the perspectives of community observers are either suspect or incorrect. In fact, there have been multiple occasions when traditional ecological knowledge gleaned from local populations accurately identified polar bear subpopulation trends before new scientific studies could be conducted to corroborate them (York et al., 2016). \nThe overwhelming conclusion from years of accumulated conversations with native populations about polar bears is that there is almost no connection between the long-term observations of polar bear ecology and the more recent claims that polar bears as a species are in grave danger due to climate change and thinning sea ice . \nIn fact, the long-term observations suggest that polar bear subpopulations are currently faring quite well, with 92% of the subpopulations studied either remaining stable or growing in recent years . \nAccording to Inuit observers, there may even be \u201c too many \u201d bears now. \nFurthermore, the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) gleaned from local populations affirms that polar bears do not need thickened sea ice to hunt seals, as they can \u201ccatch seals even if the ice is really thin\u201d (Wong et al., 2017). \nThe recent observations of polar bears eating land-based food, or eating out of garbage bins, is not evidence that they are hungrier and more desperate due to climate change. According to community observers, it is quite \u201ctypical\u201d for polar bears to forage for land-based food (and garbage), as they are opportunists when it comes to food sources. Polar bears have been consuming land-based food well before there was concern about thinning sea ice and climate change. \nA bold conclusion from York et al. (2016) is that, given the paleoclimate record of much warmer (+4 to +7.5 \u00b0C) Arctic and much more reduced sea ice thickness and extent in the past relative to today, \u201c it seems unlikely that polar bears (as a species) are at risk from anthropogenic global warming .\u201d Demographic and traditional knowledge perspectives on . . . Canadian polar bear subpopulations Summary \u201cConsidering both [observations from native populations] and scientific information, we suggest that the current status of Canadian polar bear subpopulations in 2013 was 12 stable/increasing and one declining (Kane Basin).\u201d \u201c We do not find support for the perspective that polar bears within or shared with Canada are currently in any sort of climate crisis .\u201d Observations From Natives (TEK) May Be More Reliable Than \u2018Flawed\u2019 Scientific Studies 1. \u201cWe show that much of the scientific evidence indicating that some polar bear subpopulations are declining due to climate change-mediated sea ice reductions is likely flawed by poor mark\u2013recapture (M-R) sampling and that the complex analysis models employed to overcome these capture issues apparently fail to provide accurate estimates of the demographic parameters used to determine subpopulation status.\u201d 2. \u201cThere is no trend evident from the summed subpopulation numbers from the PBSG status reports. Other indications of individual subpopulation decline are in conflict with aerial survey results, TEK [traditional ecological knowledge from native populations], or subject to sampling ambiguity, with the exception of the KB subpopulation.\u201d 3. \u201cWe hypothesize that when polar bear subpopulation trends are evaluated by both M-R sampling and TEK; notable differences are most likely due to errors in scientific methodology rather than mistaken TEK .\u201d 4. \u201cWe suggest that the difference between scientific and TEK in this case is partly caused by institutional (science establishment) reluctance to accept TEK as a valid test of correspondence between scientific predictions and observable reality (Aars et al. 2006; Resolution # 1-2005). \u2026 We did not find evidence for intentional misrepresentation of polar bear subpopulation numbers or trends from TEK, aboriginal organizations, or co-management wildlife boards . The TEK we report for Canadian polar bear subpopulation trends was a consensus from all of the sources cited above, which we believe to be a comprehensive list of available sources on the TEK for polar bear subpopulation trends.\u201d 5. \u201cScientific studies have not always agreed with TEK on subpopulation trend (e.g., NB, SB, SH, and WH), but these studies have never provided any reasons to suspect that the available TEK was suspect or incorrect . Alternatively, we are aware of multiple occasions when TEK accurately identified polar bear subpopulation trends before new scientific studies had been conducted that corroborated the TEK (S6).\u201d Polar Bears Survived During Much Warmer Climates And With Much Less Sea Ice 6. \u201cThe majority of Canada\u2019s polar bears inhabit the Canadian Arctic archipelago (Obbard et al. 2010), where 5 of 13 subpopulations are currently and historically ice-free in late summer and early fall (Lunn et al. 2002; Aars et al. 2006; Obbard et al. 2010).\u201d 7. \u201cIf polar bears have existed for the last 4 million years, they would have emerged during the mid-Pliocene approximately 1.25 million years before the onset of northern hemisphere glacial cycles (Bartoli et al. 2005). If polar bears emerged any time prior to or during the previous glacial cycle, they would have persisted through the Eemian interglacial period . During the Eemian interglacial, mean annual temperatures were 4\u00b0C warmer than the current interglacial (Holocene) for northern latitudes (M\u00fcller 2009), and some northern locations reached temperatures as high as ~7.5\u00b0C warmer than   for the same area over the last thousand years (Dahl-Jensen et al. 2013).\u201d 8. \u201cGiven the persistence of polar bears through the current and previous interglacial periods, and their ability to accommodate extended retreats onshore and based on the empirical observations of climate and sea ice change (S7), it seems unlikely that polar bears (as a species) are at risk from anthropogenic global warming .\u201d 9. \u201c Reduction in the heavy multiyear ice and increased productivity from a longer open water season may even enhance polar bear habitat in some areas (Stirling and Derocher 1993, 2012; Derocher et al. 2004; Rode et al. 2014).\u201d Inuit perspectives of polar bear research: Lessons for community-based collaborations Scientists/Academics Treat Native Populations (Inuit) Condescendingly 1. \u201cFrom May 2011 to April 2014 over four visits, we conducted individual interviews with 23 hunters and 33 elders (48 men and eight women) comprising 32 active, 14 non-active and nine less experienced hunters.\u201d 2. \u201c Strong and transparent relationships between polar bear researchers and Inuit communities are necessary to overcome persisting research (and community) misconceptions .\u201d 3. \u201cIn the past, academics have been criticised for prescribing expected research plans and outcomes in a rigid way, leading to condescending views of unfamiliar knowledge practices and unwelcoming interactions with community members (Grimwood and others 2012). \u2026 For community members, most types of research have been viewed as inseparable from government agendas through funding and consulting programmes (Bocking 2007) and past histories and power relations have politicised views of scientific research as a whole (Reed and McIlveen 2006).\u201d Inuit Observations: \u2018Too Many Polar Bears Now\u2019 4. \u201c All [Inuit] participants reported having more bear encounters in recent years than in the past . Some participants indicated that the bears they have encountered are healthy.\u201d 5. Inuit observations of polar bear ecology: \u201cLast year he said that there\u2019s more bears that are more fat \u2026 they rarely see unhealthy bears \u2026 the only time they would see one is when it\u2019s pretty old \u2026 it won\u2019t hunt\u2014hunt as much \u2026 and it\u2019s skinny.

Bears foraging for land-based foods have been reported in the literature prior to recent concerns over climate change (Russell 1975; Derocher and others 1993; Gormezano and Rockwell 2013a).\u201d 8. \u201cObservations of bears consuming garbage are not uncommon (Russell 1975; Lunn and Stirling 1985; Gormezano and Rockwell 2013b)\u201d 21 responses to \u201c2 New Papers: 9221 Of Polar Bear Subpopulations Stable, Increasing\u2026Inuit Observe \u2018Too Many Polar Bears Now\u2019\u201d ClimateOtter 7.

And now that the polar bear is not an endangered species, it should not matter if their range is reduced by harvesting. ClimateOtter 7.

The air was frigid with winter breeze, but what Choi Gonne remembers from the demonstrations is neither hatred nor rage. What she saw were people united, regardless of age or gender, bundled in coats, singing and chanting tunes calling for Park\u2019s ouster, street vendors selling mattresses and hot snacks and young students marching in their uniforms. Choi, who was among the crowd in the plaza, called those people \u201cHighlander.\u201d She said the term meant those who seek to cultivate barren soil and find hope in the darkness, which is also the title of the lead track of her latest album \u201cNomad Syndrome.\u201d \u201cThe melody of \u2018Highlander\u2019 was created about three years ago, but I couldn\u2019t settle on its lyrics. After the candlelight protest, I could finally finish the song. The event really touched my heart and inspired me,\u201d said Choi during a recent interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul. Singer-songwriter Choi Gonne poses during a recent interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul. (Park Hyun-koo / Korea Herald) Although the song doesn\u2019t specifically flesh out the event lyrically, Choi said she tries to tell her foreign friends that the song, written in English, is about that monumental socio-political event in Korea. \u201cI participated in almost every rally that started in October last year. My house was adjacent to the square and I just couldn\u2019t ignore all the sounds coming from there. I was so angry at Park at the time. Chanting with the people, what pierced me through was not their anger but their power and dedication to carve out their own destiny. And I wanted to show to foreigners what I felt through the song.\u201d The singer-songwriter\u2019s fifth EP \u201cNomad Syndrome\u201d also features track \u201cGaya,\u201d which Choi said was also a fruition of the same event. The lyrics came to her mind while watching Park\u2019s trial on TV, which Choi thought was a result of continuous lying and deceiving. One\u2019s lies will be eventually exposed through the mouths of people, leading to one\u2019s destruction, wrote Choi in the lyrics. While Choi\u2019s name may be new to the K-pop generation, she is an international artist. She performed at England\u2019s Glastonbury Festival in 2014 and 2015 and won Japan\u2019s Fuji TV\u2019s \u201cAsia Versus\u201d in 2013. Choi also toured Europe in 2012 and headlined various music festivals in Korea. Choi\u2018s voice drips with soul that is rich, raw and arcane. Listening to her reminds one of the vast plateau and windy terrain of Mongolia, the most unpolished but natural place on earth. She is also known for writing poetic lyrics mostly in English, the reason why her music sounds like a mysterious blend of the East and the West. Singer-songwriter Choi Gonne poses during a recent interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul. (Park Hyun-koo / Korea Herald) Choi said she visited ethnic Koreans in Russia before releasing the album. \u201cWhile touring cities around the world, I came to a question about my \u2018roots\u2019 in this diverse world. In the process of finding my roots, I visited ethnic Koreans in Russia and I realized that one\u2019s roots are not about where people come from. It is more about if they have that feeling of spiritual affiliation to the land,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are many people around me who want to leave Korea, and seeing them made me realize it was because their spiritual roots haven\u2019t settled down in Korea. Just like nomads, they continuously wonder around, trying to find their identities through social media and digital contents. And I wanted to give them a message, to find their spiritual roots through other songs from \u2018Nomad Syndrome,\u2019 such as \u2018Anaspora\u2019 and \u2018Limbo and Limbo.\u2019\u201d Asked if she plans to live abroad in the future for her international career, Choi replied her roots belonged here in Korea. But still, she confessed the local music industry is not favorable to indie musicians like her. \u201cI think there are less people who can accept the musical variety in Korea compared to Europe or Japan. Here, it\u2019s all about the money code, the reason why songs are repeated and musicians don\u2019t try something new,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t plan to be a superstar, but I want to show people that different kinds of music exist out there, and that they are awesome. For my next album, I will talk about things I\u2019ve experienced and felt during my world tours.\u201d By Hong Dam-young (lotus@heraldcorp.com)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "choi gonne", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "anaspora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "park geun-hye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong dam-young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "choi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "park", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "herald interview", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "korea herald", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mongolia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gwanghwamun square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:27.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "111eefd5740cc65a5dfe3fe16269868b79210200", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8T_3330TWrL3xX35Q9ya0BycSkb1p4e1QlWOUlKXtcGTOTpxaU34Foui34hzACRvANXdj79QIhbg--", "site_full": "www.greencarcongress.com", "site": "greencarcongress.com", "site_section": "http://www.greencarcongress.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Green Car Congress", "title": "Siluria and Wood launch Modus: process technology to convert low-value offgas into high-octane, low-sulfur gasoline blendstock", "title_full": "Siluria and Wood launch Modus: process technology to convert low-value offgas into high-octane, low-sulfur gasoline blendstock", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "111eefd5740cc65a5dfe3fe16269868b79210200", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8T_3330TWrL3xX35Q9ya0BycSkb1p4e1QlWOUlKXtcGTOTpxaU34Foui34hzACRvANXdj79QIhbg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mmillikin", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Siluria and Wood launch Modus: process technology to convert low-value offgas into high-octane, low-sulfur gasoline blendstock", "text": "Siluria Technologies, developer of a catalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) process to convert natural gas into liquid fuels or petrochemical building blocks ( earlier post ), and Wood, a leader in the delivery of project, engineering and technical services to energy and industrial markets, announced the availability of the Modus process technology for petroleum refiners. \nJointly developed by Siluria and Wood, Modus provides a proven and cost-efficient, one-step process to upgrade low-value refinery off gases, otherwise burned for heat, into high-value fungible refinery products such as high-octane, low-sulfur gasoline blendstock. Modus expands revenue sources and ultimately increases profitability. \nThe Modus process is based on a commercially proven catalyst system that converts light olefins, such as ethylene and propylene\u2014often contained in refinery offgas streams\u2014to high-quality gasoline blendstock with a 90+ octane rating and ultra-low sulfur content. \nMany refinery offgas and fuel streams contain varying amounts of olefins, which require complex and costly solutions to recover. As a result, these valuable streams are often burned for fuel or heat. Modus provides a simple, reliable alternative by upgrading these fuel-value streams to more valuable liquids that can be easily integrated into the refinery product slate. \u2014Robert Trout, Siluria\u2019s President and CEO \nModus can be readily integrated into existing refinery operations with minimal capital investment and operating impacts. Based on standard modular design and construction, Modus can be rapidly deployed as a standalone upgrade during routine maintenance turnarounds or revamp projects. \nModus is now available to customers worldwide under standard industry licenses. \nBackground. Siluria Technologies began as a startup developing novel bio-templated catalysts for economic direct conversion of methane to ethylene. ( Earlier post .) Leveraging work done by MIT\u2019s Dr. Angela Belcher on using genetically modified bacteriophages as scaffolds for constructing inorganic materials such as Li-ion cathodes, Siluria developed novel catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction to produce ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) directly from methane (CH 4 ) with high performance at low temperatures. \nOCM has been the target of intense scientific and commercial interest for more than thirty years due to the tremendous potential of the technology to reduce costs, energy, and environmental emissions in the production of ethylene. However, earlier efforts fell short of developing a commercially viable catalyst, due to high operating temperatures, low activities, and short lifetimes on the order of hours to days. \nSiluria combined several highly innovative technologies to create its commercially viable OCM catalysts: (1) the synthesis of nanowire catalysts to create vast numbers of unique, novel inorganic nanowire structures; (2) unique templating technologies; and (3) high throughput screening tools to rapidly evaluate hundreds of catalysts, unlike traditional methods that evaluate one catalyst at a time. \nSiluria focused on all key process variables such as temperature, pressure, activity, and catalyst stability and lifetime\u2014not solely conversion and selectivity. The result has been the development of OCM catalysts that operate at significantly lower temperature (several hundreds of degrees lower), practical operating pressures (5-10 atmospheres), high activities, and having standard lifetimes of years under these operating conditions. \nSubsequently, Siluria developed a second process\u2014Ethylene to Liquids (ETL)\u2014to convert unpurified ethylene from the OCM process to hydrocarbon liquid fuels. In the ETL process, the OCM ethylene effluent is oligomerized over a catalyst (different than the OCM catalyst) to selectively produce targeted products, such as gasoline, condensate, aromatics, heavy oil diluents or distillates including diesel or jet fuel. (Oligomerization refers to the process of producing higher carbon number molecules from ethylene or other alkenes.) \nSiluria\u2019s OCM + ETL process differs substantially from other Gas to Liquid (GTL) processes, such as Fischer-Tropsch (FT) and Methanol to Gasoline (MTG).\nFor example, Siluria\u2019s OCM+ETL process does not go through any syngas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen) intermediates, which is utilized in the FT process. Converting syngas into hydrocarbon products result in a broad product distribution ranging typically from C 1 to C 40 . This necessitates significant additional refining/separations and energy input. In contrast, utilizing ethylene as an intermediate in place of syngas allows for very targeted production of a specific narrow product slate. The result is a simpler process, lower capital costs and more flexibility in term of scale. \nIn 2014, Siluria unveiled a development unit for producing liquid fuels from natural gas based on Siluria\u2019s proprietary oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) and ethylene-to-liquid (ETL) technologies.

According to market research firm Nielsen Korea, the series recorded 6.9 percent in nationwide viewership, which is 0.4 percent point lower than SBS\u2019 \u201cJudge vs. Judge.\u201d MBC\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Not a Robot,\u201d which kicked off on the same day, recorded 4.5 percent of viewership ratings. (KBS) Despite the keen viewership ratings, the viewers showed mixed responses to the new fantasy romance. Some fans showed their anticipation on the drama which seems to share almost all the hit elements of recent hits such as tvN\u2019s \u201cGuardian: The Lonely and Great God\u201d and SBS\u2019 \u201cThe Legend of the Blue Sea.\u201d \u201cI like all the songs, backgrounds and actors.

The background and music are also quite similar.\u201d \u201cIf Kim Rae-won lived longer and he is the \u2018black knight\u2019 who keeps protecting Shin Se-kyung, it looks similar to Gong Yoo (of \u2018Guardian\u2019) who protects the goblin bride,\u201d woicw*** wrote. \u201cBlack Knight\u201d tells the story of a successful young businessman who accepts a dangerous fate on behalf of his lover. In Korea, the word \u201cBlack Knight\u201d often refers to a man who solves a difficult situation for a woman -- such as a man who drinks alcohol during a drinking game instead of a women.

Later, a few professors of institute complained about the panel members and said DTE joint secretary should not be included in the panel.\nConcern with the complaint, former chairperson Geetha Bali denied approving the selected candidate for final recruitment. Professor said Sabhajeet Yadav is not the subject expert and he is not eligible to interview a registrar. Complainant said he is a promoted IAS officer. Complainant demanded to reorganise the interview session and include subject expert in the panel.\nExperts said registrar holds 10 thousand AGP so the interview panel members should have 10 thousand AGP. Sabhajeet Yadav has 8,700 AGP so he is allegedly not eligible to interview a registrar.\nSources said, DTE chief secretary Sanjay Bandopadhyay was invited to interview the applicants but at the last movement he failed to appear and sent his representative. However DTE has many subject experts having 10 thousand AGP.\nWorking tenure of chairperson Geetha Bali has been recently completed and now institute cannot recruit registrar before appointing new chairperson. Institute chair person Bali denied to pass the appointment file of registrar as there was no clearance from chief vigilance officer to the selected the candidate.\nThe institute has also proposed to hold appointment of teaching and non teaching staff as there is lack of faculties.\nAs agreement of registrar is mandatory for appointing permanent faculty, institute would not be recruiting them till appointment of a registrar.\nThe institute is facing several controversies in appointment of a permanent registrar. MANIT is looking for registrar for past one year. Large number of ex-service man, soldiers and colonel applied for the post of registrar in MANIT. Sources said director has shortlisted ex-army man and soon his name would be recommended to the higher authorities. MANIT ex-registrar Savita Raje had also applied for the post of registrar but she did not appear in interview session.\nThere were 40 candidates called for the interview out of which only 28 appeared. MANIT faculty Rajendra Khare and Rajesh Gupta also failed to appear in the interview.

AFP PHOTO In Summary \nAfter months in and out of hospital, and tests for diseases such as malaria and typhoid, Kingdavid tested positive for lead poisoning. \nThe diagnosis launched Omido into a years-long campaign to get the government, which licenced the plant, and company bosses to close the smelter and clean up the environment. Advertisement By AFP \nIrene Akinyi Odinga has lead poisoning. With no money for treatment, the young mother of two stares death in the face.\"I feel very bad,\" the 25-year-old tells AFP on the sidelines of a UN pollution conference, shivering in a thick jacket in the warm Kenyan sun.] \n\"I have constant headaches. I cannot walk long distances, I can't even cook for my own children.\" Odinga is one of dozens of inhabitants of the Owino Uhuru slum near Mombasa, Kenya's second-largest city, who say they were poisoned by a plant recycling lead-acid batteries, the type used in cars.\"My father, my brother, my husband all worked at the smelter,\" Odinga says. \"I washed their (work) clothes.\" She suspects this is how the lead got in her system. \nAddressing the scourge of lead pollution, a health hazard particularly in poor and middle-income countries, was a focus of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) held in the Kenyan capital Nairobi this week.On Wednesday, environment ministers adopted a resolution expressing concern about the health and environmental impacts of lead-acid battery recycling. \n\"Exposure to lead, including lead in paint and in waste lead-acid batteries, can cause serious lifelong damage, especially in children, such as loss of IQ and behavioural problems,\" it said. \n- Everything changed - \"Exposure of pregnant women to high levels of lead can cause miscarriage, stillbirth as well as malformations,\" the resolution noted.Lead exposure is estimated to cause nearly half a million deaths each year, according to the World Health Organization.It accounts for more than one in ten cases of intellectual disability, 2.5 percent of global heart disease, and about the same percentage of strokes. \nPhyllis Omido worked at the Owino Uhuru battery recycling plant about seven years ago.A single mother with no daycare options, she brought her infant son, still breastfeeding, to work with her.After about two months, the boy, Kingdavid Jeremiah Indiatsi, fell ill.\"My son had been a very easy baby from birth, he would sleep the whole night. My neighbours would always tease me: 'Are you sure you've got a baby?' because he was always very silent. \n\"But then suddenly he was screaming the whole night... He had fevers that were not breaking. Then he started (having) diarrhoea. Suddenly he was not able to eat. After some time he got very dehydrated. He was severely anaemic.\"After months in and out of hospital, and tests for diseases such as malaria and typhoid, Kingdavid tested positive for lead poisoning. \nThe diagnosis launched Omido into a years-long campaign to get the government, which licenced the plant, and company bosses to close the smelter and clean up the environment.The plant was finally shuttered in 2014 -- too late for many in the community of some 3,000 people. \n- 'Just breaks my heart' - More than 150 community members and 22 smelter workers have tested positive for lead poisoning so far, Omido told AFP at the UNEA, which she attended as a delegate.Dozens have died, many of them babies.Without access to chelation therapy, which removes heavy metals from the body, Kingdavid's lead levels were reduced through years of treatment with calcium and zinc, thought to displace lead in blood, his mother said.But the boy's future is uncertain. \n\"The doctors advised me that he has to go for an (IQ) evaluation because lead affects the IQ.\"I've not taken him for that, because it just breaks my heart and I fear that if we tell him: 'This thing has affected your IQ' he might see himself like he's less than other children.\" \nKingdavid struggles with concentration, said Omido, who funded the Center for Justice Governance and Environmental Action as part of her campaign, and has been awarded the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize.\"He has many friends, and you can see a clear difference. He doesn't react as fast as other kids and... he can't concentrate on you for a very long time. \n\"We have to do a lot of extra tuition for him. When his friends are on holiday, he still has to catch up.\"The UNEA resolution adopted on Wednesday expressed \"strong determination\" to reduce exposure to lead, \"including through promoting environmentally sound management of waste lead-acid batteries and eliminating lead paint.\"Omido also worries for her friend, Odinga, whom she brought to the assembly to highlight her plight. \n\"I'm very surprised and thankful to God that Irene is still alive,\" Omido said. \"But I'm afraid that if we do not act... she's going to die as well. We need to get chelation medicine for her.\"Of all the smelter workers tested so far, Omido is the only one with a manageably low lead poisoning level.\"I was really surprised. And happy,\" she laughs. \n\"I was so sure that I had it. I guess (it's) also because I was working in the office and not in the furnace. Most of the people who have died were the ones that were working directly in the furnace.\" advertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "odinga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingdavid jeremiah indiatsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingdavid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omido", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irene akinyi odinga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phyllis omido", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "un", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "un environment assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for justice governance and environmental action", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organization.it", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman environmental prize", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "owino uhuru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nairobi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mombasa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:30.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5220c488b05fcf3637110f1852851c4af99f3f76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZik5Tk5DN6ybnJbCKOHy2qQ0tQjiH7Oz8Z", "site_full": "www.beyondblue.org.au", "site": "beyondblue.org.au", "site_section": "http://www.beyondblue.org.au/connect-with-others/online-forums/bb-social-zone", "site_categories": ["health", "panic_anxiety_disorders", "depression"], "section_title": "BB Social Zone ", "title": "CHRISTMAS 2017/NEW YEARS Chillout Lounge", "title_full": "CHRISTMAS 2017/NEW YEARS Chillout Lounge", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 25, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.beyondblue.org.au/App_Themes/standard/images/BB_FB_logo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5220c488b05fcf3637110f1852851c4af99f3f76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZik5Tk5DN6ybnJbCKOHy2qQ0tQjiH7Oz8Z", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CMF", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "CHRISTMAS 2017/NEW YEARS Chillout Lounge", "text": "Jackson,\nYlive brought a year to my eye.

Nice people abound on BB because we give what we desire; hearts overflowing and healing minds. Thankyou...\nI haven't shopped for my family yet. There's so many children, I don't know where to start. A couple of the boys begged me not to buy books again! Sigh...I try to be as generous as I can, and give valued gifts that can be kept and remembered.\nWhen I was 12 my parents gave me a diamant\u00e9 watch that danced and glittered in the light. I loved it to pieces, but wondered why my sisters received more presents than me.\nMy mum and I spoke about it last week and she proclaimed for the first time, she'd felt sad for me. My watch had cost so much, the equivalent was spent on the others which added up to many more gifts. She saw the look on my face as they opened one after the other in front of me.\nIsn't it interesting how I remember many of the gifts I received as a child.

That\u0092s a faster pace than the group had previously predicted. Researchers say next year\u0092s numbers could increase by an even greater percentage.\nCanada, in 2018, is expected to launch recreational sales of marijuana and Nevada will step up efforts for cannabis tourism. But it really comes down to California, which will begin selling recreational pot next year.\nCalifornia\u0092s medical marijuana market is already as big as the total markets in Colorado, Washington, and Oregon combined, according to BDS Analytics\u0092 GreenEdge point-of-sale tracking service.
