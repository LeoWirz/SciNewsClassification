Fabege AB   165.39M   378,934   138 and high of 181.7. Getting To Know The OMXS30 \nSweden is a uniquely powerful economy in Europe just like Germany, France, and other thriving European economies. Its rich equity market is a proof of its excellent corporate governance that every investor is looking for when it comes to foreign investments. They are looking for Fabege AB to check its reliability. The Swedish Equity Market \nThe Stockholm Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Stockholm, is the main stock exchange in Sweden situated in Frihamnen, Stockholm. Fabege AB is one of the NASDAQ most active participants. It is operated by Nasdaq Nordiq, a 13-year-old subsidiary of Nasdaq, Inc. \nNasdaq Nordiq was established in 2003 for the primary purpose of overseeing the stock exchanges in Nordic countries. Aside from the Nasdaq Stockholm, it also operates the Tallinn Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Baltic; the Riga Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Baltic; the Iceland Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Iceland; the Helsinki Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Helsinki; the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Copenhagen; and the Armenia Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq OMX Armenia. \nThe Nasdaq Stockholm has been present since 1863, making it one of the oldest European stock exchanges. It has only adopted electronic trading on June 1, 1990. Prior to this, floor trading had happened at the Stockholm Stock Exchange Building. \nThe regular session on the Nasdaq Stockholm commences from 9:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. every business day. That is the time for Fabege AB to count its gain. \nThe OMX Stockholm 30 Index (OMXS30) is the market-capitalization-weighted index that monitors the 30 most active stocks on the Nasdaq Stockholm. Numerous sectors make up the OMXS30; and the top three largest sectors are Industrials, Financials, and Consumer Services. Being the benchmark index in Sweden, it is a crucial indicator of the Swedish economy. \nThe OMXS30 is rebalanced twice a year, ensuring a strong indication of how well the Swedish equity market is. As such, some components may be dropped to give way to other companies that are more competitive. Several factors such as liquidity, market capitalization, and industry representation play major role in a stock\u2019s inclusion to the OMXS30. By the Numbers \nAs of the end of the first quarter of 2016, the Nasdaq Stockholm has a market capitalization of nearly $1.30 trillion with over 300 stocks listed on it. \nMeanwhile, the OMXS30 holds an all-time low of 98.86 points, which was last seen in November 1987. Sweden is one of the many countries that had suffered from Black Monday, a remarkable global equity market meltdown in history that began with the sinking of stocks on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (HK). \nGradually, the Swedish economy was able to overcome all other challenges through the years. In April 2015, the OMXS30 had reached an all-time high of 1,719.93 points. \nThe Nasdaq Stockholm is one of the most valuable and most competitive stock exchanges in Europe. Because of an attractive borrowing environment in European Union (EU) countries such as Sweden, many investors are flocking the Swedish equity market. There is no better way to take advantage of these growth opportunities than to invest in European stocks such as those listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm. And look for Fabege AB advantages. \nMore news for Fabege AB (STO:publ) were recently published by: Businesswire.com, which released: \u201cFabege Investing SEK 944 Million in Sundbyberg\u201d on October 18, 2016.

PAUL, Minn. \u2014 The Latest on Garrison's Keilor's dismissal following allegations of sexual misconduct (all times local): \n12:10 a.m. \nGarrison Keilor's attorney says the humorist is aware of only one woman making allegations of inappropriate behaviour against him and wants the president of Minnesota Public Radio to \"set the record straight\" on that point. \nKeilor's personal attorney, Eric Nilsson, issued a statement early Thursday responding to a news report that MPR President Jon McTaggart told employees Wednesday the decision to cut ties with Keilor resulted from multiple allegations that covered an extended period of time. \nMPR News reported the McTaggart comments. Nilsson says that the former \"A Prairie Home Companion\" host wants a swift resolution with MPR and \"expects a full restoration of his reputation.\" \nKeillor has said he touched a woman's bare back to console her, and that he apologized. MPR has not provided details of the allegations. \n___ \n8 p.m. \nThe president of Minnesota Public Radio has told employees the decision to cut business ties with former \"A Prairie Home Companion\" host Garrison Keillor resulted from \"multiple allegations\" that covered an extended period of time. \nJon McTaggart held an off-the-record meeting with employees Wednesday, a week after Keillor's dismissal was announced. Reporters from Minnesota Public Radio News did not attend because the meeting was declared off-the-record, but compiled an account from employees who did attend. \nMPR News reports McTaggart said he alone made the decision to break with Keillor, who retired as \"Prairie Home\" host last year. Keillor told the Star Tribune he touched a woman's bare back as he tried to console her, and that he apologized. \nThe show continues with Keillor's hand-picked successor, mandolinist Chris Thile. \nThe Associated Press", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "keillor", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "garrison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mctaggart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric nilsson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris thile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garrison keilor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jon mctaggart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nilsson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keilor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garrison keillor", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mpr", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "star tribune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mpr news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota public radio news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota public radio", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "minn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. paul", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:01.032+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "01a6e9f9ec7969c60df8fcae35813b04fff712a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT.JzkJu_t78zmWOpzDvXSK2uWOeDggAq_2V0cJC.sLcFNxHcW8J4.mEega9mlqnQyufE8vVYmXVsDJIR8n73oW", "site_full": "play.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://play.google.com/store", "site_categories": ["media", "hobbies_and_interests", "comic_books"], "section_title": "Android Apps on Google Play", "title": "Google Chrome: Fast & Secure", "title_full": "Google Chrome: Fast & Secure - Android Apps on Google Play", "published": "2017-11-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 39, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ac6bfd8cfbd7c6453462a1264735ecdaae390bfe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT.JzkJu_t78zmWOpzDvXSK2uWOeDggAq_2V0cJC.sLcFNxHcW8J4.mEega9mlqnQyufE8vVYmXVs1kMFTd1BjLVvbEuQw8KQpzT0czmgoL4ti4Se4JVOGn97L1mfGhMiSzVEUCQY9JS0q_LE_Uhnx6ZKOk..zk60r2HYfApcA6LPF0SF7WYktize3.ty8pyvpHXC1_YWi6UIBGr4bR0c2iVeahifm7907KV3YhnpSDH4hPRR1NHiSq96f5IHNV6I8IM64gu3XHiQ--", "ord_in_thread": 30, "author": "Bk201 Hei", "published": "2017-11-30T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "At night everything is working okay fast at 3g speed.

Michael Essien has called on Chelsea to secure Eden Hazard on a new long-term deal as contract talks continue between the club and the player. Hazard has been in a sensational form this season, having racked up an impressive eight goals and six assists despite missing the start of the season with a broken ankle. Essien is still playing football in Indonesia with Persib, but he has recently been back training at Cobham Training Centre as his season has ended. The 35-year-old thinks that the lure of his other former club Real Madrid will be tempting but he hopes that Hazard will choose to stay at Stamford Bridge. \u201cHe could go to Real Madrid to win the Balon d\u2019Or easier,\u201d Essien said with a laugh as he spoke with Goal . \u201cWhen we talk about Eden, he is such a good player. He\u2019s very quick, very good on the ball. He\u2019s very strong, he may be little but he is strong, trust me! It is hard to get the ball off him. \u201cHe\u2019s such a good player and we\u2019re happy to have him at Chelsea but I\u2019d understand why Madrid would be looking at him. He is proving it week-in, week-out. At the moment he is the most important player [at Chelsea]. When you have Hazard, he can always do something. \u201cHe can always create something to do something with the ball. He makes goals for himself or others. He has that magic touch. I think that Chelsea need to renew his contract. You don\u2019t want your best players to leave and we need him at the club. \u201cI think he is only motivated about playing football, he just enjoys playing football. It would take a lot of money to replace him [at Chelsea] but I hope that they can tie him down for a long time.\u201d Essien, who was speaking at an event with William Hill Plus , made over 250 appearances for Chelsea winning two league titles, five domestic cups and the Champions League. He signed for \u00a324.4 million from Lyon where he won a number of honours and later went on to play for Real Madrid and AC Milan. Essien was asked which Premier League player he would most enjoy facing and he explained why he would have enjoyed sharing the pitch with N\u2019Golo Kante. \u201cI would have loved to have faced Kante or play with him,\u201d Essien said. \u201cHe is such a great player. I am happy he is at Chelsea and he is enjoying his game. It would be a very physical battle if I met him on the pitch. He has great energy, he never stops running, but he doesn\u2019t run for the sake of running. He always does it for something. He\u2019s good on the ball and his anticipation is second to none. He will chase you until he gets the ball off you and his tackles are always clean. I\u2019ve met him and we just talk in general. He is a very quiet guy. \u201cI think that he is a good player and what he does on the pitch is pretty unique, not many midfielders are doing it. He has something special about him \u2026 everyone in the world has seen him and I would put him up there [among the best].\u201d Kante has made a similar early impact to Essien when he signed for the club in 2005, but Tiemoue Bakayoko has found his early career at Stamford Bridge more difficult. Bakayoko moved from France to England in a big-money deal just like Essien, but has recently come in for criticism over his performances. Essien still thinks that Bakayoko will make the grade in west London after his \u00a340 million summer move from Monaco and he has urged fans not to put too much pressure on him. \u201cIt is his first season. He is still young and he has a lot in him to keep developing,\u201d Essien said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to put pressure on him and he doesn\u2019t need to put pressure on himself. He just needs to try to enjoy the situation and to try to adapt. \u201cChelsea is an amazing place to play and the Premier League is not that easy to come to. Some people take time and others come in and get it straight away. He needs to adapt. \u201cHowever, I was ready when I signed for Chelsea. I was ready to come, it was physical in the league. I was prepared with my abilities and I was a bit older. I didn\u2019t find it hard at all. [Jose] Mourinho gave me every confidence and it was quite easy to adapt. \u201cIt was more physical back when I signed but for the players now it is a bit less. The referees are protecting the players more which is good. All my old team-mates are gone! It is the football life. Players come and go. \u201cConte has brought in the players that he needs and that\u2019s normal. It was nothing personal and it is a normal thing that happens in football. Managers come in and they need certain players, yes, all my old team-mates have gone but that\u2019s normal to not stay there forever. \u201cYou have to move on [as a player]. I don\u2019t think it is hard for Conte\u2019s side to compete with my side. I don\u2019t like comparisons, what we\u2019ve done has gone now and we have the new boys in now. We have to keep supporting them and they can win something for Chelsea. Essien has only played with David Luiz and Gary Cahill from the current group of Chelsea players, as John Terry, John Obi Mikel and Branislav Ivanovic were part of a group who left last summer. Luiz has since been dropped following a poor performance against Roma and Andreas Christensen has stepped up into the starting line-up to take his place. Luiz then suffered a training-ground knee injury but Essien thinks that Chelsea should keep him around because he improves the atmosphere in the dressing room. \u201cSell him? I am not sure. He is one of the leaders at the moment,\u201d Essien said. \u201cWhen you want to do something you need the leaders, you need that experience so hopefully he will still be around for a long time. When he was with me he was a crazy guy but in a good way. \u201cYou need that as a player. He is not that old, 30 years old, he\u2019s still young to me. He has a strong leadership in him and that\u2019s good for the team. It is good to have him in the dressing room. It is very funny, he jokes around but he\u2019s serious when he\u2019s playing. \u201cIt is sad how people forget last season so soon. It is what it is, this happens in football.

Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare.\nMedicaid is a federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people. Today, it covers about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but officials also say they want to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills.\n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\"\nIn Stuttgart, Arkansas, Vickie Rose says Medicaid is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day.\n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings.\n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose.\nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries.\nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage.\nIn other findings:\n\u201425 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage.\n\u201436 percent of people with Medicaid said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare.\nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story.\n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups ... although I think they are swimming upstream.\"\nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage.\nIn one counterintuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network.\nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach to adapt strategies used by employers.\n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\"\nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the workforce,\" he said.\nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs.\nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C.\nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.\n___\nOnline:\nGallup-Sharecare - https://tinyurl.com/yahmpox5", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vickie rose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan witters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kavita patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "witters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt salo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national association of medicaid directors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicaid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "creek fire smothers lake view terrace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sfgate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mid-delta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuttgart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ark.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oakland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clarendon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russian hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bay area", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa rosa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:02.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c47dad676982f651ae3d903b96def0a456820c78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMo2LPKeCGKh_hggVeWqk60LHHDdvIbJQOYrAMsEcmc5ULNH19fc9WltxGaBJkVoJRbVBrFFr.EymvpJP7CvZx_QPyOmUBCFJxs-", "site_full": "thefarmingforum.co.uk", "site": "thefarmingforum.co.uk", "site_section": "http://thefarmingforum.co.uk/index.php?forums/pictures/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Pictures &amp; Videos | The Farming Forum", "title": "Today at work | Page 4116", "title_full": "Today at work | Page 4116 | The Farming Forum", "published": "2017-12-07T08:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 45, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "https://d1hu4133i4rt3z.cloudfront.net/avatars/m/0/39.jpg?1496956535", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34787, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "85bb3e39c4af7db58daf1c354268b9da632c7b33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMo2LPKeCGKh_hggVeWqk60LHHDdvIbJQOYrAMsEcmc5ULNH19fc9WltxGaBJkVoJRbVBrFFr.EymvpJP7CvZx_QRH2s__nIlXcFWjmOnl68ZmEVAQQWr7ud", "ord_in_thread": 23, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-05T19:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "yellowbelly said: \u2191 I see you got finished then.

A simple 5-minute recipe perfect for snacking or gifting! \nOnce again, it was only a matter of time before a base coconut no bake cookie got some chocolate! \nI\u2019m not even going to beat around the bush here- the Chocolate and coconut combination has taken the number one spot. I cannot believe I went all this time thinking that original coconut cookies or coconut crack bars were the jam. MY OTHER RECIPES \nIt shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise, seeing that bounty bars and mound bars are two of my favorite candy bars on the market. However, I never looked at this combination outside of the store-bought packaging it came in. \nNow that the holiday season is in full swing, I\u2019ve been taking it one step further and testing this theory out in ALL THE COOKIES. \nIf you\u2019ve been waiting for an excuse to whip up some cookies, there is no time like the present. These no bake chocolate snowball cookies NEED to be your first priority- \nNo baking \nReady in 5 minutes \n4 ingredients \nSecretly healthy cookies are my favorite kind of cookies. They taste like something you\u2019d typically enjoy on special occasions, but really, they are an every-day-multiple-times-a-day snack. \nNot only do these chocolate coconut snowball no bake cookies need just 4 ingredients, they are also paleo, vegan and keto friendly. For those who follow a dairy free, low carb or sugar free diet, you are covered too! BLENDER VS Mixing Bowl \nMany of you guys have already made and loved the coconut snowball no bake cookies. Several of you mentioned that you had trouble forming them into cookies, as the dough wouldn\u2019t form properly. \nThe key to achieving a thick cookie batter is using a blender. It ensures that all the ingredients are fully combined, with no clumps. \nUnderstandably, not everyone has a blender or would prefer to do this by hand. Here are some tips to achieve perfect no bake chocolate snowball cookies- Use fine milled shredded coconut (desiccated coconut)- In contrast to the more commonly found shredded coconut, a finer cut ensures easier mixing or blending. Refrigerate the dough beforehand- Once you have blended or mixed the mixture completely, form into one big ball and cover in saran wrap/plastic wrap. Refrigerate it for 30 minutes and then form balls from there. Chill your can of coconut milk- Chilled canned coconut milk (not from the carton!) always leaves a thick layer of coconut cream on top, separating it from the juice. For these cookies, you\u2019ll use the cream portion so having it chilled prior will ensure it to be naturally thick and smooth. Wet your hands slightly before shaping the cookies- This will prevent the mixture sticking to your fingers. Sift cocoa powder- To avoid clumps in the mixture. Gifting or snacking \nSnacking on these   snowball cookies are perfectly fine. I love that they are low in carbs, but high in protein and fats, to promote satiety. You\u2019ll find that you only need one or two cookies to be completely satisfied. \nIf you plan on gifting these over the holiday period, it\u2019s incredibly easy.

The parents of fifth-grader Ashawnty Davis say she was devastated after video of a fight she was involved in was posted on an app. \nThe parents of a Colorado fifth-grader who killed herself blame it on bullying, and they say her school could have done more to intervene. \nAshawnty Davis, 10, died Wednesday after being taken off life support at a children\u2019s hospital, two weeks after she was found hanging in a closet at home. \nHer parents said Ashawnty was bullied after a video of a fight she was in at her school in Aurora in October was posted on an app. Ashawnty confronted a girl who had already been bullying her, her mother said, and the fight was recorded on a cellphone and posted to an app called Musical.ly. \n\u201cShe was devastated when she found out that it had made it to Musical.ly,\u201d Latoshia Harris, Ashawnty\u2019s mother, told CNN affiliate KDVR. \u201cMy daughter came home two weeks later and hanged herself in the closet.\u201d \nThe Davis-Harris family has not returned CNN\u2019s requests for comment. \nA spokesperson for Musical.ly told CNN the company learned of Ashawnty\u2019s death \u201cthrough news reports.\u201d \n\u201cWe are absolutely heartbroken to hear about this. Our hearts are with the Davis family in this unimaginably painful time,\u201d the company statement said. \nParents wanted school to do more \nIf her parents are correct, Ashawnty is the latest victim of \u201cbullycide,\u201d which is bullying that leads to suicide. It\u2019s happened in a number of cases involving teens over the past couple of years. \nAshawnty\u2019s parents say the Cherry Creek School District should have done more to stop the bullying that led to her death. \nAbbe Smith, director of communications for the Cherry Creek School District, told CNN that the students were talked to about the fight, parents were called and the cellphone video was sent to the Aurora Police Department. \nBut Ashawnty\u2019s parents say that was inadequate. \n\u201cThere was nothing done about it. When I got the call telling me that my daughter had been in a fight, they never gave me the opportunity to meet with the other parents to come to the bottom of the line,\u201d Harris said. \nIf they had been able to have that meeting, her parents say, Ashawnty might still be alive today. \nSmith said the school didn\u2019t know about any bullying. \n\u201cThe school did not receive any complaints from students or parents that the student was being bullied,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe do not tolerate bullying of any kind in our schools and we have a comprehensive bullying prevention program in place at all of our schools for grades K-12. \n\u201cThe safety and well-being of students is our highest priority and we strive every (day) to ensure schools are safe, welcoming and supportive places that support learning.\u201d \nSmith also stressed that the fight, while taking place on a school field, did not happen during school hours. \nThe district described Ashawnty\u2019s death as \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d Smith said counseling was being provided to students who needed it. \n\u201cWe are very much focused on supporting the students and school community as they navigate this heartbreaking situation,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThis is a tragic loss that has shaken the whole school community. Our hearts and thoughts go out to the family and everyone who knew the student.\u201d \nAshawnty\u2019s mother said she wants to hold school administrators accountable for the bullying that goes on inside their schools. \n\u201cWith the last breath in my life I\u2019m going to make sure that the unfortunate kids are able to go to school comfortably and learn,\u201d Davis said. \nSource: CNN.com Advertisements Rate this: This information is free, share with friends and family. \u2022 Reach More Than 50 Thousand Nigerians Daily, Advertise With Us, Call or Whatsapp +2347068326095", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ashawnty davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis-harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbe smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashawnty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latoshia harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cherry creek school district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aurora police department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kdvr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn.com advertisements rate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "aurora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashawnty", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:03.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c58440ff05705ade79702b784fa072cdcca4898", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSHWDMgkL9zWcfBozVblW..l4A9l9bzdo6zF42guZdKCYLMJep7LikG3Zv788LfIx4mTGv41uBdd_Vd4Bmd7Q_7lrOhC9B1UNM-", "site_full": "math.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://math.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Mathematics Stack Exchange", "title": "Matrix Computation question", "title_full": "Matrix Computation question", "published": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/math/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=4ec1df2e49b1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9c58440ff05705ade79702b784fa072cdcca4898", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSHWDMgkL9zWcfBozVblW..l4A9l9bzdo6zF42guZdKCYLMJep7LikG3Zv788LfIx4mTGv41uBdd_Vd4Bmd7Q_7lrOhC9B1UNM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aaron Wong", "published": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "Matrix Computation question", "text": "Can anyone help me with this?

The EU is looking to give her breathing room by granting another extension. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has extended UK Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s deadline to settle the Irish border issue to next Wednesday \u2013 the eve of an EU leaders\u2019 summit, which takes place next Thursday \u2013 to give her more time to broker a successful deal. Juncker had previously suggested that Sunday was the last day that he could meet May to resolve the Irish issue, after allowing her an extra week after May failed to strike a deal on the Irish border by the last deadline, which expired on Monday. One EU official told the Daily Telegraph that Juncker wants to support the British prime minister to enable her to reach an agreement that will satisfy all parties.  \u201cMr Juncker wants to support Mrs May to avoid the collapse of her government. He is prepared to meet her at any time, including on days next week in the run up to the European summit.\u201d The source said that the text of the disputed draft withdrawal agreement could be changed because  \u201cthere\u2019s always wriggle room.\u201d On Wednesday, May suffered an in-party attack from the backbench in the House of Commons, with a Tory MP offering to take the reins on negotiations if May can\u2019t  \u201csort them out\u201d  herself. Unfortunately for May, the in-fighting didn\u2019t stop there. Tory unity seems to be crumbling away entirely, with 20 conservative MPs penning a letter to May during the week, accusing pro-Brexit colleagues of being  \u201chighly irresponsible to seek to dictate terms which could lead to the UK walking away.\u201d Read more David Davis facing calls to resign after admitting Brexit impact assessments \u2018don\u2019t exist\u2019 Chaos in the party escalated even further when Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond admitted on Wednesday that the Cabinet still had not agreed on a target for the  \u201cend state.\u201d \u201cThe Cabinet has had general discussions about our Brexit negotiations but we haven\u2019t had a specific mandating of an end state position,\u201d  Hammond told MPs. \u201cThat is something that will be done first in the sub-committee that has been constituted to deal with this issue and of course logically that will happen once we have confirmation that we have reached sufficient progress and that we are going to begin the phase two negotiations with the EU 27. We are not yet at that stage and it would have been premature to have that discussion until we reach that stage.\u201d The woman at the center of the ill-fated Irish deal, Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster, told Sky News her party had been asking the May-led Government to look at drafts of the proposed agreement with the EU for five weeks prior to Monday\u2019s decision debacle. Foster said a version was not sent to her party until late on Monday morning, shortly before the prime minister\u2019s talks with Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t seen any text, despite asking for text for nearly five weeks now, we haven\u2019t been in receipt of any text and the text only came through to us late yesterday morning,\u201d  Foster said. \u201c And obviously once we saw the text we knew it wasn\u2019t going to be acceptable.\u201d Read more Attacked from all sides: PM facing another Tory revolt amid signs she\u2019s pushing soft-Brexit If May fails to negotiate a deal that is accepted by all involved, her next opportunity to get trade talks underway will be in March \u2013 but she may not have that long, as the threat of a leadership challenge hangs in the air if her no-deal goes on for much longer.  One Conservative MP told the Telegraph:  \u201cI would give her a matter of weeks if it carries on like this.\" During the Prime Minister\u2019s Questions on Wednesday, Brexit supporter and MP for Wellingborough Peter Bone wondered if Britain would deliver on its promise to leave. \u201cWhen the British people voted to leave the European superstate, they voted to end the free movement of people, they voted to stop sending billions and billions of pounds to the EU each and every year, and they voted to make our laws in our own country judged by our own judges,\u201d  Bone said. \"Are we on course still to deliver that, and if we have a problem, would it help if I came over to Brussels with you to sort them out?\u201d. He also labelled Foster the  \u201cnew heroine of Brexit\u201d  for refusing to sign up to  \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d  with the Republic of Ireland.
