The bill, which has been identified as high priority legislation by the National Rifle Association (NRA), would allow people who are prohibited from getting a concealed carry permit in a state with strong gun laws to apply for a permit in a state with weaker laws. This includes convicted stalkers, domestic abusers, people convicted of violent crimes, and people with no training or experience firing a gun. \n\u201cCongress should be putting forward legislation that addresses the epidemic of gun violence not pandering to long-standing pet projects of the NRA,\u201d said David Stacy, HRC Government Affairs Director. \u201cStates have taken the important step of passing common-sense gun policies in the face of inaction by Congress. This ill-conceived bill would undermine state laws and greatly weaken local law enforcement\u2019s ability to serve their community. HRC is proud to join gun safety advocates in opposing this dangerous proposal.\u201d \nLast year, 49 people -- most of them LGBTQ and Latinx -- were killed in a mass shooting in Orlando. While this incident gained national attention, the LGBTQ community is consistently the target of bias-motivated violence, as evidenced by the FBI\u2019s recent release of hate crimes statistics for 2016 . The volatile combination of animosity towards the LGBTQ community and lack of strong laws to prevent gun violence exacerbates the dangers faced by LGBTQ people. Reasonable gun violence prevention measures are part of the solution to bias-motivated violence. \nFollowing the tragedy in Orlando, HRC\u2019s Board of Directors adopted a resolution recommended by HRC President Chad Griffin that addresses both the epidemic of hate that has fueled anti-LGBTQ-motivated murder, assault and discrimination as well as common-sense gun violence prevention policies that would help keep the LGBTQ community safe. The resolution established HRC\u2019s organizational position that the safety of LGBTQ people in the United States requires the adoption of common-sense gun violence prevention measures, including limiting access to assault-style rifles, expanding background checks, and limiting the ability for suspected terrorists, and those with a history of domestic abuse to access guns.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aaron rodriguez", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "david stacy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chad griffin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hrc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "national rifle association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:03.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "716d166e78caa9ffadaff4f5525a0168bcf6bd30", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmNKuSSMJvw75VVy.PPZC0DSqNpqxqn1GWyEsvwsIRtg1Xn.ODLK3d", "site_full": "www.ozbargain.com.au", "site": "ozbargain.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.ozbargain.com.au/forum/559", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Toys &amp; Kids: Discussion Forum - OzBargain Forums", "title": "Any Unlocked Phones under $100?!", "title_full": "Any Unlocked Phones under $100?! - OzBargain Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T09:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.ozbargain.com.au/themes/ozbargain/logo-square.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10489, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "716d166e78caa9ffadaff4f5525a0168bcf6bd30", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmNKuSSMJvw75VVy.PPZC0DSqNpqxqn1GWyEsvwsIRtg1Xn.ODLK3d", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MrZ", "published": "2017-12-07T09:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Any Unlocked Phones under $100?!", "text": "Doesn't the Nokia 3310 have 2002-era features? i.e. no web browser, e-mail, MMS, etc?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:03.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "716d166e78caa9ffadaff4f5525a0168bcf6bd30", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmNKuSSMJvw75VVy.PPZC0DSqNpqxqn1GWyEsvwsIRtg1Xn.ODLK3d", "site_full": "www.ozbargain.com.au", "site": "ozbargain.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.ozbargain.com.au/forum/559", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Toys &amp; Kids: Discussion Forum - OzBargain Forums", "title": "Any Unlocked Phones under $100?!", "title_full": "Any Unlocked Phones under $100?! - OzBargain Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T09:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.ozbargain.com.au/themes/ozbargain/logo-square.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10489, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ab7dbd7d5f4fa040560042ae870619a82d9902b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmNKuSSMJvw75VVy.PPZC0DSqNpqxqn1GWyEsvwsIRtlM7SdHiScRcwEuaJZR9Eto09MERDDmujg--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "scrimshaw", "published": "2017-12-07T09:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Phone unlocking can be done for just a few dollars.

Allen, Deere & Company chairman and chief executive officer. The Wirtgen Group has a global footprint with approximately 8,200 employees and sells products in more than 100 countries through a large network of company-owned and independent dealers. Wirtgen\u2019s product portfolio is complementary to Deere\u2019s existing construction equipment offering and establishes Deere as the industry leader in global road construction. The Wirtgen Group has premium brands across the entire road construction sector spanning milling, processing, mixing, paving, compaction and rehabilitation. Allen said the acquisition aligns with Deere\u2019s long-term strategy to expand in both agriculture and construction \u2013 the company\u2019s two global growth businesses.

I chose this fortnight\u2019s theme \u201cT\u2019was The Night Before Christmas\u201d \u2013 I thought it would be fun to take an element from the poem, A Visit From St. Nicholas. It is a story that my mum would often read to me on the run up to Christmas and I could recite from memory! Unfortunately, as the poem is rather long, I had to cut some of the story. We\u2019d love to see your creations just make sure there is an element on your project from the verses listed. \n\nI began by stamping little Oakly the Bear and, after covering with a post-it-note, used the Christmas Tree both from Stacey Yaccula\u2019s range at Purple Onion Designs. I used pencils to colour the images \u2013 I decided to make Oakly a Polar Bear and because white looks beautiful on darker card, used a piece of kraft card as a base. I applied various layers of the pencil in little strokes to give the look of hairs on the bear and prickles on the tree.\n\nI stamped a Christmassy sentiment onto a banner and brushed Versafine Satin Red ink around the edges. I added foam to the back of the banner and, before adhering it to the project, wrapped two pieces of ribbon around the rectangle. The backing paper was created on the computer with red ink and a funky font \u2013 I then ran it through my die cutting machine with the largest My Favorite Things Pierced Tag.\n \nThis challenge ends

I am a returned veteran and I have crafted a beautiful life.

Has been ups and downs over the years, however over the past 6-8 months I have felt differently, almost like I felt she was withdrawing from me.\nLast night she said something which is what I suspected, she said she is depressed.\nShe has had issues at work recently but at home things have really altered.\nNasty and there is a communication breakdown. I hear are negative comments most of the time and it seems impossible to get anything right.\nIf I dare attempt to defend myself it ends up in me being cornered, verbally abused or storming off and locking herself in the bedroom. If I try to walk away from any dressing downs which I try to do as a time out approach as it is not constructively going anywhere, it can be days before I hear her voice again.\nShe says she is alone, a failure and has a fog in her mind.\nI can stand by her, she is not alone and I understand truthfully some of what she is going through.\nThe problem for me is the rage and anger \u2013 it is horrible, mean, she belittles me and says some really terrible things. I don\u2019t know what I am doing wrong - I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\nLast night my oldest daughter saw this and she was truly frightened. The rage in my wife\u2019s eyes over nothing was way out there. \u2013 pure raw rage. She is concerned for her and what\u2019s to help her, but she\u2019s 9.\nIntimacy is always an issue and it is rare these days if at all. I need to initiate it if it was to happen and this has generally been the case throughout our marriage.

I admire your stoic support for your wife who seems to be creating a difficult environment at home.\nSupporting a loved one who's suffering the effects of depression, especially anger, can be a thankless job; I really feel for you. I'm wondering has she been to her GP or if you've spoken to yours. It's the first place to start when mental health concerns become apparent.\nWhat is also of concern, is if your wife's demeanour has raised its head in the past at all. If not, her GP can investigate if there are physical reason's for her character changes. Peri menopause could be behind the anger. Hormones (and brain chemicals in general) are notorious for changing women of a certain age into screaming banshees.\nIf this is the case and I hope it is, her Dr can advise the best way forward. If she has depression due to an event or past hurt coming up, (triggered) then your GP can also help with medication and a referral to a psychologist.\nHow can you help? By being extremely patient and empathetic. If you read up on this stage of a woman's life and learn how others have coped, it may help you personally. If it were me in your place, (I say this tentatively) I might write her a letter and stick it in a card to be left on her pillow or some place she'll find it.\nExpress how helpless you feel seeing her like this and what it's doing to you. Explain how you've been stepping on eggshells to try and make her feel better, but seem to have failed which hurts you. Add lots of love talk and happy memories you've shared. Most of all though, tell her you're in it for the long haul and will try to be as patient and supportive as possible.\nGive her an opportunity (time) to absorb what you've written by leaving the house for a while and return ' not expecting a miracle' ok. Her response ideally would be to cry. It might ease her frustration and give you a chance to hug her.\nI hope I've helped Scott. I applaud your decision to seek help here on BB forum. It takes courage to reach out.\nPlease let us know how things go.

Go to yon jail, and walk through the wards, and mark the men with heavy over-hanging brows, men whom you would not like to meet at night, and there are sinners there. Go to the Reformatories, and note those who have betrayed a rampant juvenile depravity, and you will see sinners there. Go across the seas to the place where a man will gnaw a bone upon which is reeking human flesh, and there is a sinner there. Go where you will, you need not ransack earth to find sinners, for they are common enough; you may find them in every lane and street of every city, and town, and village, and hamlet. It is for such that Jesus died. If you will select me the grossest specimen of humanity, if he be but born of woman, I will have hope of him yet, because Jesus Christ is come to seek and to save sinners. Electing love has selected some of the worst to be made the best. Pebbles of the brook grace turns into jewels for the crown-royal. Worthless dross he transforms into pure gold. Redeeming love has set apart many of the worst of mankind to be the reward of the Saviour\u2019s passion. Effectual grace calls forth many of the vilest of the vile to sit at the table of mercy, and therefore let none despair. \nReader, by that love looking out of Jesus\u2019 tearful eyes, by that love streaming from those bleeding wounds, by that faithful love, that strong love, that pure, disinterested, and abiding love; by the heart and by the bowels of the Saviour\u2019s compassion, we conjure you turn not away as though it were nothing to you; but believe on him and you shall be saved. Trust your soul with him and he will bring you to his Father\u2019s right hand in glory everlasting. \nEvening \u201cI am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.\u201d \u2014 1 Corinthians 9:22 \nPaul\u2019s great object was not merely to instruct and to improve, but to save. Anything short of this would have disappointed him; he would have men renewed in heart, forgiven, sanctified, in fact, saved. Have our Christian labours been aimed at anything below this great point? Then let us amend our ways, for of what avail will it be at the last great day to have taught and moralized men if they appear before God unsaved? Blood-red will our skirts be if through life we have sought inferior objects, and forgotten that men needed to be saved. Paul knew the ruin of man\u2019s natural state, and did not try to educate him, but to save him; he saw men sinking to hell, and did not talk of refining them, but of saving from the wrath to come. To compass their salvation, he gave himself up with untiring zeal to telling abroad the gospel, to warning and beseeching men to be reconciled to God. His prayers were importunate and his labours incessant. To save souls was his consuming passion, his ambition, his calling. He became a servant to all men, toiling for his race, feeling a woe within him if he preached not the gospel. He laid aside his preferences to prevent prejudice; he submitted his will in things indifferent, and if men would but receive the gospel, he raised no questions about forms or ceremonies: the gospel was the one all-important business with him. If he might save some he would be content. This was the crown for which he strove, the sole and sufficient reward of all his labours and self-denials. Dear reader, have you and I lived to win souls at this noble rate? Are we possessed with the same all-absorbing desire? If not, why not? Jesus died for sinners, cannot we live for them? Where is our tenderness? Where our love to Christ, if we seek not his honour in the salvation of men? O that the Lord would saturate us through and through with an undying zeal for the souls of men. \nSpurgeon, C.

(PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nTopConsumerReviews.com recently gave their top ranking to Blue Nile, a market leader among online retailers of Diamonds . \nChoosing a diamond is an exciting experience. From a classic pair of solitaire studs, to a one-of-a-kind wedding set, having the perfect diamond can make all the difference between a treasured heirloom and jewelry that collects dust in a box. This search for the best stone takes into account such factors as size, certification, symmetry, color, and, of course, price. However, the majority of retailers in brick-and-mortar locations carry a limited selection, leaving some shoppers frustrated. Fortunately, the widest array of loose diamonds, as well as stones already in settings, is available online. This allows even the most discriminating shoppers the opportunity to find the ideal gemstone for their needs - often at prices that are considerably lower than their local jeweler. \n\u201cBlue Nile once again proves itself as the best online source for certified diamonds,\u201d explained Brian Dolezal, of TopConsumerReviews.com, LLC. \u201cEvery year, their selection expands, now reaching an all-time high of more than 175,000 stones from which to choose in every imaginable shape, color, and quality. Their prices have a wide range in order to meet every customer\u2019s needs, from an extremely affordable $330 to an impressive $4 million. No matter how you look at it, Blue Nile is the only store that offers that level of selection, and their guarantee ensures that customers are completely happy with their purchase. Between their excellent shopping experience and their solid reputation, including an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau, Blue Nile is our top pick among online retailers of Diamonds.

Today and everyday, HRC is proud to join forces with United We Dream, Center for Community Change, SEIU and many others to stand with all Dreamers and calls on Congress to pass a clean DREAM Act.\u201d \nHRC President Chad Griffin said: \u201cHRC continues to stand with more than 800,000 of our neighbors, friends, and family members whose livelihoods are being threatened by the Trump-Pence administration\u2019s open assault on Dreamers and immigrants. In this country, we share a belief that a person\u2019s circumstances at birth, or where their life takes them as a child, shouldn\u2019t determine their ability to pursue the American dream. We urge Congress to protect these innocent Dreamers from the Trump-Pence administration\u2019s heartless and cruel attacks.\u201d \nThis year, the Trump-Pence administration announced the cruel decision to end DACA and created an arbitrary deadline for Congress to impose a legislative fix. The announcement is ending a five-year-old program that has allowed hundreds of thousands of young people who were brought to the U.S. as minors to stay in the only country they\u2019ve ever known. Every day, more and more dreamers are having their DACA status expire. \nThis week, HRC joined with 127 LGBTQ and allied organizations in a letter calling on Congress to pass a clean Dream Act before the end of the year. The organizations made clear that Dreamers are a part of the American family and help make our communities vibrant. \nOver 75,000 Dreamers identify as LGBTQ and over 36,000 of them have benefited from DACA. For these young people, the threat of deportation can hold an additional element of uncertainty, since they may be sent to countries with poor LGBTQ human rights records. For example, in El Salvador, transgender women have faced such a tremendous upsurge in violence that the United Nations called for an investigation into the situation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aaron rodriguez", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alejandro avil\u00e9s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump-pence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chad griffin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hrc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deferred action for childhood arrivals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united we dream", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seiu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for community change", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "capitol hil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el salvador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump-pence", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:05.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "60ad6abf5617a458c9760fcc94d0b5859cdd32ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRCMflswLAX00I.8VOkN2sxbbYS7IfsDBMnLpfyAmCESK7m.OIYab45ibR0lb9e9JMqXoWfTJyqRHvuW9tsW5cdbO7VXxWQ5X9IxU1RMgysUZYeawnb9ox2", "site_full": "allyfortis.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://allyfortis.wordpress.com/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Ally Fortis", "title": "Q&A: Can long-time masturbation cause gonorrhea?", "title_full": "Q&A: Can long-time masturbation cause gonorrhea?", "published": "2017-12-06T17:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://allyfortis.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/qa.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "60ad6abf5617a458c9760fcc94d0b5859cdd32ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRCMflswLAX00I.8VOkN2sxbbYS7IfsDBMnLpfyAmCESK7m.OIYab45ibR0lb9e9JMqXoWfTJyqRHvuW9tsW5cdbO7VXxWQ5X9IxU1RMgysUZYeawnb9ox2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ally Fortis", "published": "2017-12-06T17:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Q&A: Can long-time masturbation cause gonorrhea?", "text": "Enter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email. \nJoin 405 other followers 3,784 hits Click to buy my motivational clothing collection Click the image to see more designs & colors.

Next year's budget for health, welfare and employment has been finalized at 144.7 trillion won. Although the welfare budget increased by 11.7% compared to this year, the budget is 1.5 trillion won smaller than the initial government proposal (146.2 trillion won). The child benefits, which the government had planned to give to all children under the age of six, will be handed out to a selective group, according to the negotiations between the ruling and opposition lawmakers, and the basic pension will increase in September, instead of April next year.\nMeanwhile, the budget for SOC facilities\ufffdthe government proposed a 20% cut from this year's budget\ufffdincreased by 1.3 trillion won reaching 19 trillion won after lawmakers included budgets reflecting requests from their constituencies. This is the largest increase in the SOC budget during the budget review at the National Assembly in eight years, since the Lee Myung-bak government promoted the Four Major Rivers Project in 2009. Even when we consider that the SOC budget usually increases from the government draft in the process of the parliamentary budget review, this year, the budget jumped nearly three to four times more than in the past. From 2010 until last year, the gap between the government draft and the lawmakers' decision was usually somewhere between 100 billion and 400 billion won. This year's budget goes against this age, which calls for the end of the glory days of civil engineering, which is distant from the lives of the citizens.\nOne hundred billion won more was allocated to the Gwang -Gangjin Expressway, and tens of billions of won more was allocated to the Saemangeum-Jeonju Expressway and the Hamyang-Ulsan Expressway. Lawmakers allocated budgets for the feasibility studies for the KTX Gumi, Gimjae Station, the extension of Seoul Metro Line 1 (Cheonan Station-Independence Hall), and Sapgyo Station on the West Coast Line, which were not even included in the original government draft. Of course, not all of these projects are unnecessary. But will the citizens tolerate the behavior of the lawmakers, who were so stingy on welfare, reducing the number of children eligible for child benefits and delaying the payment of the basic pension, but who now want to spend the taxpayers' money on more roads?\nThe ruling and opposition party floor leaders and administrators of the budget committee, who are the key figures in the budget discussions, were at it again this year, securing budgets for their constituencies. Lee Yong-ho, head of policy in the People's Party proudly posted on his Facebook that he practically threatened to scrap the entire agreement, when a senior official from the Ministry of Strategy and Finance said that it was difficult to reflect local projects in the budget.\nWitnessing the harmful effects of the Lee Myung-bak government's Four Major Rivers Project, the South Korean society reached an agreement that it was now time to break away from a \"civil engineering nation.\" What's more, it is now time to firmly secure a welfare safety net to prepare for the rise of the fourth industrial revolution. When the fourth industrial revolution, which utilizes technology at a new level\ufffdbig data, cloud, Internet of things, and artificial intelligence\ufffdin production, goes full throttle, the number of jobs can decrease and the gap between the rich and the poor is likely to increase.\nA National Assembly with these challenges in mind should have seriously debated how to use the taxpayers' money to improve the quality of life. Instead, if it decides to use the money to pave more roads in addition to the roads already overflowing in the local constituencies and boast of this as an accomplishment, this National Assembly is not one preparing for our society's future.\n\u25b6 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc2e0\ubb38 SNS [\ud2b8\uc704\ud130] [\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ubd81]\n\u25b6 [\uc778\uae30 \ubb34\ub8cc\ub9cc\ud654 \ubcf4\uae30]\n\u00a9\uacbd\ud5a5\uc2e0\ubb38( www.khan.co.kr ), \ubb34\ub2e8\uc804\uc7ac \ubc0f \uc7ac\ubc30\ud3ec \uae08\uc9c0", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://facebook.com/kyunghyangshinmun", "http://twitter.com/kyunghyang", "http://imgnews.naver.net/image/032/2017/12/07/0002836895_001_20171207154036445.jpg?type=w540", "http://sports.khan.co.kr/comics/", "http://www.khan.co.kr/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lee yong-ho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee myung-bak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national assembly", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "seoul metro line", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gimjae station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of strategy and finance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "people's party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hamyang-ulsan expressway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gwang -gangjin expressway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ktx gumi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sapgyo station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saemangeum-jeonju expressway", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:07.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d22212193d3a0ea84243a8dc2def53eb29b13f3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlRNQbuGr0BZhuzaatL7ciY", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ - International - 4chan", "title": "/ausnz/", "title_full": "/int/ - /ausnz/ - International - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T12:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 99, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "571311bdf828c5d8a02fb16c35d3916cf7765726", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlRNQbuGr0BZrDLIJ2s73je8TloOMh.ax8-", "ord_in_thread": 52, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>82716581\n>>82716574\nokay sorry\n>>82716590\nwell uh...
