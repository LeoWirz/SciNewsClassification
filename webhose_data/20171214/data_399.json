As already said by travelkat88 you are still going to end up waiting for your bags to come on to the baggage line. Personally, I just use the Visa on Arrival and fill out the forms in flight and come prepared with an appropriately sized photo and correct USD$ and I fly through the visa process followed immediately by immigration control. Just looked at my current passport and note that it contains 33 Cambodia Visa on Arrival visas so it must be working well for me as a very regular traveler to Cambodia . Can't be bothered to check my previous passports which would contain similar numbers of VOAs. As a frequent traveler, and not just to Cambodia, I use the Australian 70 + visa page passport. Back again in Cambodia in February and April 2018 and fully intend to use VOA. Ditto for August and November visits which not yet ticketed. Best regards.

Rochas. PHOTO: TWITTER \nThe crisis confronting the Imo State House of Assembly has become messier with the suspension of its Majority Leader, Lugard Igwe (All Progressives Congress, APC, Owerri Municipal), for two weeks. \nBesides, the Deputy Majority Leader, Kennedy Ibe (Obowo Constituency), has been removed. Also, all the principal officers of the House were relieved of their appointments. \nSpeaker of the 27-member Assembly, Acho Ihim, who announced the suspension on the floor yesterday, said the action was sequel to \u2018\u2019intrigues and counter-intrigues in the House.\u2019\u2019 \nDr. Uche Ogwuwike (Ikeduru Constituency) and Chinedu Offor (Onuimo Constituency) were announced as the new majority leader and deputy majority leader respectively. \nHowever, the duo, Osuji and Ibe, have tendered their resignation letters, positing their reasons as \u2018\u2019collective interest of the House.\u2019\u2019 \nChief Whip of the Assembly, Marcel Odunze (Orlu, APC), also tendered his resignation letter and was quickly replaced with Arthur Egwim, (Ideato APC) \nSeventeen members of the Assembly, The Guardian gathered, allegedly boycotted the sitting/proceeding but observed from the press gallery. \nHeavy presence of the security personnel at the premises of the complex led to the lawmakers to converge at the Speaker\u2019s Lodge afterwards. \nThe Minority Leader (Ahiazu Mbaise Constituency), Ken Agbim, who briefed journalists at the Speaker\u2019s lodge, chided the heavy presence of security operatives at the Assembly. \nHe said the action of the lawmakers was in defence of democracy. \n\u201cWe needed some clarifications from the executive concerning the budget and it is clear our questions did not go down well with the executive. \n\u2018\u2019We believe what happened today is an attack on democracy and for the first time in a long time, we are trying to ensure our nascent democracy does not suffer,\u201d he said.

It reinforced its refusal to join a new coalition after Merkel's talks with two smaller parties collapsed last month.\nHowever, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made clear that he doesn't want a new election, and Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz reversed course.\nAt a previously scheduled party congress Thursday, Schulz is seeking members' approval for a resolution approving talks on \"whether and in what form\" the Social Democrats can support a new government.\nHowever, some members \u2014 including the party's youth wing \u2014 want to specifically rule out another coalition, leaving only a minority government or a new election as options. Merkel has said she is \"very skeptical\" about leading a minority government, which hasn't yet been tried in post-World War II Germany.\nSocial Democrat parliamentary group chief Andrea Nahles said the collapse of Merkel's talks with other parties produced an unexpected new situation.\n\"We can't play the ostrich and stick our heads in the sand,\" she said.\nThe Social Democrats have been part of Germany's government for 15 of the past 19 years \u2014 first leading a center-left government under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder from 1998 to 2005, then twice governing in a \"grand coalition\" under Merkel, from 2005 to 2009 and again from 2013 until now.\nThe party suffered historically poor election results after both Merkel coalitions, with support slumping to a post-war low of 20.5 percent in September.\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Reid | History of Race and Resistance in Popular Culture | Coventry University Lecturer", "text": "Tweet On December 25 th 2016, 120 Odeon cinemas opened across the nation to screen a new Star Wars film, Rogue One . On many levels, the very idea seems to offend traditional British sensibilities \u2013 unlike in the United States where Christmas day screenings are common, in the UK this is a relatively rare occurrence. Why would anyone, so this very British logic goes, want to abandon the traditional trappings of turkey, family, and Brussels sprouts to attend so something so every day ? The offerings being made by Odeon this Christmas hint at an answer. For the second year in a row, audiences will have a new Star Wars movie to watch on the big screen and, for many, that franchise, with its cornucopia of toys, video games, costumes, and home video releases, is as much a part of the modern experience of Christmas as crackers and candy canes. It may have nothing to do with Jesus or Santa, but countless children have received countless Star Wars toys over more than three decades. And they, in turn, have grown-up, had children (perhaps even grandchildren) of their own that they have showered in plastic light sabres and Tie Fighters. An angel may sit atop the tree, but for adults and children alike, there is a reasonable chance that, hidden under layers of paper, Luke, Leia, Finn, Rey, or Vader lurk below it. The Star Wars-ification of Christmas started almost as soon as the first film in the franchise was released in 1977. Despite being a summer release, it utterly arrested its audience\u2019s imagination. Children, in particular, were attracted to its fantastic battles, the mysterious Force and, of course, the ubiquitous light sabre. As a result, interest in the film remained high during its first Christmas when toy manufacturer Kenner, unable to keep with demand, had to start selling empty Star Wars boxes which promised a later delivery of toys. Spurred on by the release of two direct sequels, a deluge of Star Wars toys helped to define childhoods throughout the early 1980s whilst other media forms helped to exponentially extend the life of the franchise and its presence under the Christmas tree. Home video releases helped to keep the original films alive whilst innumerable spin-offs, videogames, and novels \u2013some of which have been New York Times Bestsellers\u2013 helped to expand the fictional universe whilst providing new toy ranges and products to be unwrapped years after the original film made its debut. From the spin-off novels and videogames of the 1990s to the prequels and their marketing deluge, Star Wars has succeeded where Teddy Ruxpin, He-Man, and Tamagotchi have failed. Unlike the comparatively short lifecycle of most childhood phenomena, Star Wars has crossed the trans-generational line, putting it into an exclusive bracket where it is joined by just a handful of other toys and media franchises \u2013 and perhaps with the exception of Lego, no other childhood phenomenon has reached quite the critical mass Star Wars has. Star Wars became soft propaganda for the millennial generation\u2019s ever-more distant youth. Star Wars is not something which is merely enjoyed. It is something which is ravenously consumed by viewers who excitedly project themselves onto the characters they see on screen. Dialogue from the films has become a part of the popular vernacular and the imagery from the movies is now so iconic that the merest hint of a recognisable silhouette in a new trailer is enough to generate weeks of excited chatter in playgrounds and around the water cooler. Christmas Day screenings of Rogue One should not come as too much of a surprise \u2013 Star Wars has been colonising Christmas for decades.

He was awarded Best Voice Actor in the Ad Congress 2003 in Baguio City for the Radio Commercial Wikang Bansa where he imitated the voice of Mike Enriquez.

The move came just hours after Trump visited Utah Monday, where he announced his plan to open up protected federal lands to mining, logging, drilling and other forms of extraction.

AMY GOODMAN : \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want\u201d by the Rolling Stones, the song that was played at President Trump\u2019s Utah announcement yesterday. This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I\u2019m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz\u00e1lez. JUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Well, five Native American tribes have joined to file what they are calling an historic lawsuit against Donald Trump, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and several other members of the Trump administration. The move came just hours after the president visited Utah Monday, where he came to unveil his plan to open up protected federal lands to mining, logging, drilling and other forms of extraction. The plan calls for shrinking the 1.3 million-acre Bears Ears Monument by more than 80 percent and splitting it into two separate areas. Trump would slash the state\u2019s 1.9 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by 50 percent. Bears Ears National Monument was created in 2016 by then-President Barack Obama. President Bill Clinton created the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in 1996. The national monuments were designated under the century-old Antiquities Act, a law meant to protect sacred sites, artifacts and historical objects. Trump criticized the law on Monday. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Your timeless bond with the outdoors should not be replaced with the whims of regulators thousands and thousands of miles away. They don\u2019t know your land. And truly, they don\u2019t care for your land like you do. But from now on, that won\u2019t matter. I\u2019ve come to Utah to take a very historic action to reverse federal overreach and restore the rights of this land to your citizens. \u2026 Therefore, today, on the recommendation of Secretary Zinke, and with the wise counsel of Senator Hatch, Senator Lee and the many others, I will sign two presidential proclamations. These actions will modify the national monuments designations of both Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante. AMY GOODMAN : President Trump\u2019s announcement follows a months-long review by the Interior Department to identify which of 27 monuments designated by past presidents should be rescinded or resized. The Native American Rights Fund filed the lawsuit on behalf of the Navajo Nation, Pueblo of Zuni and the Hopi, Ute Indian and Ute Mountain Ute Tribes. The five tribes pushed for the creation of and co-managed the Bears Ears Monument, which they consider sacred. Conservation groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Wilderness Society and the Sierra Club, also filed a legal challenge, arguing Trump did not have the authority to dramatically shrink the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. For more, we go to two guests. Bob Deans is with us in Washington, D.C., director of strategic engagement at the Natural Resources Defense Council, author of Reckless: The Political Assault on the American Environment and co-author of The World We Create: A Message of Hope for a Planet in Peril . And on the phone from Montrose, Colorado, Regina Lopez-Whiteskunk, a member of the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe and former co-chair of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition. We welcome you both to Democracy Now! We\u2019re going to begin right now with Regina Lopez-Whiteskunk. Can you talk about the significance of this announcement that President Trump made yesterday, in actually making history, announcing the largest rollback of federal land protection in U.S. history? REGINA LOPEZ - WHITESKUNK : Yes. Thank you for having me on the show this morning. And it\u2019s rather disturbing, considering that this is the first time that a president has rolled back a significant amount. And what the landscape means to Native Americans\u2014and all citizens\u2014is it\u2019s a representation of public land, which means the public should have access. Whether it\u2019s Native Americans, whether it\u2019s the rock climbers, whether it\u2019s the archaeologists or the paleontologists, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s public land. It has the story of our people. It has a story of time. It has much more than just the extraction industry would like to take from it. And the five tribes that came together, we came together in a sense of healing. We healed our own relationships from within. And as soon as we were able to reach that point of being able to move on in a common goal to seek protection and preservation for our future, then we can move on to try to heal other relationships, such as with the federal government. And that\u2019s what we did. We achieved so much more than just the land and the protection. We achieved a sense of healing from within, from a very humanistic side of everything. It isn\u2019t just about seeking that almighty dollar or being able to fuel the homes with such energy resources out there. It\u2019s about taking care of one another and being good neighbors, being good stewards of the land, because that\u2019s what our ancestors have told us through the stories that have been left on the walls of the canyons. JUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Well, Regina Lopez-Whiteskunk, I wanted to ask you about President Trump\u2019s claim that this is actually an act to open up the lands for use by the public and the people of Utah, when, in reality, those lands can be visited by any American right now, right? REGINA LOPEZ - WHITESKUNK : They can. But here\u2019s the reality of that. By opening up\u2014and although he\u2019s saying that in words, when we open up to industry, the extractive industry, they acquire leases, they acquire their permits. Once these companies come out, we don\u2019t have access to those. Plus the lands become contaminated. Then there\u2019s other environmental threats, threats to something as basic as water. Out here in the West, we don\u2019t have a lot of water. But these are questions, these are concerns and threats, that nobody is talking about, because everybody\u2019s focused on the extractive industry and opening up for economic development. They\u2019re forgetting about those basic elements in life: water, air, the animals, the people. AMY GOODMAN : Let\u2019s bring Bob Deans into this discussion, Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, D.C. Can you talk about why President Trump has chosen these two protected areas and what this means for parks and protected areas all over the country? Start with Bears Ears, Bob. BOB DEANS : Sure, Amy. Thank you so much. Well, if you look at Bears Ears, this is land that the oil, gas and coal industry wants access to. And if you take a look at the map, you see that millions of\u2014that a huge amount of this property that Trump has stripped protections away from is exactly where those resources lie. So that\u2019s what this is about. This is about taking nearly 2 million acres of public lands, lands that belong to you and me, Amy, and handing it over for toxic pollution and industrial ruin, for the sake of profits, for coal, oil, uranium and natural gas.

Live in Detroit, available on vinyl for the first time. The collection will also include a newly created bonus ten-inch EP Berry Christmas, featuring four holiday-themed classics on \"Rudolph-Red\" vinyl, with one song on vinyl for the first time as well. Berry's classic recordings for Chicago's seminal Chess label have been extensively anthologized in the CD era. But for many Berry devotees, the two-LP vinyl collection The Great Twenty-Eight remains both a sentimental favorite and a definitive document of Berry's musical genius. It's no wonder that The Great Twenty-Eight was ranked number 21 on Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time,\" the highest-ranking hits compilation on that list. For those interested in the original 28-track edition of The Great Twenty-Eight, it is now back in print in its original two-LP format for the first time since its initial release in 1982. The Great Twenty-Eight: Super Deluxe Edition also includes a handsome 12\" x 12\" book featuring a special introductory essay by Keith Richards, a new essay by best-selling author and SiriusXM host Alan Light, complementing Michael Lydon's liner notes from the original version of The Great Twenty-Eight, and reminiscences from DJ Lee Alan, plus complete U.S. single, album and EP discographies.

I was very happy that I was going to someone from my country. But it was a lie. \n\u201cThe Nigerian they took me to locked me in a cell and told me to call my mother and ask for N60, 000. The man said he would sell me to a connection house if my family did not get the money. I called to inform my mother and the trafficker who facilitated my journey from Nigeria. \n\u201cBut the trafficker spoke with them on the phone and told them the amount they demanded was too small. They increased it to N200, 000. My mother paid into an account after they provided her with the account number over the phone. \n\u201cThe Nigerian said if I wanted to cross the sea, I had to pay him again. But when we got to the seaside, he sold me again.\u201d \nAnother Edo State indigene, Sunday Anyaegbunam, left Nigeria along with his wife in April. \nHe said during their nine-day journey through the desert, they were sold twice by Nigerians. \nAccording to him, when their Nigerian \u201cburger\u201d (trafficker) sold them to another set of Libyan traffickers at Agadez, Niger, the traffickers sold him and his wife to a Nigerian who took them to Sabha, Libya, where they were separated in different cells. \n\u201cWe were made to contact our families on the phone and I had to ensure the payment of N400, 000 for my release and N300, 000 for my wife,\u201d Anyaegbunam said. \nHe added \u201cThe Nigerians selling people in Libya are more wicked than many of the Arabs. I have never seen people so heartless as the Nigerians who bought and sold me. \n\u201cThere are many of them in Agadez and Sabha, who are making so much money from selling their own people. But there are other West Africans doing the business too. \n\u201cWhen you approach them and say, \u2018Please, my brother, help me.\u2019 They would tell you, \u201cNo brother in the jungle.\u201d \nA 25-year-old woman, Esosa Osas, who was in Libya for six months, said she also met many Nigerians selling their countrymen. \n\u201cYou dare not talk to them, else they would beat you and lock you up. They sell women for 5,000 dinars and men for 4, 000 dinars.

Using Opta data, we trace the development of a famous old rivalry during the Premier League era. \nRecord men Rooney and Aguero lead the way \nOver the past year, Wayne Rooney and Sergio Aguero have established themselves as the all-time leading scorers in United and City history. \nIt therefore comes as little surprise that no players have been more prolific during the modern history of the Manchester derby, with Rooney netting against City on eight occasions in the Premier League before returning to Everton during the close season. He also scored in the Toffees\u2019 1-1 draw at the Etihad Stadium in August. \nAguero\u2019s seven goals put him level with Eric Cantona \u2013 City\u2019s tormentor-in-chief during the Red Devils\u2019 golden period in the mid-1990s. WATCH Sergio Aguero won the Manchester derby for Man City with this superb individual effort #OnThisDay in 2013\u2026 https://t.co/dGktZiEZaK \n\u2014 Premier League (@premierleague) April 8, 2015 \nPaul Scholes scored the only goal deep into stoppage time at the Etihad in April 2010 to bring up five league goals in the derby. \nUnited duo Ruud van Nistelrooy and Andrei Kanchelskis hit four apiece. Three of the Russian winger\u2019s haul came in a 5-0 demolition of Brian Horton\u2019s Blues. \nCity strikers Niall Quinn and Edin Dzeko also have four to their name. All of Dzeko\u2019s goals came in victories at Old Trafford, while Quinn never finished on the winning side. \nLongest winning runs and losing streaks \nUnited\u2019s mastery of the Premier League at the end of the last century was reflected in derby-day dominance. Alex Ferguson\u2019s side beat City seven times in succession between 1993 and 2000. \nThe Blues endured spells outside of the top flight towards the end of that run and a 3-1 victory in the final derby at their old Maine Road home in November 2002 represented a first win over United in more than 13 years. #OnThisDay in 1994, Eric Cantona\u2019s first-half double secured derby success for @ManUtd . More: http://t.co/bFZwANbYPB pic.twitter.com/tqeVui7BHJ \n\u2014 Premier League (@premierleague) April 23, 2015 \nBetween 2013 and 2014, as Ferguson\u2019s glorious reign gave way to the less-celebrated tenures of David Moyes and Louis van Gaal, City were able to string together a Premier League best of four wins in succession. \nBiggest results \nThe Kanchelskis-inspired rout in November 1994 remains United\u2019s largest win over City in the Premier League. Later in the 1994-95 season they also eased to a 3-0 triumph at Maine Road. \nAn infamously attired Mario Balotelli set the ball rolling for the Blues\u2019 thumping 6-1 win at Old Trafford in October 2011, the enigmatic Italian completing a brace before substitute Dzeko did likewise. \nKevin Keegan and Manuel Pellegrini both oversaw 4-1 derby drubbings during their time in charge of City, both on home turf. \nMost appearances and a foot in both camps \nRyan Giggs\u2019 incredible longevity saw him take in 29 Premier League Manchester derbies. Rooney and Scholes played in 21 each, with Rio Ferdinand racking up 20. \nDespite his persistent injury struggles, City club captain Vincent Kompany has faced United on 15 occasions, once more than long-serving predecessor Richard Dunne and Joe Hart. One of our best ever strikers..? On this day in 2009, we signed Carlos Tevez! #mcfc pic.twitter.com/JxWYJtWwLe \n\u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity) July 13, 2017 \nFive players have represented both clubs in the Premier League. All of them were at the Red Devils first and only Carlos Tevez, with 113 appearances set against 63, played more times for their arch-rivals. \nPeter Schmeichel, Andy Cole and Owen Hargreaves all spent a solitary season with United\u2019s rivals, while Kanchelskis took in a late-career loan spell as City were relegated in 2000-01. \nPep v Jose \nA managerial rivalry that became one of the fiercest in football during their spells at Barcelona and Real Madrid, Guardiola and Mourinho will joust for the 20th time this weekend. \nCity\u2019s 2-1 victory in the corresponding fixture last season was Guardiola\u2019s eighth win over his old adversary, while United\u2019s 1-0 triumph on the way to lifting the EFL Cup was only the fourth time Mourinho finished 90 minutes on top. \nApril\u2019s drab goalless stalemate at the Etihad was the seventh draw shared by the duo.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

This Republican tax scam and all this kind of stuff. \nLet me share with you a very brief quote. This is from a piece by Robert McElvaine in the Washington Post, but the quote is from William Jennings Bryan. \nWilliam Jennings Bryan in 1896 gave a speech called the \" Cross of Gold \" speech. Now, Eisenhower somewhat reprised this in 1953 with his Cross of Iron speech. \nWilliam Jennings Bryan spoke in 1896 about essentially the difference between the Republican idea and the Democratic idea. He said: \n\"There are those who believe that if you will only legislate to make the well-to-do prosperous their prosperity will leak through on those below.\" \n1896 he said this, trickle-down economics. \n\"The Democratic idea, however, has been that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous their prosperity will find its way up through every class which rests upon them.\" \nPetty straightforward stuff, right? \nIn his letter to his brother Edgar in 1954 Eisenhower said, \"Should any political party attempt to abolish social security ... Their number is negligible and they are stupid.\" He was specifically calling out the Hunt Brothers, but he also he also warned us about the whole military-industrial complex. \nDwight Eisenhower gave a speech January 1961. Of course, the new president is sworn in on January 20th of the year following the election, so this is the election of 1960. Eisenhower's party lost.

border\nPicture: Daily News\nCustoms at Aranyaprathet said they had found 50,350 unused DTAC SIM cards in a trolley left at the border.\nEarlier officials had received a tip off that a consignment of SIM cards was being smuggled across by a Cambodian man.\nInspections had therefore been stepped up.\nThe trolley containing three large bags was found Thursday after it was abandoned on Wednesday.\nCustoms suspect a Cambodian criminal gang is behind the delivery and are coordinating with their counterparts across the border to find who left them there.\nSource: Daily News\n-- \u00a9
