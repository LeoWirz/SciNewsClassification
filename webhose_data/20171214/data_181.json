The PSAR, Developed by Welles Wilder, is designed to determine the point in time when there emerges a better than average probability of a trend switching directions. This is a common tool used by traders and investors to try to gauge potential reversal of a trend. \nThe parabolic SAR is shown on the charts as a series of small \u2018dots\u2019 that are placed either above or below the price. When the price is trending to the upside, the dots are below the price action and when the price is trending to the downside, the dots are above the price action. The basic use of the Parabolic SAR is to buy when the dots move below the price bars (signaling an uptrend) and sell/short-sell when the dots move above the price bars (signaling a downtrend). \nInvestors and traders using technical analysis to examine stocks may be interested in taking a look at the ATR or Average True Range. Currently, Forum Energy Technologies Inc (FET) has a 14-day ATR of 0.61. The Average True Range is an investor tool used to measure stock volatility. The ATR is not used to figure out price direction, just to measure volatility. The ATR is an indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder. Wilder has developed multiple indicators that are still quite popular in today\u2019s investing landscape. The general interpretation of the ATR is the higher the ATR value, the higher the volatility. \nThe Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is another technical indicator worth checking out. Forum Energy Technologies Inc (FET) currently has a 14 day Williams %R of -53.45. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. The Williams %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator except it is plotted upside-down. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. If the indicator travels under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. Chart analysts may also use the indicator to project possible price reversals and to define trends. \nThe Average Directional Index or ADX is technical analysis indicator used to discern if a market is trending or not trending. The ADX alone measures trend strength but not direction. Using the ADX with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) may help determine the direction of the trend as well as the overall momentum. Many traders will use the ADX alongside other indicators in order to help spot proper trading entry/exit points. Currently, the 14-day ADX for Forum Energy Technologies Inc (FET) is 17.28. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would signal a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would indicate an extremely strong trend. \nTraders may be leaning on technical stock analysis to help with investing decisions. Forum Energy Technologies Inc (FET) currently   46.21. Despite the name, CCI can be used on other investment tools such as stocks. The CCI was designed to typically stay within the reading of -100 to +100. Traders may use the indicator to determine stock trends or to identify overbought/oversold conditions. A CCI reading above +100 would imply that the stock is overbought and possibly ready for a correction. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally. \nTraders are paying renewed attention to shares of Forum Energy Technologies Inc (FET). The current 14-day RSI is presently sitting at 50.83, the 7-day is 48.23, and the 3-day is 31.92. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index is a popular oscillating indicator among traders and investors. The RSI operates in a range-bound area with values between 0 and 100. When the RSI line moves up, the stock may be experiencing strength. The opposite is the case when the RSI line is heading lower. Different time periods may be used when using the RSI indicator. The RSI may be more volatile using a shorter period of time. Many traders keep an eye on the 30 and 70 marks on the RSI scale. A move above 70 is widely considered to show the stock as overbought, and a move below 30 would indicate that the stock may be oversold. Traders may use these levels to help identify stock price reversals.

What have you bought from the empowr marketplace today? # I'm going to close a whole boatload of loops today \u2013 how about you? See more options \n\n\nGuide to earning on empowr Did you know? You are earning in empowr with the help of ad credits.\nHowever, you have not yet watched the quick ad credits tutorial video.\nWhy not take a moment to watch it now and better understand your options? \n\nYou earn when your posts get viewed.\nYour earnings increase when more people view your posts, so you want your posts shared as much as possible.\nThe more people you \"close the loop\" with, the more people share your posts (and the more you earn).\nWhat is \"closing the loop\" and how do I do it? \"Closing the loop\" with someone means sharing some of their posts (which helps them earn).\nTo close the loop with someone, follow the instructions inside the loop:\nAs you can see, to close the loop with Manuela, you share 2 of her posts. After you do that, you (meaning your profile and posts) will be presented to her so she can close the loop back with you (by sharing your posts) which helps you earn. The moment you close the loop with someone, you've made it their turn to help you earn. (They won't be presented to you again, until they close the loop back with you).\nSummary: The more people you \"close the loop\" with, the more people will share your posts and the more you earn. \n\nHow to maximize your earnings QUESTION: For best results, who are the best people for me to close the loop with?\nANSWER: Those most likely to close the loop back with you.\nQUESTION: Well, then, who's most likely to close the loop back with me?\nANSWER: The next person presented to you, after you click right (or on mobile, click \"Next\" or swipe left).\nSummary: For best results and to maximize your earnings, instead of closing the loop with random people, click right or \"Next\" to be presented with the next best person for you.\nBonus tips: Don't fall out: Have you noticed that only people are presented to you that have posted recently? If you don't post anything new, you'll stop being presented to anyone. So ABP (Always Be Posting) to make sure you are always being presented to others.\nClosing the loop gets you seen: People aren't presented to you again until they've closed the loop back with you. On your end, that means that until you close the loop with someone, you won't be shown to them again. So try to close the loop with each person presented before moving on.\nLocation accuracy matters: In the coming months, you'll notice people shown to you will get closer and closer to you geographically as more people join empowr. This will enable you to meet more of them in-person. It will also enable you to receive services from them (paying with your empowr earnings) and totally wipe out shipping costs when you buy products from them.\nSo why not accelerate the process by inviting people you know? You earn $20 for each completed account if you're the first to invite them.\nInvite now \u25ba Summary: Make sure your location is accurate or you'll be missing out on much of the value from the trusted relationships you're building.\nThe end goal Your goal in empowr should be to have a thousand people in your circle that you can trust to help you earn.\nempowr means freedom: Take a moment to imagine having a thousand people in your circle, with each of them also having, on average, a thousand people in their circle:\nYou'll have one million people within only two degrees of separation from yourself; and a billion people within only three degrees \u2014 with each person earning daily, just like you are, and able to purchase with just one click. Anything you choose to sell, Sponsor or promote will almost instantly spread far and wide, enabling financial freedom for you and your loved ones. Your turn: empowr has spent over 15 years building technologies with only one objective in mind: Bringing economic upside to you as opposed to rich investors, corporations and advertisers.

Mumbai Juniorthon where 4000 children are expected to participate this year, aims to promote running as an active lifestyle for children & their families. Launched in 2015, Juniorthon is categorised to accommodate various levels of runners considering age and distance. To support a good cause and promote a healthier future for children, the goal of this marathon is to discourage the ample use of video games, television, fast food and visits to shopping malls by children. The children participating in Juniorthon will take to the streets of Mumbai, push their limits and conquer a distance as a testament to their physical endurance and mental toughness to fight for this cause. Further, all participants will experience an in-depth training cum prep-up session by Holistic Guru Mickey Mehta, who will teach children to avoid injuries and maintain stamina during the run. 2017 will also see the mark of Juniorthon\u2019s \u2018The Happy Run\u2019, which encourages differently enabled children to participate in a unique 0.5 km inspirational marathon in Mumbai. This year the kids from Indian Cancer Society will also participate in \u2018The Happy Run\u2019. Juniorthon also seeded the concept of running by conducting running workshops at various schools in Mumbai Including Stanislaus, Manickji Cooper, St Theresa\u2019s, RBK International, Learners Academy, and D. G Khetan International School etc. \u201cLack of outdoor activities has led to a rise in childhood obesity & other related diseases in India. Children are more vulnerable to Vitamin D deficiency, depression and chronic weight-related diseases due to their inactive lifestyles. Every child needs to play outdoors for his or her physical, social and emotional wellbeing. Mumbai Juniorthon is all about children running towards a healthier future and supporting a good cause. Juniorthon\u2019s core purpose is to urge children to go outdoors and activate their sedentary lifestyle by giving them an opportunity to set out and accomplish the goal of running,\u201d says Bhavna Mehta, Organiser of Juniorthon. Mumbai Juniorthon is free for all and has tied up with Smile Foundation, an NGO that works towards development & empowerment of children from vulnerable backgrounds via Education & Health Care. The event boasts of a fundraising platform wherein a significant portion of the registration fees will be donated to the NGO. Following the run, Juniorthon will also showcase a special family carnival cum fitness expo with multiple workshops, curated shows, fitness activities and food pop-ups for a great family m\u00eal\u00e9e. \u2022OPENERS: Distance: 0.5 km - 1 Parent + 1 child aged between 5-8 years \u2022BEGINNERS:Distance: 1 km \u2013 Age: 6 to 11 years \u2022AMATEURS: Distance: 2 km - Age: 6 to 13 years \u2022PROS:Distance: 4 km - Age: 11 to 15 years \u2022DIFFERENTLY ABLED: Distance: 0.5 km \u2013 Age: 6 to 15 years The carnival will include stage performances, workshops, and activities.

terrorists abroad should never be let back in UK, minister says Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson (Rick Findler/PA) 15 comments \nBritons who have fought for Islamic State should never be allowed to come back to this country, the Defence Secretary has said. \nGavin Williamson said those who were intent on bringing \u201cdestruction, death and bloodshed\u201d onto the streets of Britain were being \u201chunted down\u201d and that threat \u201celiminated\u201d. \nHe told the Daily Mail: \u201cA dead terrorist can\u2019t cause any harm to Britain.\u201d \nIn October, the terror laws watchdog said authorities should look to \u201creintegrate\u201d the \u201cyoung\u201d and \u201cnaive\u201d jihadis who travel to warzones, rather than prosecute them, on their return to the country. British extremist Mohammed Emwazi known by the nickname \u2018Jihadi John\u2019 was killed in a drone strike \nMax Hill QC, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, spoke of \u201closing a generation\u201d of men and women by automatically using the courts to punish them. \nBut Mr Williamson said the armed forces were working \u201cright across the globe\u201d to ensure jihadis are never able to come back to the country in the first place. \nHe said: \u201cI do not believe that any terrorist, whether they come from this country or any other, should ever be allowed back into this country.\u201d \nMr Williamson told the paper the role of jihadis in foreign fields should not be underestimated, with \u201cmuch of what is done to activate\u201d threats to Britain done in places such as Libya, Iraq and Syria. \nHe added: \u201cOur job in terms of eliminating will not stop this year, will not stop next year, it is something we have got to continue to pursue.\u201d \nHundreds of British citizens are known to have travelled to Syria to fight with Islamist groups during the course of the six-year conflict. \nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is due to deliver a speech on Thursday in which he will praise British efforts around the world to tackle terrorism. \nHe will say: \u201cEvery day around the world I can tell you that British serving men and women are putting their lives at risk to roll up terrorist networks, to expose what they are doing, to thwart them and bring them to justice. \n\u201cThey are making good on what the Prime Minister has rightly called the unconditional commitment of the British people to the security of our European friends, not just in this continent but beyond.\u201d \nOn Tuesday, the director general of MI5 told the Cabinet that a total of nine Islamist terrorist plots have been thwarted in the UK over the past year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "g", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rick findler/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavin williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boris johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed emwazi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max hill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "defence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daily mail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cabinet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:08.034+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc06fc1fd59efc1867753bca24028cf27d791d7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.lheEjjUjSl2qfz3HtkoSbYrxZCieas7YCVLLywsfhGpNH1tOoBAHpw9wBjKBA7A2C6tAdPHPXL5m.JyD4xf8sAv7MVkozbKQQhV7QnVrQkw--", "site_full": "www.auditiondate.in", "site": "auditiondate.in", "site_section": "http://www.auditiondate.in", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "AuditionDate", "title": "Bigg Boss Winners List 2017", "title_full": "Bigg Boss Winners List 2017", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81a8c971683fd23baad3cfb1c106e240e7f9c922", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.lheEjjUjSl2qfz3HtkoSbYrxZCieas7YCVLLywsfhGpNH1tOoBAHpw9wBjKBA7A2C6tAdPHPXL5m.JyD4xf8sAv7MVkozbKQkuvei.oCnMg--", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "admin", "published": "2017-11-23T13:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "ZEE TV and Dance India Dance are all set for the DID Li\u2019l Masters Season 4 2018.

The PSAR, Developed by Welles Wilder, is designed to determine the point in time when there emerges a better than average probability of a trend switching directions. This is a common tool used by traders and investors to try to gauge potential reversal of a trend. \nThe parabolic SAR is shown on the charts as a series of small \u2018dots\u2019 that are placed either above or below the price. When the price is trending to the upside, the dots are below the price action and when the price is trending to the downside, the dots are above the price action. The basic use of the Parabolic SAR is to buy when the dots move below the price bars (signaling an uptrend) and sell/short-sell when the dots move above the price bars (signaling a downtrend). \nActive traders have a wide range of technical indicators at their disposal for when completing technical stock analysis. Currently, the 14-day ATR for UK Index MSCI Ishares (EWU) is spotted at 0.24. First developed by J. Welles Wilder, the ATR may assist traders in determining if there is heightened interest in a trend, or if extreme levels may be signaling a reversal. Simply put, the ATR determines the volatility of a security over a given period of time, or the tendency of the security to move one direction or another. \nChecking in on some other technical levels, the 14-day RSI is currently at 47.73, the 7-day stands at 42.38, and the 3-day is sitting at 18.86. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a commonly used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued. \nAnother technical indicator that may be a powerful resource for determining trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970\u2019s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for UK Index MSCI Ishares (EWU) is noted at 10.96. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. \nThe Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is another technical indicator worth taking a look at. UK Index MSCI Ishares (EWU) currently has a 14 day Williams %R of -60.00. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. The Williams %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator except it is plotted upside-down. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. If the indicator travels under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. Chart analysts may also use the indicator to project possible price reversals and to define trends. \nUK Index MSCI Ishares (EWU) currently   -14.96. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal.

An aerial image of the oak tree at the Scout Association\u2019s Gilwell Park in Chingford (Woodland Trust/PA) \nFirst founded in 1907, the Scouts grew into the biggest co-educational youth movement in the country, now boasting more than 400,000 members. \nBeccy Speight, Woodland Trust chief executive, said: \u201cOur competition aims to highlight and celebrate our country\u2019s remarkable trees, and to ultimately ensure they are given the recognition and protection they deserve. \n\u201cThe passion shown by the people who nominated trees, and the way the public get behind them in the voting process shows how much of an inspiration trees are to people.\u201d \nGilwell Oak will also receive a \u00a31,000 tree care award as part of its prize. \nWinners of the title in other parts of the UK were the Erskine House Tree in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the Big Tree is Kirkwall, Scotland, and The Hollow Tree in Gnoll Country Park, Wales. \nVoting for the European Tree of the Year will open in February 2018, the Woodland Trust said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gilwell oak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beccy speight", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert bayden powell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grylls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dick turpin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gilwell oak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woodland trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollow tree", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "essex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scout association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament oak", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woodland trust/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woodland trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirkwall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gnoll country park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belfast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nottinghamshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chingford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gilwell park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:09.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2c682225686674aaa6bfc2e8adb7ba2ca6777f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DH4fzRhcB2ytvlXvTYS3gjp9pJbxl8TetZzExkicolG6k0qcwldjm7Mp3IMktaN5zbEvpu9hltfdqTnBpHwzrD32d6wzSlSXgo", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.co.uk", "site": "huffingtonpost.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/feeds/verticals/uk-tech/index.xml", "site_categories": ["politics", "financial_news", "law_government_and_politics", "finance"], "section_title": "HuffPost UK - Athena2 - All Entries (Public)", "title": "Theresa May Clashes With Donald Trump Again As US Recognises Jerusalem As Israel's Capital", "title_full": "Theresa May Clashes With Donald Trump Again As US Recognises Jerusalem As Israel's Capital", "published": "2017-12-07T02:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 117, "participants_count": 81, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.huffingtonpost.com%2Fasset%2F1200_630%2F5a284298140000f36fb6bcf9.jpeg&amp;client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&amp;signature=e7d63aeb0b421210ae7aec335daa3005f5b80300", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3053, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5141c57106ed1b20a1d2784444797ecea3722780", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DH4fzRhcB2ytvlXvTYS3gjp9pJbxl8TetZzExkicolG6k0qcwldjm7Mp3IMktaN5zbEvpu9hltfdqTnBpHwzrD3wdjqXbsydG6iYCmwaGMxyS5uu.ViCF2cw--", "ord_in_thread": 113, "author": "Lee Blanshard", "published": "2017-12-07T11:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Yep!

The British Embassy to Israel is based in Tel Aviv and we have no plans to move it,\" she said in a press release. \"Our position on the status of Jerusalem is clear and long-standing: it should be determined in a negotiated settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and Jerusalem should ultimately be the shared capital of the Israeli and Palestinian states. \"In line with relevant Security Council Resolutions, we regard East Jerusalem as part of the Occupied Palestinian Territories --,\" the Prime Minister pointed out. \"We encourage the US Administration to now bring forward detailed proposals for an Israel-Palestinian settlement. \"To have the best chances of success, the peace process must be conducted in an atmosphere free from violence. We call on all parties to work together to maintain calm,\" she added. In a more serious vein, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu slammed the US decision as \"irresponsible\" and \"unacceptable.\" \"This decision is against international law and relevant UN Resolutions,\" he wrote on his Twitter account. Turkey's Foreign Ministry also condemned the move, saying: \"We learnt with great concern of this decision which is against international law and relevant UN resolutions.\" \"It has been recurrently emphasized by various UN resolutions that the Palestinian question can only be settled through the existence of an independent, sovereign and contiguous State of Palestine based on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital,\" the ministry said in a statement carried by AA. \"It is unacceptable that the US, a Permanent Member of the UN Security Council, ignores this fact. Attainment of independence by Palestine is a historical, conscientious and human obligation. Turkey will continue to advocate this,\" the statement added. It further stated that the decision will have negative reflections on the peace and stability in the region and bears the risk of completely destroying the grounds for peace. It called on the US administration to reconsider \"this faulty decision which may result in highly negative outcomes and to avoid uncalculated steps that will harm the multicultural identity and historical status of Jerusalem.\" \"These developments regarding Jerusalem will be taken up extensively at the OIC (Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) Leaders' Summit and the Council of Foreign Ministers Meeting that will be held on December 13, 2017, in Istanbul upon the call made by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - the current chair of the OIC,\" the statement added. In Moscow, Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee the Federation Council (Russian parliament's upper house), said Trump's decision is a blatant violation of the relevant UN resolution. The move blocks the way to the two-state vision for solving the Middle East conflict. It could fuel tension across the region and undermine the peace efforts, he added. Though the US Congress approved today's decision in a bill in 1995, previous administrations refrained from implementing it. Trump vowed in his presidential campaign that he would implement the bill.

The session follows Mexican President Enrique Pe?a Nieto's last visit to Kuwait during which several agreements were signed, covering various fields of bilateral cooperation, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Finance said in a press statement Wednesday. During the session held in Mexico, the two sides discussed a host of joint issues, focusing on cooperation in economy, finance, trade, investment, energy, and air transport. They also exchanged several draft agreements and MoUs to be studied and later signed for consolidating bilateral ties. The Kuwaiti side to the committee session was led by the Finance Ministry's Undersecretary Khalifa Hamada, while the Mexicans were headed by Agustin Garc?a-L?pez, Executive Director of the Mexican Agency for International Development Cooperation. Meanwhile, the visiting delegation represented Kuwait in an economic and business conference between the Arab World and Mexico, organized at the Mexican Congress.

Provincial police spokesman Hazrat Hussain Mashraqiwal told media that the strike targeted an IS hideout in the Momand Dara area of the Achin district in Nangarhar. He claimed that 25 IS fighters, including key members of the insurgent group, were killed in the raid but did not provide details. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also destroyed in the attack. Security forces and civilians suffered no casualties in the unmanned aerial strike. The insurgent group has not commented on the incident. Last month, at least 18 IS fighters were killed in an air strike and a clash in Achin district. In April, US targeted a hideout of IS in Achin, a stronghold of the group in the province, with the largest non-nuclear bomb used in the combat.

From tree lightnings to company gifts, all of them are wrapped up in getting what they want. For Fallon, its Michael but since she can't have him she wants to be friends with Kori. Steven wants to take down Stansfield while Cristal teams up with an unlikely partner to take care of her past. Michael wants Fallon to give him and Kori space. They may have shared pie on Thanksgiving , but he needs to move on and he needs her to stay clear of them. Fallon doesn't take this well. She invites Kori to the Carrington Christmas Tree Lightning. Kori isn't happy about the invitation. She wants nothing to do with Fallon. Dynasty Recap: Thanksgiving at Gunpoint>>> Dead Fish Cristal goes to the doctors. Blake might be trying to have a baby with her but she isn't trying. She has an IUD! And it is good for 2 more years, the doctor tells her. Cristal is relieved. It seems she might already have a child. While she is on the table, she has a flashback to the time she became pregnant. Sammy's mother was upset when she broke the news, but Cristal told her she could do it all alone. After Cristal gets out of the doctor's she finds a note to her and a cooler of dead bloody fish in her car. Her enemies have finally found her and she needs to do something fast. She heads home with the cooler, dropping it accidentally at the feet of Anders. We already know he is aware of her real name. Kidnapped Blake gets a visit from Stansfield. He threatens Blake after finding out Steven moved the foundation money.Steven is trying to do right for the kids, but it looks like Blake has illegal plans for the money. Steven meets with Jeff to see if he can look into some cases that Stansfield was on. Steven's poking around gets him kidnapped. After he is taken to a warehouse, the kidnapper shows who he is. It's Blake. He tells Steven the next time it won't be him. It will be someone else. He needs to leave the Stansfield thing alone. Of course, Steven doesn't and goes right back to Jeff to keep working on taking Stansfield down. It is only a matter of time before he learns his father paid off Stansfield to save him from getting taken in on murder charges. Steven decides to drop it all. Jeff isn't so willing. he pays off Stansfield to leave town and also keeps the recordings of the meetings for himself. Steven also leaves town in his limo, headed to see an ex in New York. The Stansfield situation really seems to be eating at him and the fact that he got a man killed as we see him using cocaine. Double Agent Sammy Jo didn't spend his time poolside this week. He needs to etch out a spot on the family tree somehow, a realization that comes to him after Fallon tells him he isn't a Carrington so his opinions on anything doesn't matter. Like a true Carrington, he plays Blake and Fallon by spying on both of them and feeding each business secrets as they compete to one up each other with gifts for their clients for Christmas. In the end, Fallon likes his sly ways and wants to show him a thing or two. Revenge There was no way Fallon could keep up the good girl act with Kori. Fallon takes Jeff to the Christmas Tree Lightning after learning Michael is going with Kori. It is an event Fallon always goes to with Michael. Reminscent of her time there with Michael, she takes Jeff to their spot on the roof only to find Michael and Kori getting it on there! Upset, she steals their clothes and leaves them locked on the rooftop. Dynasty Reboot Casts Nicollette Sheridan as Alexis Carrington>>> An Unlikely Pair Desperate for help, Cristal turns to Anders. She needs money to make the men go away. Surprisingly, Anders agrees. He will keep her past quiet, but not her future. He knows she cannot get pregnant and he has to tell Blake. He helps her drop off money to the men. She thinks it is finally over but she still needs to tell Blake the truth. Just when you think Blake is unforgiving, Cristal tells him everything about her past. Or so it seems. Blake is sweet and understanding but is quick to tell Anders to look into Cristal's past. What will he find? Dynasty airs Wednesdays at 9/8c on the CW. Want more news? Visit BuddyTV's Dynasty Facebook page.

\ue643 3 hours ago By David Watters Former Ossett Albion stalwart Micky Long is looking for Yorkshire-born EVO-STIK League stars to fly the flag for the White Rose county globally! \nThe experienced former Albion coach and player will be running the rule over prospective 'internationals' at open trials on Sunday at the home of Hemsworth Miners Welfare following his appointment by the new Yorkshire International Football Association (YIFA) to help Bradford City academy coach Ryan Farrell set up and run the new side. \n\"God's own county\" already boasts the world's oldest football club in EVO-STIK League Sheffield FC and the duo are looking forward to fixtures against teams representing regions and would-be states around the world like Greenland and Tibet who've been denied FIFA membership. \nYIFA was founded in July and theoretically could call on the services of a number of top Premier League stars including Leicester striker Jamie Vardy who was born in Sheffield and famously kicked off his rise to the top of the game at EVO-STIK League South Stocksbridge Park Steels. \nYIFA chairman Phil Hegart joked to BBC Sport this week that they'd consider talent at any level ahead of their first fixture in January against the Isle of Man's notional national team, Ellan Vannin. \nHegarty said: \"If Lionel Messi's mum was born in Barnsley we will be happy to take a look at him but otherwise we are just looking for those born in Yorkshire. The sort of football they will be playing will be proper Yorkshire football, not Premier League football.\" \nA kit has already been produced for the players and according to Hegarty, they will be expected to take part in a full cultural programme and fulfill an off-pitch ambassadorial role. \nHe added: \"We want them to talk about what it is to be from Yorkshire, the heritage and history of the region and what makes us that bit special. It will be a way of reaching out to grassroots Yorkshire people and saying: This is our football team; this is what we are about, what the region is about and why we are representing it.\" \nThe ultimate goal for Yorkshire is to win the World Football Cup - the global tournament for international teams outside FIfA run by the Confederation of Independent Football Associations. Sadly for the White Roses, Yorkshire are too late to qualify for the 2018 tournament in London featuring 16 teams from across five continents. \nSunday's trials are taking place at Hemsworth's home in Pontefract between noon and 6pm. \nFollow us: @evostikleague on Twitter | Facebook www.facebook.com/evostikleague Where next?
