For their paper, Blanchflower and Oswald investigate claims about happiness made by the Brookings Institution\u2019s Carol Graham in her recent book, \u201cHappiness For All?\u201d In the book, Graham draws primarily on Gallup data to argue American happiness is faltering as a rational response to growing inequality. Among Graham\u2019s most striking finding is, as she puts it, \u201cmarkers of well and ill-being, ranging from life satisfaction to stress, are more unequally shared across the rich and the poor in the U.S. than they are in Latin America, a region long known for high levels of inequality.\u201d Low-income Americans are particularly skeptical that hard work will improve their economic situation. Blanchflower and Oswald wanted to see if other data sources corroborated Graham\u2019s findings. They first turn to the General Social Survey, a nationally representative survey administered every several years and used frequently in social science work. The GSS data show, unambiguously, that Americans\u2019 evaluations of their own happiness has been falling in recent years. The decline is visible across multiple demographic groups. Declines have been steepest among Americans with the least education, and the happiness gap between the most-educated and least-educated Americans has nearly doubled since 1972. Blanchflower and Oswald note the GSS data show similar trends for Americans\u2019 feelings about their finances \u2014 everyone is less optimistic about money relative to 1972, but optimism has dropped particularly sharply among the least-educated. They call these disparities a form of \u201cpsychological inequality,\u201d which is both a reflection of actual monetary inequality and a driver of it \u2014 after all, it\u2019s difficult to improve your financial situation if you don\u2019t believe your financial situation can be improved. As another marker of psychological distress, Blanchflower and Oswald look at cross-country data on the experience of pain. In 2011, the International Social Survey Programme asked respondents in over 30 nations how often they had experienced bodily aches and pains in the past month. Americans were the most likely to report frequent pain, with 34 percent saying they experienced it \u201coften\u201d or \u201cvery often.\u201d The average across all countries surveyed was just 20 percent. \u201cAs the US is one of the richest countries in the world, and in principle might be expected to have one of the most comfortable lifestyles in the world, it seems strange \u2014 to put it at its mildest \u2014 that the nation should report such a lot of pain,\u201d Blanchflower and Oswald write. Aware that some of this could be attributable to question translation issues or cultural differences (for instance, Americans may just be more predisposed to complain about pain than members of other nations), the authors ran the numbers controlling for age, gender, marital status, labor force status and education. The United States remained an outlier even when these factors were accounted for. The nation\u2019s relatively stingy social safety net may be one factor contributing to this exceptionalism. Many Americans still lack access to health care, which is available universally in most other wealthy nations. The expense of health care, even for those who have insurance, could mean Americans experiencing aches and pains are more likely to tough it out and forgo treatment, relative to people in other countries. In the United States, health issues remain a major contributor to financial insecurity, meaning they likely contribute to some of the declining happiness and financial pessimism seen in the other research surveyed by Blanchflower and Oswald. All told, the data underscore how country-level material wealth can be a poor indicator for the well being of its inhabitants. 18946079 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christopher ingraham", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david blanchflower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blanchflower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carol graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew oswald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oswald", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "international social survey programme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gallup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dartmouth college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general social survey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of warwick", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latin america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:47.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "de60ae6455c271d94b131cacf6db99c3c8ef1dc3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpTpiDtinyUPDDCPFAuQrUR.f6G05VJZLS4PmVERVYyK0o0ObBxygpr8zNFuZDMBMyZpGbuz5hPWdfaPEbaN2G7g2kw_.eC4fJo-", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual?page=5\n", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK -

I'm not going to colour Chapter 1 traditionally again because at this point it's about finding the right (read: affordable in the long run) tools and it's better to try on a smaller separate story. I can't get around to actually working on that smaller \"trial\" story though but I'm thinking about it.\nI also \"gave myself the permission\" to think up stories other than Cop Story - I used to stuff everything in that setting because I was afraid of having a second project that would \"compete\" with Cop Story but at the end of the day Cop Story is this branching out thing that has competing parts within itself so what the hell. If I can work something into it I still do it, if I have an idea and some fundamental part of it doesn't fit into what I have \"not an actual example but: DRAGONS) then oh well, I can ponder on it and see what happens. I think doing something is usually better than doing nothing, and I spent too much time feeling stuck and doing nothing. Feeling okay about Cop Story right now so not even working on other ideas much but allowing myself the possibility definitely helped there. Funny how that works???\nI started drawing people on public transport again! So after I go out and commute somewhere I tend to end up with a handful of sketches that I ink and sometimes colour, and I'm really loose about it, it's the space to try something new. Sometimes I add backgrounds (like a forest instead of the bus interior) and just draw randomless. It seems both helpful and relaxing, and it's not so scary drawing in public now that everyone and their grandmother is staring into mobile phones.\nI haven't really decided what to do with those sketches! A friend suggested putting together a digital sketchbook and putting it on Gumroad or something but knowing me I'll probably just upload it all to my usual art haunts.\nI definitely feel better about my whole art process now that I leave some time both for the comic and random sketchbook doodles - I'm not saying it's how everyone should do it but it's definitely the way to go for me. I used to have all those unfinished sketchbooks and a lot of anxiety, now there's only four left (not counting stuff I use for comic pages only) and I'm progressing through them steadily. It's not about filling them up fast or to a certain date but it feels good to be filling them up.\nQuote: : I just think it would take a lot of time of actually practicing to get back to where I was, let alone progress further.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:48.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ee797300cb6354bb2abf29c8795451f5a5fd63d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.UUYp.iN6sdaFvzFkl.eMaj2XlSXlqwvqKbbJCGQQsRk6f.rQOTpXsrkN8eBcuE_mhFGoQhseHR7DPoa0Jwjf7524olLb16WoQUF0BdFqLpr9g8ZobzWQIzMNgSy8apXI-", "site_full": "www.myrtlebeachonline.com", "site": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "site_section": "http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/politics-government/?widgetName=rssfeed&widgetContentId=712015&getXmlFeed=true", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Politics & Government News | MyrtleBeachOnline.com &", "title": "Sunshine Skyway bridge to close for road race", "title_full": "Sunshine Skyway bridge to close for road race", "published": "2017-12-07T10:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//www.myrtlebeachonline.com/static/images/myrtlebeachonline/facebook.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 95710, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ee797300cb6354bb2abf29c8795451f5a5fd63d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.UUYp.iN6sdaFvzFkl.eMaj2XlSXlqwvqKbbJCGQQsRk6f.rQOTpXsrkN8eBcuE_mhFGoQhseHR7DPoa0Jwjf7524olLb16WoQUF0BdFqLpr9g8ZobzWQIzMNgSy8apXI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Associated Press", "published": "2017-12-07T10:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "Sunshine Skyway bridge to close for road race", "text": "Sunshine Skyway bridge to close for road race The Associated Press December 07, 2017 03:53 AM UPDATED 1 MINUTE AGO ST.

post. All opinions and photography are my own and are not influenced by Minted. Thank you for supporting the fantastic brands that support my blog. \nDiscover my favorite place to get the best Christmas cards and beautiful holiday decor for your home and everyone on your list! \nI absolutely love to receive Christmas cards. Who doesn\u2019t, right?! It\u2019s so much fun to see family and friends again. This year I wanted to get my cards out early and not procrastinate like I have in past years. So after I selected our family photo, I headed straight to Minted to get the perfect design. We just received our cards a few days ago and I absolutely love the way they turned out! \nThere are a ton of great options to pick at Minted, but as soon as I saw the glimmery \u201c Merry Christmas \u201d design, I knew it was the one. The real gold foil lettering adds an extra special touch to our photo! \nI decided to upgrade the card so I could include a picture of the boys on the back. How sweet is this picture of them walking together and holding hands? Be still my heart! Our card had the option to do multiple pictures on the back but I thought that one single image was perfection! \nDid you know that Minted also gives you the option to print the return address for FREE?! Not only does that give the Christmas cards a neat and clean look, it also saves this busy mama a ton of time. So of course, I totally took advantage of that freebie! \nI also had all my recipients addresses printed on the envelopes. It looks so great because the print actually matches my cards. So really, all that\u2019s left for me to do is slap a stamp on them and drop them in the mail. It\u2019s so wonderful to mark off one more thing on that long holiday to-do list! \nI am so excited to get them in the mail for family and friends to see! And with all the addressing already done for me, they\u2019re probably going to actually arrive on time this year. Thanks to Minted I will look like I\u2019m really on top of things this Christmas! \ud83d\ude09 \nIf you haven\u2019t ordered your Christmas cards yet, there\u2019s still plenty of time for you to create your own design and get them to your loved ones. If you are needing some help in deciding on a card, I\u2019ve picked out a few of my favorites. I\u2019m lovin\u2019 this card , and this one is fun, h\u2026.and I really love the pattern on this one ! Oh\u2026and I have good news for you too! You can get up to 20% off with coupon code BRIGHT17 . \nBut wait! That\u2019s not all I got from Minted this year. Remember our entryway that I shared in my Christmas Home tour ? So many of you commented on my beautiful wall print and wanted to know where I got it. \nThe wonderful printable art called All The Names of Jesus is also from Minted. I just love the way it looks in my entryway waiting to greet all my guests. \nNot only is the print a beautiful holiday decoration, but with it\u2019s neutral style it can be displayed in the home all year long. And because I love it so much, I don\u2019t see me taking it down anytime soon! \nBesides wall art, Minted also has pillows, curtains and even lampshades! They also have Little Mint which is home items for the nursery or kids room. I found a ton of cute items there like little stools, floor pillows, hampers and fabric storage bins!

I've wanted a lot of these exact changes to be implemented myself with the exception of the flashbang radius lol. As it comes to the end of the year I really don't think the Blizzard team is gonna do anything about McCree cause he's just such a killer when it comes to the big leagues.

Renewable energy is developing at a rapid pace and hydropower remains the most explored and primary source of clean energy. Small hydropower converts the energy of the flowing water into electricity by using a turbine coupled to a generator. It has high capacity utilization and plant availability factor which results in maximum availability of plant for generation. Majorly, the run of river and already existing water infrastructure are considered which contributes to the generation of small hydro plants. Hydroelectric energy is the cleanest form of renewable generation as it does not releases any harmful gases, carbon dioxide and other pollutant which directly or indirectly affects the environment. The plants are generally off grid and is widely used in rural areas where there is no electricity supply. It has no fuel cost and low operational and maintenance cost makes it one of the cheapest source of energy. Small hydro plants has the efficiency over 90% which makes it most efficient and favorable energy among the other renewable sources. The lifespan of small hydropower plants are more as compared to larger hydropower plants. Generally the life span is up-to 50 years and this make it a reliable and economical source of energy conversion. Small hydro has high capacity utilization factor up to 50% which results in higher output as compared to wind and solar power which accounts for 25% and 20% respectively. Small hydro plant can be operated continuously at any temperature and wind condition which makes it economical and flexible.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released its annual Point in Time count Wednesday, a report that showed nearly 554,000 homeless people across the country during local tallies conducted in January. That figure is up nearly 1 percent from 2016. Of that total, 193,000 people had no access to nightly shelter and instead were staying in vehicles, tents, the streets and other places considered uninhabitable. The unsheltered figure is up by more than 9 percent compared to two years ago. Increases are higher in several West Coast cities, where the explosion in homelessness has prompted at least 10 city and county governments to declare states of emergency since 2015. City officials, homeless advocates and those living on the streets point to a main culprit: the region\u2019s booming economy. Rents have soared beyond affordability for many lower-wage workers who until just a just few years ago could typically find a place to stay. Now, even a temporary setback can be enough to leave them out on the streets. \u201cA lot of people in America don\u2019t realize they might be two checks, three checks, four checks away from being homeless,\u201d said Thomas Butler Jr., who stays in a carefully organized tent near a freeway ramp in downtown Los Angeles. Butler said he was in transitional housing \u2014 a type of program that prepares people for permanent homes \u2014 for a while but mostly has lived on the streets for the past couple of years. The numbers in the report back up what many people in California, Oregon and Washington have been experiencing in their communities: encampments sprouting along freeways and rivers; local governments struggling to come up with money for long-term solutions; conflicts over whether to crack down on street camping and even feeding the homeless. The most alarming consequence of the West Coast homeless explosion is a deadly hepatitis A outbreak that has affected Los Angeles, Santa Cruz and San Diego, the popular tourist destination in a county where more than 5,600 people now live on the streets or in their cars. The outbreak prompted California officials to declare a state of emergency in October. The HUD report underscores the severity of the problem along the West Coast. While the overall homeless population in California, Oregon and Washington grew by 14 percent over the past two years, the part of that population considered unsheltered climbed 23 percent to 108,000. That is in part due a shortage of affordable housing. The homeless service area that includes most of Los Angeles County, the epicenter of the crisis, saw its total homeless count top 55,000 people, up by more than 13,000 from 2016. Four out of every five homeless individuals there are considered unsheltered, leaving tens of thousands of people with no place to sleep other than the streets or parks. By comparison, while New York City\u2019s homeless population grew to more than 76,000, only about 5 percent are considered unsheltered thanks to a system that can get people a cot under a roof immediately. In the West Coast states, the surge in homelessness has become part of the fabric of daily life. The Monty, a bar in the Westlake neighborhood near downtown Los Angeles, usually doesn\u2019t open until 8 p.m. Partner and general manager Corey Allen said that\u2019s because a nearby shelter requires people staying there to be in the building by 7. Waiting until after that to open means the streets outside are calmer. Allen said the homeless have come into his bar to bathe in the restroom wash basins, and employees have developed a strategy for stopping people from coming in to panhandle among customers.

It was 2013, a few years after the 35-year-old elementary school art teacher first started documenting her passion for adventurous, sometimes dangerous hikes on her increasingly popular website Hidden San Diego. Walking along the path recently, Johnson recalled that initial adventure into the network of narrow, water-carved canyons that rise above the San Elijo Lagoon Ecological Reserve. \u201cIt was a crazy adventure, kind of scary,\u201d she said, eyes beaming. \u201cI thought I could die. It\u2019s sandstone so it crumbles easy, and there\u2019s slot canyons that you have to climb up, but your adrenaline\u2019s going, and the child in you comes out.\u201d Offering a practical guide to the San Diego region\u2019s largely unknown hikes and points of interest, Hiddensandiego.net has become something of a local sensation, garnering a respectable 2.4 million hits a year after less than a decade in existence. From spooky forests, tunnels, cemeteries and abandoned buildings to gorgeous views and waterfalls, Johnson has cataloged more than 200 adventures, including pictures and often historical information. She\u2019s now expanding her footprint to include all of California with a new website hiddenca.com . \u201cA lot of people aren\u2019t into normal hiking trails,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m not. I need to have a reward. Hiking for endurance is cool and all, but I want to find something at the end.\u201d As she relived the rush of navigating through dense vegetation to reach the sandy, sun-blasted formations, parents herding rambunctious preteens and thirtysomethings in athletic gear streamed by. Last year, the hike south of the lagoon and just west of Interstate 5 was opened to the public and renamed Annie\u2019s Canyon Trail. While the paths have been improved and a metal ladder was installed for safety at a view point, many of the canyons have now been chained off. Hiker Jon Copp was in town from Cleveland visiting friends for Thanksgiving. He said he appreciated the balance between access and protecting the natural environment. \u201cI don\u2019t have any desire to break rules for the sake of breaking rules,\u201d said the 31-year-old. \u201cIf you can give me a really nice hike where maybe I\u2019m getting like 85 percent of the experience, but at the same time, it\u2019s being protected and managed, I\u2019m fine with that.\u201d After Johnson wrote about the location, trespassers increasingly splashed graffiti over the sandstone environment and left beer bottles and trash littered about after bonfire parties. That came to an end when the nonprofit San Elijo Lagoon Conservancy, in response to the vandalism, received a grant for around $100,000 to clean up and improve the area. \u201cThe more popular it became the more graffiti was in there,\u201d said Jennifer Bright, development director for the conservancy. \u201cThe Mushroom Caves were an area of ecological reserves that was no trespassing for years.\u201d Asked about Johnson\u2019s role, Bright was terse about what was clearly a hotly debated topic among the conservancy. \u201cOur reason for opening it had nothing to do with Hidden San Diego,\u201d she said. While Johnson relishes her role in turning people on to the outdoors, she also grapples with the ethics around popularizing once hidden locations, especially when they involve restricted, often delicate natural environments. \u201cI have such mixed feelings,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI love seeing people out enjoying adventuring, but then it\u2019s also like there\u2019s one more hidden spot that\u2019s no longer hidden.\u201d While Johnson\u2019s website kicked off a chain of events that eventually led to rehabilitation of the sandstone canyons, she said she\u2019s not proud of her role in the trail\u2019s evolution. \u201cWhen I was younger, I think I was a little bit more of a rebel,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, as I get older there\u2019s a certain responsibility I feel.\u201d Still, Johnson\u2019s not ready to give up on her most daring adventures. Rather, she has created a pay section on her website to limit access to what she calls her most \u201csacred spots.\u201d In part, she said that\u2019s because when she posts a new hike, it\u2019s not just her readers that get exposed to those locations. A number of websites, she said, have routinely started reposting her content and photographs without her permission. In the end, she hopes to be able to support herself through the website, which currently brings in a few hundred dollars a month in advertising and subscriptions. Her dream is to travel the word, exploring and encouraging others to join in. \u201cI\u2019ve always followed my intuition, and it\u2019s always led me well,\u201d she said. 18925108 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jessica johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jon copp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer bright", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "annie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joshua emerson smith", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "san diego union-tribune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canyon trail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san elijo lagoon ecological reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mushroom caves", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hidden san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "solana beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san elijo lagoon conservancy", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:52.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5fd16787847c1fe91b736e951f69c9ba3ca77762", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_78rXuOkjLhU9IyA4ZPA0xXWVAbKqP0qoXXv55RN3caTvKhZ9t_26Gt2SZY26vWlNVwW7YO4q4RWfvVM_oM5iXFHrLk9dz9wrPCD0nILoPwA--", "site_full": "www.chron.com", "site": "chron.com", "site_section": "http://www.chron.com/rss/feed/News-270.php\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "News", "title": "California wind, and fire danger, hits unprecedented high", "title_full": "California wind, and fire danger, hits unprecedented high", "published": "2017-12-07T10:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/73/77/14663678/3/rawImage.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 773, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5fd16787847c1fe91b736e951f69c9ba3ca77762", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_78rXuOkjLhU9IyA4ZPA0xXWVAbKqP0qoXXv55RN3caTvKhZ9t_26Gt2SZY26vWlNVwW7YO4q4RWfvVM_oM5iXFHrLk9dz9wrPCD0nILoPwA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AMANDA LEE MYERS and ANDREW DALTON, Associated Press", "published": "2017-12-07T10:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "California wind, and fire danger, hits unprecedented high", "text": "Close Image 1 of 16 Motorists on Highway 101 watch flames from the Thomas fire leap above the roadway north of Ventura, Calif., on Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017.

Millions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. Officials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. Melissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" In what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. The wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. Little flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. Flames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. Across the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. Back in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. Air tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" ___ Dalton reported from Los Angeles.

If no photos are taken during this great occasion, then it would be very easy for people to forget the flow of events. That is why hiring a photographer is of paramount importance. But it is good to look for someone who is well-versed in this field of photography. For the best professional service for wedding photography Bay Area couples can search locally or online.\n\nWhen it comes to hiring a matrimony photographer, finding a real specialist is a plus. Remember the market is flooded with these service providers, and this makes it hard for one to choose a perfect camera expert. This, therefore, calls for a thorough legwork to ensure the right service provider is selected. Ensure that you interview several candidates before settling with one. Outlined in this article are some guidelines for choosing a wedlock photographer.\n\nExperience is the first important aspect to look at when hiring these types of photographers. You should be concerned about their existence in business. A photographer who has been around for long must be well-versed in this particular field. Look for specialists that have filmed countless wedding settings. Avoid going for inexperienced people since they may not be able to meet your needs.\n\nThe next vital aspect to look at is the sample photos they have. Any professional photographer must have a photo album full of pictures taken during wedding events. Ask to be given such samples so that you can scrutinize them properly. Make sure you check all the photos since most photographers place the best photos in the front pages of their albums. If you are scouting for an expert online, you have to visit their online galleries to check the photo samples.\n\nThirdly, request your prospective photographer to give out a few names of couples they filmed their weddings before. Call the references and inquire about the quality of the photography services offered by the person in question. If they are happy with the services offered, you may consider hiring that particular service provider. But if they were never contented with the services delivered, do not hesitate to look elsewhere.\n\nAnother important aspect to consider is how these services have been priced. Every company is unique and therefore prices are quite different. It is your mandate to search for a company that is ready to work within your budget. Getting quoted from different companies and comparing them is the best way to get affordable services.\n\nThe best place to begin when searching for matrimony photographers is with recommendations from trustworthy people. Look around to see if there are any newly married couples. If so, ask them to recommend you the photography experts they contracted. Also, you can talk to your close friends, relatives or workmates to see if they have anything to offer. It is good to be inquisitive if at all you want to make an informed decision.\n\nThe Internet is also a great place to search for these professionals. There are photographers who have already advertised their services online. Consider searching the relevant keywords on Yahoo or Google to see if you are going to pinpoint a reputable company around. Once you locate a service provider, consider researching their background so as to be able to make a well-informed choice.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can find a list of the benefits you get when you hire a wedding photography Bay Area professional at http://www.simplejoie.com right now. \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "patrick baker", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bay area", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:52.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d71a4c282118fc412866852993e4b33dbdd101e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3KiTuFgTWY4ySgnIr_bqx8_8s1R5ytXI69.ecBhcHLaVj7hq7naR18Rr7YDizuoZ68kqIRBQJIs8XfT4oVZBV9S2ZUu2qsfmSe39HZ5zUcTcQ--", "site_full": "entertain-art.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://entertain-art.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Arts and Entertainment", "title": "Strategies To Consider When Hiring Florida Foreclosure Attorneys", "title_full": "Strategies To Consider When Hiring Florida Foreclosure Attorneys", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d71a4c282118fc412866852993e4b33dbdd101e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3KiTuFgTWY4ySgnIr_bqx8_8s1R5ytXI69.ecBhcHLaVj7hq7naR18Rr7YDizuoZ68kqIRBQJIs8XfT4oVZBV9S2ZUu2qsfmSe39HZ5zUcTcQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "S Joell-Ireland (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "Strategies To Consider When Hiring Florida Foreclosure Attorneys", "text": "By Dennis Snyder \n\nThere is nothing as good like making sure you have the right person to represent you in a case when you are not able. Many victims feel disappointed when they are mistreated by their opponents, just because of their physical appearance. Hiring Florida foreclosure attorneys has come to rescue such situations, and everything is expected to run smoothly. The following are guidelines on the attorney selections.\n\nIt is spending some time that one can get prominent lawyers to hire. Consultation is done to make sure you are guided by the choices to make. Visiting the website will also be of great help since you will see what others have to say about this specialist and from that, make a choice, which is worth the salt. Experts with a poor reputation should be avoided in real sense.\n\nThe experience that the individual has should also be your guiding tip. It is vital for any counselor to present his or her documents to the clients to prove that a good job will be done. More so, an individual should inquire to talk to the previous clients if possible to clear doubts. In case a person knows nothing about the expert, then it is clear that something is wrong and you should go for another option.\n\nAn individual, who does not rush to dialogue before you talk, is the best to deal hire. Many specialists fail to listen to their client problem keenly pretending to know much, which leads to frustration. One should take time to get an expert, who knows the sense of having excellent communication skills. It would be wise to be a good listener, who responds to things in the right way.\n\nThe personality of the individual you hire matters a lot, especially when you have no time to meet with your expert. An advocate, who has no limitation on phone calls are the best to hire. One should make sure you maintain a friendly relationship to ensure everything runs as expected. It would be wise to search for persons, who are understanding in one way or the other.\n\nHonesty is a virtue that not many lawyers have since they are money oriented. Their interest is getting good cash and nothing else. It would be wise if one can get an honest expert, who will always tell you the truth regardless of how much pain it will cost you. Living with lies will lead to frustrating outcomes and loss of resources.\n\nExperts, who work day and night to meet the demands of the customers, are the best to deal with in the field of law. The individuals can take time to do research on the case at hand and come up with a solution that is valid. Lazy lawyers should be avoided at all cost.\n\nTo get a good lawyer is a hard task that many people take for granted. A lot of time is spent to make sure the choices that would be made will be worth the salt and stand on your behalf in the right way. Note that, inexperienced individuals will lead to your failure since the possibility of winning the case will be low.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are searching for information about Florida foreclosure attorneys , come to our web pages today.

Most of these photographers have big albums filled with photos that were taken on different occasions. Ask to see such photos in order to gauge their competency in this field. You need to be extremely keen when examining the photos. Ensure the same quality has been maintained in all the pictures they have.\n\nThe third aspect is about references. A quality photographer will not hesitate when asked to provide a list of referees. You need to call the references and ask questions pertaining to the photography services offered by the specialist you want to hire. If they are not complaining, then you may proceed to hire the same service provider. But if otherwise, consider looking for an expert elsewhere.\n\nAgain, consider asking about prices charged for the photography services offered. It is obvious that prices vary from one company to another. You need to ask for quotes from different companies so that you can make comparison. Always settle for a service provider that offers affordable but high quality services.\n\nA good place to start when hunting for a wedding photographer is with referrals from people around. If you know any newly-married couple in your area, you should consider asking them to recommend you the photography specialist they hired to film their matrimony.

This article looks at Fellowes Shredder repair NJ . It is something that every office owner should know how to carry out because the device can stop working at any time and you need to have it functional again. Some high profile offices have documents that should never see the light, and this is one of the machines that will ensure that happens.\n\nThe first thing that you are supposed to do is to empty it everything and find a way you can clear all the paper jams. It is a process that has to be worked out slowly if you need it to be effective. At times, if there are particles that are not coming out then you will have to remove them with tweezers. Sometimes you need to do more checking because what is typically required is for you to do some oiling.\n\nAn import part of this machine is the head that always must be in the correct position for functionality to be enhanced. When you proceed and make some adjustments that take it out of place, then you are likely to cause it not to work well. Let the machine lie there without doing anything, and when you resume the job, it will be back to normal.\n\nYou have to get a lubricant because without it then working will be so hard. Not just any other grease must be used, but you will get the various types that are recommended. When making the application, it has to be done by the correct items and not any other crude means.\n\nIf you have to ask, let it be from your acquaintances or colleagues at work. It is something that anybody who deals in paperwork must know and hence asking does not make you less informed. It will either be a situation where you share ideas of you get to listen to their opinions. The first wrong assumption that you can make is that no one understands such things and thus ends up losing valuable data.\n\nThere is also a lot of information which you can get online. Getting a whole lesson on this is possible. It just depends on which site you have visited. For this process, you just need to have a computer and an excellent source of network connectivity.\n\nAt times you can source for an expert form some other place. Professional have to be with everything. That means they have to prove beyond reasonable that they are suitable for the job. You are critical because you do not want someone messing with your machine.\n\nThese are some of the strategies which you can use to work in this tool. Caution and sheer precision are necessary because it does not make sense to destroy it more when you thought that you were indeed going some changes. If you follow everything carefully, then you are bound to have it working well all the time.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are searching for information about Fellowes shredder repair NJ residents can visit our web pages online today.

In order to make this happen, we need to raise $70 per domain to keep these sites intact and not have them bought out for further infant cutting propaganda. If you are able to help with this endeavor in any way, big or small, please give via PayPal Friends/Family to TheIntactNetwork@gmail.com or at the button below . Even a $2 donation is useful and will pool with others for the acquisition of a domain. We'll share the domains with donors as they are able to be acquired and re-directed to pro-intact info. If you'd like to select one from the top of the list (most urgent) email SavingSons@gmail.com or message the SOS or TIN Facebook pages. THANK YOU! * Domains will be purchased for redirection to pro-intact sites in an order of priority. We will not be attempting to purchase sites that are being sold for over $70 per 36 months, because this is outside the range of our fundraising limitations. We will be focused on the current top 25 that otherwise point to pro-cutting materials online. We will add to this list as others come available, or as we are able to raise funding to do so.

Clark\u2019s \u201cThe Beatles Die on Tuesday\u201d opened at 2nd Street Theater, Sandy Klein, manager of the theater, challenged Clark to write a new Christmas play. \u201cWhat she had in mind was something pretty family-friendly,\u201d Clark told GO! \u201cAnd so I tried. But she seems to be pretty OK with how it turned out.\u201d What: \u201cA Politically Correct Christmas\u201d When: Opens 7:30 p.m. Friday; additional performances 7:30 p.m. Thursday-Saturday, 2 p.m. Sunday, till Dec. 17 Where: 2nd Street Theater, 220 NE Lafayette Ave., Bend Cost: $19, $16 students and seniors Contact: 2ndstreettheater.com or 541-312-9626 View More \u201cIt\u201d refers to \u201cA Politically Correct Christmas\u201d (or \u201cA P.C. Xmas\u201d for short), Clark\u2019s collection of four new short plays riffing on well-known classic tales. The new show makes its world premiere Friday at the Bend theater. Like so much gift-box ribbon, Clark twists, ties and tapes the stories of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman, a grown-up Kevin McCallister of \u201cHome Alone\u201d and Ralphie of \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d into modern tales that oftentimes are laugh-out-loud funny \u2014 and probably landing closer to PG-13 than a family-oriented production, according to Clark. First up is \u201cRudy Rudy Rudolph,\u201d directed by Clark himself. It opens with a trio of kids (played by Katie James, Jayde Clark and Brynne Hunt) singing a changed-up version of \u201cRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\u201d They show up periodically to sing another variant verse introducing the plot\u2019s next wrinkle. Matt Vigil stars as everyone\u2019s favorite flying reindeer, and boy, is he ever bright and cheerful. Vixen (Catherine Christie) is especially smitten with Rudy and makes plans to drink mojitos with him, although from the viewer\u2019s standpoint, he doesn\u2019t appear to reciprocate her romantic designs. The reindeer with the red nose is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, however: Donner (Tyler Santos) and Blitzen (Tommy Kuchulis) are a pair of young, dumb bucks given to hilarious antler collisions at the slightest whiff of disagreement. Each has designs on courting the lovely doe, and hatch a plan to thwart Rudy \u2014 by sawing off Blitzen\u2019s antlers so he can pose as Rhonda the randy reindeer, consort to Rudy. Hijinks ensue, the reindeer pair off unexpectedly, and let\u2019s just say some healthy glows are the result. Leading into intermission is \u201cHalfway Home Alone,\u201d directed by Danielle Herron. Here, we see Harry and Marv, the oft-thwarted villains of \u201cHome Alone,\u201d excellently re-created by Joshua Harrison and Levon Alldredge, respectively. The two, freshly out of prison, are arriving at a halfway house, where they\u2019re forced to bunk together. Harry (played by Joe Pesci in the film) has designs of becoming a Broadway hairdresser, but as fate would have it, the only room available in the house is with Marv (Daniel Stern in the film). Thanks, in large part, to Clark\u2019s script, and no doubt Herron\u2019s direction, Harrison and Alldredge somehow manage to re-create the duo\u2019s chemistry, bringing to the small stage the broad physical comedy of the two and the spirit of the source films. Of course, other than their bickering, and Marv\u2019s hots for the house manager, Tina (Gracie DeWilde), they\u2019d be nothing without a conflict. That arrives in the form of their formerly pint-size nemesis, Kevin McCallister (Kuchulis) now grown and ready to thwart more of Marv and Harry\u2019s plans. \u201cLess than Frosty,\u201d directed by Scott Schultz, takes off on Frosty the Snowman, seen here as he slowly decays thanks to global warming: Think of your most politically incorrect relatives after a few drinks have removed whatever filters they have, then double their intake of Fox News, and you have some approximation of Frosty, who\u2019s ripe for moving to the \u201ccold folks home.\u201d Richard Mueller stars as Frosty, who lives with a family played by Amy James as the mother, and Audrey Rink and Katie James as the daughters, all beginning to despair at Frosty\u2019s melting condition. Alldredge turns up again here as a slick salesman, ready to sell Frosty and his family on a nice icebox in which to chill. The cloying, patronizing voice he adopts for the role could put the most shameless radio huckster out of business. Clark said that while all four of his plays have moments he enjoys, \u201cWhat I\u2019ve been finding is that there are things I\u2019ve written in that I didn\u2019t even know were funny until I\u2019d seen it on stage. For example, Frosty, when I wrote him, I had something completely different in mind, but what Richard\u2019s done with it is completely hilarious. I couldn\u2019t even have thought of that. He\u2019s taken it and run with it farther than my thoughts went.\u201d The Karen Sipes-directed \u201cThe Christmas Story: 20 years later\u201d finds Ralphie (Russ Seaton) home from the Vietnam War, and younger brother Randy (Harrison) a pacifistic hippie. Clark provides the frequently occurring voice-overs you may remember from \u201cA Christmas Story.\u201d Some things never change: When dad\u2019s precious leg lamp suffers damage, they must turn to an antiques dealer you\u2019ll recognize from his torment of Ralphie: Scot Fergis (\u201cScut Farkus\u201d in the film), the third role played by Kuchulis in the quartet of Christmas plays. Clark said that Kuchulis \u201ckicked ass at auditions. Everybody wanted him. I would venture to say he\u2019s the Jim Carrey of Bend.\u201d Asked about the title \u201cA P.C. Xmas,\u201d Clark said, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to take a stand on anything in the \u2026 cultural atmosphere right now, the \u2018happy holidays\u2019 versus \u2018keep Christ in Christmas.\u2019 And I\u2019m not taking a stand on anything. I\u2019m just making fun of the whole thing. It\u2019s the differences that make us unique, and that\u2019s one of the things that I was trying to emphasize by making fun of this whole thing.\u201d Before the month is out, Clark will again appear on the 2nd Street stage as Crumpet, the wry Macy\u2019s elf of \u201cThe Santaland Diaries.\u201d The one-man show, adapted from famed humorist David Sedaris\u2019 classic story by Joe Mantello. It runs Dec. 21-24 at 2nd Street and Dec. 22 at Maragas Winery. \u201cIt\u2019s such a hit. So many people expect me to do it now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming a cult classic. Despite my feelings about it, and how this is my sixth time doing it. It\u2019s like, \u2018Ugh.\u2019\u201d (Uh-oh. He\u2019s starting to sound like Crumpet!) Clark, who interned at Oregon Shakespeare Festival several years back, will also appear early next year in \u201cEquivocation,\u201d a play by Bill Cain about events surrounding the creation of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cMacbeth.\u201d Clark\u2019s also writing a TV pilot, which he described as \u201ca dream for the future.\u201d For now, he hopes \u201cA P.C.

What did you want me to do, to leave him at home? \n\u201cI\u2019m always honest.

In fact, it\u2019s seemingly un-Filipino about the way the title is, but either way, it\u2019s something new from Gerry Alanguilan with Kevin Ray Valentino providing a spectacular art bringing this graphic novel to life. \n\nIt was released recently at Komikon in November and its Gerry\u2019s latest book since \u201cRodski Patotski: Ang Dalagang Baby\u201d with Arnold Arre (Mythology Class, Trip to Tagaytay). So far I haven\u2019t got any idea was the book is all about and the first impression on the cover has something to do with a frog, which explains the \u201cKokak\u201d part of the title. \n\nIt was the first time not being able to attend Komikon since the very first one in 2005. But going back to the book it features the artwork of Kevin Ray Valentino who had no formal art training and took him nearly three years to have this book made. \n\nThe premise for Bakokak is fairly simple a giant frog wreaking destruction in a populace, but it set in an alternate future where the Philippines is a forward developing country that came under attack from this creature. \n\nIn reality, it would be hilarious IF there was a giant frog going through Metro Manila and destroying every building that it steps on and that\u2019s basically the story. \n\nBut at the heart of this imposing book is the giant frog and unknown lead character that basically has common sense. There\u2019s something fascinating about monsters leveling cities or towns, but a frog is kind of like being ingrained in Filipino popular culture having explained by Gerry how he got interested in writing about this genre. \n\nBakokak is some ways a silent graphic novel heavily visuals by Kevin Ray Valentino with minimal dialogue. You open the first few pages you get blown away by his remarkable talent. The Philippines never had an iconic monster mostly these days writers dig up Filipino folklore for its supernatural stories, but giant creatures are unheard of regarding mythology. Basically, the Filipinos are into the usual telenovela or dramas that mirror reality and rather not have the imagination for putting together a great story. But Gerry has been championed on writing good stories that seek some for a challenge in regard to the narrative with quality. \n\n\n\nThe Alanguilan Element \n\nThe story of Bakokak is fairly simple in the narrative with a giant creature attacking cities and the usual let\u2019s blow this monsters to kingdom come. Then there\u2019s this one character who knew the solution he gets ignored until everything goes crazy. \n\nBakokak signifies one layer or element of Gerry as the way Wasted is described as part of his love life, his political views and discrimination in Elmer , the male fantasies in Where Bold Stars go to Die , and a tribute to his father-in-law as well as his wife with Rodski Patotski: Ang Dalagang Baby . \n\nKevin Ray\u2019s Resurgence \n\nAt the heart of a simple story is Kevin Ray Valentino\u2019s ever-growing talent. Some of the people I know here have browsed the pages. Ross Duncan , part owner of Greenlight Comics here in Adelaide says that Valentino\u2019s artwork reminds him of Geoff Darrow \u2019s art style minus the lines. Adelaide Ladies Comics Club co-founder Jess Cate was simply impressed about the artwork that goes for Bakokak, the same goes to local artist Greg Gates who saw the pages during last weekend\u2019s Comic Lovers & Creators Meet . The work Valentino has put on his book will put him on the map for more future projects to come. If he keeps doing this kind of masterpiece he already got rave reviews with the local indie comics\u2019 scene here in South Australia. \n\nOverall \u201cBakokak\u201d is a fun nod to old school monsters leveling cities and destroying its path. The lesson here has common sense in thinking strategically how to stop a raging frog rather than fight fire with fire, which the usual backward solution to everything besides a conflict with this type of creature. Gerry and Kevin Ray sure had an impressive collaboration on this book certainly there are more stories where that came from. \n\n\u201cBakokak\u201d will be available soon in the Philippines through Comic Odyssey for PHP 200.00 pesos.

I think BT-H wants you to rely on the Factory specs for ignition timing. This would be listed in Richardson. From memory, it is somewhere around 36\u00b0. Many owners have remarked that modern fuels like more retard of at least a few degrees. I think 32\u00b0 would be fine.\nI would use the piston stop method to determine TDC. The BT-H uses a 6 mm rod to mark the point where the timing should occur. When you have set the timing, make sure that after you insert the rod you put the bike in gear and nudge the rear wheel in the direction of forward motion until the rod is tight in the mag. With all of the slack is removed see where the degree wheel is. The point of taking the slack out is that when you slip the rod into the mag it is not a tight fit and the mag can move a few degrees in either direction. By making sure the rod is tight by gently moving the wheel in a forward direction you will be consistent about where you set the timing.\nDavid\n#688834 - 03/21/17 3:37 am Re: Best ignition advance [ Re: David Dunfey ] Joined: May 2009\nPosts: 272 Paul Sammut\nBritBike Forum member Paul Sammut\nBritBike Forum member\nJoined: May 2009\nPosts: 272\nOmaha, NE, USA As always, David, you're enormously helpful. Thank you so much. I Have the Richardson book, but the timing it recommends varies by piston make. I have no idea what that is in my bike, so hence my question. I will start at around 36 or 34 deg and rotate the \"magneto\" to fine tune it.\nPaul\n'74 Commando\n'75 T160 Trident\n'15 R1200 GS Adv\n'51 Vincent Rapide #689311 - 03/25/17 1:30 pm Re: Best ignition advance [ Re: Paul Sammut ] Joined: Feb 2007\nPosts: 2,200 Semper Gumby\nBritBike Forum member Semper Gumby\nBritBike Forum member\nJoined: Feb 2007\nPosts: 2,200\nAtlanta, GA USA So you can ride it to the TSMR right!\n\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4d\nGaggle of BSAs\na Honda\nan old BMW\nand a Montesa\nParking lot Elf in training #689321 - 03/25/17 4:18 pm Re: Best ignition advance [ Re: Semper Gumby ] Joined: May 2009\nPosts: 272 Paul Sammut\nBritBike Forum member Paul Sammut\nBritBike Forum member\nJoined: May 2009\nPosts: 272\nOmaha, NE, USA I'd love to, Semp, but there is a conference in D.C. at the same time at which I have a commitment.

Romania \u2013 39pc of the aircraft older than 20 years Posted by: Valeriu Lazar in NEWS , TOP NEWS 34 mins ago 0 0 Views \nAir transport operators in the European Union (EU) had in total over 6,500 aircraft, used for passengers or freight, in 2015. These excluded piston planes, helicopters and aircrafts with maximum take-off weight less than 2,600 kg, Eurostat informs. \nFrom the total EU aircraft fleet, around a fifth (21%) of the aircraft were aged less than 5 years, while 17% were 20 years old or more. Almost a third of the aircraft (30%) were 5 to 9 years old, 17% were 10 to 14 years old and 15% were 15 to 19 years old. \nDecember 7 marks the International Civil Aviation Day. \n1 in 4 EU aircraft operated in the United Kingdom \nIn 2015, the United Kingdom was the leading aircraft operator in the EU, running more than 1 250 aircraft. In other words, UK-based operators accounted for almost one in every five EU aircraft (19%). The top five was completed by Germany with over 1 100 aircraft (17% of the EU aircraft fleet), France (565 aircraft, 9%), Spain (485 aircraft, 7%) and Ireland (around 460 aircraft, 7%). \nLargest share of old aircraft operated in Croatia and Sweden, lowest in Finland, Luxembourg and Ireland \n\nAcross the EU Member States, over half the aircraft was aged 20 years or over in Croatia (61%), Sweden (60%), Bulgaria and Lithuania (55%), Slovakia (52%) as well as in Cyprus.

Japan is the one that holds the UN\u2019s rotating presidency. \nThe talks were requested by eight countries, Bolivia, Britain, Egypt, France, Italy, Senegal, Sweden and Uruguay. \nAfter Trump\u2019s announcement, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Jerusalem\u2019s final status could only be resolved through direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. \nPresident Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that the U.S. recognizes Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and that the American Embassy will be relocated there. \n\u201c That city is Israel\u2019s capital. It is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,\u201d Trump said at the White House. He added that the United States will build an American embassy in Jerusalem. The current embassy is in Tel Aviv, where most other countries have their embassies based. \n\u201c This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It\u2019s something that has to be done ,\u201d the US President pointed out, admitting his decision was driven by a political campaign pledge. \u201cW hile previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering ,\u201d he argued. \nTrump\u2019s announcement was welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a \u201ccourageous and just decision,\u201d however most of the US allies and the entire Arab world slammed the decision, warning it could jeopardize the current peace negotiations and could destabilize the entire Middle East region. \nThe European Union voiced \u201cserious concern,\u201d while UK dubbed the move as \u201cunhelpful\u201d. Germany has clearly said that it doesn\u2019t support the US President\u2019s decision, and France described it as \u201cregrettable\u201d. \nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has harshly criticized it as a \u201cdeplorable and unacceptable\u201d move and said it proves America\u2019s withdrawal as a sponsor of the peace process. Protests were staged in the Gaza Strip in response to US President Donald Trump\u2019s move, as Palestinian leaders called for three days of rage against the move. Hundreds of Palestinians took to the streets in Gaza City on Wednesday, waving banners denouncing Trump. \nTurkey also called the decision \u201cirresponsible\u201d and illegal. Israel\u2019s neighbors Jordan and Egypt both warned the decision violated international law and agreements, and could have highly negative consequences, while Iran said it would \u201cprovoke Muslims and inflame a new intifada,\u201d according to timesofisrael.com. The Saudi Arabia has also condemned Trump\u2019s decision saying it\u2019s \u201cirresponsible\u201d. \nKremlin also voiced \u2018concern about the possible deterioration of the situation in the event of recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel by the United States.\u2019\u201c However, it is premature to comment on the decisions that have not been made yet ,\u201d Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, as quoted by Tass agency, also adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas had a phone conversation on this topic. \nUntil the 1967 war, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan. The western part housed the seat of Israel\u2019s government. During the six-day war, Israel took control of the eastern part, that Palestinians consider the rightful capital of any future Palestinian state.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmitry peskov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio guterres", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "un security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romania journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestinian authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bolivia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uruguay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senegal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:57.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "61e0f3b4bfca2c9b2549c9c9d5ffd55cf5134a0a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJpIKC16qphebO71efzjghbK4e1YMmydAqc9Ks1H2ipN8zflYzEKV31tXqv5ROrAK8tdOaxD8eNl003hQ9FzsRrqDgsBZzRhc_T6vnd85.fjNFkdwrUKamPEXDgDlMWziYGB.oa3CSiGks59i9L_qXy1f_19pDmMSRIzQoMeAMeSCePs_qx_buWrK73zfPusQaPwkS7lltz2g-", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Holiday-Decorations-Christmas-Decorations/N-5yc1vZcgxo/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Home Accents Holiday 9 ft.

The Metropolis was a bit to complex to my idea so I went for a more minimalistic approach, where I could use an Arduino. Now the first part is working, I have 8 slide pots for frequency CV out, 8 thumb-wheels so I can choose between 0 and 9 repetitions for each step. U1 is an analog multiplexer/demultiplexer where the potentiometer is chosen that goes to a certain step. U2 is a BCD to decimal converter where the selected output is low while the non-selected outputs are all high. The LED's connected to the outputs of U2 are the LED's mounted in the sliders of the pots, so you can immediately see which step (potmeter) is active. U3 is again a BCD to decimal converter where the outputs are connected to the commons of the 8 thumb wheel switches to select which thumb wheel switch is active.

It said visa records are confidential under U.S. law. \nSpokeswoman Heather Nauert called on the Cambodian government to reinstate the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, which was dissolved by Supreme Court order last month, and free its leader Kem Sokha, imprisoned since September. She also urged Cambodia to allow civil society and media to operate freely. \nPrime Minister Hun Sen, who has held power for more than three decades, has sought to neutralize political opponents and silence critics ahead of national elections next year. Kem Sokha has been charged with trying to topple the government with U.S. support, which Washington has said is a baseless accusation. \nNauert said Cambodia\u2019s actions run counter to the Paris Peace Agreements of 1991. The United States and 18 other governments signed the accords, which ushered in democracy after the genocidal rule of the Khmer Rouge regime in the late 1970s, then occupation by Vietnam and civil war. \nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson will restrict entry into the United States of \u201cthose individuals involved in undermining democracy in Cambodia,\u201d Nauert said in a statement, adding that in certain circumstances, family members of those individuals will also be subject to visa restrictions. The department cited a provision of U.S. immigration law under which individuals can be denied entry if the secretary determines it would have \u201cadverse foreign policy consequences.\u201d \nThe White House has already terminated U.S. support of Cambodia\u2019s national election committee, saying last month that the July 2018 vote \u201cwill not be legitimate, free or fair.\u201d \n\u201cWe will continue to monitor the situation and take additional steps as necessary, while maintaining our close and enduring ties with the people of Cambodia,\u201d Nauert said. \nCambodian government spokesman Phay Siphan said Cambodia would give the U.S. government time to understand the current situation in the country but said Washington should not only believe what the opposition is saying. Still, he said the relationship between the U.S. and Cambodia remained unchanged despite the new restrictions. \n\u201cIt is the decision made by the United States government, but for Cambodia, the relationship of the two countries remains the same,\u201d he said Thursday. \nMonovithya Kem, an opposition spokeswoman currently in the U.S., welcomed the visa restrictions and called for targeted financial sanctions on senior officials in Hun Sen\u2019s government. Kem, who is the daughter of Kem Sokha, urged the U.S., Japan, Australia and the European Union to coordinate responses to the \u201ccrisis\u201d in Cambodia and help win her father\u2019s freedom. \nLike many prominent opposition figures, Kem has fled Cambodia as she fears arrest. \nHun Sen has been in office since 1985 and has held a tight grip on power since ousting a co-prime minister in a bloody 1997 coup. \nIn recent months, the government has intensified restrictions on civil society groups and independent media outlets. In September, it shut down the English-language Cambodia Daily. Authorities have shuttered radio stations that aired programming from U.S.-funded Radio Free Asia and Voice of America, whose reports they allege are biased. \nThe government also expelled the U.S. National Democratic Institute, which helped train political parties and election monitors, accusing it of colluding with its opponents. \nHun Sen has moved Cambodia closer to China in recent years and become increasingly critical of Washington. However, he\u2019s been complimentary of President Donald Trump. \nSpeaking at Asian leaders\u2019 summit attended by Trump last month, Hun Sen praised the U.S. leader for non-interference in affairs of other nations, but complained the U.S. Embassy in Cambodia was not adhering to the policy.

The wish to control Justice is stronger than reason, Prosecutor General says Posted by: Valeriu Lazar in POLITICS , TOP NEWS 2 hours ago 0 5 Views \nThe plenum of the Chamber of Deputies adopted on Wednesday the proposal to amend Law 303/2004 on the statute of judges and prosecutors, according to which the state will be bound to turn against the magistrate who committed an error in bad faith or serious negligence for damages. \nIoan Terea, PSD deputy of Sibiu, is under criminal investigation after an incident last night, involving two protesters. They accuse him of hitting them by car, and one of them requested to be taken to hospital, accusing one-arm pain. In reply, Ioan Terea states that the two have simply threw themselves in front of the car. \n\u201cAfter the damage was covered by the state under the irrevocable judgment in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (6), the state shall seek compensation from the judge or prosecutor who, in bad faith or serious negligence, committed the judicial error which led to damages,\u201d the amendment adopted by the plenum of the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday reads. \nThe Chamber of Deputies is the first chamber notified in this case, and the decision-making body is the Senate. \nAugustin Lazar: The desire to control Justice is stronger than reason \nProsecutor General Augustin Lazar has told the journalists before the Superior Council of Magistracy (CSM) sitting on Thursday, talking about amendments to the laws of Justice: \n\u201cI could not characterize the activity of the Chamber of Deputies, but I can tell you that amending the laws of Justice, under these improper conditions and without having impact studies on the results, will perturb Justice.

I am looking for some advice. I'm in a weird spot with my knowledge of this stuff. The mechanical aspect of everything (Soldering, SMD Rework, Repair, PCB/faceplates/enclosure design, and construction) I work on at a professional level as my day-to-day job. This stuff I am really good at. However, I have an amateur understanding of the \"why\" in all of this. I can read a schematic and follow wiring diagrams, but my biggest hurdle is knowing why all this stuff works in conjunction with one another. A few months ago I watched a video of a guy going through a Juno circuit step by step. He went from the start to the finish of the VCO circuit. This video opened a floodgate of questions, and since then, I have been seeking knowledge to better understand how circuits are put together and the decisions behind their design. It was a valuable video to me. My question to you is how do I get into this stuff? EVERY single resource I find (Books, webpages, videos, etc.) are either two levels of understanding; VERY basic beginner or Very Advanced. I feel I am in the middle somewhere. It seems like there is no transition for people who understand the basics, but want to move forward with their understanding. Does anyone have any recommendations for how to transition? I eventually want to build some personal eurorack modules. On a somewhat related sidenote; I heard of a collection of schematics for synth stuff floating around. I want to say it's in a book, but it could be an online repository. I remember reading an interview with Tony Rolando about how he got into synth stuff. He mentioned that this book was a big help in his understanding of the circuits. Does anyone know what this is? Also, any other books or info about engineering applied to synths/ music stuff would be awesome.

Anyway, once my AOS is received what processing time lines do I look at. The Nebraska service center? Or my local Field office? My local office shows their processing times as pretty fast. So does my application eventually get sent from the nebraska service center, and is the whole thing (i130 and I 485) then send to my field office? Any idea how fast my application gets sent to my field office? Does my I-130 have to be approved before the rest gets sent to the field office? From what some one told me who also is in my area, once its at my local office it should be pretty quick, but how long does it take to get there?
