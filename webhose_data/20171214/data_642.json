Many expect the bottom to drop and the prices will fall drastically. \nNow, I will not predict what is going to happen with cryptocurrency prices. But I am going to give you some facts you should know. And, if you want to keep up-to-date on crypto prices, you can at this link. \nThese facts should help you decide if investing in a cryptocurrency is right for you. Cryptocurrency Facts #1: Digital Money \nCryptocurrency is digital money that is created using blockchain technology and managed with top-of-the-line encryption. \nTo store your cryptocurrency, you use a digital wallet. That wallet has its own digital address that allows you to accept, spend or transfer your cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency Facts #2: The First \nThe first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin. It was created in 2008 and went public in 2009. Cryptocurrency Facts #3: How Many? \nCurrently, there are over 1,100 various cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency Facts #4: How New Crypto Is Created \nUnlike the dollar that seems to be printed without the actual backing of any precious metals, the majority or cryptocurrency is created when a person accepts, spends or transfers their cryptocurrency. \nThe reason is, when a transaction is made, the crypto community allows their computers to be a part of the transaction by performing computations. When the transaction is complete, the owners of the computers who helped process the transaction are awarded with newly made cryptocurrency. \nNow some people have this thought that they could just \u201chook in\u201d to the crypto community and let their computers mine cryptocurrency through computation. But the energy use alone can cost more than what the person receives. \nYou essentially must \u201cgo green\u201d by using solar or wind energy to make crypto mining profitable. Cryptocurrency Facts #5: Number Of Bitcoin Created Daily \nThe statistics are amazing! \nEach day, approximately 3,600 new Bitcoins are created using blockchain technology. \nConsider this\u2026 Just looking at the current price of Bitcoin, that is 34,790,400. \nThat is a lot of money being made daily. Cryptocurrency Facts #6: Hoarders \nIt has been determined that over 60% of the Bitcoins in accounts have never been used in any way. \nSo anyone out there sitting on a Bitcoin, I DO accept Bitcoin donations\u2026 Cryptocurrency Facts #7: The Big Loser \nThere have been some people who have become millionaires thanks to cryptocurrency. But 1 man lost big. \nIt seems James Howell threw his hard drive in the trash. He forgot he had over 7 \u00bd Million $ in Bitcoin on the drive. \nJames had a very bad day. Cryptocurrency Facts #8: The Crypto ATM \nVancouver, Canada is the first location of a Bitcoin cash machine. You simply enter your wallet info and you can draw out cash which will be deleted from your Bitcoin stash. Cryptocurrency Facts #9: Illegal \nIn 2013, Thailand made Bitcoin illegal in the country. But it has since been dropped and Thai natives can legally have Bitcoins. Cryptocurrency Facts #10: Employment \nThe crypto industry currently employs over 2,000 people. Cryptocurrency Facts #11: College Tuition \nSeveral colleges will now accept Bitcoin as a method to pay your college tuition. That includes: New York\u2019s King\u2019s College The United Kingdom\u2019s University of Cumbria and the University of Nicosia in Cyprus Cryptocurrency Facts #12: Not Infinite \nThe majority of cryptocurrencies have a maximum amount of coins that can ever be mined. Once that amount gets close, it will be quite difficult for any computers attempting to mine. \nHere are a few of the maximum crypto coins: Dash \u2013 18,900,000 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eric tippet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric tippetts product", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james howell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of nicosia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "college tuition  several", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of cumbria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto atm  vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digital money  cryptocurrency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cyprus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:08.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b6466089cdc6f7efc2c6bf125dc9e0d33154413", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApuZp3cC4b_GpF6z83Z.zpUDaNJvvHHeOWlnxqTZVVGgUtPhbWqQMchsFLrSE.ZzdmvjIKyjYHiGTm.8oASxvTy17p4HP6sMVYUV0bnZzQMqqqqWDZ5OLkVK7NTsRqMqEoU42s3xfJgnTw--", "site_full": "mebankers.net", "site": "mebankers.net", "site_section": "http://mebankers.net/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "The Middle East Banking News Network", "title": "Dubai wealth managers dismiss UAE inclusion in EU tax haven blacklist", "title_full": "Dubai wealth managers dismiss UAE inclusion in EU tax haven blacklist", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4b6466089cdc6f7efc2c6bf125dc9e0d33154413", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApuZp3cC4b_GpF6z83Z.zpUDaNJvvHHeOWlnxqTZVVGgUtPhbWqQMchsFLrSE.ZzdmvjIKyjYHiGTm.8oASxvTy17p4HP6sMVYUV0bnZzQMqqqqWDZ5OLkVK7NTsRqMqEoU42s3xfJgnTw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "News Aggregation Team", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Dubai wealth managers dismiss UAE inclusion in EU tax haven blacklist", "text": "Legal, Tax, Regulation & Compliance December 6, 2017 \nIn order to read this article you will need to register for a FREE TRIAL with us, please click here \nEnter your email for quick registration If you already have an account, Click here to login.

The journalists, including photographers and camera crews, have been handed detailed schedules of events that will take place in different parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. \nWhen we sit in our living rooms and watch the news coming out of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, let us ask ourselves: How many of these \"events\" are, in fact, media burlesques? Why are journalists allowing themselves to be duped by the Palestinian propaganda machine, which spews hatred and violence from morning until night? \nIt is high time for some self-reflection on the part of the media: Do they really wish to continue serving as a mouthpiece for those Arabs and Muslims who intimidate and terrorize the West? \nThe \"rivers of blood\" we are being promised are flowing as we speak. Yet, it is the knife that Arabs and Muslims take to one another's throats that is the source of this crimson current, not some statement made by a US president. Perhaps that could finally be an event worth covering by the roving reporters of the region? \nA short three hours after US President Donald Trump phoned Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas to inform him of his intention to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a number of Palestinian photojournalists received a phone call from Bethlehem. \nThe callers were Palestinian \"activists,\" who invited the photographers to come to the city to document an \"important event.\" When the photographers arrived, they discovered that the \"important event\" was a handful of Palestinian \"activists\" who wanted to burn posters of Trump in front of the cameras. \nThe \"activists\" waited patiently as the photojournalists and cameramen set up their equipment to get the \"important event\" on film. Shortly thereafter, the media was abuzz with reports about \"angry Palestinian protesters taking to the streets to protest\" Trump's intention to move the embassy to Jerusalem and his recognition of the city as the capital of Israel. The handful of Palestinians who were filmed burning the Trump pictures were made to look as if they were part of a mass protest sweeping Palestinian communities. The handful of Palestinians in Bethlehem who were filmed burning pictures of U.S. President Donald Trump on December 6 were made by the media to look as if they were part of a mass protest sweeping Palestinian communities. (Image source: CBS News video screenshot) \nThe incident represents yet another example of the collusion between the Palestinians and the media, whose representatives are always more than happy to serve as mouthpieces for the Palestinian propaganda machine and provide an open platform for broadcasting Palestinian threats against Israel and the US. \nHad the photographers and cameramen not shown up to the erstwhile \"spontaneous\" poster-burning event, the Palestinian activists would have been forced to quietly slink back to one of Bethlehem's fine coffee shops. \nYet, there was no worry on that score: the Palestinian activists are well aware that local and foreign reporters are starving for sensationalism -- and what better fits the bill than posters of Trump going up in flames in the middle of the birthplace of Jesus, on the eve of Christmas and as thousands of Christian pilgrims and tourists are converging on the city? \nBy misrepresenting the poster burning \"ceremony\" as a reflection of widespread Palestinian rage concerning Trump's policy on Jerusalem, the international media is once again complicit in promoting the propaganda of Palestinian spin doctors. Palestinian leaders and spokesmen strive to create the impression that Trump's policy regarding Jerusalem will bring the region down in flames. They also seek to send a message to the American people that their president's policies endanger their lives. In effect, the media has volunteered to serve the Palestinian campaign of intimidation. And the media convergence on the poster-burning farce in Bethlehem is just the beginning. \nNow that the Palestinians have managed, with the help of the media, to burn these images into the minds of millions of Americans, they are planning more staged protests. The goal: to terrify the American public and force Trump to rescind his decision regarding the status of Jerusalem. This tactic of intimidation through the media is not new. In fact, it is something that has been happening for decades, largely thanks to the buy-in of the mainstream media in the West. \nNow, Palestinian and Western journalists have been invited to cover a series of protests planned by the Palestinians in the coming days and weeks in response to Trump's policies. The journalists, including photographers and camera crews, have been handed detailed schedules of events that will take place in different parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The journalists have been promised more scenes of burning photos of Trump and US flags. Some of the journalists have even received tips as to the locations where \"clashes\" are supposed to take place between Palestinian rioters and Israel Defense Forces soldiers. In other words, the journalists have been told precisely where they need to be in order to document Palestinians throwing stones at the soldiers -- and the predicted the IDF response. \nHere is the funny part. If, for whatever reason, the cameras are a no-show, the \"activists\" are likely to be as well. In the Palestinian world, it is all about manipulating the media and recruiting it in favor of the cause. And the cause is always bashing Israel -- with bashing Trump not far behind. \nYes, the Palestinians will protest in the coming days against Trump. Yes, they will take to the streets and throw stones at IDF soldiers. Yes, they will burn pictures of Trump and US flags. And yes, they will try to carry out terror attacks against Israelis. \nBut when we sit in our living rooms and watch the news coming out of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, let us ask ourselves: How many of these \"events\" are, in fact, media burlesques? Why are journalists allowing themselves to be duped by the Palestinian propaganda machine, which spews hatred and violence from morning until night? And, why are the journalists exaggerating and compounding the Palestinian threats for violence and anarchy? \nFirst, many of the journalists want to appease their readers and editors by offering them stories that reflect negatively on Israel. Second, some of the journalists believe that writing anti-Israel stories paves the way for them to win awards from assorted professed \"virtue-signaling\" organizations. Third, many journalists believe that writing anti-Israel reports give them access to so-called \"liberals\" and a supposedly \"enlightened\" coterie who romanticize being \"on the right side of history.\" They do not want to see that 21 Muslim states have been trying for many decades to destroy one Jewish state; instead, they appear to think that if journalists are \"liberal\" and \"open-minded,\" they need to support the \"underdog,\" who they believe are \"the Palestinians.\" Fourth, many of the journalists see the conflict as being between bad guys (supposedly the Israelis) and good guys (supposedly the Palestinians) and that it is their duty to stand with the \"good guys,\" even if the \"good guys\" are engaged in violence and terrorism. \nRecently, more than 300 Muslim worshipers were massacred by Muslim terrorists while praying in a mosque in Sinai, Egypt. That tragedy was probably covered by fewer journalists than the orchestrated Trump-poster episode in Bethlehem. Where was the outcry in the Arab and Islamic world? Now, Arabs and Muslims are talking about \"days of rage\" in protest against Trump. Why were there no \"days of rage\" in the Arab and Islamic countries when more than 300 worshipers, many of them children, were massacred during Friday prayers? \nIt is high time for some self-reflection on the part of the media: Do they really wish to continue serving as a mouthpiece for those Arabs and Muslims who intimidate and terrorize the West? \nJournalists are actively colluding with the Palestinian Authority and Hamas to create the false impression that World War III will erupt if the US embassy is moved to Jerusalem. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims and Christians have been massacred since the beginning of the \"Arab Spring\" more than six years ago. They were killed by Muslim terrorists and other Arabs. The bloodshed continues to this day in Yemen, Libya, Syria, Iraq and Egypt. \nSo, make no mistake about it: the \"rivers of blood\" we are being promised are flowing as we speak. Yet, it is the knife that Arabs and Muslims take to one another's throats that is the source of this crimson current, not some statement made by a US president.

But they\u2019re inching closer.\n\u201cThe good news is we\u2019re getting healthier, maybe as healthy as we\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said after yesterday\u2019s practice yesterday at Warrior Ice Arena.\nThe bright spot was the return of rookie winger Jake DeBrusk, who missed three games because of an upper-body injury, perhaps a concussion. DeBrusk skated with David Krejci and Anders Bjork, a line that might stick together when the B\u2019s host the Arizona Coyotes tonight at the Garden.\n\u201cJake obviously was getting closer, and he looks good now,\u201d said Cassidy. \u201cHe\u2019ll be a gametime decision. He\u2019d have to be activated first. That\u2019s something (general manager Don Sweeney) and I will discuss.\u201d\nThe Bruins must open a roster spot to activate DeBrusk. If they choose to put a player on waivers, the top two candidates are wingers Matt Beleskey and Frank Vatrano. Beleskey would seem the obvious call because he\u2019s in the third season of a five-year deal that carries an annual salary cap hit of $3.8 million.\nTeams might see Vatrano as a useful goal-scoring threat.\nAbsent from practice were defenseman Torey Krug and forward Ryan Spooner. Krug likely will play tonight. Spooner likely will not.\nDefenseman Adam McQuaid (broken leg) has been skating and has an outside chance to return next Wednesday in Detroit. Winger Peter Cehlarik (left leg) will be out a while longer.\nTomorrow\u2019s game begins a stretch where the B\u2019s should be able to pile up points \u2014 playing eight of their next 10 games at home, with road games in Detroit and Buffalo.\nDeBrusk\u2019s return will be a big plus for a team that has played well recently with exception of Monday\u2019s 5-3 loss in Nashville, where the Bruins spotted the Predators a 4-0 lead. DeBrusk was a healthy scratch against Toronto but had six points in five games before getting hurt against Edmonton on Nov.\u200926.\n\u201cLike a lot of young guys, he\u2019ll have some ups and downs,\u201d Cassidy said of the 21-year-old. \u201cI thought he was in a bit of a down period (earlier). We addressed that. He missed a game, came back, took it to heart and played really well.\n\u201cHe was trending up again, but these are things you have to learn to deal with, some time off, some injuries, some setbacks. Hopefully he\u2019ll be a better player for it going forward.\u201d\nCassidy said Krug sat out practice for \u201cmaintenance.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make that decision (today), see how he feels,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201c But the plan (is) to have him.\u201d\nHe added Krug\u2019s ailment is \u201csimilar to the problem from before,\u201d but the team never gave details of that injury.\nSpooner\u2019s injury is of the lower-body variety. He missed more than a month because of a groin injury before returning for five of the past six games.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at it (and) re-evaluating,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cWe chose to keep him off (yesterday). We\u2019ll see how he is tomorrow and go from there.\u201d\nSo even though the trainer\u2019s room remains busy, things are moving in the right direction.\n\u201cIt took .\u2009.\u2009. longer than I\u2019m sure (Cassidy) anticipated,\u201d center Patrice Bergeron said. \u201cI think it made us a better team. .\u2009.\u2009.

(AP Photo/Rui Vieira) prev next comments LIVERPOOL, England \u2014 Four months after asking to leave Liverpool, Philippe Coutinho scored a hat trick wearing the captain's armband to propel the club into the Champions League knockout stage on a record-setting night for English soccer.\nThe Brazil playmaker headlined a devastating display by Liverpool in its 7-0 thrashing of Spartak Moscow at Anfield on Wednesday, with the other three members of the attacking \"Fab 4\" \u2014 Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah \u2014 also scoring.\nCoutinho started the season in dispute with Liverpool, which refused to sell him to Barcelona following repeated bids by the Spanish team in August. The fact that he was handed the armband by coach Juergen Klopp against Spartak is a sign of the reconciliation between the two parties, even though speculation continues about a renewed bid by Barcelona in January.\nLiverpool fans are just enjoying him while they can. And who knows how far Coutinho can take the team in Europe's top competition this season?\nThis win \u2014 its second 7-0 in the group stage \u2014 saw Liverpool top Group E and become the fifth English team to qualify for the last 16. It is the first time a country has had five representatives in the Champions League knockout stage, signaling a revival by the English after a period of underachievement since Chelsea was European champion in 2012.\nLiverpool was one of four English teams to qualify in first place, along with Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham, and its tally of 23 group-stage goals is the second-highest in the competition's history, only behind Paris Saint-Germain's 25 from this season too.\nSpartak arrived in the northwest of England still in with a chance of qualifying. The Russian team left in humiliation, ripped apart by Liverpool's attacking quartet.\n\"When it was 6-0,\" Klopp said, \"we were looking at each other (on the Liverpool bench) and saying, 'How did this happen?'\"\nCoutinho scored his first hat trick for Liverpool and it started when he stroked home a penalty after Georgi Dzhikiya tugged Salah in the penalty area. Liverpool had failed to score its last four penalties at Anfield, including attempts by Firmino and James Milner in the Champions League.\nCoutinho completed a team move involving Mane, Salah and Firmino with a low left-foot finish into the corner to make it 2-0 in the 15th, and more dreadful defending from Spartak led to a third goal three minutes later.\nMane pounced on a mistake by Dzhikiya, ran up the right wing and sent in a cross that Spartak defender Serdar Tasci could only block with his chest. Firmino latched onto the loose ball and curled home a shot with the outside of his right foot.\nLiverpool squandered a three-goal lead with a second-half collapse at Sevilla two weeks ago, which cost them a chance to clinch first place with a round to spare, but there was to be no repeat here.\nMilner, on as a substitute, crossed from the left for Mane to meet with a fierce volley past goalkeeper Aleksandr Selikhov in the 47th.\nCoutinho completed his hat trick three minutes later by firing in a shot that deflected off Salvatore Bocchetti and flew inside the near post, leaving Selikhov wrong-footed.\nMane bundled in substitute Daniel Sturridge's cross for the sixth and Salah, the Premier League's top scorer, got in on the act in the 86th with some great footwork and a finish high into the net.\n\"I can't explain it,\" said Spartak coach Massimo Carrera. \"They almost played like they were afraid of Liverpool.\"\nLiverpool, which is in the knockout stage of the Champions League for the first time in nine years, could still be paired with Real Madrid, Juventus or Bayern Munich in Monday's draw for the last 16.\nThe negatives for Liverpool were the yellow card for Emre Can, which rules him out of the first leg of the last 16, and a first-half injury to left back Alberto Moreno that could force him out of the Merseyside derby against Everton on Sunday.\nSpartak finished third in the group and dropped into the Europa League.\n___\nMore AP Champions League coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/ChampionsLeague\n___\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80",

(AP Photo/Frank Augstein) prev next comments LONDON \u2014 Washing away the pain of last year's botched Champions League campaign, Tottenham completed this group stage as Europe's leading team.\nA 3-0 victory over an ineffective APOEL on Wednesday took the team to 16 points, the highest total of any team this season, and first place in Group H ahead of holder Real Madrid.\nThat's some progress for a team that could not even make the knockout phase last season, and is only appearing in the Champions League for the third time.\nWith top spot already secured, Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino even had the luxury of giving fringe players a run-out at Wembley Stadium. Fernando Llorente and Georges-Kevin Nkoudou seized their chance by scoring their first goals for Tottenham, either side of Son Heung-min's strike.\n\"It's a massive change,\" Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said. \"Last year we were so disappointed about how we played, about how difficult it was for us to compete in the Champions League. This season we have improved a lot.\"\nNot on the domestic front, though. Runners-up last season in the Premier League, Tottenham has slipped to sixth and is already 18 points adrift of leader Manchester City. The wait for a first English title since 1961 will extend into another season unless there's a rapid transformation.\nAnd there's a danger the only way back into the Champions League is by winning it for the first time.\n\"We have spent a lot of energy ... and maybe it has affected us a bit in the Premier League,\" Pochettino said. \"Now we have to be focused on the Premier League and win games there.\"\nThat is something Tottenham has not achieved in a month, collecting only two points from its last four fixtures.\n\"We wanted to get back to winning ways and we did that tonight,\" said Dele Alli, one of only three players retained from the side that drew at Watford on Saturday. \"It's important that as a team we stay together and keep building.\"\nPochettino did have a chance to test the depth of the resources at his disposal in the buildup to the busy end-of-year fixture program.\nLlorente's wait for a Tottenham goal ended in his 17th game, on only his fourth start since joining from Swansea as cover for Harry Kane in August.\n\"It's difficult when you don't have opportunities,\" Llorente said, \"but you have to create them for yourself.\"\nThe 32-year-old striker scored on the turn after meeting Serge Aurier's cross in the 20th minute.\n\"It's important for him,\" Pochettino said. \"When you are a striker you need to feel the net. Of course players need time to adapt, when you arrive at a new team with no pre-season you need time to find your best level.\n\"It's difficult to play 20 or 30 minutes, it's important for him to feel he can cope for 90 minutes. He is a player who is going to help the team a lot. He has been helping a lot but now with more confidence and belief he is going to help more.\"\nLlorente went on to set up the second. Son Heung-min played a one-two with Llorente on the edge of the area before striking low into the net in the 37th.\nNkoudou's chance to get off the mark came in the 80th minute. The French midfielder, who joined in August 2016 from Marseille, netted with a deflected shot after waltzing through the Cypriot side's defense.\n\"I'm very happy, for different players had a different opportunity to play and show their quality,\" Pochettino said. \"They will add quality and put pressure on the players in the first XI. To have more players with the confidence to compete for a place is important.\"\nThe omens are good for Tottenham in the Champions League. The last two English teams to collect 16 points in the group stage went on to reach the final: Arsenal in 2006 and Manchester United in 2008. The furthest Tottenham has previously reached was the quarterfinals in 2011.\nBut despite winning its group, thanks to a victory and draw against Madrid, Tottenham could still face a tough team when the competition resumes in February. Bayern Munich and Juventus are among the second-place teams who could await the north London club in the draw on Monday.\nAPOEL exited Europe after finishing last in the group. Borussia Dortmund took third place to qualify for the Europa League despite losing to second-place Real Madrid 3-2.\n___\nMore AP Champions League coverage: www.apnews.com/tag/ChampionsLeague", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "georges-kevin nkoudou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "augstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "serge aurier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pochettino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "llorente", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nkoudou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moussa sissoko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dele alli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry kane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mauricio pochettino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nauzet parez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "son heung-min", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fernando llorente", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "champions league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "real madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press tottenham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tottenham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juventus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bayern munich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "borussia dortmund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europa league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "premier league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apoel nicosia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apoel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tottenham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wembley stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marseille", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swansea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:09.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6354f7f479a5028ed8f8384c1fcd401946169022", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbU1RQqGLQ7tg4gYyi_mnitaf8UwO5JjNrgy3hfjC1c4n194z.mRm3KcGAmwDneUjbKiHT6oOuv7KcTurnpqfY4IAtREyQF1RGvlHYRusavbI", "site_full": "www.expedia.fr", "site": "expedia.fr", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.fr/Herceghalom-Hotel.d6129491.Voyage-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Hotel Herceghalom -

It\u2019s crucial to document your work , both for your sanity and to help others who want to learn your awesome resource. \nHowever, creating online documentation can be a real pain. Thankfully, Docsify makes it easier by providing a free documentation generator running on Markdown . \nThis is not a typical static site generator and it does not require static HTML/CSS pages . Instead, it loads Markdown files dynamically and displays them as web pages. Pretty neat! \nCheck out the Docsify homepage for a preview of the layout , along with further setup details . \nIt does require that you create the index.html file yourself , which can then be uploaded to GitHub Pages or hosted on your own server. From there, you just write Markdown files for each page and use those as your primary docs. Read Also: 10 Programming Habits Developers Should Adopt \nThe entire process is outlined in detail in the quick start guide , so that\u2019s probably the best place to start. This can all run through npm , so it really helps to know your command prompt or at least be willing to learn. \nIt is possible to create a raw HTML file yourself and just copy/paste the template from Docsify\u2019s setup guide. But, I recommend doing it dynamically , since it saves a ton of time\u2014and isn\u2019t that really the point? \nAs you learn the Docsify system, you can add features using Markdown or raw HTML . These features include a custom navigation bar and even your own cover page with your project\u2019s logo. \nDocsify even comes packaged with a bunch of free themes if you want pre-designed layouts to work with. Or, you can browse through their showcase gallery to see which projects use Docsify for their documentation. \nAll the basic setup info & file downloads can be found on GitHub , so head over there if you want to give this a shot. \nYou can also see a live demo on the main Docsify documentation page which, sure enough, runs on Docsify. So, if you like that web page layout you can use that same template and run it all through Docsify, 100% free and open-source. Read Also: How to Publish a Github Page \nHongkiat.com (HKDC).

In one sitting, we disemboweled both Santa and Lambchop. pic.twitter.com/3RjA10KdTc \u2014 Jeffrey Paul King (@JeffreyPaulKing) December 7, 2017 The Twitter is getting heated over Al Franken, verging on ugly. A Tweet that stood out to me, which I cannot find, was expressing the author's conflicted feelings, but finding that he can't compromise on this issue. Ultimately he feels that Franken should go. Others point out that it won't do much good politically and we'd be sacrificing a fine Senator. I don't find that to be persuasive. If his announcement tomorrow is that he denies everything and will stay and contest the allegations, I'll do my best to believe they are at least overblown, at worst false. But I don't believe that right now, and his saying that he wants to let the whatever-it-is in the Senate play out won't convince me. He strongly denies the latest allegation. What I have not heard come out of his mouth is \"I have never groped a woman without her consent.\" Or even \"I haven't groped a woman since I got woke.\" Even if some of the allegations are questionable, that sinks him for me. Saying he never propositioned someone to join him in a bathroom, and NOT saying he didn't grope her first, smacks of a bad liar with something to hide. Maybe he didn't grope her. But has he ever done it? It's a simple question to address and he has not done so. This might not be a court proceeding, but if I were on his jury, I'd vote to convict. Paul Waldman wrote today that \"grabbing a woman's butt while posing for a picture is a rotten thing to do, but it isn't as bad as making a woman's workplace a nightmare of discomfort and fear....\" Legally that's true. On a personal level I'm not so sure. We'll call it a draw. One takes work on the part of the harasser; the other violates your person. I can get a harasser fired (theoretically). I can make his life hell (theoretically). I can never get back the sense that the world is a good place and I deserve respect that a groper makes off with in a flat second. Innocence evaporates. Life is never quite as joyful again. Southern California is burning. It's bad. Stay safe.

As with anyone with experience will know, buying wooden planks/boards for the carpentry formation constitutes a huge proportion of the total cost. Moreover, it is mostly not useful after the decking as it is covered with concrete.\nSo you can kindly link me up with any available seller that has just finished decking in the site so that I can buy the used planks.

Spent a lot of time downloading apps and used it until iPhone 3g came out. which was faster and was all the buzz but really did exactly what the first one did. At some point, the iPhones did supportMMSs which was native on things such as flip phones. Then there was the iPhone 4g which I did have and it was cool but still did pretty much the same thing. The UI was an eyesore because of the panel layout of apps. my first android was an HTC which was customized by htc with their interface and eventually I moved to Samsung. At some point, the iPhone became a status symbol more than anything else. I greatly enjoy the ability to customize my phone to do whatever I need it to do.

The status is one step from the highest level of \"extinct in the wild\". \nThe decline of the population, which may have become extreme in the past 11 years, is likely to be driven by excessive trapping at migration and wintering sites, according to the red list of IUCN. \nBack in 2000, the species was listed under \"least concern\", the lowest level on the six-grade alert system. \nEvery year, yellow-breasted buntings migrate from Siberia southward to wintering grounds in south China and southeast Asia in a journey spanning up to 4,000 kilometers. \nIn South China's Guangdong province, where the yellow-breasted bunting is considered a delicacy, there were records of consumption of the bird as early as the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). \nOnce restricted to a small area of southern China, the practice of cooking yellow-breasted buntings has become more widespread and popular due to increasing affluence, and now hunters have to travel widely to find sufficient birds, according to the IUCN. \nDespite a ban on selling the bird introduced by the Chinese government in 1997, illicit trading has been rampant, driving the species to the verge of extinction. \nA bird protection volunteer told Beijing Youth Daily that through undercover investigations, it was found that most of the birds sold in Guangdong were transported from north China. \nA man surnamed Liu from the northern province of Hebei told Beijing Youth Daily that back in 2000, more than 400 yellow-breasted buntings could be captured in one net; and in 2008, he could still catch more than 50 birds in one day. But today, only one or two can be caught in a day. \nLiu said bird hunting is a lucrative business: a net costs only 15 yuan ($2.3), while a yellow-breasted bunting can be sold for about 20 yuan. \nLiu said after the birds were captured, they would be put into cages to be fattened up for around 20 days. Then they would be suffocated in a sealed bag before being sold to south China. \nAnd according to bird protection volunteers, sales of the yellow-breasted bunting in Guangdong have gone underground in recent years as a result of the government's crackdown campaigns. \nIn some restaurants, where one yellow-breasted bunting is priced at up to 60 yuan, its name on the menu would be replaced with \"rice bird\" to avoid inspection from authorities. \nMedia reports show there are 28 cases of illegal hunting of yellow-breasted bunting in China from 2000 to 2013. In one case, more than 100,000 yellow-breasted buntings were seized by authorities in Guangzhou and Shaoguan, two cities in Guangdong province. \nDespite its popularity among diners, the yellow-breasted bunting is not much different from other birds in terms of nutrition value. \nThe yellow-breasted bunting differs little from pigeons or quail in nutrition, said Zhu Yi, a food science professor with China Agricultural University. And as a migratory species, the birds may host unidentified viruses and many illegally captured ones may be poisoned to death, threatening the health of diners, he said.

It's a truly gargantuan black hole, some 800 million times the mass of our sun. The size amazed and puzzled astronomers, according to reports. (Photo/Agencies) \nAstronomers have uncovered the farthest known supermassive black hole, which is 800 million times the mass of our Sun. \n\"This black hole grew far larger than we expected in only 690 million years after the Big Bang, which challenges our theories about how black holes form,\" study co-author Daniel Stern from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California said in a news release. \nAstronomers combined data from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) with ground-based surveys to identify potential distant objects to study, then followed up with Carnegie Observatories' Magellan telescopes in Chile. \nCarnegie astronomer Eduardo Banados led the effort to identify candidates out of the hundreds of millions of objects WISE found that would be worth following up with Magellan. \nThe newly found black hole, detailed in a paper published online in the journal Nature Wednesday, is positioned at the center of a galaxy, a phenomenon called a quasar. \nThis quasar is especially interesting because it comes from a time when the universe was just beginning to emerge from its dark ages. The discovery will provide fundamental information about the universe when it was only 5 percent of its current age, according to the study. \nThe quasar's distance is determined by what is called its redshift, a measurement of how much the wave-length of its light is stretched by the expansion of the universe before reaching Earth. The higher the redshift, the greater the distance, and the farther back astronomers are looking in time when they observe the object. \nThis newly discovered quasar has a redshift of 7.54, based on the detection of ionized carbon emissions from the galaxy that hosts the massive black hole. That means the quasar's light traveled some 13 billion light-years before reaching the Magellan telescopes. \n\"Quasars are among the brightest and most distant known celestial objects and are crucial to understand the early universe,\" said co-author Bram Venemans of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany. \nScientists estimate that the sky contains 20 to 100 quasars which are as bright and distant as this quasar. However, the newly discovered one is not only the most distant, but also the only example we have that can be seen before the universe became reionized. \n\"It was the universe's last major transition and one of the current frontiers of astrophysics,\" Banados said. \nIn the coming years, astronomers hope to find more. \"With several next-generation, even-more-sensitive facilities currently being built, we can expect many exciting discoveries in the very early universe in the coming years,\" Stern said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mo", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "eduardo banados", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banados", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bram venemans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel stern", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jet propulsion laboratory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magellan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max planck institute for astronomy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carnegie observatories", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pasadena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:11.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b62e55ff7b60855a91a6f7c8f0ec930f69853e51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQh2lA_jY_RhQ2YF34CEU2GMljSGdwSsl.BLvhpGXWDZt.ENs8kLSfMY8xyRhGyMj.vhia3ppPoGU8ZBkbhsBsZfVOaK3_hIM6.51QqvxOEIw--", "site_full": "colombiareports.com", "site": "colombiareports.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["travel", "south_america"], "section_title": "", "title": "Colombia's senate rejects congressional seats for victims", "title_full": "Colombia's senate rejects congressional seats for victims", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://colombiareports.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/efrain_cepeda.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b62e55ff7b60855a91a6f7c8f0ec930f69853e51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQh2lA_jY_RhQ2YF34CEU2GMljSGdwSsl.BLvhpGXWDZt.ENs8kLSfMY8xyRhGyMj.vhia3ppPoGU8ZBkbhsBsZfVOaK3_hIM6.51QqvxOEIw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adriaan Alsema", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Colombia's senate rejects congressional seats for victims", "text": "Colombia\u2019s senate rejects congressional seats for victims written by Adriaan Alsema December 7, 2017 \nColombia\u2019s president Juan Manuel Santos said Wednesday he will ask the court to reject a senate decision to sink the reservation of 16 congressional seats for victims. \nSenate President Efrain Cepeda ( Conservative Party ) announced earlier that he would uphold a rejection of the victims\u2019 seats that was part of a peace process with Marxist FARC guerrillas. \nThe bill was denied after it obtained 50 votes in the 102-seat chamber. Colombia\u2019s congress in chaos over peace process \nPresident Juan Manuel Santos claimed the bill was effectively approved by a majority because three senators left their seats vacant after being jailed. \nThe political participation for victims was the only part of a major political reform agreed with the FARC and the UN that had survived Congress until its final vote. \nWe will continue fighting for the approval of this bill for the victims, and because it is one of the commitments we made at the negotiations table. President Juan Manuel Santos \nThe victims have the right to be heard for a short time, the victims were the ones who suffered most from this armed conflict. President Juan Manuel Santos \nCepeda defended his decision to stick to his initial rejecting of the bill that bans the inclusion of war-torn region to Congress. \nAn absolute majority means that a decision is adopted by the majority of the members\u2019 votes, which in this case would be the majority of 102 senators. Efrain Cepeda via El Espectador \nWhile meant for victims, conservative parties have argued that the transitional seats could end up in the hands of criminal groups or even the FARC, the former guerrilla group that became a political party in August. \nHard-line former President Alvaro Uribe , an opponent of the peace process, said the seats were \u201cfor the FARC.\u201d \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 quieren violar el rechazo del Congreso a las 16 curules para Farc? pic.twitter.com/ZuoNFtsFXa \n\u2014 \u00c1lvaro Uribe V\u00e9lez (@AlvaroUribeVel) December 1, 2017 \nVictim representatives who wanted to run for one of the transitional seats had urged to stop associating them with guerrillas or drug trafficking groups. \nWe are not guerrillas.

Dezember 2017 - Malwarebytes (https://de.malwarebytes.com/), der f\u00fchrende Anbieter von L\u00f6sungen zur Vermeidung und Behebung von Malware-Bedrohungen, pr\u00e4sentiert seinen Report \u00fcber das neue Zeitalter des organisierten Cyberverbrechens. Die Angriffe im Jahr 2017 stiegen nicht nur in ihrer H\u00e4ufigkeit an, sondern waren auch ausgereifter und erzeugten mehr Schaden. Der Report \"The New Mafia: Gangs and Vigilantes - A Guide to Cybercrime for CEOs\" (https://go.malwarebytes.com/Cybercrime_NewMafia_PR.html) entmystifiziert Cybersicherheit und zeigt welche Parallelen sich zwischen heutigen Cyberkriminellen und den Mafia-Gangs aus den 30er Jahren auftun. Diese neue Generation an Cyberkriminellen \u00e4hnelt traditionellen Mafia-Organisationen: Die professionelle Koordinierung sowie Einsch\u00fcchterungen der Opfer sind nur zwei der sich \u00fcberschneidenden Punkte. Die Daten von Malwarebytes best\u00e4tigen, dass diese Gangs, die sich zur Zeit professionalisieren, Unternehmen gro\u00dfen Schaden zuf\u00fcgen k\u00f6nnen. -Die neue Cyber-Mafia steigert die Angriffsh\u00e4ufigkeit. Die durchschnittliche Angriffsanzahl stieg 2017 um 23 Prozent im Vergleich zu 2016. -Die Anzahl der von Malwarebytes entdeckten Ransomware-Angriffe explodierte. Ransomware-Angriffe stiegen dieses Jahr sogar um 62 Prozent an. Hinzu kommt, dass die Angriffe seit 2015 um 1.982 Prozent stiegen - im September 2017 gab es mehrere hunderttausend Erkennungen (im September 2015 waren es nur 16.000). -Die Ransomware-Zahlen stiegen 2017 noch st\u00e4rker an. Im Januar erkannte Malwarebytes noch 90.351 F\u00e4lle, im Oktober waren es bereits 333.871.\"Der dramatische Anstieg des organisierten Verbrechens im fr\u00fchen 20. Jahrhundert f\u00fchrte dazu, dass es \"Mafia\" genannt wurde und \u00e4hnelt den seit Kurzem anhaltenden Wachstum der Cyberkriminalit\u00e4t\", so Marcin Kleczynski, CEO von Malwarebytes. \"Die neue Mafia, die wir in unserem Report identifiziert haben, besteht aus vier Hauptgruppen: traditionelle Gangs, vom Staat finanzierte Angreifer, ideologische Hacker und Hacker-For-Hire, also Hacker, die sich anheuern lassen. Doch durch Wachsamkeit und einem besseren Verst\u00e4ndnis der Cyberkriminalit\u00e4ts-Landschaft k\u00f6nnen Unternehmen die Bem\u00fchungen der Strafverfolgungsbeh\u00f6rden unterst\u00fctzen und gleichzeitg ihren Schutz selbst in die Hand nehmen.\" Der Anstieg der Cyberkriminalit\u00e4t und die fehlende Klarheit, wie sie am besten zu bek\u00e4mpfen ist, haben schwerwiegende Auswirkungen auf die Opfer. Denn Opfer von Cyberkriminalit\u00e4t sch\u00e4men sich oft und machen Angriffe daher nicht \u00f6ffentlich. Das gilt f\u00fcr Konsumenten und Unternehmen gleicherma\u00dfen und kann gef\u00e4hrliche Folgen haben, da Unternehmen ihren Kopf in den Sand stecken, anstatt offen gegen zuk\u00fcnftige Vorf\u00e4lle anzuarbeiten. Der Report besagt, dass die L\u00f6sung die Aufkl\u00e4rung des Managements ist, so dass CEOs genau so wahrscheinlich wie IT-Abteilungen die Zeichen eines Angriffs erkennen und entsprechend reagieren k\u00f6nnen. \"CEOs d\u00fcrfen Cyberkriminalit\u00e4t nicht mehr als ein technologisches Problem betrachten, sondern als gesch\u00e4ftskritisch\", so Kleczynski. \"Die sch\u00e4dlichsten Cyber-Angriffe auf Unternehmen, sind diejenigen, die lange unentdeckt bleiben. Der Report zeigt, dass viele Manager noch Wissensl\u00fccken in diesem Bereich haben.\" Der Bericht geht auch auf die Zukunft der Cyberkriminalit\u00e4t und ihre Auswirkungen auf unsere physische und digitale Welt ein, die sich immer weiter vermengen. Mit IoT k\u00f6nnen Kriminelle wieder zu ihrem Ausgangspunkt zur\u00fcckkehren: Anstatt einer Schie\u00dferei mitten in der Stadt, kann nun der gehackte Herzschrittmacher die Zielperson exekutieren. Daher muss das Verst\u00e4ndnis und die Gesetzgebung sich beim Thema Cyberkriminalit\u00e4t stark verbessern. Die Analysen von Malwarebytes zeigen, dass obwohl viele Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer \u00fcber die rufsch\u00e4digenden und finanziellen Risiken von Cyberkriminalit\u00e4t Bescheid wissen, sie immer noch ihre Schwachstellen untersch\u00e4tzen. Der Report zeigt, dass Unternehmen und Konsumenten das Potenzial haben, zur\u00fcckzuschlagen, indem sie Wissen teilen und sich proaktiv verteidigen. Unternehmen, die gehackt worden sind, d\u00fcrfen nicht mehr an den Pranger gestellt werden, stattdessen sollte aktiv mit ihnen gearbeitet werden. Denn nur dann k\u00f6nnen alle lernen, wie sie derartige Angriffe aufhalten k\u00f6nnen.

Het is de laatste jaren uitgegroeid tot een publiekstrekker van jewelste. Dat is toe te schrijven aan de ruim zeventig kramen die in het sfeervolle oude centrum van het stadje staan, en de uitgebreide omlijsting. Elf meter hoge kerstboom \nDe kerstmarkt wordt woensdag 13 december van 16.00 tot 21.00 uur gehouden. Er is een levende kerststal met een echte baby als het Kindje Jezus in de kribbe, figuranten, een aantal dieren en vertellingen van het kerstverhaal. \nIn het oog springend dit jaar is dat de rollen van herders worden gespeeld door de gereformeerd vrijgemaakte predikant Kor van der Meer en pastoraal medewerkster Ria Dekker van de PKN-gemeente. De kerststal staat op het grasveld voor de Boomhofkerk, bij de ruim elf meter hoge kerstboom die vol komt te hangen met megakerstballen. Groot Gramsberger Kerstmannen Koor \nNaast de kerststal zijn er nog tal van activiteiten. Natuurlijk is de Kerstman aanwezig en er klinkt sfeervolle muziek en zang van onder meer midwinterhoornblazers, het inmiddels befaamde Groot Gramsberger Kerstmannen Koor (GGKK) met ruim vijftig zingende kerstmannen, de koren Sing & Swing en Nooit Alleen en de muziekverenigingen Harmonie Crescendo en fanfare Soli Deo Gloria. \nIn de Boomhofkerk bespelen organisten het kerkorgel. In het museum exposeert fotoclub Fotogram met winterse foto\u2019s. Voor de kinderen zijn er knutselactiviteiten. Zes studenten van het Alfa-college uit Hardenberg staan op twee locaties op de kerstmarkt, waar kinderen leuke dingen kunnen maken met klei, karton en hout. Hebbedingetjes \nHet aanbod is heel divers. Kerstbomen en -ballen, kaarsen, kaarten, handgemaakte artikelen, mutsen en handschoenen, maar ook accessoires voor het interieur en leuke hebbedingetjes. Aan de inwendige mens is ook gedacht. Niemand hoeft thuis te eten want er zijn winterse gerechten zoals stamppot, erwtensoep, broodjes rookworst, braadworst en winterse dranken zoals warme chocolademelk en gl\u00fchwein. \nWebsite: www.gramsbergen.nl/evenementen Tip de redactie via WhatsApp!

Esp. if it were originally ordered/purposed as a plow truck, there's a good chance it was ordered with 4.10s, which, as said, will NOT be happy at highway speed.\nLow mileage on a diesel engine that can go half a million miles or more isn't a big plus, unless you plan on putting half a million miles on it in the fairly near future. At this age, it's the rest of the truck, and its condition, that determines the value. If EVERY other bit of rust, on the BONES of the truck, has been fixed/replaced properly, then $3500 is only a bit on the high side. Otherwise, if it shows any of the typical... er... provenance of a plow truck, it's more like a $2K-mobile.\nWait... 1987.... yeah, it'd still be a 6.9, but wouldn't it have a ZF5 behind it?

I\u2019ve had pretty extensive health issues that largely keep me homebound, and porn just makes me feel lonely. I\u2019ve engaged in cybersex with women I met online, but I always lose contact with them because the only time I want to talk is when my horniness overpowers my embarrassment; I\u2019m very uncomfortable seeking this stuff out even online, and I\u2019ve had a few women that I cut off because they wanted to move much too fast, and expected me to just ignore all my boundaries. For the same reason I\u2019m not comfortable with sex-related online communities. On top of that, the women I talk with don\u2019t get much from the situation; the most I\u2019m comfortable with is voice chat and I need to be eased into that. Paying is not a financial possibility for me right now, and TBH I don\u2019t really have any desire to do sexual stuff with a woman who only is there because I pay her. \nI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m afraid I have no advice to give you. Surely you understand that nobody is going to give you something for nothing? You simply can\u2019t expect random strangers to give you free sexual interaction, completely on your terms, without expecting anything in return. That simply isn\u2019t the way human dynamics work. What you are looking for, whether you like it or not, is a sex worker. You want someone to fulfill your desires on demand while staying completely within the boundaries you set, but who won\u2019t ask anything for herself or expect romance or whatever. That is about as good a description of a sex worker/client relationship as one could wish for; a sex worker is only looking for her fee, nothing else, and as a professional she will proceed at your pace and leave you alone when you aren\u2019t paying for her to do otherwise. I\u2019m perfectly willing to provide the service if you like, and there are phone sex services, cam girls, etc available on the internet. But if you are willing to provide your phone partner with nothing, I\u2019m afraid nothing is all you can expect in return.\n( Have a question of your own?

Not to mention the fact that certain things, like gun crime statistics, are blown way out of proportion to sound way worse than they really are. This image is using CDC numbers to determine your genuine overall odds of dying by firearms. Most media tends to blow it out of proportion and make it seem like any turn of the corner will kill you, in order to have firearms become more restricted and potentially prohibited by people that know absolutely nothing about what they're talking about. Realistically, you have a miniscule chance of dying to a gun. If you're not part of any consistent criminal activity or suicidal, you have almost no chance of dying to a gun. 1712 people out of 312M die to non-gang gun homicide. But those 1712 are blown so far out of proportion that people treat it like every single area that hasn't banned guns outright is a warzone that threatens their life because they'll get shot by 30 calibre assault weapons that can empty their clipazine in half a second. In reality, people should stop losing their minds over something that doesn't even affect 0.1% of the population and focus on much more important things. If they're so worried about getting hurt, they should learn one or more methods of self-defense, like hand-to-hand combat, short-range melee combat (batons, tasers, etc.), or better yet, CARRYING A FIREARM. Recently, there was an auto shop in Florida that was attacked by a man with a \".45 handgun\" (probably a 1911) and was promptly stopped as everyone in the shop was armed with a firearm located within the shop. The owner even possessed a CCW license, which allowed him to deal with the shooter along with his co-workers. In the end, one person died and two people were injured, the shooter didn't even make it through more than one magazine, and nobody else got hurt. The article presenting this incident stated \"you won't hear about it on the news.\" Lo and behold, no such incident has ever been mentioned on the news. TL;DR your odds of dying to a gun are astronomical, people should stop worrying about it and learn ways to defend themselves if they're so damn worried about it #22 to #11 - anon id: 6ac6f2a5 Reply +11 Hey, listen man, I read that, and I gotta say I agree with you but holy **** formatting needs to be done I know you did separate a couple lines with an \\n but jesus mate When you leave everything in one large block of text still, things bleed together and make what you're goin on about seem like too much work for some of the uh, slower folk we have here. good half of the site Don't get me wrong man, the content of your comment was good.

Now that the initial euphoria has died down, it is appropriate to delve deeper and look for potential learnings in the report. As a country, we should analyse the World Bank report not only from the ranking perspective but also the DTF scoring point of view. DTF stands for \u2018distance from the frontier\u2019 with scores ranging from 0-100 (where 100 is the strongest or front-runner economy). Also, to gauge the ruling government\u2019s performance since election, it is appropriate to compare the rankings of 2018 and 2014. These three indicators reveal a lot more than what has been discussed so far. This analysis does not attempt to downplay the progress made by the country and the fact that India has commenced in the direction of the government\u2019s goal to attain a ranking under 50. However, from point of view of serious investors and analysts, it is important to try and figure out how soon India will reach the top 50, and how other countries are faring. The chart identifies areas where India has made good progress vis-\u00e0-vis areas that still need improvements on the journey of going from the 100th to the 50th ranking nation. From the perspective of real estate, the five indicators in red highlight areas which have a high impact on the sector \u2013 registering a property, dealing with construction permits, enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency. How World Bank measures these indicators Dealing with construction permits: All procedures required for a business in the construction industry to construct a building, for instance a warehouse, factoring in the time and cost to complete each procedure as well as the quality of building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional certification requirements. While maturing real estate sectors such as the residential, office and retail have been doing well, it is time we look at new sunrise opportunities in sectors such as warehousing. With GST paving the way for cross-border movement of goods across India, the World Bank data on time and cost involved in constructing a warehouse is not encouraging enough. The e-commerce sector is growing rapidly in India, and very soon there will be opportunities for constructing large modern warehouses equipped with state-of-art automation. Registering a property: The full sequence of procedures necessary for a business (the buyer) to purchase a property from another business (the seller) and to transfer the property title to the buyer\u2019s name so that the buyer can use the property for expanding its business, use the property as collateral in taking new loans \u2013 or, if necessary, sell the property to another business. Prior to RERA becoming a market force in 2017, information on projects, land title clearance deeds and developer liability existed somewhere on paper (if existed at all) and buyers had no access to it. Nevertheless, verifying land title clearances and other aspects of due diligence were the responsibility of the buyer, who would have to engage a consultant for such verification. The full impact of RERA is still not visible in the ranking for property registrations This will only happen when all states have adopted RERA without tampering with the Central guidelines by next year. Also, initiatives such as single-window clearances and online registration facilities should be strengthened in order to make these procedures less time-consuming and cost-intensive. Online records of titles, title insurance and title search and certification will be the real game-changers which could take India into the World Bank\u2019s Top 50 almost immediately. Work has commenced on digital registration, digital records and online search and certification, but adequate controls also need to be added at every stage. Enforcing contracts: The time and cost involved in resolving a commercial dispute through a local first-instance court, the quality of judicial processes index, and evaluating the economy on how well it has adopted good practices that promote quality and efficiency in the judicial system. The World Bank\u2019s Doing Business report says after establishing debt recovery tribunals in India, non-performing loans have reduced by 28 per cent, thereby resulting in a decrease in overall interest rates. RERA as a body that resolves disputes between developers and buyers is a progressive initiative, which however must be implemented in all markets without dilution. Progress on this will be captured in next year\u2019s report and reflect in India\u2019s ranking on this parameter. The processes involved in resolving disputes between businesses, land owners, developers and the government need to be speeded up \u2013 a clear action point for the coming year. Resolving insolvency: The time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic entities, as well as the strength of the legal framework applicable to judicial liquidation and reorganisation proceedings. As the chart below indicates, India\u2019s track record with regards to insolvency has been very poor, resulting in investors\u2019 reluctance to involve themselves financially. There is a large concentration of stress in the land-rich textiles and metal manufacturing industries, and it remains to be seen whether the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code will help unlock land parcels in Indian cities. This does not mean that Indian Government has not done anything \u2013 these ranks are merely relative performances as seen from a strong correlation between ranks and DTF scores. It does mean that other countries in Asia and Africa are possibly doing far better in terms of reforming their real estate and manufacturing competitiveness when compared to India. The report has acknowledged India\u2019s efforts in terms of: 1. Single window approval system for building plans 2. Streamlining business incorporation processes 3. Easing tax compliance procedures (via online filing, consolidation through GST, etc) 4. Bankruptcy and insolvency 5. Easing export-import border compliance procedures It also confirms that after establishing debt recovery tribunals in India, non-performing loans have reduced by 28 per cent, leading to a reduction in overall interest rates. However, it has also highlighted a few persisting challenges \u2013 for instance, the World Bank sees inefficient licensing and size restrictions (in FDI, etc) as continuing to hamper India\u2019s total factor productivity (TFP). There could be a whopping 40-60 per cent improvement in TFP if India overcomes these challenges. The outcomes from the recently modified IBC code will be closely monitored, having a strong bearing on DB rank and DTF score next year. Clearly, there is a need to train a sharper focus on reforms or initiatives such as \u2018Make in India\u2019, \u2018Housing for All\u2019, land acquisition, insolvency and contract enforcement to overcome the remaining challenges. The good news is that India is the shining star among the \u2018major investible markets\u2019 this year, exhibiting remarkable progress in its DTF scores. The Doing Business indicators are now the basis for undertaking reforms across many economies, including India, providing ready benchmarks or guidance values. If the PM ensures that each India state is scored on the EODB metric, the index will also help promote competitiveness within the country. To conclude\u2026 There are still factors which the World Bank could not acknowledge this year, primarily because of timing of the report. These are factors that can be seen as \u2018low hanging fruit\u2019, and a lot can be done this year to improve on them. RERA has to date seen only limited deployment and needs to be implemented across all states with little or no dilution. Altogether, while India\u2019s massive improvement on the World Bank\u2019s EODB index is a creditable achievement, a lot needs to be done in the future to improve further on it.

As you can tell by the title I'm going to be doing a review on the 'Bugaboo Donkey - Duo', so keep reading if you'd like to know what I think so far. It isn't going to be very in-depth as I'm sure theres many of these reviews scattered online, but I'm just going to do a tiny review on what I think. As a 2nd time mum I knew the struggle of picking a pram; when pregnant with Evangeline I always felt completely overwhelmed when walking into Mothercare, John Lewis and all of those independent baby shops - theres prams everywhere, so many different brands and knowing whats right is a big struggle, or at least it was for me. Ironically you'd think picking a pram would be much easier; but of course we were looking at a different type of pram - a Duo pram.  I was always under the assumption that picking a double would be much, much easier because there wasn't many - and boy was I wrong.   I never realised just how many different brands made Twin/Duo prams. Needless to say it took much longer to find a pram than we anticipated.  \n\nOriginally we had around 6-7 if not more that were in the running to be the pram we chose, there was the I-Candy Peach, Egg Tandem, Joolz Geo, Silver Cross Wave, Upper Baby Vista, Mountain Buggy, Oyster Max and of course the Bugaboo Donkey. I was completely surprised to find this many twin/duo prams, like I've touched on above I thought only limited brands made them - when in fact practically all of them do.  \n\nWhen it came to picking out our pram there were many factors that we weren't to keen on, and being completely honest what I wanted was unrealistic. I wanted a pram where I could see both of my daughters at the same time, wanted something sleek & modern, yet able to withstand any terrain (our old pram was a city pram so country walks were extremely bumpy) but also narrow enough to fit around every location we visited, I wanted a basket large enough, I didn't want it to long or to wide - as you can see I wasn't being very realistic haha! Eventually we had to go by what we liked and managed to narrow it down to the I-Candy, Joolz Geo, Egg or Bugaboo.  \n\nDue to having the pram with a toddler and a baby we had to take into consideration Evangeline's size, she is quite big for a 16 month old, so we had to sit her in each pram to see roughly how long it would be before she grew out of the seat or the hood was touching her head. Straight away the I-candy Peach was ruled out as as soon as she was placed into the seat her head was probably 1-1.5 inches from the top of the hood, meaning she wouldn't fit into it for very long after it had been bought; this was the same with the Egg, so they were ruled out for that reason. Next was the Joolz Geo, the main reason we didn't get this pram is because they didn't have it in store and I love to look at prams in-depth, push them around a little, check basket size and so on before making any decisions - also we weren't able to sit Evie in the seat to see how big she was in it. So therefore we went for the Bugaboo Donkey duo. \n\nThe Bugaboo Donkey meet most of the criteria, I was able to see both of my daughters at the same time, the basket was large, its multi-terrain, the seat was of a perfect size for Evangeline and pretty much still is and its compatible with a buggy board for when she's older. There were a few disadvantages being completely honest, the prams very wide, its very expensive, everything had to be bought separately and it isn't very sleek. \n\nSo onto the main review; (Little disclaimer - if you have this pram and don't share my opinion that absolutely fine & if you do thats great too - just remember I'm not saying that what I'm saying applies for everyone, its just what I feel) . The Bugaboo Donkey Duo is a great overall, it enables me to see both Evangeline & Florance at the same time, unlike other tandem/double prams which was a large selling point for me. As I said its multi-terrain which is fab as we tend do go on a great deal of walks along country roads, down the beach, around the park and within towns, so having a pram that isn't extremely bumpy is excellent. The basket is MASSIVE which is an added bonus as it allows me to pop rain  covers and shopping underneath. It's available in pretty much every shop that sells prams/baby stuff which is also an added positive meaning you can get your hands on it in pretty much every shop. Another positive is you can buy the pram with 8 different colour packages and 2 different colour packages for the chasis - although you do have to pay extra for different colours. \n\nSo the negatives, the pram is extremely wide and I find it very difficult to fit into every shop, clothes shopping is practically impossible as fitting between the isle is very tricky; I often find myself knocking stuff of the rails just trying to navigate around and a majority of the time I tend to leave as its more hassle than its worth. It's not just shops, footpaths can be awkward to - trying to fit down an average sized footpath with people, other prams or wheelchairs is practically impossible being honest as there just isn't enough room.. The bonus is being able to see both babies/children at the same time; but the negative to that is that its very wide.  \n\nThe price is another thing that makes me grumble, the pram itself is great, but we paid roughly the same price you'd pay for a small car - \u00a31315.00 - roughly, having to buy seating a separate seating unit, purchasing hoods and colour packages separately its very pricey. Not just this we had to purchase another car seat - the Maxi-cosi as we were informed this is the only car seat compatible with the adapters which we also had to buy separately, they cost around \u00a329.00. So the price for me I would have to say is a massive negative. However in saying that most prams nowadays break a hole in the bank. But as I said paying \u00a31315.00 for a pram is something that I screw my nose up at. The look, I'm not to keen on how the pram looks, its very bulky and not very modern/sleek; and to me it looks and feels a little flimsy - which isn't great when you pay a lot of money.  \n\nThe pram is easily put together which is great as it doesn't take a genius to assemble like some prams. Its pretty straight forward and everything is basic to assemble - the hood is the trickiest part haha! \n\nI think thats all I have to say really, overall the pram is an okay pram and it does the job; once Evangeline is a little older I will be selling this pram, maybe even before to buy something more suited for me and my lifestyle. Positives outweigh the negatives and it is a good pram but of course its all personal preference. I hope you found this review somewhat helpful especially if you are in the market for a twin/duo pram - if you have any more questions defiantly let me know. \n\n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "oyster max", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joolz geo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evangeline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egg tandem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mothercare", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "upper baby vista", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:13.014+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15095925, "moreResultsAvailable": 15095825, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512640933014&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 294}
