Well, they are quite famous for failing to get full ownership of Facebook after the allegations that it was forcefully taken from them. \nAnd, now they are known for being the World's Bitcoin Billionaires. Fortune does favour the brave! \nHowever, what's this fuss around Bitcoin? If you've had a hard time wrapping your head around it, we've listed down few things that'll help you get an idea of what Bitcoin is all about. \n1. The whole deal behind Bitcoin is that it is considered to be a safe option to conduct transactions because it is not under any central authority. This crypto-currency was created by a person named Satoshi Nakamoto (still unknown) in the year 2009. \n2. Transactions using bitcoins can be done anonymously and there is no transaction fees involved unlike *cough* all the banks. At the moment, it is used as a form of investment to earn more money (Apparently, way better than investing in stocks!). \n3. There's a public digital ledger that manages all the Bitcoin transactions, created by 'miners' whose job is to ensure maximum security to the Bitcoin currency system. \n4. There are several places where you can own your set of bitcoins. They are known as 'Bitcoin exchanges'. \nMt Gox is known for having the highest bitcoin exchanges ever to occur though they had a fall-out in between. However, there are other platforms such as Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Coinbase, and many others who are known for managing bitcoins. \nNo one knows if and when the Bitcoin bubble ever bursts. It's a completely new way of ensuring free-flow of e-money without any form of regulation. Right now in India, one bitcoin is valued at Rs. 9,34,321.68.

You need a new pair of dress slacks or an electric toothbrush (that old toothbrush has some gunk on it, man). \nOccasionally, however, the gift you desperately desire and the gift that makes the most practical sense are one in the same. It\u2019s that way for a prospective Deontay Wilder-Anthony Joshua championship bout. That\u2019s the heavyweight boxing clash that the sports world wants, needs and ultimately deserves. \nBoxing is always better when the heavyweight division is carrying its weight. Nothing against the little guys \u2014 a great fight is a great fight \u2014 but the heavyweights simply bring more thunder to the sport. As fans, we crave that power. \nI\u2019ll stop short of calling the heavyweight division a wasteland for most of the 21st century, but it\u2019s at least suffered a dry spell in terms of quality depth. Wladimir Klitschko dominated the division for more than a decade. His legacy as one of the sport\u2019s all-time greats is secure, but he didn\u2019t really have many worthy rivals either. \nWell, until Joshua came along. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with him, he\u2019s a 28-year-old wildly popular Brit who is now 20-0 in his career, with 20 knockouts. That includes a 12-round slugfest with Klitschko in the Ukranian big man\u2019s squared circle swan song in April, a match that could (probably should) win Fight of the Year, despite getting about a tenth of the attention of Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor. \nJoshua won a gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, and he made a smashing professional debut a year later, thumping Italian boxer Emanuelue Leo with a first-round TKO. He\u2019s been busting guys up ever since. \nJoshua actually held a job as a bricklayer before he ever took up boxing, and that seems right to me. The guy always looks like he\u2019s smuggling cement blocks in his gloves. His YouTube highlights should come with a warning label: Viewers watching these clips might experience sympathy dizziness and jaw pain. \nOf course, if anyone in the boxing game hits any harder than Joshua, it\u2019s Wilder. Here\u2019s the skinny on the thickest heavyweight in the sport: The 32-year-old Alabama native is 39-0 in his nine-year career, with 38 knockouts. Those are the numbers. The eye test spells it out even plainer: Wilder is a bad, bad man. \nWhen he plants that hard right jab, large men crumble like pi\u00f1atas. Better yet, Wilder owns the kind of Ali-like swagger that Klitschko, for all his greatness, just didn\u2019t possess. The heavyweight champ-eeeen of the world needs a certain charisma. \nJoshua vs. Wilder would be one of the biggest heavyweight fights in history \u2014 literally. Wilder, aka the Bronze Bomber, stands 6-foot-7 and 227 pounds with an 83-inch reach. Joshua is 6-6 and 249 pounds, with an 82-inch reach. These are a couple of oak trees, only more nimble. \nThe Joshua-Wilder fight should happen in 2018, but we all know how that goes. After pummeling Bermane Stiverne in a first-round knockout in November, Wilder addressed the looming prospect of Joshua. He called out Joshua\u2019s promoters for protecting their prize champion. \n\u201cI think they\u2019re hesitant for a reason,\u201d Wilder said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a great thing going. He can fight literally a guy who doesn\u2019t even have a name and can make millions and millions of dollars off him. Why would they risk taking a chance with the most dangerous heavyweight in the division?\u201d \nHere\u2019s the unspoken element of Wilder\u2019s bravado \u2014 he needs Joshua just as much as Joshua needs him. Wilder\u2019s own list of vanquished opponents doesn\u2019t exactly read like murderer\u2019s row. Joshua would push Wilder to perhaps his greatest heights, and vice versa. \nIt\u2019s titillating to consider the rivalry these guys could generate. They could lead a rebirth of the heavyweight division. In addition to Wilder and Joshua, the class features some promising contenders like Jarrell \u201cBig Baby\u201d Miller (20-0-1), Dominic Brazeale (who gave Joshua a war for seven rounds in June 2016 before suffering his only loss in 20 fights), Bulgaria\u2019s Kubrat Pulev (25-1) and New Zealand\u2019s Joseph Parker (24-0). If 6-foot-9 former champion Tyson Fury (25-0) can make a comeback in 2018 \u2013 he hasn\u2019t fought since 2015 while dealing with depression and cocaine addiction \u2014 the heavyweight division has a shot to be in its best shape since the 1990s, when Mike Tyson, Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield and Riddick Bowe ruled the earth. \n\u201cThe heavyweight division was once in a dark place, but now it is coming into the light,\u201d Wilder said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting and I can\u2019t wait to make it even more exciting.\u201d \nMuch rigmarole must be sorted out before a Wilder-Joshua fight comes to fruition. They have to figure out where it would take place (Great Britain or the U.S.), the pay-per-view network, and of course the cut of the purse (50-50 seems fair).

Jha By Subhash K. Jha Dec 7, 2017 - 10:59 am IST \n\u201cI don\u2019t think I enjoyed working with any co-star as much as I did with Shashi Kapoor. His death has still not sunk in. Even as I\u2019ve been busy with various things during the past few days, my mind has been going back to all the wonderful times I shared with Shashi. While I shared only a professional rapport with my other co-stars, with Shashi I also socialized. We did meet over dinner and drinks. And it was always a pleasure to meet Shashi and his really wonderful wife Jennifer Kendal. They complemented each other perfectly. Seeing Shashi Kapoor and Jennifer together was so gratifying. I don\u2019t think Shashi ever got over her death. It broke him and turned him reckless about his life. He became suicidal. It was sad to see him let himself go. I still remember how handsome he was. My God! He was the most handsome man I had seen. When I met him for the first time, it was when he visited the location of my first Hindi film Kashmir Ki Kali . We were shooting the song \u2018Isharon Isharon Mein\u2019 with Shashi\u2019s brother Shammi Kapoor. I couldn\u2019t concentrate on my romantic poses with Shammi. The director Shakti Samanta had to ask Shashi to leave. The funny thing was, before I could confess I was a fan , Shashi started telling me he was fan of my work, having seen me in Satyajit Ray\u2019s Apur Sansar . That charm completely won women over. \nOver the years, we became close friends. We got a lot of opportunity to work and spend time together as most of our films were shot outside Mumbai over a lengthy period of time. I remember we were all together for My Love in Nairobi. Likewise my other films with Shashi Kapoor which were shot in places as far-flung as Rajasthan and Canada ( Door Desh was shot in Canada). I remember we were shooting Paap Aur Punya in Rajasthan. Shashi\u2019s children and my son Saif Ali Khan were all there. Saif, who very small, became very fond of his Shashi Uncle. In a sequence where Shashi Kapoor was being hung by a noose by the villain, Saif unknown to the camera and crew, toddled up to the villain and bit him for hurting his favourite Shashi Uncle. I guess Shashi Kapoor\u2019s charms worked with the young and old alike. \nWe did a lot of films together, some of them like New Delhi Times, Aamne Samne and Aa Gale Lag Jaa were good, some really awful. Not too many of them worked at the box office. which is a pity. Because among all my co-stars it\u2019s Shashi Kapoor I enjoyed working with the most.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shashi kapoor", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "saif ali khan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shashi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "subhash k. jha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aamne samne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paap aur punya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gale lag jaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shashi kapoor subhash k. jha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shakti samanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shammi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satyajit ray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "desh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shammi kapoor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer kendal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shashi uncle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kashmir ki kali", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new delhi times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "paap aur punya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nairobi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajasthan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:48.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "83c9a750f2a9d3a5fd0ea0c2d2bd2a57f6bc53b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSw8Z82NtFsSKXQf8HNrh3ik-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "83c9a750f2a9d3a5fd0ea0c2d2bd2a57f6bc53b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSw8Z82NtFsSKXQf8HNrh3ik-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Polymorpheus stood battered and ravaged.

Appearing to briefly consider his options, he then closed his eyes.\r\n\r\nFor a second, an almost imperceptibly faint aura glimmered around him before opening out into a searing circular flare, and rushing outwards just behind its boundaries as though approaching from the end of a very long tunnel was a silhouette - one with the vaguest hint of Polymorpheus' shape, but horribly deformed. It spoke to the senses of divinity given physical form, but profaned beyond recognition; bent and blistered at unseemly angles, its dark and mottled form was constantly smoking, dripping and crumbling into the air around it.\r\n\r\nImmediately, it leapt forwards and hammered against Anachronos. Eight blows were struck, eight deafening thunderclaps pulsed outwards from where they landed; each a miniature nova of sound and discharged energy that felt more like a blow to the body than anything to be percieved with the ears and eyes.\r\n\r\nThe figure ended the onslaught, and stepped back. Anachronos remained still in his saddle for a beat, before slowly slumping forward on to his mount - alive, but catatonic.

The theft occurred about 6 p.m. in the 1400 block of Monterey Boulevard. The thief took check no. 97 out of the victim\u2019s Chase Bank checkbook, and apparently forged the owner\u2019s signature to cash the check for $3,826. It was not immediately clear why the suspect chose that figure. \nTires damaged \nThe tires of two cars parked in South Hermosa were damaged last month by an unknown suspect. The incidents were reported on Nov. 23, Thanksgiving, in the 400 block of Ardmore Avenue, the first about 3 p.m., the second about 10 p.m. In both cases, the two passenger side tires were damaged.

Headsets, speakers, and earphones continue to get louder and more immersive but are they more experiential? Over the past five years wires have been removed and design has become more attractive but experience has yet to advance; until one company came to rescue. Sabinetek as a official partner with Qualcomm, has multiple patents and already delivered successful acoustic solutions to many industry giants in China. Next month, Sabinetek will exhibit at CES 2018 as Innovation Awards Honoree to release its brand new product MIKE. MIKE, a new portable microphone, is changing the way we produce and record sound. Unlike traditional microphones which transfer file after the recording, MIKE can transfer data with mobile phone in real-time. This function makes all the difference among the microphone category because functions are not experience. Functions such as stereo sound quality, long distant recording, powerful editing APP, and noise suppression technology are needed together and at the same time. Real-time transmission technology enriches MIKE to replace the mic on mobile phone to make that experience happens. The product comes with an accessory that makes it easily attachable to the musical instrument that the user plays with; another accessory, a hand band, allows the user to wear it while playing certain instruments when needed to (for instance: saxophone, violin), to catch the closest source of the sound. Whether a musician, a speaker, educator, reporter, or everyday person MIKE can be used to create a better experience. Music and composers can compose to record demos whenever they feel inspired using the high-quality recording and immediate app sharing function will dramatically improve their production process. Presenters, reporters, and educators can experience the freedom of hands free recordings in real time, taking their listeners even closer to sound. The average Joe can easily record moments and laughs experienced while traveling and throughout life; creating a track record of the amazing memories that shape our life.

After the 2017 legislative success of LB 88, which removed hurdles in over 30 areas of employment for military spouses and included other supportive legislation for our military community, Blood has been motivated to create new legislation to continue to remove barriers to employment and create policy that supports the well-being of service members and their families. \u201cIt is important to highlight the base\u2019s estimated 1.7 billion local economic impact on our surrounding communities and why we must work hard to keep this base here in Nebraska,\u201d stated Senator Blood. \u201cAs we look to make Nebraska one of the most military-friendly states, we must also continue to enact and revise legislation covering licensure and employment protection, consumer protection, family law, child care and protection, voting, education, healthcare, state judicial systems and disposition of human remains. Some of these issues do not require legislation, but need active partnerships with outside organizations to make it happen. This is a bipartisan issue that we should all be able to support and move through the process without hesitation.\u201d This initiative includes the following: Military Civil Relief Consumer Protection Act Physical Therapists Interstate Compact Advanced Practice Registered Nurses Compact Military Spouse Realtors Licensing Accommodation Military Medicaid Waiver (for transitioning special needs military family members not covered by TRICARE) Military Spouse Attorneys Licensing Accommodation (Initiated process with Nebraska Supreme Court-See OWH Midlands Voices 11/29/17) Pro bono legal representation for service members and families (Working with Nebraska Non-Profit to provide these services) Military Representation on Certain State Boards and Councils that pertain to mental health and early childhood development councils (Working with Nebraska organizations to encourage Military presence on these types of boards/councils) \u201cI know this is a very bold initiative, but it is only the tip of the iceberg of what we can and need to do here in Nebraska,\u201d Blood explains. \u201cWe talk a LOT about the next round of BRAC and we need to remember that part of that formula is not just about the runway and missions, although a paramount factor, but also about how we embrace and protect our service members and their families. I have a fire in my belly and will continue to push for these types of policies over the course of my tenure in the legislature.\u201d Senator Blood has been working closely with the USA4Military Families Department of Defense State Liaison Office since June 2017 to insure that Nebraska Legislation is competitive with other states and to craft the most effective legislation possible.

While the agency has been working against the clock to help ever more people, the cash is quickly running out. \n\u201cWe\u2019re letting down those who need us most,\u201d said Claude Jibidar, WFP\u2019s Representative in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). A tightly planned surge had made a big difference, Jibidar explained, but WFP had largely funded this from its own meagre resources. \u201cWithout immediate donor support, many \u2013 particularly women and children \u2013 will die.\u201d \nThe eruption of violence in what used to be a poor but peaceful region has claimed countless lives. Some 1.4 million people have been forced from their homes. Traditionally high malnutrition rates have sky-rocketed. \nWith 3.2 million people desperately short of food, WFP has stepped in with emergency assistance. A lull in fighting has allowed more staff to be deployed. Aid workers have fanned out into the Kasai countryside. WFP has co-ordinated multi-agency logistics and humanitarian flights. As a result, the number of people assisted has grown rapidly \u2013 from 42,000 in September to 115,000 in October and 225,000 in November.

The opportunities that can be created leveraging this initiative are limitless.'\nUnderpinning the Waurn Ponds Smart Energy partnership will be a 14.5 hectare solar energy farm backed by rooftop solar panels and 1 megawatt battery storage, which is expected to begin powering the campus from mid-2019.\n'While there are a great number of benefits that cover many areas such as research applications, the University will also be able to reduce carbon emissions by 12,000 tonnes per year and generate half of the Waurn Ponds campus' energy needs on site, supporting Deakin to achieve our sustainability goals,' Professor den Hollander said.\nMr Ficca and Professor den Hollander noted the Waurn Ponds Smart Energy Partnership created the foundation to attract additional partners as it expanded its research capabilities and detailed benefits for the broader community.\n'Deakin is passionate about supporting the communities we serve, working collaboratively with industry and relevant businesses as well as governments to drive forward solutions to the challenges we are all facing, and together with AusNet Services, we're looking forward to welcoming additional partners to increase our reach and impact through this innovative project,' Professor den Hollander said.\nMondo Power is an independent subsidiary of AusNet Services Ltd and is based out of Melbourne, Victoria. Mondo Power specialises in advanced energy management solutions for both commercialBR> and community partners with a focus on distributed energy offerings.\nAusNet Services is Victoria's largest energy delivery service business, owning and operating over $11 billion of electricity and gas transmission and distribution assets and moves energy across Victoria to more than 1.3 million residential and business customers.\nDeakin University has developed a strong reputation for its inclusive, student-focused culture, innovation and in this digital age has been driving the digital frontier in the use of new and emergingBR> technologies in teaching and research.\nMedia contacts:\nCaroline Taylor\nHead of Marketing, AusNet Services\nM: 0467 700 161\nBryan Allchin\nMedia Relations and Corporate Communications Director, Deakin University\nM: 0428 597 468\nImages are available for media use via this link:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/99hldrvtlf3d499/Caption%20Info.docx?dl=0 AusNet Services Ltd. published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:11:04 UTC .\nOriginal document https://www.ausnetservices.com.au/Misc-Pages/Links/About-Us/News-Room/News-Room-2017/Deakin-and-AusNet-Services-announce-smart-energy-microgrid-partnership\nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/EB7739B76E4E1DBEE94662FD0C07032833F2168A", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "deakin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ficca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nino ficca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jane den hollander", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caroline taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "den hollander", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "deakin university", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ausnet services", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bryan allchin  media relations and corporate communications", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waurn ponds smart energy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mondo power", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ausnet services ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ausnet services ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waurn ponds smart energy partnership", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mondo power", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waurn ponds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:52.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d95649d19bd9d7010a462cda94d51f9194f7a776", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQFkW.2rL7Fszy15OFg20SJr9.Zm9nn42ZdDJiN4UvxeVg2bTL2HbZtIpwIqj0BC3dsP5y4QMJrOUHB8GLeWJ1hhUEbY1NLMjDBJFFRIjrSX1XEW2hlUXHc1ZEMkaHzM5A-", "site_full": "natewesterveltblog.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://natewesterveltblog.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Construction Engineering vs Civil Engineering? \u2013 natewesterveltblog", "title": "Construction Engineering vs Civil Engineering?", "title_full": "Construction Engineering vs Civil Engineering?", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d95649d19bd9d7010a462cda94d51f9194f7a776", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQFkW.2rL7Fszy15OFg20SJr9.Zm9nn42ZdDJiN4UvxeVg2bTL2HbZtIpwIqj0BC3dsP5y4QMJrOUHB8GLeWJ1hhUEbY1NLMjDBJFFRIjrSX1XEW2hlUXHc1ZEMkaHzM5A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "natewestervelt", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "Construction Engineering vs Civil Engineering?", "text": "Construction Engineering vs Civil Engineering?\nAny difference between the two?

Do you pay income taxes in Oregon? If the answer to both of those questions is yes, are you aware of the Oregon Cultural Trust? \nThe trust is a unique opportunity for Oregon taxpayers and cultural nonprofits. It\u2019s pretty simple really. If you donate to any of the 1,400-plus cultural organizations in Oregon and then make a matching donation to the trust, the trust donation, dollar-for-dollar, reduces the amount you owe in income tax. It\u2019s a credit, not a deduction, so it means you give one dollar less to the state for every dollar you donate, up to $500 per person, $1,000 for joint filers, and $2,500 for corporations! \nThe Legislature created this program 15 years ago, the only credit of this type in the nation. Last year the trust raised over $4.5 million and awarded nearly $3 million to organizations statewide, including $106,374 in Jackson and Josephine counties to groups including the Jackson County Library Foundation, Rogue World Music, Southern Oregon University, the Southern Oregon Film Society and the Talent Historical Society, as well as the Jackson and Josephine County cultural coalitions. The rest of the funds are secured in a permanent endowment to support culture in Oregon in the future. \nPlease help the Oregon Cultural Trust \u201cDouble the Love\u201d by taking advantage of the cultural tax credit in 2017. Oregon will be deeply grateful for your support, and so will our local arts, humanities and heritage organizations. \nGeorge Kramer", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "george kramer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garrison keillor", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "southern oregon film society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern oregon university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jefferson public radio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herb childs  medford  support oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "talent historical society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon cultural trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "legislature", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson county library foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rogue world music", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota public radio", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josephine county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josephine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:52.049+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f67d16e566fc3510a437a07becc75ea5d349bd27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Cbb2OCt9FiK5DwdPO6pGiPV7_aTHUc1TiBmwYUN6yAB4kk.qB3J2L1CFO9vDFMd5BFdIlIhpbb.Ysqfu4ed4gLdhh3Qu8YLTm3Y6l0baj5blvhO7WkY3V", "site_full": "www.freeprnow.com", "site": "freeprnow.com", "site_section": "http://www.freePRnow.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "freePRnow.com", "title": "Global Life Saving Appliances Industry 2017 Market Research Report", "title_full": "Global Life Saving Appliances Industry 2017 Market Research Report", "published": "2017-12-07T05:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 24600, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f67d16e566fc3510a437a07becc75ea5d349bd27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Cbb2OCt9FiK5DwdPO6pGiPV7_aTHUc1TiBmwYUN6yAB4kk.qB3J2L1CFO9vDFMd5BFdIlIhpbb.Ysqfu4ed4gLdhh3Qu8YLTm3Y6l0baj5blvhO7WkY3V", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T05:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "Global Life Saving Appliances Industry 2017 Market Research Report", "text": "qyresearch global Global Life Saving Appliances Industry 2017 Market Research Report The Global Life Saving Appliances Industry 2017 Market Research Report is   Life Saving Appliances industry. freePRnow.com , 12/07/2017 -

When to see your GP What treatments are available? A cough is a reflex action to clear your airways of mucus and irritants such as dust or smoke. It's rarely a sign of anything serious. A \"dry cough\" means it's tickly and doesn't produce any phlegm (thick mucus). A \"chesty cough\" means phlegm is produced to help clear your airways. Most coughs clear up within three weeks and don't require any treatment. For more persistent coughs, it's a good idea to see your GP so they can investigate the cause. What can cause a cough? There are a number of different causes of short-term (acute) and persistent (chronic) coughs. Short-term coughs Common causes of a short-term cough include: an upper  respiratory tract infection  (URTI) that affects the throat, windpipe or sinuses \u2013 examples are a  cold ,  flu ,  laryngitis ,  sinusitis  or  whooping cough a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) that affects your lungs or lower airways \u2013 examples are acute  bronchitis  or  pneumonia an  allergy , such as  allergic rhinitis  or  hay fever a flare-up of a long-term condition such as  asthma ,  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  or chronic  bronchitis inhaled dust or smoke   In rare cases, a short-term cough may be the first sign of a health condition that causes a persistent cough. Persistent coughs A persistent cough may be caused by: a long-term respiratory tract infection, such as chronic bronchitis   asthma \u2013 this also usually causes other symptoms, such as wheezing, chest tightness and shortness of breath an  allergy smoking \u2013 a smoker's cough can also be a symptom of COPD bronchiectasis  \u2013 where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened postnasal drip \u2013 mucus dripping down the throat from the back of the nose, caused by a condition such as  rhinitis  or sinusitis gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)  \u2013 where the throat becomes irritated by leaking stomach acid a prescribed medicine, such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor), which is used to treat high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease Rarely, a persistent cough can be a symptom of a more serious condition, such as  lung cancer ,  heart failure , a  pulmonary embolism (blood clot on the lung) or  tuberculosis .  Coughs in children Coughs in children often have similar causes to those mentioned above. For example, respiratory tract infections, asthma and GORD can all affect children. Causes of coughs that are more common in children than adults include: bronchiolitis  \u2013 a mild respiratory tract infection that usually causes cold-like symptoms croup  \u2013 this causes a distinctive barking cough and a harsh sound known as stridor when the child breathes in whooping cough  \u2013 look out for symptoms such as intense, hacking bouts of coughing, vomiting, and a \"whoop\" sound with each sharp intake of breath after coughing Occasionally, a persistent cough in a child can be a sign of a serious long-term condition, such as  cystic fibrosis . When to see your GP There's usually no need to see your GP if you or your child have a mild cough for a week or two. However, you should seek medical advice if: you've had a cough for more than three weeks your cough is particularly severe or is getting worse you  cough up blood  or experience  shortness of breath , breathing difficulties or  chest pain you have any other worrying symptoms, such as  unexplained weight loss , a persistent change in your voice, or  lumps or swellings  in your neck If your GP is unsure what's causing your cough, they may refer you to a hospital specialist for an assessment. They may also request some tests, such as a chest  X-ray ,  allergy tests , breathing tests, and an analysis of a sample of your phlegm to check for infection. What treatments are available? Treatment isn't always necessary for mild, short-term coughs because it's likely to be a viral infection that will get better on its own within a few weeks. You can look after yourself at home by resting, drinking plenty of fluids, and taking painkillers such as  paracetamol  or  ibuprofen . Cough medicines and remedies Although some people find them helpful, medicines that claim to suppress your cough or stop you bringing up phlegm are not usually recommended. This is because there's little evidence to suggest they're any more effective than simple home remedies, and they're not suitable for everyone. The  Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends that over-the-counter cough and cold medicines shouldn't be given to children under the age of six. Children aged 6 to 12 should only use them on the advice of a doctor or pharmacist. A homemade remedy containing honey and lemon is likely to be just as useful and safer to take. Honey shouldn't be given to babies under the age of one because of the risk of  infant botulism . Treating the underlying cause If your cough has a specific cause, treating this may help. For example: asthma can be treated with inhaled  steroids  to reduce inflammation in your airways allergies can be treated by avoiding things you're allergic to and taking  antihistamines  to dampen down your allergic reactions bacterial infections can be treated with  antibiotics GORD can be treated with  antacids  to neutralise your stomach acid and medication to reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces COPD can be treated with  bronchodilators  to widen your airways If you smoke, quitting is also likely to help improve your co ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "regulatory agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicines and healthcare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mhra", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:53.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "31df7b4ef51226c13a96dc4b54dbaad0c9cc8826", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpN75wdASpJ1iPUUq487Xz7HQ5F3kCMbZN7S2P4TP18LNfSK21qAPPJTWKXI1ZNGrI7fBobVJRSzIZbu.ddNcXk2NINbhhFVxRuM2Acvvnp2w--", "site_full": "s-trance-zone.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://s-trance-zone.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Paolo Grillo (S-Trance)", "title": "SONIC SENSE & MIND SPIN - Cleopatra (SPECTRO SENSES Remix)", "title_full": "SONIC SENSE & MIND SPIN - Cleopatra (SPECTRO SENSES Remix)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "31df7b4ef51226c13a96dc4b54dbaad0c9cc8826", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpN75wdASpJ1iPUUq487Xz7HQ5F3kCMbZN7S2P4TP18LNfSK21qAPPJTWKXI1ZNGrI7fBobVJRSzIZbu.ddNcXk2NINbhhFVxRuM2Acvvnp2w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Paolo Grillo (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "SONIC SENSE & MIND SPIN - Cleopatra (SPECTRO SENSES Remix)", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:53.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "61d71a918d621579f65b58f9ff1c136dd05d2d46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFJYSGeCRgELnx4TNE4o_ClbPdjI2P6fWSwhZdFaynI9xnFMkoFupIv6yFQu2d1g3Xv6wz2mBlnIVYOVSNG1mVjYDreGqgqS6iBix8v86oWk0R_QmgJx1wBLzcxg1i9uM-", "site_full": "forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://alaskapreps.forums.rivals.com/link-forums/college-football.26/", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "College Football Soundoff | Rivals Message Boards", "title": "Poll- Which QB would you take first in the 2018 NFL Draft ?....", "title_full": "Poll- Which QB would you take first in the 2018 NFL Draft ?.... | Rivals Message Boards", "published": "2017-12-07T09:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3057, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "df179e25d74a20aee20fc8f9bb55183a6358d373", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFJYSGeCRgELnx4TNE4o_ClbPdjI2P6fWSwhZdFaynI9xnFMkoFupIv6yFQu2d1g3Xv6wz2mBlnIVYOVSNG1mVjYDreGqgqS6iBix8v86oWk0R_QmgJx1wp_6renrWv4y59rFrhdL5Zg--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "DawgMaticFan", "published": "2017-12-07T09:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Jennerpeach41 said: \u2191 Looks like Mayfield to Cleveland.

I am over weight but all tests done come back saying everythings in working order. No pos, my thyroids good, the whole 9 yards. I know this doesn't mean I should stay overweight I am trying to eat better and I'm gonna start small exercises to lessen the anxiety. Alright so around thanksgiving, about a week before I started my period I began having severe anxiety and panic attacks like back to back. I felt awful like the world was about to end. I'm such a baby with feeling sick and stuff I just wanted to lay down and cry. I don't wanna die but i was definitely thinking that if I had to feel this way my whole life I definitely don't wanna be here. But while on my period things were for the most part okay, small jolts of anxiety here and there but definitely nothing like the week prior. I was so grateful but honestly feeling a bit embarrased cause i acted like a complete child in front of my family. Hell, I even slept next to my mother for a week cause it was almost calming. It helped me get about 2 hours of sleep at night when the anxiety was so bad. Sorry, anyways I went to my doctor yesterday (dec 6th) for a physical and she recommended larin fe 1.5/30 to try and regulate my period. I took 2 around 9pm as she said to try and get back the days I missed for not starting on sunday, if that makes sense. I also got a shot for meningitis and I'm not very fond of shots so that did give me a little anxiety but not enough to make me unable to sleep. it's now 3am and I haven't been able to sleep since 12 cause I'm just feeling pretty anxious. Not as bad as before but it's still very unpleasant. I'm just wondering if the Larin fe 1.5/30 could be causing my anxiety to act up?

Following the introduction of trucks for long-haulage and construction, the focus is now on urban and additional low-carbon transport solutions. \n\"With today's release, Scania comprehensively sets the stage for the necessary shift towards sustainable transport, offering tailored low-carbon trucks for all transport applications,\" says Christian Levin , Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing. \nThe new fuel-efficient future-oriented trucks all feature the widely acclaimed styling and product characteristics of the new truck generation. Among these are enhanced driveability as well as improved visibility, increased safety, ergonomics and comfort. With the new generation trucks, Scania is taking major steps in providing customer-adapted trucks for even better total operating economy. \nScania extends its urban range \nWith the introduction of the lighter trucks powered by the new 7-litre engine, Scania offers urban transporters a new level of transport efficiency with fuel savings of up to 10 percent. With its more compact dimensions, the new P-series cab can feature a lower engine tunnel, which opens up a more spacious cab interior. Drivers will enjoy the best driving conditions in the industry in vehicles that excel in handling, steering and driveability \u2013 all of which are essential in challenging urban traffic. \nLow entry for higher efficiency \nThe L-series is Scania's newly developed cab series for urban transport, such as distribution, refuse collection and maintenance. Drivers will benefit from vastly improved direct vision of the surroundings. Drivers will also be at the same height as other road users, with the added advantage of improved working conditions when repeatedly entering and exiting the cab. The Scania L-series features a kneeling mode and lower boarding steps on both sides of the cab. Drivers can also take advantage of the space in front of the engine tunnel to exit on the passenger side, thereby avoiding oncoming traffic. \nKeeping an eye on safety \nIn addition to the better view over surrounding traffic, Scania introduces the City Safe Window. Drivers will thereby have better opportunities to detect nearby pedestrians and cyclists. The window on the passenger side door is available for all P- and L-series cabs, those most common in urban transport, as well as for the CrewCab. \nScania CrewCab \u2013 protecting those that protect \nSince Scania's new CrewCab will mainly be used by firefighters, it has been specifically tailored for emergency assignments, keeping both ergonomics and safety in mind. For extra safety, there is an option for up to four roll over side-curtain airbags. The CrewCab accommodates up to eight passengers with a high level of safety and comfort, which includes a separate climate system with its own heating for the crew area. \nBreakthrough for gas-fuelled long-haulage operations \nScania already offers the broadest range of trucks for renewable fuels, including ethanol, biodiesel, HVO as well as hybrid technology. \nWith Scania's introduction of a six-cylinder 13-litre gas engine specifically designed for regional and long-haulage operations, climate-conscious hauliers now have a strong alternative to conventional fossil fuels. For a 40-tonne truck-and-trailer combination with tanks for liquefied gas, the range has been extended to 1,100 kilometres. In parallel, Scania also releases a 9-litre gas engine for the new truck generation. \nIncreased uptime with flexible plans \nScania Maintenance with Flexible Plans is now also made available for the gas engine range.Significantly greater maintenance precision can be achieved on the basis of the vehicle's actual usage pattern as continuously monitored through connectivity. The solution ensures that every single truck gets exactly the right maintenance at exactly the right time, thereby reducing time in the workshop and increasing uptime. \n\"With the new generation trucks, Scania is taking major steps in improved safety, driver comfort and fuel economy. The released models have been universally praised and awarded for their innovative features and overall performance and we are certain that the new urban range will be equally successful,\" says Levin. \nMore information available on www.scania.com/group/en/section/pressroom/presskit/ . \nFor further information, please contact: \nHenrik Eng Product Director, Urban, Scania TrucksPhone: + 46-70-658-98-29", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christian levin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henrik eng product director", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "levin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "scania", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hvo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "urban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scania maintenance", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:54.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ba86ceeee61276fa84d0bb728456eb0e1606853", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1r8TizVebtIb3DV1HzPCgOi", "site_full": "nigeria.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://nigeria.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria News (News Reader) |", "title": "Tanzania:Cattle Supply At Pugu Auction Falls", "title_full": "Tanzania:Cattle Supply At Pugu Auction Falls", "published": "2017-12-07T11:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5727, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6ba86ceeee61276fa84d0bb728456eb0e1606853", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1r8TizVebtIb3DV1HzPCgOi", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Tanzania:Cattle Supply At Pugu Auction Falls", "text": "18 hours ago Tanzania:Cattle Supply At Pugu Auction Falls [Daily News] THE average of cattle supply at Pugu Auction market declined slightly by 6.2 per cent to 29,008 in November from 30,940 in the preceding month, the trend that pushed slightly retail prices in Dar es Salaam.

Ogogo and Emeagwai are Akinlabi\u2019s girlfriend and friend respectively. \nA team of five policemen, including Abua, had flagged down Ogogo at a checkpoint along Igbuzo Market. One of the policemen, identified as Nwokolo, was said to have demanded money from Akinlabi and the driver told him that he did not have N200 to give him. \nNwokolo reportedly said he would take one of the N1,000 notes Jerry had on him. As Akinlabi drove off from the checkpoint, Abua reportedly shot at the car and bullets pierced the back of the vehicle, hitting Ogogo, who sat at the back seat. \nThe bullet also grazed the back of Emeagwai, who was at the passenger\u2019s seat. Akinlabi revealed that four cops, including the team leader, one ASP Akhabue, were detained by the police, while Abua evaded arrest. \nAkinlabi said he took the victims to a general hospital in Igbuzo, from where Ogogo was referred to the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba. He said he called a senior police officer at Asaba who notified the state Commissioner of Police of the incident. \nHe said, \u201cThe CP and the DPO of the Igbozo Police Station came to the FMC and deposited N100,000, but I have spent much more than that. Meanwhile, the policeman who shot at us had gone to drop the gun at the station and fled. \nEmeagwai urged the police authorities not to sweep the case under the carpet, saying the policemen must be punished. The Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Andrew Aniamaka, said the policemen would be brought to book if found culpable after investigation.

There weren\u2019t outlets on the side of the bedroom with the beds and most were far or loose. The outlet attached to the lamp did not work. The beds did not have actual fitted sheets which was concerning. And the heater often blew cold air which caused me to have headaches over night. It wasn\u2019t until our last night that the hotel staff offered to move us to one of the newer rooms but it was already our last night and would have been more of a hassle to move our stuff from one room to another.

But when I heard the 108 Garage team were opening a second Japanese inspired restaurant I was more than happy to make the effort to try the new venue. \nLuca Longobardi and Chris Denney have taken over a Victorian Pub on Golborne Road and given the place a radical makeover. On the ground floor you\u2019ll find Southam Street Grill serving creative Japanese food and open for lunch and dinner. Upstairs they are opening a separate sake room, a raw bar, and a private members club, making it a one-stop destination for West London\u2019s movers and shakers. \nI absolutely loved the design, an eclectic mix of dusty pink paint, tropical wallpapers and vintage and velvet furniture. Japanese trinkets and old books sit looking pretty on the shelves. \nThe menu is an unusual pairing, familiar British produce with Japanese flavours and techniques. The list is split into: Snacks, Small Plates, Mains and Sides, and we were recommended to choose about three plates each. \nThe clear winner on our table of colourful dishes was the Crispy Skin Poussin with spring onion and coriander. The bird was beautifully cooked with a satisfyingly crispy skin and rested in a bowl of aromatic broth. The ideal winter dish. We also liked the Soft Shell Crab Harumaki (a kind of spring rolls) although the proportion of crab to vegetables felt a bit mean. Baby back ribs with chipotle miso and lime were very tasty but needed a little bit more spice to really impress. \nAll the sides were pleasant, comforting fried mushrooms with garlic and cilantro and Fries topped with curry sauce and cheese! \nI thought the dessert section of the menu needed a bit more thought.
