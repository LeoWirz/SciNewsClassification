December 7, 2017) - Jaxon Mining Inc. (TSXV: JAX) (FSE: 0U31) (OTC: JXMNF) is pleased to announce the completion of the Fall/Winter 2017 drilling program at its Hazelton silver-zinc project, located 50 kilometres north of Smithers, British Columbia in the prolific Skeena Arch. \nJaxon drilled a total of 2,281 metres in 12 diamond drill holes. Core logging is almost complete, and core splitting is on-going. As of today, 1019 samples have been selected to be sent to MS Analytical laboratory in Langley, BC. Delays are still being experienced at the lab due to an above-average volume of business late in the season. First assays are expected by late-December 2017. \nCore was sampled based on zones of mineralization, alteration and lithology and sampled intervals ranged in size from 0.5m to 2.0m, with the average being approximately 1.0m. Representative samples of core from mineralized zones have been selected for future petrographic studies as well. \nBruce Ballantyne, Jaxon's Project Manager, stated \"Jaxon is very appreciative of the excellent expert team work of the diamond drill crews, helicopter support, pad-builders, ground logistics and the professional work of the core logging, sampling and sawing, cutting and shipping crews. Considering that the oncoming winter weather made things difficult, the swift completion of the program was outstanding.\" He added, \"At this stage, Jaxon has strong confidence that the zones of mineralisation noted in the drill core are directly related to the anomaly trends as modelled from the 3D and 2D IP survey.\" \nJohn King Burns, Chairman of Jaxon, stated \"We would like to thank Bruce, our entire team, our contractors and the local community for designing and completing the drill program safely, on time and budget with no loss time accidents. We announced in the late fall that we were going to conduct a drill program at the Max Target before winter weather set in, we successfully closed a financing to pay for the work and we have now completed the program. We are already starting to design our exploration and drilling programs for the spring of 2018 and will announce those plans in the winter of 2018.\" \nThis news release has been reviewed and approved by Derrick Strickland, P.Geo. a qualified person for the purpose of National Instrument 43-101, standards and disclosure for mineral projects. \nAbout Jaxon \nJaxon is a precious and base metals exploration company with a regional focus on Western Canada.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite). Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., meets with reporters after House Republicans held a closed-door strategy session as the deadline looms to pass a spending bill to fund the government by week's end, on Capitol Hill... \nBy ALAN FRAMAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Congress seems set to prevent a weekend government shutdown, but lawmakers and President Donald Trump still have longer-range disputes to settle over spending, immigration and other issues before they can declare budget peace. \nWith many on both sides deciding a headline-grabbing federal closure would be a political blunder - at least for now - the House planned to approve legislation Thursday financing federal agencies through Dec. 22. The Senate seemed ready to follow. Without legislation, many agencies would run out of money after midnight Friday and grind to a close. \nThe two-week spending measure is aimed at giving both parties' bargainers more time to reach longer-term budget decisions. To jumpstart that negotiating, Trump and congressional leaders were meeting Thursday to try reaching agreements. \nThe prospects for successful White House talks were buffeted Wednesday when the impulsive Trump blurted to reporters that a shutdown \"could happen.\" He blamed Democrats, saying they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\" \nLast week, an unexpected attack by Trump on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., prompted the two Democrats to skip a bargaining session that was planned then. \nThis time, the White House smoothed the waters by following up with a more peaceable, written statement. It praised Pelosi and Schumer for choosing to \"put their responsibility to the American people above partisanship\" and said Trump was anticipating productive talks between \"leaders who put their differences aside.\" \nLater, the White House issued another statement indicating Trump would sign the two-week spending extension. It also laid out administration budget goals, saying money for the military including missile defense and security along the border with Mexico \"must be prioritized in a long-term funding agreement.\" \nFor Republicans, a shutdown would put a humiliating bookend on a year in which they've controlled the White House and Congress with little to show for it. They want the public to focus instead on the GOP's prized $1.5 trillion tax bill, which party leaders hope to send Trump by Christmas. \nThe two-week spending bill also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program. That widely popular program provides medical care to more than 8 million children. \nEven the head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members have been threatening to oppose the temporary spending measure, predicted passage. \n\"No one wants a shutdown, including Freedom Caucus members,\" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters. \nThe roughly 30-member caucus has been trying to win promises from leaders of spending curbs and quick passage of a full-year defense budget in exchange for backing the short-term bill. Without support from many of them, Republicans would need votes from Democrats to push the temporary spending measure through the House. \nWhile many Democrats seemed likely to oppose the short-term bill, enough were expected to support it in the Senate to allow its passage there.

AspenRidge Recovery, which operates addiction treatment facilities in both Lakewood and Fort Collins, opened the new Women\u2019s Center in the Fort Collins location and will begin accepting patients immediately. The Women\u2019s Center will provide both outpatient treatment and a 90-day in-house recovery setting.\n\u201cWe are excited to provide the option of an addiction treatment track specifically tailored to women in Northern Colorado,\u201d stated Cortland Mathers-Suter, Managing Director for AspenRidge Recovery. \u201cWe find that the vast majority of women with substance use disorders have a history of trauma, as well as gender specific needs that are different from men. Our therapies for our women\u2019s program focus on the addiction experience of women, and the trauma-related symptoms and relationship issues that frequently lead them to relapse.\u201d\nThe AspenRidge North women\u2019s program will provide comprehensive services for women including both intensive outpatient treatment and residence in a sober housing environment. During the 90-day recovery program, patients will participate in individually tailored programming for rehabilitation, have access to mental health, addiction, and trauma psychiatry, family psychiatry, and practical life skills classes to support reintegration to society. Female-specific therapy will address topics such as juggling family life and self-care, and the stresses of family caretaking. The specific therapies offered to women for post-traumatic stress include equine assisted therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), narrative therapies, experiential therapies, and Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT).\n\u201cThe women\u2019s program will provide a comfortable, family-style home environment and relaxed atmosphere for female patients, in addition to the latest evidence-based therapeutic methods to give patients the tools to live successful and sober lives,\u201d continued Mathers-Suter.\nThe AspenRidge North women\u2019s recovery home will have capacity for up to eight individuals in the 90-day program.

I quit cold turkey, started to learn and got a good IB within a year, started studying psychology at a university in the netherlands, but I quit that as it wasn\u2018t the right thing for me and beginning of this year I landed a job at an IT firm specialised in SAP development and consulting and I couldn\u2018t be happier", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:05:59.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a174f7a67a8cf09afc7859750e70291beedc904", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvytyEk9OkVqs761rCdu4pX2xOToHncIPMyOxqEklip.P2CTcswKCflw", "site_full": "forums.warframe.com", "site": "warframe.com", "site_section": "https://forums.warframe.com/forum/21-general/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "General - Warframe Forums", "title": "possible wii u placement??", "title_full": "possible wii u placement?? - General - Warframe Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T15:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://content.invisioncic.com/Mwarframe/monthly_2017_07/warframe_share.png.bec3c989c4517e865df9b45a300e63e0.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7793, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2a11473608b4dcf45e79e4cdc856c9f3866df505", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvytyEk9OkVqs761rCdu4pX2xOToHncIPMyOxqEklip.P0Gem9UNPsyECtrlPxHqYTY-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "(PS4)s3d_sas", "published": "2017-12-07T16:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Just now, furturgamesliker said: so it's a bad idea then?\nI think we need better 1 ?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:05:59.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "39577a39e2d2f301d1a6b8e7e450cb8a05d370fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W87hH.3oDj9Y8S8qGGExKAx0sRJX7bKVuozXXcAelbuK_7bU3n_fTqzGRLNlFsE3oqc_qHpdty4Vlp6_bdNivCGFCibzYCy.Vg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "What's the fastest way you've seen someone improve their life?", "title_full": "What's the fastest way you've seen someone improve their life? : AskReddit", "published": "2017-12-06T22:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 191, "participants_count": 181, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c1dc6b938a172fb590d88400c22d4c6f993e3127", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W87hH.3oDj9Y8S8qGGExKAx0sRJX7bKVuozXXcAelbuK_7bU3n_fTqzGRLNlFsE3oqc_qHpdty4Vlp6_bdNivCGci0KP29oObClb1cBHMgrf7vfGgjL_3VU-", "ord_in_thread": 160, "author": "NoobGaimz", "published": "2017-12-07T10:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "A guy living in my neightbourhood got punched really hard.

The phone will have a starting price of Rs 5,999 after the scheme expires, the same price tag seen on Xiaomi Redmi 4A. \nThe Redmi devices have already registered over 10 lakh buyers for the device across Flipkart and Xiaomi's official website. The company will also sell the device from brick and mortar stores in the country. The offline retail partners comprise Sangeetha, Poorvika, UniverCell, E-Zone and more. \nThe company has introduced an 8-day battery life with the new Redmi 5A. Xiaomi claims that 3000mAh battery on the Redmi 5A is good for a standby time of 8 days, or 7 hours of video playback. One of the biggest gripe with Xiaomi devices this year has been the hybrid SIM slot. Xiaomi has taken care of it with the Redmi 5A, giving it a dedicated microSD card slot apart from the dualSIM slots. \nAs earlier indications suggested, Xiaomi redmi 5A will be 'Made in India' and will have some changes as compared to the version sold in China. Launched in October earlier this year, the Chinese model of the sports a hybrid SIM tray, where the Redmi 5A will ship with a dual SIM slots and a dedicated microSD card slot. Additionaly, Xiaomi is bringing a 3GB RAM/32GB ROM variant to India which is not available in China. Processor \nThe Redmi 5A is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 quad-core chipset clocked at 1.4GHz. The device comes in two options, one with 2GB RAM, 16GB ROM, and another with 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage. The chipset will also be paired with Adreno 308 GPU. Design \nWhen it comes to design, the device looks similar to the previous iteration. However, this time around the company has used a metal body instead of polycarbonate that was used in the Xiaomi Redmi 4A. Similar to other current generation Redmi phones, the antenna-lines have been pushed to the edges of the device, giving it a cleaner look altogether. \nSimilar to the previous iteration Xiaomi Redmi 4A, the company will be skipping on the fingerprint sensor for this budget oriented Redmi 5A. Camera \nThe rear camera on the Redmi 5A sports a 13Megapixel module with an aperture of f/2.2. The camera comes with common features like HDR mode, panorama mode and burst mode. For the front camera, Xiaomi used a 5Megapixel sensor with an f/2.0 aperture. Display \nRedmi 5A features a 5-inch display with a resolution of 1280x720. The IPS LCD panel on the Redmi 5A is a multitouch display with a pixel density of 296ppi. \nConnectivity For connectivity, Xiaomi has placed a dual SIM tray which can either store two SIMs, along with a dedicated slot for a microSD card upto 128GB. The device comes equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1 and GPS with A-GPS, GLONASS, BDS, and a 3.5mm audio jack. The array of sensors on the device include an acccelerometer, a proximity sensor and ambient light sensor. \nThe Xiaomi Redmi 5A will also come with an IR blaster which can turn the device into a universal remote with the Mi Remote app. \nSoftware On the software front, the device will ship with MIUI 9 based on Android Nougat out of the box. \nBattery One of the biggest USP's of the previous Redmi 5A was its lasting battery and this time the company claims to have radically improved on that end. Xiaomi claims that the Redmi 5A can give a battery-life of eight days. Although the device sports a smaller 3000mAh battery, running MIUI9 and Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 helps the Xiaomi Redmi 5A with battery life. \nPrice The Xiaomi Redmi 5A has been launched in Indian with a introductory price of Rs 4,999 for the 2GB/16GB variant, making it the cheapest smartphone Xiaomi markets in India. The offer stands for the first 50 lakh customers only. After the introductory scheme expires, Xiaomi will sell the device at Rs 5,999 for the base variant and Rs 6,999 for the higher 3GB/32GB variant. \nAlso Watch:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "flipkart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "xiaomi redmi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sangeetha", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "univercell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "redmi 5a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gpu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "poorvika", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flipkart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:05:59.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "39577a39e2d2f301d1a6b8e7e450cb8a05d370fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W87hH.3oDj9Y8S8qGGExKAx0sRJX7bKVuozXXcAelbuK_7bU3n_fTqzGRLNlFsE3oqc_qHpdty4Vlp6_bdNivCGFCibzYCy.Vg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "What's the fastest way you've seen someone improve their life?", "title_full": "What's the fastest way you've seen someone improve their life? : AskReddit", "published": "2017-12-06T22:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 191, "participants_count": 181, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4b21632fa7e2ba78af34bb8f978407af882d2c22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W87hH.3oDj9Y8S8qGGExKAx0sRJX7bKVuozXXcAelbuK_7bU3n_fTqzGRLNlFsE3oqc_qHpdty4Vlp6_bdNivCGci0KP29oObClb1cBHMgrfqCzTpHFiIwU-", "ord_in_thread": 154, "author": "bubbieburrito", "published": "2017-12-07T10:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "As much as I would like to think that, it\u2019s not quite true.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:05:59.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e772d9af5cf970356e6222c144ecde9bb246dab9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeKTc2myOcgfHR.lbVoiBRw_ucuGGziRlzILqv4wPdn8ngwGkEX.YxhbC30X5p3v7pTmMmzJpxyVZMk9XEFvqmSwSwgzCzxxgN", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/shop-over-the-counter-medicine/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Over The Counter Medicine - Buy Over The Counter Medicine at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "Mederma Scar gel 20g", "title_full": "Mederma Scar gel 20g | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-03-11T16:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.947, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b1e3a5d76c99aaf94ef8a13ef869e828b487c149", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeKTc2myOcgfHR.lbVoiBRw_ucuGGziRlzILqv4wPdn8ngwGkEX.YxhbC30X5p3v7pTmMmzJpxyVZMk9XEFvqmS0dVWSFRZ.dc.mx2ssY4Jz4-", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Mohd Khairul", "published": "2017-11-28T23:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Proses penghantaran slow", "text": "Lambat gila proses supplier hantar ke lazada.

With 25 I was a spoiled shitty Kid that did nothing. I smoked Pot the whole day sold it very uneffective, basically that i can smoke for free. People that did stuff always told me \"you got it going, im working the whole day und you Just do party and chillig\". I was so fucked up i believed them. So while many of my Friends went places i only accomplished making my family and friends feel bad. Its a strange feeling when you never have to be anywhere after a Party. But Life catched up with me: 3 Things happend when i was 25. My stepdad died, my very pretty girlfirend finally got enough of my shit and went to the USA after breaking up with me and my Cat died. It might sound awfull but my cat diying tipped me over. I had her when i was 9. Her dead meant childhood over for me. I hit rockbottom. First thing i did i looked at my self. Something i had not done in years and saw what an absolute loser and asshole i was while acting cool. Just full of shit nothing but Big talking. That was actually satisfaying. I now knew that life was in my hand, even tho im at my worst. Also a woman told me at that time when i told her that im just a loser \"so Change it\". Nothing is sat in stone. I looked what worked before in my life. So i quitted Smoking Pot, Smoking in general and alcoholics over night. I knew i need my mind clear, like an instinct. I did Sport my whole life but hadnt since 5 years and got Out of shape. My lung function was a disaster and i did not go to the university in years. I went there and talked to the Secretary and we figguered Out my mess. A friend of Mine got coach from a Team and i jumped the oppertunity. It took years to catch up, but i got my ambition back.\nRight now im 30. Im done with my Bachelor, im a Football Player that is regulary in the papers and im working as a football Coach for 16-18 years old. Im also wokring as a Sport teacher. People now say that im very reliable and engaged. They seek me for advice, approval or Just comfort. Something i couldnt Imagine years ago.\nIn the end life is just your making. As a rule of thumb i always take the oppertunity given, sometimes It doesnt work out, but you will never regret it. It might read fast but dont be mistaken. Its hard Work, it takes self discipline and time and still some things will fail.

The company has itself released a few new images of the devices but hasn't revealed much of what's under the hood or even the pricing of the device. \nThe devices will be instrumental to Xiaomi's success in the Indian market. The company had come neck to neck with Samsung in India during the third quarter of the year. The Redmi series was the biggest contributor to the brand's success in India. Redmi Note 4 was the best selling device online and the company's expansion to brick and mortar stores has just given them more penetration in the market. \nThe new devices that will be unveiled today will also fall in the budget segment and is expected to undercut competition in terms pricing. AliExpress, a Chinese e-tailer had listed the device on its website along with the prices. According to the listing, Redmi 5 has been priced at $199 (approx Rs 12,800) for the Black and Gold colour and $209 (approx Rs 13,500) for the pink and blue colour. \nThe Redmi 5 Plus was priced at $249 (Rs 16,000) on the retailer's website. Since all this information has not been verified by Xiaomi, it's better for the reader to take the information with a grain of salt. \nThe main attraction on both the devices will be the tall Full Display. Apart from that, the device features a single lens 12Megapixel camera on the rear panel and a 5 Megapixel front facing snapper. \nThe Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus will also come with the latest MIUI 9 out of the box. So far, leaks have suggested that the Redmi 5 will feature a 5.7inch full display and the Redmi 5 Plus will feature a 5.9 inch display. Earlier, the device was spotted on the listing of Chinese regulator TENAA. \nRedmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus will feature a 1.8GHz processor which could be the Snapdragon 625. However, considering previous iterations of the device, Xiaomi might opt for a more budget oriented Snapdragon 450. \nThe device is expected to feature a much smaller 3200mAH battery in comparison to last year's Redmi 4. The Redmi device will come in three variants with 16GB, 32GB and 64GB variants. \nComing to the bigger Redmi 5 Plus, the device is expected to come with a bigger 4000mAH battery and stronger Snapdragon 600-series chipset. Given the popularity of the Redmi series in India, the company might get the new devices to Indian shores soon after the official launch.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xiaomi redmi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "redmi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "miui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "megapixel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tenaa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:05:59.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "39577a39e2d2f301d1a6b8e7e450cb8a05d370fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W87hH.3oDj9Y8S8qGGExKAx0sRJX7bKVuozXXcAelbuK_7bU3n_fTqzGRLNlFsE3oqc_qHpdty4Vlp6_bdNivCGFCibzYCy.Vg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "What's the fastest way you've seen someone improve their life?", "title_full": "What's the fastest way you've seen someone improve their life? : AskReddit", "published": "2017-12-06T22:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 191, "participants_count": 181, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3f8a55a6968b83f2b904b2726b5193216176b4ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W87hH.3oDj9Y8S8qGGExKAx0sRJX7bKVuozXXcAelbuK_7bU3n_fTqzGRLNlFsE3oqc_qHpdty4Vlp6_bdNivCGci0KP29oObClb1cBHMgrf6lEPBVWhJnU-", "ord_in_thread": 146, "author": "Nlz90", "published": "2017-12-07T10:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Once I saw a guy in the club, restless like he is hesitating to do something.\nLater on he found the courage to approach this girl that he apparently liked.\nThey got married last week.\nOK that didn't happen, but it could have.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:05:59.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "39577a39e2d2f301d1a6b8e7e450cb8a05d370fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W87hH.3oDj9Y8S8qGGExKAx0sRJX7bKVuozXXcAelbuK_7bU3n_fTqzGRLNlFsE3oqc_qHpdty4Vlp6_bdNivCGFCibzYCy.Vg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "What's the fastest way you've seen someone improve their life?", "title_full": "What's the fastest way you've seen someone improve their life? : AskReddit", "published": "2017-12-06T22:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 191, "participants_count": 181, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "97dc9cfbbb2cbd1845abab46e307cf50e483ea11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W87hH.3oDj9Y8S8qGGExKAx0sRJX7bKVuozXXcAelbuK_7bU3n_fTqzGRLNlFsE3oqc_qHpdty4Vlp6_bdNivCGci0KP29oObClb1cBHMgrfDfnAb2PszJk-", "ord_in_thread": 168, "author": "purpleseaurchen", "published": "2017-12-07T10:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quitting drugs and switching to an all organic diet.

Usually not a big deal, they roll off after 1 month... EXCEPT on your hiring matrix score where it stays on for a year, so it would expire the following September right at the start of the Peak season when they freeze all promotions so I realized I wouldn't even have a shot at getting so much as an interview until February 2017, 17 months later...\nI decided right then and there I'd had enough and knew at the start of 2016 I would look for a new job and do it in time to be able to take their annual buyout offer. On Dec. 31st I started looking for jobs, I must have applied to about 50 - 60 in all sorts of fields, and went to about 7 or 8 interviews in January. My biggest issue being pay as I was paid \"decent\" as my top-out was about double minimum wage, and most entry-level positions anywhere paid several dollars less than that.\nEventually, with only a couple of days left to take the buyout offer, I got a start date for a factory assignment from a temp agency, and immediately that same day I took the buyout offer from my employer (which made me non-rehireable). The pay at my new assignment was also like $2 per hour less than what I was making (but with higher top-out), all in all it seemed a stupid thing to do. Quit a stable better paying job I worked at full time for a temp one and no way to go back to my old one, but I was done with them and wanted change.\n6 weeks into that assignment I received a phone call from another place I had applied for and offered a temporary position, at first I was getting comfortable and was going to turn them down but then they mentioned the pay and it was way too good to turn down, so I went.\n10 months into that job I received a hiring packet, in February 2017 and was hired on full time 2 months later. I now work for a company making $4 more per hour than the top-out was at my old employer where I will eventually top out at more than double my old salary. It's easy work, low stress, and great co-workers, many of which are in their early twenties buying brand new houses and vehicles.\nSo one decision to leave a job I hated landed me a much better one within 6 months with a much brighter future and better career opportunities.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:05:59.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "39577a39e2d2f301d1a6b8e7e450cb8a05d370fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W87hH.3oDj9Y8S8qGGExKAx0sRJX7bKVuozXXcAelbuK_7bU3n_fTqzGRLNlFsE3oqc_qHpdty4Vlp6_bdNivCGFCibzYCy.Vg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "What's the fastest way you've seen someone improve their life?", "title_full": "What's the fastest way you've seen someone improve their life? : AskReddit", "published": "2017-12-06T22:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 191, "participants_count": 181, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "23b24b7726cc7ff1478d81fbfd405a7a7d0b364f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W87hH.3oDj9Y8S8qGGExKAx0sRJX7bKVuozXXcAelbuK_7bU3n_fTqzGRLNlFsE3oqc_qHpdty4Vlp6_bdNivCGci0KP29oObClb1cBHMgrfN76YYtZJ2QQ-", "ord_in_thread": 170, "author": "ThingsUponMyHead", "published": "2017-12-07T10:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Not nearly as impressive as some other stories on here.

Cricket - India v Sri Lanka- Third Test Match - Feroz Shah Kotla, New Delhi - December 5, 2017 - A Sri Lankan player, wearing a face mask, gestures as he walks in the field. REUTERS/Stringer Three months after subjecting Sri Lanka to a 9-0 whitewash across all formats, Virat Kohli\u2019s men prevailed 1-0 in the latest round of a duel between the neighbours to seal their record-equalling ninth consecutive test series win. Three of those triumphs have come against an unsettled and inexperienced Sri Lankan side in the throes of a tricky transition period following the retirements of batting stalwarts Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara in 2015. India\u2019s six other series wins in this period includes home triumphs against South Africa, New Zealand, England, Bangladesh and Australia, as well as a victory over West Indies in the Caribbean. While it makes financial sense for Sri Lanka to play India, the game\u2019s economic engine, the home board (BCCI) said the latest series, an underwhelming prospect for fans, was unavoidable as it had to honour its commitment to the calendar. \u201cThe back-to-back series resulted from what had been committed in the past in the current FTP (Future Tours Programme),\u201d BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary told reporters on the sidelines of the third and final test in Delhi. \u201cThe observation of the captain of the team will be a substantial basis of further discussions on FTP.\u201d Cricket - India v Australia - India Team's Practice Session - Indore, India \u2013 September 23, 2017 \u2013 India's captain Virat Kohli plays with a soccer ball. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi Indian captains seldom talk about scheduling issues but Kohli has expressed concerns that the frequency of certain contests might result in plenty of empty seats in the stands. \u201cIt definitely has to be taken into consideration because you don\u2019t want fans going away from the game or not watching,\u201d Kohli said ahead of the back-to-back series against Sri Lanka, who have managed only one win in the last nine tests against their neighbours. A policeman walks past a logo of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) during a governing council meeting of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at BCCI headquarters in Mumbai April 26, 2010. REUTERS/Arko Datta/File Photo \u201cWe have to find a balance between how to engage the fans and, at the same time, keep players fresh, keep cricket exciting and have very competitive going throughout the year.\u201d India also played five one-dayers in Sri Lanka this year, against an opponent containing many regulars in the Indian Premier League (IPL). \u201cThis analysis has to be done over a period of time, by asking fans who watch the game,\u201d Kohli said. \u201dFor someone watching the game, it is very different than someone playing the game. For us, there is no room for saying that I don\u2019t want to play this game. \u201cI don\u2019t know if too much cricket is being played, or (it\u2018s) repetition of the same series...

Current price levels place the shares above the rising trendline. \nA principle of technical analysis is that once a trend has been formed (two or more peaks/troughs have touched the trendline and reversed direction) it will remain intact until broken. That sounds much more simplistic than it is! The goal is to analyze the current trend using trendlines and then either invest with the current trend until the trendline is broken, or wait for the trendline to be broken and then invest with the new (opposite) trend. \nOne of the basic tenets put forth by Charles Dow in the Dow Theory is that security prices do trend. Trends are often measured and identified by \u201ctrendlines.\u201d A trendline is a sloping line that is drawn between two or more prominent points on a chart. Rising trends are defined by a trendline that is drawn between two or more troughs (low points) to identify price support. Falling trend-s are defined by trendlines that are drawn between two or more peaks (high points) to identify price resistance. \nInvestors may be watching other technical indicators such as the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. The Williams %R is a momentum indicator that helps measure oversold and overbought levels. This indicator compares the closing price of a stock in relation to the highs and lows over a certain time period. A common look back period is 14 days. Heico Cp Cl A (HEI.A)\u2019s Williams %R presently stands at -19.80. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would indicate an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would indicate an oversold situation. \nHeico Cp Cl A (HEI.A)\u2019s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R presently is at -19.80. In general, if the reading goes above -20, the stock may be considered to be overbought. Alternately, if the indicator goes under -80, this may show the stock as being oversold. The Williams %R indicator helps show the relative situation of the current price close to the period being observed. \nWe can also take a look at the Average Directional Index or ADX of Heico Cp Cl A (HEI.A). The ADX is used to measure trend strength. ADX calculations are made based on the moving average price range expansion over a specified amount of time. ADX is charted as a line with values ranging from 0 to 100. The indicator is non-directional meaning that it gauges trend strength whether the stock price is trending higher or lower. The 14-day ADX sits at 26.11. In general, and ADX value from 0-25 would represent an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would indicate a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would signify an extremely strong trend. At the time of writing, Heico Cp Cl A (HEI.A)   59.21. Developed by Donald Lambert, the CCI is a versatile tool that may be used to help spot an emerging trend or provide warning of extreme conditions. CCI generally measures the current price relative to the average price level over a specific time period. CCI is relatively high when prices are much higher than average, and relatively low when prices are much lower than the average. \nA commonly used tool among technical stock analysts is the moving average. Moving averages are considered to be lagging indicators that simply take the average price of a stock over a certain period of time. Moving averages can be very helpful for identifying peaks and troughs. They may also be used to assist the trader figure out proper support and resistance levels for the stock. Currently, the 200-day MA is sitting at 67.91. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of stock price movements. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder, and it oscillates between 0 and 100. Generally, the RSI is considered to be oversold when it falls below 30 and overbought when it heads above 70. RSI can be used to detect general trends as well as finding divergences and failure swings. The 14-day RSI is presently standing at 71.41, the 7-day is 72.83, and the 3-day is resting at 66.90.

Advertisement \nIstanbul, Turkey /AFP/. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan begins the first visit by a Turkish head of state to Greece in 65 years Thursday, with concerns over relations as Athens said it was \"worried\" by his comments perceived as reviving territorial friction.Ties between Turkey and Greece have warmed over the past 20 years, after decades of tension that almost sparked a miltary confrontation in 1996 ended when earthquakes struck both countries in 1999.Relations today are relatively cordial, but a Greek government spokesman expressed concern after the Turkish president called for \"improvements\" to how airspace and waters between the two states are delineated in the Aegean Sea in a television interview on Wednesday.\"The interview today with Erdogan raises serious worries and questions,\" said Dimitris Tzanakopoulos in a statement, adding that Athens sees the visit as \"an opportunity to build bridges, not walls\".With Turkey's bid to join the EU at a standstill and relations with much of the West frigid, Erdogan's trip will be only his second visit to an EU member since last year's failed coup, after talks in Poland this October.Turkey's president Celal Bayar visited Greece in 1952, the same year the two countries simultaneously joined NATO with strong American backing.Erdogan visited Greece twice as prime minister in 2004 and 2010, building on a rapprochement between Ankara and Athens that only began in earnest after the destructive quakes.- 'Wide divide exists' -The two countries have uneasy relations dating back to the creation of the modern Turkish Republic out of the ruins of the Ottoman Empire.But Erdogan's Islamic-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002, sought a more pragmatic relationship based on trade and tourism, and Greece became a key backer of the Turkish bid to join the EU.\"Erdogan's visit can be seen as part of the long phase of rapprochement between the two countries that began in 1999,\" Dimitrios Triantaphyllou, director of the Centre for International and European Studies at Kadir Has University in Istanbul, told AFP.But he added that while Greek-Turkish relations can be seen as \"relatively robust\", none of a whole range of outstanding issues between the two sides have been resolved.\"Beyond the pragmatism, a wide divide exists between the two countries,\" he said.Athens is unhappy over Turkey's upkeep of Byzantine heritage in Istanbul, the former Constantinople, including the Hagia Sophia, which is officially a museum but has seen an uptick in Muslim worship in the last years.Greece has also been rattled by Erdogan's sometimes angry tirades against the post World War I treaties that set the countries' modern borders and meant almost all the Aegean Sea islands are Greek territory.Erdogan revisited the issue Wednesday in an interview with Greece's Skai TV, saying existing territorial waters were \"quite problematic\" for Turkish maritime liners plying the Aegean, \"and this is not something that we can live with\".Ankara, meanwhile, is unhappy that Greece is hosting suspects wanted over the 2016 failed coup and who fled Turkey, notably eight troops who escaped by helicopter on the night of the putsch.Another festering sore is Cyprus, where the northern portion of the island is still occupied by Turkish troops following the 1974 invasion in response to an Athens-inspired coup aimed at uniting it with Greece.Much-touted peace talks this year that brought together both sides on the divided island as well as Greece, Turkey and colonial power Britain ended without a breakthrough.\"While over the last decades economic cooperation and commercial and tourist ties between the two countries have been very active, their relations still get stuck on the same differences,\" said Jean Marcou, associate researcher at the French Institute of Anatolian Studies.- 'Deep relations' -Athens and Ankara are cooperating over the migrant crisis, following a deal between Turkey and the EU which has significantly stemmed the flow of people to Europe.The Turkish president's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkey had \"deep\" relations with Greece and applauded Athens' support for the embattled Turkish EU membership bid.He confirmed Erdogan would first go to Athens to meet Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and then to the northeastern Thrace region, home to Greece's main Muslim minority.Erdogan has a relatively warm relationship with Alexis Tsipras, the leftist politician who became Greek prime minister in 2015 and generally eschews nationalist rhetoric against Turkey.Tsipras told Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency in an interview ahead of the visit that suspected coup plotters \"were not welcome\" in Greece and emphasised the importance of dialogue between Turkey and the EU.In a move seen by Turkish commentators as a gesture to Ankara, nine suspected members of the Marxist Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C), branded a terrorist organisation by Turkey were last week charged by a Greek prosecutor. advertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

When literally everything else in the sport compact segment goes extinct, auto, hybrid, or electron-powered, maybe then Honda can offer a two-peddled Sport-injection Civic.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:02.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "040251ff8bfdce485493ba3cd8a77448ef7ea4c1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfI5VQz788xFZLx22j.aFMz9x1Z_guDUEimgKBBLhwkHFZd2oGANI4ACDrLhVYLZZKN.9b8jPywQVb1b.UI.snPdMNF_YVVLaJtyJmmQ9wxpF2.JccND4fUfMYQlfYcAncyIvvXRfxb0d", "site_full": "www.finanznachrichten.de", "site": "finanznachrichten.de", "site_section": "http://www.finanznachrichten.de/rss-news", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "FinanzNachrichten.de: News", "title": "Ladbrokes Coral And GVC In 'detailed' Takeover Talks", "title_full": "Ladbrokes Coral And GVC In 'detailed' Takeover Talks", "published": "2017-12-07T10:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://fns1.de/g/fb.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20838, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "040251ff8bfdce485493ba3cd8a77448ef7ea4c1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfI5VQz788xFZLx22j.aFMz9x1Z_guDUEimgKBBLhwkHFZd2oGANI4ACDrLhVYLZZKN.9b8jPywQVb1b.UI.snPdMNF_YVVLaJtyJmmQ9wxpF2.JccND4fUfMYQlfYcAncyIvvXRfxb0d", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Ladbrokes Coral And GVC In 'detailed' Takeover Talks", "text": "Ladbrokes Coral And GVC In 'detailed' Takeover Talks LONDON (dpa-AFX) - Ladbrokes Coral Group plc (LAD.L) said it is in 'detailed' discussions regarding a takeover by GVC Holdings plc (GVC.L) in a deal which would value the group at 3.9 billion pounds.As per the terms of the Possible Offer, Ladbrokes Coral shareholders would be entitled to 32.7 pence in cash and 0.141 ordinary GVC shares for each Ladbrokes Coral share, and a potential further value of up to 42.8 pence structured as a contingent value right 'CVR'. The companies anticipate that Ladbrokes Coral shareholders would hold about 46.5 per cent, and GVC shareholders would hold about 53.5 per cent of the issued and to be issued share capital of the enlarged group.Based on the respective Ladbrokes Coral and GVC share prices as at the close of business on 6 December 2017, the Possible Offer values Ladbrokes Coral at 160.9 pence per Ladbrokes Coral share, equating to a total equity value of about 3.1 billion pounds, plus a CVR of up to 42.8 pence per Ladbrokes Coral share, equating to a total equity value of up to about 3.9 billion pounds, including the maximum CVR.It is expected that the Proposed Offer would include a mix and match facility allowing Ladbrokes Coral shareholders the opportunity to elect to receive more cash or more new ordinary shares in GVC, subject to offsetting elections made by other Ladbrokes Coral shareholders, as the case may be. The CVR would not be included in the mix and match facility.Whilst the determination of the senior management positions will be finalised by the parties over the coming weeks, it has been agreed by the parties that Kenneth Alexander would be the CEO of the enlarged group should the transaction proceed to completion.The Board of GVC also believes that the transaction will be double digit EPS accretive from the first full year post-completion and following all reasonably expected outcomes of the Triennial Review, including the FOBT maximum stake being set at 2.00 pounds.As per the U.K. rule, GVC is required, by not later than 5.00 pm (London time) on 4 January 2018, either to announce a firm intention to make an offer for Ladbrokes Coral or to announce that it does not intend to make an offer.
