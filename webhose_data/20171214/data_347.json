He packed his bag with his most treasured possessions before going to bed: the 1 terabyte hard drive with his evidence against the Islamic State group, an orange notebook half-filled with notes on Ottoman history, and, a keepsake, the first book from Amazon delivered to Mosul. He passed the night in despair, imagining all the ways he could die, and the moment he would leave his mother and his city. He had spent nearly his entire life in this home, with his five brothers and five sisters. He woke his mother in her bedroom on the ground floor. \"I am leaving,\" he said. \"Where?\" she asked. \"I am leaving,\" was all he could say. He couldn't endanger her by telling her anything more. In truth, since the IS had invaded his city, he'd lived a life about which she was totally unaware. He felt her eyes on the back of his neck, and headed to the waiting Chevrolet. He didn't look back. For nearly two years, he'd wandered the streets of occupied Mosul, chatting with shopkeepers and Islamic State fighters, visiting friends who worked at the hospital, swapping scraps of information. He grew out his hair and his beard and wore the shortened trousers required by IS. He forced himself to witness the beheadings and deaths by stoning, so he could hear the killers call out the names of the condemned and their supposed crimes. He wasn't a spy. He was an undercover historian and blogger . As IS turned the Iraqi city he loved into a fundamentalist bastion, he decided he would show the world how the extremists had distorted its true nature, how they were trying to rewrite the past and forge a brutal Sunni-only future for a city that had once welcomed many faiths. He knew that if he was caught he too would be killed. \"I am writing this for the history , because I know this will end. People will return, life will go back to normal,\" is how he explained the blog that was his conduit to the citizens of Mosul and the world beyond. \"After many years, there will be people who will study what happened. The city deserves to have something written to defend the city and tell the truth, because they say that when the war begins, the first victim is the truth.\" He called himself Mosul Eye . He made a promise to himself in those first few days: Trust no one, document everything. Neither family, friends nor the Islamic State group could identify him. His readership grew by the thousands every month. And now, he was running for his life. But it would mean passing through one Islamic State checkpoint after another, on the odds that the extremists wouldn't stop him, wouldn't find the hard drive that contained evidence of IS atrocities, the names of its collaborators and fighters, and all the evidence that its bearer was the man they'd been trying to silence since they first swept in. The weight of months and years of anonymity were crushing him. He missed his name. --- From the beginning, Mosul Eye wrote simultaneously as a witness and a historian. Born in the midst of the Iran-Iraq war in 1986, he had come of age during a second war, when Saddam Hussein fell and the Americans took over. At 17, he remembers going to a meeting of extremists at the mosque and hearing them talk about fighting the crusaders. \"I should be honest, I didn't understand.\" As for the Americans, whose language he already spoke haltingly, he couldn't fathom why they would come all the way from the United States to Mosul. He thought studying history would give him the answers. The men in black came from the north, cutting across his neighborhood in brand new trucks, the best all-terrain Toyotas money could buy. He had seen jihadis before in Mosul and at first figured these men would fade away like the rest. But in the midst of pitched fighting, the extremists found the time to run down about 70 assassination targets and kill them all, hanging enormous banners announcing their arrival in June 2014. By then a newly minted teacher, the historian attended a staff meeting at Mosul University, where the conquerors explained the Islamic State education system, how all classes would be based upon the strictest interpretation of the Quran. To a man who had been accused of secularism during his master's thesis defense just the year before, it felt like the end of his career. In those first few days, he wrote observations about IS, also known by the acronym ISIS, on his personal Facebook page - until a friend warned that he risked being killed. With the smell of battle still in the air, he wandered the streets, puzzling over its transformation into a city at war. He returned to find his family weeping. The smell of smoke and gunfire permeated the home. On June 18, 2014, a week after the city fell, Mosul Eye was born . \"My job as a historian requires an unbiased approach which I am going to adhere to and keep my personal opinion to myself,\" he wrote. \"I will only communicate the facts I see.\" By day, he chatted with Islamic State fighters and vendors, and observed. Always observed. By night, he wrote in his native Arabic and fluent English on a WordPress blog and later on Facebook and Twitter. The city turned dark, and Mosul Eye became one of the outside world's main sources of news about the Islamic State fighters, their atrocities and their transformation of the city into a grotesque shadow of itself. The things IS wanted kept secret went to the heart of its brutal rule. \"They were organized as a killing machine. They are thirsty (for) blood and money and women.\" He attended Friday sermons with feigned enthusiasm. He collected and posted propaganda leaflets, including one on July 27, 2014, that claimed the Islamic State leader was a descendent of the Prophet Mohammed's daughter. Back home, writing on his blog in his other, secret identity, he decried the leaflet as a blatant attempt \"to distort history\" to justify the fanatics' actions. He drank glass after glass of tea at the hospital, talking to people who worked there. Much of the information he collected went up online. Other details he kept in his computer, for fear they would give away his identity. Someday, he told himself, he would write Mosul's history using these documents. The most sensitive information initially came from two old friends: one a doctor and the other a high school dropout who embraced the Islamic State's extreme interpretation of religion. He was a taxi driver who like many others in Mosul had been detained by a Shiite militia in 2008 and still burned with resentment. He swiftly joined an intelligence unit in Mosul, becoming \"one of the monsters of ISIS\" - and couldn't resist bragging about his insider knowledge. Once he corroborated the details and masked the sources, Mosul Eye put it out for the world to see. He sometimes included photos of the fighters and commanders, complete with biographies pieced together over days of surreptitious gathering of bits and pieces of information during the course of his normal life - that of an out-of-work scholar living at home with his family. \"I used the two characters, the two personalities to serve each other,\" he said. He would chat up market vendors and bored checkpoint guards for new leads. He took on other identities as well on Facebook. Although the names were clearly fake, the characters started to take on a life of their own. One was named Mouris Milton whom he came to believe was an even better version of himself - funny, knowledgeable. Another was Ibn al-Athir al-Mawsilli, a coldly logical historian. International media picked up on Mosul Eye from the first days, starting with an online question-and-answer with a German newspaper. The anonymous writer gave periodic written interviews in English over the years. Sometimes, journalists quoted his blog and called it an interview. In October 2016, he spoke by phone with the New Yorker for a profile but still kept his identity masked. Intelligence agencies made contact as well and he rebuffed them each time. \"I am not a spy or a journalist,\" he would say. \"I tell them this: If you want the information, it's published and it's public for free. Take it.\" First the Islamic State group compiled lists of women accused of prostitution, he said, stoning or shooting around 500 in the initial months. Then it went after men accused of being gay, flinging them off tall buildings. Shiites, Christians and Yazidis fled from a city once proud of its multiple religions. When the only Mosul residents left were fellow Sunnis, they too were not spared, according to the catalog of horrors that is Mosul Eye's daily report. He detailed the deaths and whippings, for spying and apostasy, for failing to attend prayers, for overdue taxes. The blog attracted the attention of the fanatics, who posted death threats in the comments section. --- Less than a year into their rule, in March 2015, he nearly cracked. IS beheaded a 14-year-old in front of a crowd; 12 people were arrested for selling and smoking cigarettes, and some of them flogged publicly. Seeing few alternatives, young men from Mosul were joining up by the dozens. The sight of a fanatic severing the hand of a child accused of stealing unmoored him. The man told the boy that his hand was a gift of repentance to God before serenely slicing it away. It was too much. Mosul Eye was done. He defied the dress requirements, cut his hair short, shaved his beard and pulled on a bright red crewneck sweater. He persuaded his closest friend to join him. \"I decided to die.\" The sun shining, they drove to the banks of the Tigris blasting forbidden music from the car. They spread a scrap of rug over a stone outcropping and shared a carafe of tea. Mosul Eye lit a cigarette, heedless of a handful of other people picnicking nearby. \"I was so tired of worrying about myself, my family, my brothers. I am not alive to worry, but I am alive to live this life. I thought: I am done.\" He planned it as a sort of last supper, a final joyful day to end all days. He assumed he would be spotted, arrested, tortured. The tea was the best he had ever tasted. Somehow, incredibly, his crimes went unnoticed. He went home. \"At that moment I felt like I was given a new life.\" He grew out his hair and beard again, put the shortened trousers back on. And, for the remainder of his time in Mosul, smoked and listened to music in his room with the curtains drawn and the lights off. His computer screen and the tip of his cigarette glowed as he wrote in the dark. The next month, he slipped up. His friend the ex-taxi driver told him about an airstrike that had just killed multiple high-level Islamic State commanders, destroying a giant weapons cache. Elated, Mosul Eye dashed home to post it online. He hit \"publish\" and then, minutes later, realized his mistake. The information could have come from only one person. He trashed the post and spent a sleepless night. \"It's like a death game and one mistake could finish your life.\" For a week, he went dark. Then he invited his friend to meet at a restaurant. They ate spicy chicken, an unemployed teacher and the gun-toting ex-taxi driver talking again about their city and their lives. His cover was not blown. The historian went back online. Alongside the blog, he kept meticulous records - information too dangerous to share. His computer hard drive filled with death, filed according to date, cause of death, perpetrator, neighborhood and ethnicity. Accompanying each spreadsheet entry was a separate file with observations from each day. \"IS is forcing abortions and tubal ligation surgeries on Yazidi women,\" he wrote in unpublished notes from January 2015. A doctor told him there had been between 50 and 60 forced abortions and a dozen Yazidi girls younger than 15 died of injuries from repeated rapes. April 19, 2015: \"The forensics department received the bodies of 23 IS militants killed in Baiji. They had no shrapnel, no bullets, no explosives and the cause of death does not seem to be explosion. It is like nothing happened to the bodies. A medical source believes they were exposed to poison gas.\" July 7, 2015: \"43 citizens were executed in different places, this time by gunfire, which is unusual because they were previously beheadings. A source inside IS said that 13 of those who were executed are fighters and they tried to flee.\" He noted a flurry of security on days when the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, seemed to be in town. Many in Iraq, especially those who supported the Shiite-dominated leadership in Baghdad, blamed Mosul for its own fate. Mosul Eye freely acknowledged that some residents at first believed the new conquerors could only be an improvement over the heavy-handed government and the soldiers who fled with hardly a backward glance at the city they were supposed to defend. But he also wrote publicly and privately of the suffering among citizens who refused to join the group. He was fighting on two fronts: \"One against ISIS, and the other against the rumors. Trying to protect the face of Mosul, the soul of Mosul.\" He tested out different voices, implying one day that he was Christian, another that he was Muslim. Sometimes he indicated he was gone, other times that he was still in the city. \"I couldn't trust anyone,\" he said. In his mind, he left Mosul a thousand times, but always found reasons to stay: his mother, his nieces and nephews, his mission. But finally, he had to go. \"I had to run away with the proof that will protect Mosul for years to come, and to at least be loyal to the people who were killed in the city.\" And he did not want to become another casualty of the monsters. \"I think I deserve life, deserve to be alive.\" A smuggler, persuaded by $1,000 and the assurances of a mutual acquaintance, agreed to get him out. He was leaving the next day. Mosul Eye had no time to reflect, no time to change his mind. He returned home and began transferring the contents of his computer to the hard drive. He pulled out the orange notebook with the hand-drawn map of Mosul on the cover and the outlines of what he hoped would one day be his doctoral dissertation. Into the bag went \"Father Bombo's Pilgrimage to Mecca,\" an obscure American satirical novel from 1770 that he had ordered from Amazon via a new shop that was the only place in town to order from abroad online. It was time to leave. He wanted to make sure his mother would never have to watch the capture and killing of Mosul Eye. On Dec. 15, 2015 he left Mosul, driving with the smuggler to the outskirts of Raqqa, a pickup point that alarmed him. From there he and other Iraqis and Syrians were picked up by a second set of smugglers and driven by convoy to Turkey. They had no trouble crossing the border. -- In Turkey, Mosul Eye kept at it: via WhatsApp and Viber, from Facebook messages and long conversations with friends and relatives who had contacts within IS. From hundreds of kilometers away, his life remained consumed by events in Mosul. By mid-2016, deaths were piling up faster than he could document. The IS and airstrikes were taking a bloody toll on residents. His records grew haphazard, and he turned to Twitter to document the atrocities. In February 2017, he received asylum in Europe with the aid of an organization that learned his backstory. He continued to track the airstrikes and Islamic State killings He mapped the airstrikes as they closed in on his family, pleading with his older brother to leave his home in West Mosul. Ahmed, 36, died days later when shrapnel from a mortar strike pierced his heart, leaving behind four young children. It was only then that Mosul Eye revealed his secret to a younger brother - who was proud to learn the anonymous historian he had been reading for so long was his brother. \"People in Mosul had lost hope and confidence in politicians, in everything,\" his brother said. Mosul Eye \"managed to show that it's possible to change the situation in the city and bring it back to life.\" As the Old City crumbled, Mosul Eye sent coordinates and phone numbers for homes filled with civilians to a BBC journalist who was covering the battle, trying to get the attention of someone in the coalition command. He believes he saved lives. Then, with his beloved Old City destroyed, Mosul Eye launched a fundraiser to rebuild the city's libraries because the extremists had burned all the books. None of his volunteers knew his identity. An activist who helped co-found a \"Women of Mosul\" Facebook group with Mosul Eye describes him as a \"spiritual leader\" for the city's secular-minded. \"He was telling us about the day-to-day events under ISIS and we were following closely with excitement as if we were watching a movie. Sometimes he went through hard times and we used to encourage him. He won the people's trust and we became very curious to know his real personality,\" said the activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she believed she was still in danger. From a distance, finally writing his dissertation on 19th century Mosul history in the safety of a European city, he continued to write as Mosul Eye and organize cultural events and fundraisers from afar - even after Mosul was liberated. The double life consumed him, sapped energy he'd rather use for the doctoral dissertation and for helping Mosul rebuild. And it hurt when someone asked the young Iraqi why he didn't do more to help his people. He desperately wanted his mother to know all that he had done. He felt barely real, with so many people knowing him by false identities: 293,000 followers on Facebook, 37,000 on WordPress and 23,400 on Twitter. In hours of face-to-face conversations with The Associated Press over the course of two months, he agonized over when and how to end the anonymity that plagued him. He did not want to be a virtual character anymore. On Nov. 15, 2017, Mosul Eye made his decision. \"I can't be anonymous anymore. This is to say that I defeated ISIS. You can see me now, and you can know me now.\" He is 31 years old. His name is Omar Mohammed. \"I am a scholar.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "saddam hussein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "viber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mouris milton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul eye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omar mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yazidis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu bakr al-baghdadi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibn al-athir al-mawsilli", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "isis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wordpress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul eye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "old city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raqqa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tigris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baiji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west mosul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul eye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baghdad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:28.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cde08aab39e1e1e38ccc65325449a41c568fa798", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8EaRevSyaieSKl7Aten64MqGKFt08gHBFuEPf7No9o3A--", "site_full": "www.wisebread.com", "site": "wisebread.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.killeraces.com/wisebread", "site_categories": ["credit_debt_and_loans", "finance"], "section_title": "Wise Bread", "title": "Best Deals for Thursday 12/07", "title_full": "Best Deals for Thursday 12/07", "published": "2017-12-07T06:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19922, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cde08aab39e1e1e38ccc65325449a41c568fa798", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8EaRevSyaieSKl7Aten64MqGKFt08gHBFuEPf7No9o3A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Amy Lin", "published": "2017-12-07T06:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "Best Deals for Thursday 12/07", "text": "Home \u00bb \u00bb Best Deals for Thursday 12/07 Best Deals for Thursday 12/07 \nSAVE as much as 80% OFF Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated 6-Piece Tumbler Set, 30 oz, and more... \nCamping Cookware 10 Piece Cookset, 1 Liter Pot, 75% OFF, and more... \nBamboo Shower Seat Bench with Storage Shelf, SAVE 67% OFF, and more...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bamboo shower seat bench", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:28.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5615693575dcc83253c56a555037a0f05f397e34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LJXICgYNfZBmzdZ1kuumsjT7X_p.MMMcViIJR2doGUWkBWxue_QjTzml4tGlOcTwvEAqAbSgOkHhp.q5BFFX31YEJxlsWiLZiTlyPNchike_gkR1vQldxaEdJZK567JE-", "site_full": "www.webotopia.org", "site": "webotopia.org", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/WebotopiaDirectory", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "media", "tech"], "section_title": "Webotopia", "title": "Insignia Depot", "title_full": "Insignia Depot", "published": "2017-12-07T13:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5615693575dcc83253c56a555037a0f05f397e34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LJXICgYNfZBmzdZ1kuumsjT7X_p.MMMcViIJR2doGUWkBWxue_QjTzml4tGlOcTwvEAqAbSgOkHhp.q5BFFX31YEJxlsWiLZiTlyPNchike_gkR1vQldxaEdJZK567JE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T13:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "Insignia Depot", "text": "  Shopping \u0165 Arts, Antiques & Collectibles \u0165 Insignia Depot Insignia Depot \nSpecializes in military insignia products including ribbons, patches, medals, wings, and badges.

WNCC moved to 11-2 on the season while Casper dropped to 10-2. The Cougars led for most of the night with just four lead changes. What was key for the Cougars was their effort from start to finish. \u201cThis was a really big win for us and it was a good win to put under our belt before we are off for a few weeks,\u201d sophomore Jaleesa Avery said. \u201cWe beat them twice last year and we knew they were coming for us tonight .\u201d It was a battle, too. WNCC held the largest lead of the contest of 11 points in the second half, 65-54. Casper, came into Tuesday\u2019s contest with a number 18 ranking in the first NJCAA polls that were released Tuesday , started to come back, cutting the lead to four points on several occasions. \u201cOverall, the team played well,\u201d sophomore Anastacia Johnson said. \u201cWe have a lot of areas that we need to fix, but they are easy fixes.\u201d WNCC kept focused throughout and that is what helped the Cougars to their 11 th win of the season, according to Johnson. \u201cThe keys to the game were energy, enthusiasm, and effort,\u201d Johnson, who finished with a team-high seven assists, said. \u201cWe also had to be the tougher team.\u201d A big key was rebounding, too. WNCC limited Casper to just one shot most of the game. The Cougars out-rebounded the Thunderbirds 41-36. Merle Wiehl led the team on the glass with 11 boards. Wiehl finished the game with a double-double, finishing with 18 points. Seay also had 18 points in the contest to go with 9-of-11 free throw shooting. Also getting double digits in scoring was Melisa Kadic, who tallied 16 points. Another big reason for the win was shooting. WNCC shot 45 percent for the game. WNCC also nailed seven treys compared to six for Casper. Kadic and Wiehl each had two 3-pointers. Free throw shooting was another big difference. Casper was just 6 of 9 from the charity stripe, while WNCC was 16 of 27. The first three quarters was back and forth. WNCC led 16-15 after one quarter and led 33-30 at halftime. The third quarter saw Casper hold one-point leads three times, the last time at 51-50. Kadic came down and nailed a trey to put WNCC up 53-51 before both squads settled for a 53-53 tie after 30 minutes of play. The first part of the fourth quarter is where things changed quickly. WNCC started the quarter on a 12-1 run to lead 65-54 behind a hard-nosed defense that generated steals and four points from Johnson. WNCC and Casper kept exchanging buckets after that before Seay hit 5-of-6 free throws at the end of the game to seal the win. WNCC will close out the first semester on Saturday when they host Eastern Wyoming College at 5:30 p.m. in a men\u2019s and women\u2019s doubleheader. The EWC contest will be the Cougars second Region IX South sub-region contest. The Cougars will then have the holiday break off before returning to the court January 4 when they host Northwest Kansas Tech junior varsity.

Until this morning! The inception Just yesterday, myself & a couple of my colleagues were discussing politics and the general welfare of public, which is one of the most common topic for small talks.. We ventured into government policies, who is to be blamed and all those areas where everyone has an opinion to offer..And it soon turned out as an heated debate which predictably was concluded with \u201cPolitics is a gutter & we are all doomed to this sad state of being\u201d.. It was business as usual.. Until this morning!\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we have\u2026..?!\u201d It got me thinking if the problem was really unsolvable.. Something in me couldn\u2019t stand the thought that we were all playing blame games and really can\u2019t do anything about it.. And I don\u2019t believe in super hero stuff as well.. I believe in change though.. And when am a believer, I am firm.. So I guess my subconscious has been at it for quite sometime and suddenly I just thought \u201cWhy can\u2019t we have an Institute for Training Politicians?!\u201d\nAnd here is a preliminary formulation of the plan that dawned on me.. Straight from my notes..\nThis plan probably reflects the problems (as I see it) is faced by my society at this point of time..

The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 175.8 points in November, down 0.5 percent from October. Food prices on international markets were 2.3 percent higher than last November. Agricultural commodities have emerged from a highly volatile period and FAO has said it expects them to remain stable over the next decade. FAO raised its forecast for global cereals output in 2017 to 2.627 billion tonnes, 16.8 million tonnes higher than last year's level and pushing worldwide supplies to an all-time high. The agency also raised its forecast for global wheat production to 754.8 million tonnes, 1 percent lower than 2016.

In Landfall , instruments initiate language through our new text software, erst. The blend of electronic and acoustic strings is the dominant sound of Landfall .

In fact, he could fulfill what he wanted to do in life, like getting multiple assignments to earn enough money at peak-time and putting it all back into movies and theatre, because of his temperament and approach to his career. Quite naturally, the son, the human being and the actor in him were majorly shaped by one man\u2014his father Prithviraj Kapoor, right from his childhood. \nShashi\u2019s first-ever conscious memory of his father was when he was about five. \u201cThat was when I got to watch my father\u2019s film Sikander and his own play, Prithvi Theatres\u2019 Shakuntala , in which he played Dushyant,\u201d recalled Shashi. \u201cI remember being completely fascinated and amazed. Even at that age, I could not but marvel at the difference between the humble giant who was my father at home and the powerful persona that I was watching on screen and on stage.\u201d \nShashi went home, completely fascinated by his art as well as the storytelling, and this was the beginning of his inclination and inspiration to become an actor. From this, the gentleman Kapoor ultimately learnt never to take work home and became the first star to reserve Sundays for family and not work on that day. Soon, with his father\u2019s consent, Shashi began doing small roles in his plays. He was six. \nSaid Shashi, \u201cPrithviraj had a gentle and unique technique of teaching. It was a tradition at Prithvi Theatres that 4 to 5 hours of talking sessions were held daily with my father. We would all listen as he spoke \u2013about everything, including Life and acting.\u201d This is where Shashi realized that to be a good actor and professional, one had to be a good human being. \nSome 150 people worked at Prithvi Theatres, and they came from all conceivable religions \u2013 Hindu, Muslim, Parsis, Jews, Sikhs and Christians. From here, Shashi learnt to treat everyone with complete respect, and at par with himself. \u201cWhen Prithvi Theatres started out in 1944, my father was already a colossal star in the movies, yet never did he look at anyone as lesser than him,\u201d said Shashi. \u201cI was intelligent enough to make out that this humility and respect for everyone was not for effect. He was like a monarch who never gave the impression that he was lowering his status in treating you at par \u2013 his principle was to raise you to his level and look at you as someone equal to Prithviraj Kapoor!\u201d \nAs Shabana Azmi said later of Shashi as producer, \u201cDuring the outdoors of Junoon , from actors to unit hands, everyone was given accommodation in the same hotel.\u201d Another lesson learnt. \nDue to his innate sense of equality of all religions and classes, it never mattered to Prithviraj that Shashi\u2019s love was a foreigner. And there was so much camaraderie between Jennifer and him that when Shashi broached the idea of reviving Prithvi Theatres after his father\u2019s death, his wife gave her all to fulfill the dream and also looked after it till she was alive, with Shashi being overtly busy (except on Sundays!) to earn the much-needed money for it! \n\u201cIt was also amazing that one of the topmost film stars of that time could be such a mammoth success on stage simultaneously!\u201d said Shashi, who similarly balanced his plays and his stints as a child actor in films and later his leading roles in Hindi and English movies and his passion for producing meaningful cinema and promoting theatre. \u201cHere I would like to mention what I learnt from my father as an actor: to never differentiate between the two mediums except in the technical sense,\u201d said Shashi. \nWorldwide, drama was over-the-top then and based on the Corinthian style that Parsi and Marathi theatre also followed in India. Prithviraj was the first to start and promote a natural style of acting. \u201cHe advocated this modern style in the firm belief that a good actor can convey everything even with his back to the audience!\u201d recalled the star. \u201cFor his times, this was not just progressive but also revolutionary because all actors then would face the audience \u2013 but father would never allow this! And I think this benefited me hugely as an actor.\u201d \n\u201cDespite some deliberate theatrical turns in plays and films, seven other plays staged by Prithvi and most of his other film roles were contemporary, and his natural acting style became very conspicuous in those times.\u201d Once again, Shashi emulated this principle, losing out on multiple film acting awards (until Deewaar ) because of his easy and natural style! \nLast but not the least, Shashi (like his brothers and sister Urmila) also inherited his taste for great food! \nIn his last phase when he was dying of malignancy in hospital, Prithviraj told the doctors that he would leave the hospital if they insisted on their rule of not allowing visitors. He wanted his friends, his associates and even his fans to meet him, some of whom would come from remote areas of Punjab. This is exactly what an ailing Shashi Kapoor, though he had memory issues, also followed\u2014every evening, he would be brought to the Prithvi Theatre to meet and interact with admirers, colleagues and everyone who wished to meet him. \nShashi graphically remembers his father taking him aside after he quit college to become a full-time actor, and telling him, \u201cEducation does not stop with an end to college. It ends with life itself, for it is a musalsal (continuous) process.\u201d And Shashi learnt the best things from his father as he continued to evolve, like always paying for his ticket for plays he watched at Prithvi!

As the building and tram depot are a bit off the main drag, it can be rather dark there on a mid-December evening. So when something caught my eye as bright and incandescent, I instantly took notice. \nNow, it would be fair to say that my mood fit the season. It\u2019s dark and it\u2019s cold, the stresses at the university are so that they peak around this time of year. It\u2019s probably the same as your work. It\u2019s as though our companies want to squeeze every last drop of hope out of us before we have a chance to relax at Christmas, as if they were vacation days that didn\u2019t roll over. \nLong hours combined with a recent weekend conference and trying to finalize an e-book have made the last couple of weeks so stressful that I strive for irritability. I think my last good mood was when I watched two old ladies fight over a loaf of bread at the market. (Hell hath no fury like an old woman who thinks she\u2019s getting jilted out of bread\u2026) \nSo I have been holding on until Christmas. I suppose I have done so since I was young, even though it used to be in tense anticipation of Santa\u2019s arrival and subsequent spoiling of me with GI Joes and chemical experiments that would dye the library desk blue. Though the excitement of Christmas is obviously not the same as it was when I was a kid, it\u2019s still pretty sweet. There\u2019s a day in the middle of the harsh winter where your responsibilities are put by the wayside and you are required to not do anything but eat, drink, and forget about work. This is a holiday I can get behind. \nEnter the Christmas tram. The Christmas tram is one of the newer trams, long and sleek; the interior is lifeless, cold, the transportational manifestation of bureaucracy. But today the tram\u2019s entire length is topped with a wave of Christmas lights. They\u2019re the white kind, I guess so as not to cause other drivers to go into epileptic fits. I wait at the stop with the others, who are all as gray-faced and glum as I am. After the driver dusts off his seat and wiggles into his ass-groove, he sits. The Christmas tram pulls up and we get on. \nWhat makes the Christmas tram so noticeable is that it\u2019s in Prague. If it were soaring down a Brooklyn street or up Forbes Avenue in Pittsburgh, the Christmas tram wouldn\u2019t be so surprising. My Czech students are often calling out Americans for their over-enthusiasm as regards the Christmas holidays. And sure, they\u2019re absolutely right. We bring Christmas celebration to a level of intensity just below the level of intensity Japan brings to manga. However, perhaps the Christmas tram is a step out of the closet for the Czech holiday spirit. \nInside the Christmas tram there are more lights. The back window is filled with an angel blowing a horn to proclaim joyous events. This guy pulled out all the yuletide stops. I sit in a seat near the doors and listen to music, too tired to read. During the twenty-minute trip, I do a bit of surreptitious people watching. When a man nearby smiles for no reason, I know the Christmas tram is doing its job. Three men get on and though one of them has been beaten in a fight very recently (as in, moments ago) the Christmas tram lightens their mood and cools their residual aggression. Yep, there are smiles, polite gestures, friendly banter. Two old women who don\u2019t know each other argue over the other one taking the seat and they\u2019re both laughing.

But that's not the whole story. A new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. Experts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. Call it Medicaid's health care challenge. A federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" In small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. Thirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. The Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. In other findings: - Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. - Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. - Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. Still, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" Having a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. In one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. In theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" Salo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. Some states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. The Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C.

The opportunity for this specific implementation is large. In terms of volume, SWIFT does about 25\u201330M payment messages per day, of which 11\u201313M are related to securities processing\u2014this equates to a total of about 3bn per year. We assume (conservatively) that around 10% (300M) of these securities messages are related to bond processing.\nIf the LINK token is addressing smart contract data input/payment output functionality for over 300M messages per year\u2014it will be involved in processing around 820K transactions a day. This is more than Ethereum (600K transactions per day, valued at $44bn at time of writing) or Ripple (200K network payments per day, valued at $11bn at time of writing). ChainLink is currently valued at $100m.\nThe final piece of the SWIFT partnership that is important to understand is that, if it is implemented, ChainLink will have access to one of the very few gateways to fiat that exists for smart contracts. If the partnership is successful, ChainLink will not only enable SWIFT to process smart contracts, but it is possible SWIFT will enable other external smart-contracts to settle through fiat on its network by means of a ChainLink/SWIFT oracle. This is a massive opportunity for both companies: SWIFT could potentially become the fiat clearinghouse for cryptocurrency-based smart contract transactions by way of ChainLink.'\nHYUUUGE", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:33.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "358cf8188ac7701d07cb82ffd0b8ea310566ddfc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTYPwT6IIxITE0V2KxjkbyLnyvdv1ZqVfr_EGuxmlwgP33qLE5JkBXPDFtNpHHuKHA53bgeOPYMX7.NK0Wow.IL", "site_full": "www.easyreadernews.com", "site": "easyreadernews.com", "site_section": "http://www.easyreadernews.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Easy Reader News", "title": "Old Mothers: Don Preston, Bunk Gardner", "title_full": "Old Mothers: Don Preston, Bunk Gardner", "published": "2017-12-07T10:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://egh0t2b8t2s3nmhmh1owg24pcj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Don-and-Bunk-THIS-ONE-Heather-Thayer-Photography.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "358cf8188ac7701d07cb82ffd0b8ea310566ddfc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTYPwT6IIxITE0V2KxjkbyLnyvdv1ZqVfr_EGuxmlwgP33qLE5JkBXPDFtNpHHuKHA53bgeOPYMX7.NK0Wow.IL", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bondo Wyszpolski", "published": "2017-12-07T10:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "Old Mothers: Don Preston, Bunk Gardner", "text": "Bunk Gardner on sax and Don Preston on keyboards. Courtesy of Heather Thayer Photography Mothers then, grandmothers now The Don & Bunk Show comes to Torrance, and why you must go! by Bondo Wyszpolski Imagine getting all excited about a couple of \u201cgrandmothers\u201d in their mid-80s playing an afternoon gig on Saturday, and in a library of all places (the Katy Geissert Civic Center Library). The Don & Bunk Show starts at 2 p.m. and by 4 p.m. they\u2019ll have packed up and be ready to go home. Not very promising so far? Okay, let\u2019s work this up a bit.Don Preston and Bunk Gardner were an integral part of the original Mothers of Invention, the group that Frank Zappa pushed through three incarnations. While both musicians came onboard after the group\u2019s debut LP, \u201cFreak Out!\u201d (1966), they remained key to the lineup that gave us \u201cWe\u2019re Only in it For the Money\u201d (1968), \u201cCruising with Ruben and the Jets\u201d (1968), \u201cMothermania\u201d (1969), \u201cUncle Meat\u201d (1969), plus Zappa\u2019s debut solo album, \u201cLumpy Gravy\u201d (1967), and a few more recordings as well. Most of the original Mothers now have both feet in the grave: Zappa himself in 1993, Jimmy Carl Black in 2008, and Ray Collins in 2012. Roy Estrada is still living but sitting in jail, probably for life. Elliot Ingber, who was on \u201cFreak Out!\u201d spent only a year or so with the band, but went on to join forces with Captain Beefheart. Anyway, the point of all this is that Don Preston and Bunk Gardner represent a good portion of the living history of one of the most original and bizarre avant-garde rock and roll ensembles of all time. And, sure, they\u2019re slowing down a little, but speaking with both of them over the phone a few days ago you\u2019d hardly know it. And next spring (hot off their Torrance engagement!) they\u2019re headed off to Europe, with dates scheduled in some places where they\u2019ve never performed, such as Turkey and Greece.\nThe early days If you scratch around into who\u2019s played with who, we find that Don Preston has appeared in groups or on records with an astonishing number of musicians of all stripes. A few names, like Gil Evans, Tommy Flanagan, John Lennon, Robby Krieger, Carla Bley, the Residents, Flo & Eddie, and the Jefferson Airplane will have to suffice. He was Meredith Monk\u2019s music director until 1974, and (along with Bunk Gardner) has been with the loosely-knit Grandmothers (comprised of Mothers of Invention alumni, and there were many!) for some 35 years. About two months ago, Preston found himself in the Los Angeles Times as an example of an older person with a limited income given an eviction notice by a landlord wanting to renovate, and then charging more, which would be well beyond the means of Preston and his wife. They\u2019d been there 12 years, and no one needs to be told how stressful it is to pick up and then try to settle in elsewhere. And, because Bunk Gardner informed me that the Prestons were in the process of moving I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d reach anyone. But Preston not only picked up the phone, he seemed relaxed and was generous with his time (as was Gardner, by the way). Preston\u2019s daughter and his wife\u2019s daughter had put a blurb on Facebook, he said, and were contacted by someone with a condo in Diamond Bar: a fan, yes, but also a person willing and able to help out a living treasure in the domain of American music. And so, at press time, Preston said he was very pleased with the new home and couldn\u2019t wait to set up his equipment. A vast improvement over the last place, he said. Is he still composing? I asked. Oh, yes, he replied. Perhaps we will be treated to a recent piece or two this Saturday. The concert draws mainly, but not exclusively, from Preston\u2019s compositions plus those Zappa wrote for the Mothers. Preston\u2019s father was a resident composer for the Detroit Philharmonic. Preston himself started on piano at about age five and his influences growing up included Stravinsky\u2019s music in \u201cFantasia\u201d at one end and Erroll Garner, Stan Kenton, Woody Herman, etc., on the other. While serving overseas in Trieste, Italy, Herbie Mann asked him to audition for the 98th Army Band. There was a musician in his barracks named Buzz Gardner, who later introduced Preston to his brother, John Leon Gardner, better known as Bunk. Skip ahead a few years and we\u2019re now in California. Preston had a combo and, briefly, Zappa was a member of it. Jump ahead again, and it\u2019s Zappa with his own group and he\u2019s asking Preston to audition. But Preston didn\u2019t get the job because he didn\u2019t play rock, although with Zappa it was never rock in any conventional sense. However, after Preston played some gigs with various rock musicians he again auditioned for Zappa\u2019s outfit and this time he was hired. It must have been early 1967, give or take a couple of months, and Preston says he had no expectations. This was also the time when Bunk Gardner joined the group. From all accounts, the audition process was grueling, and it didn\u2019t end there. Rehearsing was a full-time job, eight hours a day, seven days a week, even holidays, Preston says. There was six months of this before recording (and presuming performing) the material on the next album. According to Gardner there were days where it went on much longer. Perhaps we could say that with Frank Zappa music was always a work in progress, in the sense that he was not only at home in uncharted waters (which he then charted), but was constantly in search of sounds that hadn\u2019t ever been heard or recorded. Gardner says that it was always a challenge, and for him a challenge unequaled before or since. \u201cEvery day was a new experience,\u201d and being in the group was truly a commitment. For all that, it seems to have been fun for the first couple of years. Ray Collins, the lead vocalist on much of the material from \u201cFreak Out!\u201d through \u201cUncle Meat,\u201d apparently had a great sense of humor (praised often in Preston\u2019s interviews), despite quitting and rejoining the band on at least two or three occasions. Preston himself says he felt called upon to bring weirdness into the group. Well, the band\u2019s stage antics are legendary, perhaps heightened during their 1967 residency at the Garrick Theatre in New York. Gardner says that Zappa was a workaholic. While he was famously against drugs, he apparently wasn\u2019t against stimulants: Black coffee and cigarettes kept Zappa going, and this must have led to his early demise at the age of 52. This, plus he was \u201calways in litigation,\u201d suing someone or being sued.In the meantime, the musical cohesiveness of the Mothers of Invention, and the heights to which the group aspired and attained, are embedded forever in vinyl and in the formats that have emerged since. It\u2019s sometimes forgotten just how momentous, how explosive on every front, popular music was from 1966 through 1968. We can read about the friendly competition between, let\u2019s say, Brian Wilson with \u201cPet Sounds\u201d and Lennon-McCartney with \u201cSgt. Pepper,\u201d most of their music accessible enough to climb into the Top 40; but at the same time, swimming under the radar for most people but no less potent, there would be records like the Mothers\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019re Only in it for the Money,\u201d which was a parody of \u201cSgt. Pepper.\u201d \u201cWhy? Because it sold a lot of albums,\u201d Preston has said. For the cover, the group wore dresses instead of band uniforms; and one could see, looking over Zappa or Jimmy Carl Black in a dress, why innocent teenage record buyers would keep their fingers away from the cage. The band\u2019s name was spelled out in vegetables, and the cast of background figures was rather darker than those on the Beatles album. But legal issues came to the fore and what should have been the cover photo had to be relegated to the inside. The envelope was pushed every which way, wasn\u2019t it? Maybe there was some professional jealousy involved as well when it came to \u201cSgt. Pepper\u201d and its endless accolades. Zappa wanted big sales, Preston has said, but he also wanted to keep playing atonal music and didn\u2019t seem to understand or accept that the two don\u2019t mix. Besides, they weren\u2019t what anyone might call a \u201cpretty\u201d group. Young girls weren\u2019t about to plaster their bedroom walls with posters of the band, at least a couple of whom were in their late 30s\u2026 old timers in the pop universe. The good times began to crumble as Zappa became even more of a perfectionist (or control freak), getting quite angry when matters weren\u2019t right with his music, because he was the primary composer and de facto leader of the group despite its apparent democratic nature. You\u2019ll need to go to other sources for clarification, but Zappa started distancing himself from the rest of the group, even going so far as to stay in a different hotel when they toured, as if wary that too much fraternizing with them might lead to someone usurping his leadership. Preston concedes that Zappa was a good leader, but a taskmaster can be tolerated for only so long and the final couple of months were very difficult, Preston says. \u201cIt wound up in the toilet.\u201d \nThe end, and its aftermath One day Zappa called in everyone for a meeting and announced that he was dissolving the group. It seems that the initial reaction was one of shock. As Preston has said elsewhere, the breakup was for the wrong reasons: \u201cFinancially it was wrong; it was wrong for us to accept that. We didn\u2019t have to, because we were all equal partners. But we thought we had to, so we did.\u201d Gardner told me he was disappointed in how it ended, but not surprised. The band members, he says, had hoped the group would continue. In Preston\u2019s words, \u201cWe were like family\u2026 That was a real hard blow.\u201d Presumably there was a great deal of anger as well: After the split, Preston says, Bunk wouldn\u2019t talk with Zappa, and vocalist Ray Collins distanced himself from anything having to do with Zappa (and I think that included the Grandmothers). Preston, well, not so much, because he was interested in where Zappa was going musically, and he mentions how even some of the later albums with the original lineup, like \u201cUncle Meat,\u201d were more classical sounding. Zappa was, if anything, always inventive and headed into new territory. Despite the album title, \u201cWe\u2019re Only in it for the Money,\u201d the reason given for disbanding the group was financial. One can deduce from the above that there were other factors, because Zappa would go on to form two more variations of the Mothers, and in the end he seems to have done well for himself and his family, although perhaps at the expense of others.Later on, when Preston was in New York performing with Gil Evans, Zappa\u2019s new group was playing in another part of the building and they reconnected. Preston was asked to sit in. Afterwards, he was approached by former Turtles Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan, now in Zappa\u2019s second Mothers band and enjoying a personal renaissance as Flo and Eddie. They said the group\u2019s current keyboardist wasn\u2019t up to snuff and would Preston consider joining them? He said sure, and then remained with the group until 1974. If we consider all of this cross-pollination, the singers who gave us \u201cHappy Together\u201d reaching out to the fellow who\u2019d worked and played with dancer-vocalist-composer Meredith Monk, it\u2019s enough to make us smile and shake our heads. Meanwhile, Bunk Gardner played in various outfits, did two albums with Geronimo Black (Jimmy Carl Black\u2019s band), a couple of solo albums, etc., and of course has helped keep the Mothers of Invention legacy alive with the Grandmothers. He and Preston, who first met in 1960, have remained good friends throughout all the years, and although they clearly enjoy playing they\u2019re also performing for the money. Sadly, it\u2019s not always a lot. Gardner points out that while they may have been famous (or infamous), financially the rewards were minimal. And so you go on tour. But when you tour, and traveling itself isn\u2019t always cheap, one has to play constantly, almost every night, because when there\u2019s a day off it\u2019s essentially lost revenue. And few bands, as we know, can play arenas and stadiums night after night. Gardner also commented at length on the rising cost of living in Los Angeles, which of course was a big factor recently for Preston. To supplement his income Gardner has worked as a chef in a couple of restaurants down in Laguna Beach, but he\u2019s also giving lessons to young and aspiring musicians, although few are liable to have the sort of life-changing career that Gardner had during the later 1960s. Another topic he spoke about at length brings us to the present, and it\u2019s that as one ages the physical limitations become more evident. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any easier,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t play what I used to,\u201d and so \u201cto play at the level that you want to\u201d one has to expend more energy. But Gardner does keep up as best he can, routinely swimming at the YMCA. At the gym, he notes, only a handful of the people working out are musicians: It\u2019s the lifestyle, and musicians aren\u2019t notorious for watching their health. Rock and jazz bios are filled with artists who expired well before reaching middle age, and we hardly need to include Zappa as one prime example. Fortunately, we have two surviving and healthy former members of a legendary band who continue to play music and to enjoy doing so. And we are fortunate to still be able to hear and enjoy their music as well. This is living history, vital and inspiring. The Don and Bunk Show , with Don Preston on keyboards and Bunk Gardner on sax and flute, along with drummer Chris Garcia , takes place on Saturday at 2 p.m. in the Katy Geissert Civic Center Library, 3301 Torrance Blvd., Torrance.

Halligan, CEO & Co-Founder of n2Grate Government Technology Solutions Posted By: Andy Reed on: December 07, 2017 Print \nWith a number of new companies on the up and up, a promising one to watch is certainly leading network solutions provider n2Grate , a company dedicated to helping customers achieve their business/mission objectives by maximizing technology investment. With a focus on infrastructure, software, professional and managed services, n2grate works to support a diverse set of clients across both the public and private sector. The company is a SBA-certified HUBZone company. Founded in 2010, n2Grate surpassed $100 million in revenue in 2017, and one of the fastest-growing technology companies in the Washington area for the past three years, n2grate has landed on the INC 500 list (twice), the CRN Solution Provider 500 , and the Deloitte Technology Fast 500 , among other prestigious lists. ExecutiveBiz was able to get Steve on the line to talk about the company\u2019s origins, vision, and future initiatives. Let\u2019s dive in. \u201cDo your homework, have a plan and be willing to adjust to rapidly changing market dynamics.\u201d Steve Halligan \nEM: With more than two decades of experience in the telecommunications, networking and data center business how did your background prepare you for your current responsibilities? Steve Halligan: I\u2019ve had the good fortune to work with, and for, some excellent technology companies, both in terms of creating the solutions, as well as the service components of design, implementation and support. I\u2019ve always looked to understand our customer\u2019s Mission and Business goals first \u2013 then to determine my value in the solution areas I was working with at the time. Throughout my career, I paid attention to different company business models to determine what really added value and provided differentiated service. We\u2019ve striven to keep n2grate relevant by leveraging our employees\u2019 deep business experiences. \nWhat was the catalyst behind launching n2Grate? Many of the original market factors that drove our 2009 business plan stay true today. Federal Data Center Consolidation was the compelling initiative at that time that got us started. Additionally, we saw the need for industry expertise to help customers in their own journey to the cloud. Over our eight-year history, we\u2019ve added value in these networking technology transitions for both Government and commercial markets. \nThere is quite a bit of focus within government agencies to migrate to the cloud. What do you see as the biggest impediments slowing that process down? Legacy applications, budget processes and contract vehicles are the consistent variables that have inhibited further cloud progress. We are investing in solutions offerings in as-a-service models to help our government clients leverage their steady state funding better. So much of the budget is tied to \u201ckeeping the lights on\u201d and not enough to innovation. Creatively changing the IT acquisition can help some of these challenges our government customers face. As a small business, we look to bring smart ideas, agility, and financial engineering solutions to support our customers. \nWhat areas within your current solution set do you see providing the greatest potential for growth, and why? The transition to Software Defined Networking, represents a significant opportunity for n2grate and our clients. Software Defined Networking provides the framework to reduce the operating costs and enable organizations to proactively address threats and vulnerabilities on the network. This shift from reactive network management to proactive management will drive significant opportunity as our clients implement new solutions. We have participated in a number of industry events this past quarter, and see continued trends of investments in Legacy Modernization, Business Intelligence, Predictive Security, and Big Data Analytics. Blockchain-based solutions and AI Capabilities is are catching a lot of buzz. We are fairly pragmatic and see that cloud and network transitions, as well as software defined networking, are areas we\u2019ll see continued growth in for the next few years. \nFrom your experiences in founding and building n2Grate, what advice would you give to someone launching a new company? I have always applauded and admired the entrepreneur that is willing to take risks, and put their time, talents and money on the line to create something. Do your homework, have a plan and be willing to adjust to rapidly changing market dynamics. ### \nWith 25 years in the telecommunications, networking and data center business, Steve Halligan has developed a broad range of industry knowledge and relationships in the Federal, Enterprise and Systems Integrator markets.
