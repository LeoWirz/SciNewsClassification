But not Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder. \nThe NBA MVP and the Thunder arrived on Wednesday night South of the Border to face the Brooklyn Nets in the NBA\u2019s 25th game in Mexico more concerned about dinner than the altitude. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know nothing about the altitude, to be honest, I just play,\u201d Westbrook said at the team\u2019s hotel in an upscale part of town. \u201cIf you are in shape then you are in shape and if you are not then you are not.\u201d \nSitting at 7,350 feet above sea level, Mexico\u2019s capital is at a far higher elevation than Denver \u2014 the NBA\u2019s highest venue at 5,280 feet. \nProfessional teams try different approaches to avoid the effects of the altitude on the body and usually, arriving as close to a game as possible is regarded as the way to go. The NFL champions New England Patriots did just that and arrived a few hours prior to a game against the Oakland Raiders on Nov. 19 and got a convincing win. \n\u201cYou have to be ready to go, it\u2019s kind of the equivalent to playing on the second game of a back-to-back in my opinion,\u201d Andre Robertson said. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to adjust but I think it will be fine, we are all in the same category, we are going to be tired and they are going to be tired.\u201d \nThunder coach Billy Donovan said that he\u2019s not planning to alter their substitutions pattern to adjust better to the altitude and that the team will visit the Arena Ciudad de Mexico on Thursday morning to try to get acclimated. \n\u201cWe played a lot of games in Denver, I don\u2019t think this will be much different,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI have a lot of respect for the players, one for the way they take care of themselves physically, mentally and emotionally, and two, for the way they prepare every day because every 48 hours it\u2019s a new team, a new situation and a new environment.\u201d \nFor the Thunder, the game will be their fourth so far in December and the fifth in eight days. They played at Orlando on Nov. 29 and then beat Minnesota, San Antonio and Utah at home. \n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the job and it\u2019s something that we love to do, and you can\u2019t complain,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cI love playing basketball, I love traveling it\u2019s something that we are blessed to do.\u201d \nWestbrook said that this it\u2019s his first trip to Mexico City and that he has been to Los Cabos before so he knows that dinner may involve some tacos. \n\u201cFor sure, I think it\u2019s definitively a possibility,\u201d said Westbrook about trying the Mexican cuisine. \u201cI don\u2019t know where, but definitively.\u201d TAGS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "westbrook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "carlos rodriguez", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "billy donovan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donovan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andre robertson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russell westbrook", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oakland raiders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nba mvp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn nets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england patriots", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mexico city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los cabos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arena ciudad de mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma city thunder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san antonio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:51.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "091a597a2197fda54bfe53dd62d0e9ce98e8ac81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptHF3WDID4DTPAGWrxe.DKsfWkyCiSgG2udsnphmG90jxcTfDZP5shaFFcZFBYHkXxAutrdVbOqPxTehGFDavQikvwe5lFiKE8cInotE6RAKg--", "site_full": "madblastsofchaos.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://madblastsofchaos.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Mad Blasts Of Chaos", "title": "The Varukers - Led To The Slaughter 7\" - 1984", "title_full": "The Varukers - Led To The Slaughter 7\" - 1984", "published": "2017-12-07T11:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "091a597a2197fda54bfe53dd62d0e9ce98e8ac81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptHF3WDID4DTPAGWrxe.DKsfWkyCiSgG2udsnphmG90jxcTfDZP5shaFFcZFBYHkXxAutrdVbOqPxTehGFDavQikvwe5lFiKE8cInotE6RAKg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "STiG NZ (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "The Varukers - Led To The Slaughter 7\" - 1984", "text": "\nOne of the final Riot City releases.

Once you are on the favorite story that you wish to show on your profile screen, tap on Highlight at the bottom to the left of More . Next, select New . Here, you can give a name to your highlight. Think of it as a collection/album where all your related stories will be stored. You can create multiple Highlight collections. After giving a relevant name tap on Add . In case you have already created a relevant highlight collection earlier, select it. \nThat\u2019s all it takes to highlight stories on your profile. Similarly, you can highlight other photos/videos if desired. The highlighted stories will remain on your profile until removed manually. Method 2: Add Stories To Highlight From Archive \nIf you have enabled archive for your stories then this method will work for you. \nThere are 2 ways you can go about adding stories to Highlight from the Archive. \nWay 1 Open the Instagram app and navigate to your profile screen by tapping on the profile icon at the bottom right. On your profile, you will see a new section below the bio . It is nothing but Highlights. Tap on New(+) . This will take you to the archived stories. Select the one you wish to add to your profile as a Highlight and tap on Next at the top right. As it is a new Highlight collection, give it a name and tap on Add at the top right. \nWay 2 On your profile screen, tap on the timer icon at the top right corner to go to the archived stories. Now, switch to stories archive by tapping on the drop-down menu labeled Archive at the top and select Stories . Here, you got two options either tap on the 3 dots at the top right corner and select Create Highlight or select the desired photo/video and tap on Highlight at the bottom while viewing it. If you choose the first option then on the next step select the desired photos/videos to add to a highlight and tap on Next at the top right. After that give a name to the highlight and tap Add . In case you went for the second option then select an existing collection or create a new one for adding the selected photo/video like in Method 1 . \nWith all of these methods, it is possible to add stories highlights on your profile. To validate you can head over to your profile screen and below the bio, you should see the added highlights. \nAll your followers will be able to see your Highlights in your profile. \nHighlight makes it possible to have your stories on your profile and at the same time gives them a chance to last a lot more than 24 hours.

Mostly because I wanted to get ready to see The Last Jedi . Which actually made me want to watch ALL of the Star Wars movies over again, but let's see . . . 2 hours 16 minutes + 2 hours 22 minutes + 2 hours 20 minutes  + 2 hours 5 minutes + 2 hours 7 minutes + 2 hours 16 minutes + 2 hours 15 minutes = 15 hours 41 minutes . . . I don't see that happening in the next ten days, do you?  \n\nBut 2 hours and 15 minutes . . . maybe.  \n\nBesides, I'd been meaning to re-re-watch it for some time, because (1) my #1son recently  told me that it was his favorite Star Wars movie, and (2) because I wanted to make a list of what I didn't like about it. \n\nIt didn't take long for me to start remembering . . . vividly . . . how much I hated this movie. \n\nThe biggest problem I have with it is the way that Finn, who has been programmed from birth to be an obedient soldier of The Empire, throws off that programming in order to pursue What Is Right. I mean . . . I know that we have to take some short cuts in film-making, but could we just have a reason for this abrupt 180\u00baer? Apparently not. So ten minutes or so into The Force Awakens , I'm already thinking, \"What the fuck?\"  \n\nBut it gets worse pretty quickly. At the 20 minute mark, Finn . . . despite the fact that his superior officer noted some irregularities in his behavior on their most recent mission . . . is able to intercept the transport of Poe Dameron, the most significant prisoner that The Empire has managed to capture in the past 30 years or so . . . and to get him aboard a Tie fighter without encountering ANY resistance. Say what? And come to think of it, how did he even know that this prisoner was being moved? It's not like he was on the email list for that shit, y'know? And since his behavior on the last ravaged planet mission had drawn the attention and ire of his superior officer, you'd think that they might have been keeping an eye on him. But you'd be wrong. \n\nAnd then it gets worse. When Poe Dameron asks \"Finn\" why he is helping him to escape, Finn replies, \"Because it's the right thing to do.\" Now, I realize that that's just a bullshit answer--as does Poe--and that in itself is fine. Finn wants to escape from the ship, and he sees Poe as a way to do that. The problem is this: how did Finn even know how to frame that response? Do they spend a lot of time studying Moral Philosophy in Stormtrooper School? I think not. \n\nAnd then it gets worse. Poe tells Finn, \"I can fly anything.\" Well. How is that possible? He's never been inside of a Tie fighter before. It was manufactured by people from another fuckin' planet. It is not believable that he'd intuitively be able to figure out how to fly the thing. And you'd think that if anything was labeled, it would be in a language foreign to him, wouldn't you? Also, when he asks Finn if he can handle the guns on the Tie fighter, Finn says something about being able to handle the hand guns Stormtroopers use, and Poe replies, \"Same thing.\" Umm . . . no, Scott. Not the same thing. And there is no way that a ground troop Stormtrooper would be trained to use the armaments on a Tie fighter. That's not how the military works, man. I call bullshit. \n\nAnd . . . um . . . how does Rey know how to fly the Millennium Falcon? I thought she was a planet-bound scavenger. Maybe she's read some books? Or watched some You Tube videos? I want those deleted scenes. \n\nThen we are asked to believe that Han Solo and Chewbacca just happen to bump into the Millennium Falcon in the middle of nowhere. In space. You'd think that the universe had shrunk to the size of Dickens's London . . . you know, where there are only about 150 people and maybe a square mile of territory to cover? Yeah. This doesn't even come close to being on the coincidence level. More like the Miraculous on the Level of the Creation of the Universe Level.  \n\nAnd speaking of Han Solo . . . and, for that matter, of Leia Organa  . . . why is it that almost 40 years have passed . . . and the faces of Leia, Han, and Luke do not allow the storytellers to deny that passage of time . . . and yet things that should have been resolved 35 years ago are still hanging? For fuck's sake. And for that matter, are we really supposed to believe that a spaceship that has been sitting in a junkyard for four decades fires up and blasts off within a few seconds of its switches being flipped? I'm calling bullshit again here. \n\nAnd let me get THIS straight. Han decides to help Rey and Finn . . . even though there's very little reason for him to do that . . . and he goes to a bar on a planet where it just so happens that Luke Skywalker's light saber has been hidden. Not hidden very well, I'll grant you--just thrown into a trunk in the cellar. And it's not because the light saber or The Force or anything called to him, it's just a coinky-dinky. Bad storytelling relies on coincidence. Good storytelling gives us a reason to believe that a coincidence is possible. This is bad storytelling at its baddest. Shit just happens because it's the easiest way to move the story forward. No logical consistency or imperative, nothing. Just . . . and then THIS.  \n\nBullshit, bullshit, bullshit. At the one hour mark, I had definitely had enough. I had definitely re-re-confirmed my suspicion that this was The Worst Star Wars Movie EVer, and a bad movie as well. And I had no idea why it was #1son's favorite Star Wars movie. But keeping that in mind, I bucked up and hit the PLAY button for le grand finale. \n\nRey, who has never used a weapon before (how could she have, given her backstory? Plus her comments to Han Solo earlier on indicated that she had NO IDEA how to use this gun) manages to bring down several HIGHLY TRAINED Storm Troopers with said weapon . . . and from a fair distance. Apparently the majority of their Storm Trooper training was in how to fall well after being shot. \n\nAnd speaking of weapons . . . Finn has obviously never held a light saber before, and yet he is able to fend off a Storm Trooper who is expert in the use of the light saber long enough for Han Solo to shoot said Storm Trooper. \n\nAnd . . . am I really supposed to believe that Han and Leia have let three decades (or so) pass with NO communication between them?  \n\nOh, for fuck's sake. People just do not act the way that the people in this movie act. It's not a question of science fiction, it's a question of having a rudimentary understanding of human nature. That understanding is totally lacking here. \n\nAt this point (a little over an hour into the festivities), I fully understood why I have so little regard for this movie. I could boil it down to one axiom: people just do not act this way. \n\nAnd still I continued to watch. \n\nHow is it that Finn, a two-bit soldier, knows the floor plan of the Planet Killer Super Death Star . . . which is the size of a fuckin' planet . . . so well . . . including how to destroy it with a few well-placed shots? You know, I had a Top Secret security clearance in the U.S. Army's Military Intelligence, but they failed to reveal to me how to destroy Washington D.C. with one well-placed grenade. That's just the evolution of the military at work, I suppose. \n\nAhem. \n\nAnd the most ridiculous was yet to come. The whole Han Solo is dead aftermath. I'm not even going to bother with the whole Why Do Finn and Rey Give a Shit About This Guy Thing. (Or, for that matter, about each other.) No. Let's just stick to the stupidity of the plot. \n\nTo begin with, how the hell does Kylo Ren get into the forest AHEAD of Finn and Rey? 'Cause that just doesn't make any visual sense at all. But it gets worse. First Finn, who, so far as we know, has never used a light saber before, does a pretty fair job of defending himself against Kylo Ren, who is an expert . . . possibly THE pre-eminent expert . . . with the weapon. But then it gets worse. Because at least Finn was a trained soldier. Then Rey, the scavenger, who has most certainly never even seen a light saber before, does battle with the aforementioned EXPERT SWORDSMAN Kylo Ren, and fights him to a standstill. Now, they could have made this a little bit more believable if they'd played up the fact that he had been wounded by Chewbacca before this whole battle began, but that's not how this story goes. And understandably so, I suppose, in that fighting a seriously wounded enemy doesn't seem particularly brave or noble. But for fuck's sake, man . . . this is so massively bullshitty that I can't even stand to talk about it anymore. It's like a liberal's wet dream, in which your belief in what you want to happen coupled with your will for it to happen surmounts everything else . . . including years of training in the arts of weaponry. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Yep, I hate this movie. I really, really hate this movie.  \n\nNo wonder it made two billion dollars. \n\nStill I took a deep breath and continued to watch the last twenty minutes. \n\nAnd there was the giant chasm that just happened to open up between the fallen Ren and the standing Rey thing. Mmm-hmm. \n\nAnd the fact that the 6' 3\" 176 lbs Ren is physically overpowered by the  5' 7\" 121 lbs Rey. Mmm-hmm. Best not question that, though, or you'll reveal yourself as the misogynist that you are. \n\nEnough. \n\nWatching this thing again did most certainly confirm my disdain for it. What a total piece of shit. What an asinine bit of lazy, illogical, juvenile story-telling. And Star Wars fans have the nerve to complain about Jar Jar Binks? F ck. \n\nI sure as hell hope that The Last Jedi  does a better job of telling a story than The Force Awakens . I'm hopeful, since it looks like Luke Skywalker, played by the most wonderful Mark Hamill, seems to be the featured player. \n\nMeanwhile, I think I need to watch Rogue One  again in order to get the bad taste of The Force Awakens  out of my mouth. \n\nBleh. \n\n\n\n\n\nFull Frontal  Transparency : I wrote this entry (and watched this movie) under the influence of six shots of vodka. I found it to be a most enervating experience, and plan to repeat it as soon as the opportunity presents itself. The vodka, that is. Most definitely NOT the movie. I will never watch this piece of shit again. I probably wouldn't have made it through this time without the booze, come to think of it. \n\nThanks for your support. \n\n\n\nHa ha, it's just the moon. Sure do look Death Star-ish to me, though. Specially in the black and the white.

The report titled \u201c Rigid Food Containers Market : APEJ to Remain Dominant in Global Rigid Food Containers Market: Global Industry Analysis (2012 \u2013 2016) & Opportunity Assessment (2017 \u2013 2022)\u201d offers in-depth analysis and insights on the key factors shaping the global rigid food containers market during the assessment period. \nGet Free Sample Report @ https://www.mrrse.com/sample/3797 \nAccording to the report, rising disposable income, changing lifestyles, and urbanization are fuelling the demand for packaged and convenience foods. Owing to the rising demand for these food products, manufacturers are focusing on using high-quality packaging materials. Rigid food containers present an excellent option to the food and beverage industry in terms of durability and longer shelf lives. These factors are influencing manufacturers to use rigid food containers in their offerings. \nSteady growth in the global food trade is another key factor that has led to sustained demand for rigid food containers globally. Rigid food containers are widely used in transporting food materials over long distances. They offer added advantages as the materials used in manufacturing rigid food containers can be reused and recycled. Also, some of the limitations associated with flexible packaging can be mitigated by the use of rigid food containers. \nAccording to the report, paper and paperboard are among the sought-after materials used for the manufacture of rigid food containers. Collectively, these product types account for nearly 80% revenue share of the global market. Owing to the cost-effectiveness and advantages over other materials, paper and paperboard will continue to find favor among manufacturers during the forecast period. \nBrowse Complete Report with TOC @ https://www.mrrse.com/rigid-food-containers-market \nGlobally, the food industry demand more trays and bottles & jars in terms of packaging material. Owing to these, demand for rigid food containers in manufacturing trays, bottles, and jars will continue to account for significant revenue share of the market.

But never purple wind. Until now. The color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high,\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow (Thursday) is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure almost certain to grow. \nBut hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday, reports CBS Los Angeles . \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will (be) no ability to fight fires.\" \nCategory 1 hurricanes have maximum sustained winds ranging between 74 and 95 mph. \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nFlames of a wildfire are seen from the 405 highway in Los Angeles, California, Dec. 6, 2017, in this picture obtained from social media. Twitter/MAJORCA @CoCo_Mayo76/ via Reuters \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Wednesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nThe alert, with a long, loud tone, startled users on social media, who were quick to comment on the message. Some responses were serious, reports CBS Los Angeles . Some were less so. \nEmergency wildfires alert sent to many L.A.-area residents on December 6, 2017 CBS Los Angeles \nThe station is updating viewers with the latest on all the major wildfires . \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire known as the Thomas Fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Wednesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \n\"I was expecting, you know, this year to see snow on that mountain, and now the thing's on fire,\" Jake Sandell said. \nAs the Thomas Fire inched west toward Santa Barbara County, one man pulled over on the side of Highway 1 in La Conchita and rushed to rescue an animal, \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Jeff Glor reports. \nOn Thursday morning, officials closed U.S. 101 for more than a dozen miles along the coast, cutting off a major route between Ventura and Santa Barbara counties as fire charred heavy brush along lanes. US 101 is closed in both directions between Carpinteria and Ventura. With S/R 150 also closed between Carpinteria and Ojai, there is no viable route between Santa Barbara and Ventura. Avoid the area. #ThomasFire \nThe wilder winds could easily make new fires explode too, as one known as the Skirball Fire did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nFew flames were visible late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nWhere the California wildfires are expected to strike. CBS News \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. UCLA canceled Thursday classes. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

You could say so, now that Lexus has made a seven-seat version of the RX SUV to rival the Volvo XC90 and its likes. The so-called RX L is making its world debut at the ongoing Los Angeles auto show.What Lexus did was lengthened the RX\u2019s rear by 110mm and inserted a steeper tailgate so that third-row passengers can enjoy proper leg and head room. There\u2019s also the option of specifying a two-seat matrix in the second row.There are only two engines to choose from in the RX L: 290hp 3.5-litre V6 petrol motor in the RX L 350 and 308hp 3.5-litre V6 petrol-electric hybrid in the RX L 450h.We hear that the Thai Lexus office is not planning to sell either model of the RX L since both will be penalised by maximum excise tax due to their engines exceeding 3,000cc. \nAre they eying the LX monster SUV then? Not really. The LX was never sold officially in Thailand due to its gas-guzzling engine. The LX570 comes with 383hp 5.7-litre V8.The interesting thing, though, is that Lexus also used the LA motor show to debut a five-seat version of the LX, which was previously only available in seven-seat configuration. The two-row LX is aimed at users needing lots of luggage space.Nevertheless, the LX (and the smaller GX) won\u2019t pop up on the radar screens of Thai Lexus product planners. Both are based on Toyota\u2019s Land Cruiser models using chassis-on-frame underpinnings and are aimed primarily at the North American and Middle Eastern markets. \nThat\u2019s acceptable. What\u2019s with that new SUV concept coming soon? Just this week, Lexus has announced that it will premiere the LF-1 Limitless concept vehicle at the 2017 Detroit motor show next month.Although details are still scarce, the sole teaser picture below reveals a raked tailgate possibly pointing to a new car-based SUV (with a monocoque platform, like in the RX and NX). And as Lexus has mentioned \u201cflagship crossover\u201d, there\u2019s a good chance that it might preview a sporty SUV competing with the likes of the BMW X6 and Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe.Last year, Lexus also revealed its intentions of building a new baby SUV sitting below the NX. The UX Concept is most likely to make way for a production version based on the Toyota C-HR to compete with the Audi Q3 and BMW X1.It appears that Lexus is preparing an onslaught of SUVs in the coming years as the trend for such vehicles continue to be on the rise.

George C. Marshall quote as part of Army football tradition Saturday afternoon. \nThe plaque reads, \u201cI want an officer for a secret and dangerous mission. I want a West Point football player.\u201d \nPalelei\u2019s mission sent him to San Diego earlier this year. The Army junior guard sneaked into his older brother Evan\u2019s home and replaced all of the baby clothes with Army clothes for his future niece or nephew. \nIt wasn\u2019t long ago when Ethan was in the stands cheering for Evan in one of college football\u2019s most-storied rivalries. Evan was a two-year starting defensive end for Navy (2012-2013). The Midshipmen\u2019s winning streak over Army reached 12 games by time Evan graduated and was extended to 14 before it was broken by Ethan and the Black Knights last December. \n\u201cHonestly, my brother is the toughest guy in the house,\u201d Ethan Palelei said of Evan. \u201cWatching him play and the way that whole program worked every day was inspiring because it was my brother. Now, it\u2019s time to slay the dragon.\u201d \nPranks have become a big part of the Army-Navy rivalry within the Palelei family. Ethan changed all of the napkins to ones printed with \u201cGo Army\u201d for Evan\u2019s wedding reception. The ribbing branches beyond the brothers. Constance, Ethan and Evan\u2019s sister, is married to Maika Polamalu, a former Navy football player. \n\u201cWe have a great time with it,\u201d said Lonnie Palelei, the boys\u2019 father, who played six seasons in the NFL with the Steelers, Giants, Jets and Eagles. \u201cThe boys, even though they graduated from Navy, they really root for West Point because of my son. On that one Saturday, I\u2019m sure they give it to him. \n\u201cIt's a great rivalry and in my house it illustrates how these boys fight each other for this game this one Saturday but they truly are brothers and they love each other.\u201d \nScott brothers fighting for bragging rights \nThis year\u2019s Army-Navy game will pit brother against brother. The Commander in Chief\u2019s Trophy and bragging rights are on the line between Army junior cornerback Zach Scott and Navy senior receiver Craig Scott. \nCraig Scott Sr. will watch the game from the Navy side in the first half and the Army side in the second half. Zach walked on to the big squad after playing his freshman year for Army\u2019s sprint (lightweight) football team. Craig has caught two passes for 27 yards and a touchdown and is Navy\u2019s primary punt returner. \n\u201cIt's all love between my brother and I,\u201d said Zach Scott, a reserve defensive back. \u201cOnce kickoff starts, we are enemies and we are fighting to see who can win, but at the end of the day that's my brother and I love him. There's definitely a lot of smack talk between us but at end of the day, it's all good.\u201d \nsinterdonato@th-record.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ethan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lonnie palelei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maika polamalu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george c. marshall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "constance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palelei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zach scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethan palelei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig scott sr.", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "army-navy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sal interdonato times herald-record", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steelers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "black knights", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:54.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a98cc13caa39f5e1bc26064157980d71bd2e1576", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg82owXl7dgVshak7.XlZ2xEp.TzNWYE3FyEH3tGzeQwAGuiKiUuQ7.DSAjaSW5SZdFmKe3GTsVIdaQtyK17n9ta8N8qy.KWjFC0HGpfqfoxqVAw37k1dEZf", "site_full": "www.recordonline.com", "site": "recordonline.com", "site_section": "http://www.recordonline.com/sports?template=rss&mime=xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sports - recordonline.com", "title": "Navy's Perry a threat wherever he lines up", "title_full": "Navy's Perry a threat wherever he lines up", "published": "2017-12-07T07:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.recordonline.com/storyimage/TH/20171206/COLLEGEVARSITY/171209634/AR/0/AR-171209634.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 62682, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a98cc13caa39f5e1bc26064157980d71bd2e1576", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg82owXl7dgVshak7.XlZ2xEp.TzNWYE3FyEH3tGzeQwAGuiKiUuQ7.DSAjaSW5SZdFmKe3GTsVIdaQtyK17n9ta8N8qy.KWjFC0HGpfqfoxqVAw37k1dEZf", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sal Interdonato", "published": "2017-12-07T07:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Navy's Perry a threat wherever he lines up", "text": "Navy's Perry a threat wherever he lines up Wednesday Dec 6, 2017 at 6:53 PM Dec 7, 2017 at 12:15 AM Sal Interdonato Times Herald-Record @salinterdonato \nWEST POINT \u2013 Rhyan England and the Army defense\u2019s first assignment Saturday is finding Navy\u2019s No. 10 on the field. \nMalcolm Perry could be Navy\u2019s starting quarterback in the 118th Army-Navy game. The sophomore could play slot back or wide receiver. No matter, the 5-foot-9, 185-pound Perry is a touchdown threat wherever he lines up. Fifteen times this season, Perry has run or caught a pass for 20 or more yards. \n\u201cHe's a great player,\u201d said England, Army\u2019s senior safety, of Perry. \u201cHe plays the game with a lot of intensity and he's really their go-to guy. We definitely have to keep our eyes on him and make sure we know where he's at.\u201d \nOne missed assignment is all it takes for Perry to break open a game. And, one open gap could determine who claims the Commander in Chief\u2019s Trophy. \nFive of Perry\u2019s eight rushing touchdowns are from 23 yards or more. He\u2019s the only player in Navy history to have two touchdown runs of 90-plus yards in a career: 91 against Air Force and 92 against Southern Methodist this season. Perry\u2019s two touchdown receptions have covered 75 and 40 yards. \n\u201cWe knew how this game is going to go,\u201d Perry told the Capital Gazette earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a grind-it-out type of battle. Big plays can definitely decide this game so we do need some of those.\u201d \nPerry is averaging almost 144 all-purpose yards per game, 9 yards per carry, 25 yards per reception and just under 25 yards per kick return. He\u2019s started nine of Navy\u2019s 11 games at slot back. In his first start behind center, Perry rushed for a career-high 282 yards against SMU, the third-best total in Navy history. \nPerry has completed one pass this season \u2013 a 5-yard touchdown to quarterback Zach Abey on a trick play against Temple (Abey was Navy\u2019s starter against Army last season). \nPerry\u2019s speed is alarming, Army coach Jeff Monken said. \n\u201cHe\u2019s fast,\u201d Monken said. \u201cHe\u2019s hard to catch. He\u2019s hard to tackle. \u2026 They\u2019ve done a really good job of using his talents and abilities.\u201d \nContaining Perry is one of the keys to victory for Army. \n\u201cAs long as we are doing our assignments and we are executing like we\u2019re supposed to, I think we will get the job done,\u201d England said. \nsinterdonato@th-record.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "perry", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "jeff monken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rhyan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm perry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zach abey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monken", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "navy", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sal interdonato times herald-record", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army defense", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "118th army-navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "air force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capital gazette", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:54.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb16cc213d616112eb0ea128b5cb98b3bb8e3dff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUxBil9k0Grk6.QyzCmd.jQNi_66qf0uyWma8vERmM7waxfyjEpn_uYKbE._M1iakf.EnEavd7Ms2sd7RCJt0mOepLoAuN2OTxD71YuG2mFjA--", "site_full": "newstrendingblog.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Want to study abroad?

Staff Photo by Matt West prev next comments FOXBORO \u2014 Dolphins defensive end Cameron Wake has delivered several of his finest pass rushing performances against the Patriots.\nThe 6-foot-3, 265-pound undrafted ninth-year pro out of Penn State has played in 16 games against the Patriots with 10.5 sacks, two forced fumbles, 29 solo tackles and eight assists.\nWake, 35, has eight sacks this season that include the pop and drop he laid on Tom Brady in the Pats\u2019 35-17 victory at Gillette Stadium on Nov. 26. Wake dispensed four additional hits on Brady in that game, primarily at the expense of Patriots\u2019 reserve right tackle LaAdrian Waddle.\nHe will resume his assault from either side of the Miami front line when the Dolphins host the Patriots on Monday night at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good player and he has been doing it a long time,\u201d said Waddle. \u201cHe is strong and he is fast and he can do a little bit of everything and that keeps you on your toes. You have to expect a couple of different things from him but he is a good player that gives it his all every play. You just got to be ready for him.\u201d\nWake has 89.5 career sacks, the most among active players dating back to 2009 but well behind the Dolphins record of 131 held by hybrid defensive end Jason Taylor. Wake has the second most sacks by an undrafted player behind former Vikings star John Randle (137.5).\n\u201cWake is an excellent player and he\u2019s been that way for a lot of years,\u201d said Pats left tackle Nate Solder. \u201cHe has great speed and great strength and one of his unique characteristics is his great flexibility. He is able to bend and get leverage on people. I have not had a lot of reps against him over the years but he does have a unique skill set because he is strong and he is also fast. He is very dynamic in the way he can adjust to the way the blockers that are trying to block him.\u201d\nWake and defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh line up on the left side and comprise one of the most dangerous inside-outside pass rushing tandems in the league. Suh has 3.5 sacks and 50.5 in his career, the second most by an interior defensive lineman since 2010.\n\u201cThe hardest part is actually getting him (Suh) blocked,\u201d said Patriots coach Bill Belichick. \u201cHe\u2019s explosive, very strong and has a good get off and pursues well.\u201d\nJordan Phillips is projected to start at right tackle while Andre Branch will line up opposite Solder. The two have combined for 33 tackles, five sacks and seven tackles for a loss.\n\u201cThey have a lot of good players and they are physical up field players,\u201d said Solder. \u201cThey are going to come at you and they do a lot of different things, and they are well coached.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://embed.sendtonews.com/player3/embedcode.js?fk=KG5SCeOG&cid=4407&offsetx=0&offsety=0&floatwidth=400&floatposition=bottom-right"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rich thompson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cameron wake", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "decembe", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tom brady", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "matt west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher evans tom brady", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill belichick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex burkhead", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob gronkowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandin cooks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick caserio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nate solder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dwayne allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ndamukong suh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dion lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brady", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john randle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris hogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pats", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laadrian waddle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waddle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcom brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt west credit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh mcdaniels", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dolphins", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vikings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penn state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillette stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andre branch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pats", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan phillips", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england patriots", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gillette stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foxboro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foxboro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hard rock stadium", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:55.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9194cd79a8b00249b8335741118389d9fce00bdb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdhombnbQ8AyiEfVU7pdda57P6W0YlZoGS.6XoIzuhqDNHj.7iT9mw1d9dmZyOFVejFnXr7ADRYdY_MyK.aVM45AK1i8KsF8js-", "site_full": "clubadmiralty.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://clubadmiralty.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Club Admiralty", "title": "Sev TNG: Dr. Polaski joins the crew", "title_full": "Sev TNG: Dr. Polaski joins the crew", "published": "2017-12-07T08:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5fqlxyEL9vI/Wc_Dlz_fz3I/AAAAAAAADao/D4Jhi2zjLZYb7l9FBPKAjGF5gyZgdCzjgCLcBGAs/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/s116.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9194cd79a8b00249b8335741118389d9fce00bdb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdhombnbQ8AyiEfVU7pdda57P6W0YlZoGS.6XoIzuhqDNHj.7iT9mw1d9dmZyOFVejFnXr7ADRYdY_MyK.aVM45AK1i8KsF8js-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "\u039f \u03a6\u03bf\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T08:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Sev TNG: Dr. Polaski joins the crew", "text": "A blog about life in general, in as many languages as I can manage. \u0395\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae\u03c2, \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03b3\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf - \u03c3\u03b5 \u03cc\u03c3\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b3\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c7\u03c9 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03c9.

Steinbrenner originally had said he and his siblings would meet with candidates who reached a second round. \n\"When I get that kind of recommendation from my top people, I just didn't see the need,\" he said. \nBoone had worked for ESPN since retiring as a player. He acknowledged one of his first tasks will be to convince his players he can do the job. \n\"I think in short order I'll be able to earn that respect, that they'll be able to look at me, trust in me, know that I have their interest at heart, but know that hopefully I know what the heck I'm talking about,\" he said. \"That's something that you have to earn over the initial days in spring training, in the season.\" \nBoone was assigned uniform 17, his number with Cincinnati and Cleveland; pitcher Masahiro Tanaka has the No. 19 jersey Boone wore with the Yankees in 2003. \nBoone can appreciate tough managerial decisions. He was benched by Joe Torre against starter Pedro Martinez in Game 7 of the 2003 ALCS in favor of Enrique Wilson, then entered as a pinch runner. \n\"I'm going to really care about these guys. Hopefully I'm going to love these guys and they're going to love me back, but when you have to make difficult decisions you have to be honest in your evaluations,\" he said. \"So sometimes I feel like there's the potential to be clouded because you like a guy or you want a guy to do so well and you're kind of hoping.\" About Us", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "boone", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "yanks boone", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mike fishman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe torre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim naehring", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason zillo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan giese", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hal steinbrenner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cashman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enrique wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steinbrenner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean afterman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim wakefield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedro martinez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian cashman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chad bohling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron boone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "masahiro tanaka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david grabiner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve donohue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin reese", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donohue", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yanks", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "espn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yankees", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ariz.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yankee stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cincinnati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scottsdale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:55.041+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "271a6915b6484c7eb11898dff98630f8881eda3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg82owXl7dgVshak7.XlZ2xEuLXjxl4LQRpPnBbWHZXUaNoKIHdwWbrqBTTyDVI.KaoaSZ_v7PDTfXRE8FjPNLm1w4rgvrQLvGk-", "site_full": "www.recordonline.com", "site": "recordonline.com", "site_section": "http://www.recordonline.com/sports?template=rss&mime=xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sports - recordonline.com", "title": "Porzingis returns in Knicks' win", "title_full": "Porzingis returns in Knicks' win", "published": "2017-12-07T07:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.recordonline.com/storyimage/TH/20171206/SPORTS/171209618/AR/0/AR-171209618.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 62682, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "271a6915b6484c7eb11898dff98630f8881eda3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg82owXl7dgVshak7.XlZ2xEuLXjxl4LQRpPnBbWHZXUaNoKIHdwWbrqBTTyDVI.KaoaSZ_v7PDTfXRE8FjPNLm1w4rgvrQLvGk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Associated Press", "published": "2017-12-07T07:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "Porzingis returns in Knicks' win", "text": "Porzingis returns in Knicks' win Wednesday Dec 6, 2017 at 2:00 AM Dec 7, 2017 at 12:09 AM The Associated Press \nNEW YORK \u2014 Tim Hardaway Jr. is still out and Kristaps Porzingis couldn't find a rhythm coming back, so the Knicks needed to find offense somewhere. \nCourtney Lee provided it. \nLee scored 24 points, Porzingis had 18 after a slow start in his return to the lineup, and the Knicks beat the Memphis Grizzlies 99-88 on Wednesday night. \nLee doesn't force his offense and coach Jeff Hornacek has told him not to pass up open shots. He certainly can't now, as Hornacek said Lee has to pick up a bulk of the missing shots with Hardaway's 17.8 points per game missing. \n\"Tim was shooting like 18, 20 shots a game, so I need to warm this arm up man, get ready, if he wants me to shoot that many times,\" Lee said. \"On top of my shots that's like 30 shots, if he wants me to do that.\" \nMoving from forward back to shooting guard in Hardaway's absence, Lee took 17 shots, about seven more than his season average. He fell just shy of his season high for points and was the catalyst in a big run to open the second half that largely determined the game. \nPorzingis scored 12 after halftime as the Knicks rebounded from consecutive losses without their top two scorers that had dropped them under .500. \nPorzingis came back from his sprained right ankle and illness, but the Knicks announced Tuesday that Hardaway had a stress injury in his lower left leg and had begun a treatment and rehabilitation plan. He will be re-evaluated in two weeks. \nMarc Gasol had 17 points and eight rebounds for the Grizzlies, who were playing for the first time since ending their 11-game skid with a victory over Minnesota on Monday. Tyreke Evans added 15 points but was just 4-for-13 from the floor. \nPorzingis was just 3-for-11 for six points in the first half, but the Knicks rallied to tie it at 49 going into the break on Lee's 3-pointer. \nPorzingis then hit a deep 3 to open the third quarter and the Knicks took off from there. Lee had a pair of baskets and then consecutive 3s late in what became a 19-2 run that made it 68-51. \n\"We knew that second half was going to be different and you could already see that end of the first half we were turning up our defense and it was giving us results right away,\" Porzingis said. \"And that's what we did in the second half.

High Street favourites? Hit Oxford Street. Designer treats? Bond Street. Edgy fashion? Shoreditch. And of course, there is that shop that has a bit of everything and more besides\u2026Harrods. And, after you\u2019ve done the Capital, do the Capital! \nWe had a family night recently at the Capital Hotel, within a stiletto totter of Britain\u2019s favourite store. What a treat it was. The Capital is one of those discreetly luxurious places \u2013 elegant, quintessentially English and old fashioned (but in a good way!). Exterior of The Capital Hotel \nIt doesn\u2019t look much when you first enter. There is no grand and ostentatious lobby or ballroom sized restaurant. Instead there\u2019s a rather neat hallway from which you can enter the bar and Nathan Outlaw\u2019s latest outpost \u2013 the two Michelin starred Outlaw\u2019s at the Capital . We had come straight from a wedding, so were feeling so full of food and wine\u2026OK, maybe just me with the wine\u2026that we sadly couldn\u2019t indulge. We were also pooped as we had flown straight from Africa (read out about our amazing trip to Tanzania here ) to Gatwick Airport earlier that morning, had a quick change of clothes then jumped on the train to London for said wedding. Phew! \nSo, up we trooped to our spotlessly clean and scrumptiously comfortable junior suite. After hot (marble!) baths we settled into watching Bridget Jones\u2019 Baby on the film channel and\u2026.all got the munchies. We ordered up snacks on room service (available 24/7) and eventually drifted off into the deepest of sleeps in the dreamiest of beds. The double glazing here must be particularly efficient because, despite the bustle of Knightsbridge outside, not a peep could be heard from the street. It is one serene little oasis. Junior Suite with sofabed at The Capital \nNext morning, breakfast was indulgent. The continental breakfast buffet on offer is many hotels is often so dull. Here it was all rather tempting and beautifully presented in the hotel\u2019s bar area. Of course, despite filling up on croissants and fresh fruit we still managed a cooked breakfast, too. The kids wolfed down eggy bread with cinnamon sugar and maple bacon, Mister Gallivant did the Full English, me the Eggs Benedict. Breakfast at The Capital \nI was sad to leave. The Capital is family run with such friendly, attentive staff \u2013 a world away from so many faceless five star hotels I\u2019ve stayed in. It\u2019s one of those places where if you ask, you will very probably receive. \nWhich brings me to Harrods \u2013 of which you could perhaps say the same. Gone are the days when you could buy a pet elephant or monkey, it\u2019s true, but hey, who has time to look after them anyway? There is plenty more to tempt you to part with your cash. Carry your bags Ma\u2019am? \nMiss Gallivant and I swooned over jewellery , clothes, shoes (in the appropriately named Shoe Heaven). Living in the wilds of Kent I don\u2019t get many great shopping opportunities and when I do I am like a woman possessed. We would have carried on and checked out some of the other great Knightsbridge shops, including Harvey Nics, darlings. Unfortunately we had Mr (grumpy) Gallivant and Master (even more grumpy) Gallivant with us and the rolling eyes and mutterings very soon became too much. I managed to eek out the visit a little longer with a visit to the impressive Harrod food halls, which they did, despite their best protests, enjoy. \nWe came out with just a tin of biscuits \u2013 in a very smart Harrods carrier bag \u2013 but with a wish list as long as my arm. I\u2019ll just have to sneak back there without the guys. In fact they are now doing a rather appealing Christmas Shopping Treat which includes a \u00a350 Harrods voucher for every double room booked as well as a concierge to carry your bags back to the hotel! There\u2019s sherry and mince pies on arrival, afternoon tea, a Cosmopolitan (or any other cocktail of your choice in the hotel bar and Full English Breakfast. Girlie getaway anyone?? \nIf you want a pre-Christmas family treat there are also good value packages available and the hotel is just a hop and a skip away from Hyde Park\u2019s Winter Wonderland and the outdoor ice skating rink at The Natural History Museum. A wintery cocktail from The Capital Bar Capital Christmas Tea \nThe lowdown \nThe Christmas Shopping Treat package at The Capital hotel costs from \u00a3230 per person per night, including all of the above. Their Family Offer \u2013 two Classic King Rooms or a double and interconnecting twin if preferred \u2013 costs from \u00a3509 a night including continental breakfast.

Tricked out with Tech: Bathroom features that take smart living to a whole new level 0 comments Bathroom features that take smart living to a whole new level \n( Family Features ) No luxurious home upgrade is complete without the enhancements of modern technology. High-tech and intelligent devices lend ease to everyday activities and enrich your ability to enjoy the comforts of home. With new products joining this category at an exponential pace, there\u2019s a way to boost the smart function of every room, even the bathroom. \nClimate controls \nEnvironmental elements like lighting and temperature are among the first signals your brain processes when you enter a new space. Aligning those nuances with your comfort and preferences is the ultimate expression of personalization. Motion or voice control sensors make it possible to bring lights to life with next to no effort, while a smart thermostat with differentiated climate zones can adjust to meet your needs throughout the day, perhaps kicking up a few degrees to prevent a chill when you emerge from a steamy shower. \nUncommon commodes \nThere truly is no limit to the home features that can work harder, faster and smarter \u2013 even when it comes to the toilet. If the notion of an intelligent toilet seems extreme to your senses, you may not be alone. \n\u201cWhen Americans hear the word bidet, most have an outdated picture in their minds of a standalone fixture, but in fact, the functionality is now built into a toilet or attachable seats, and they are simple to use. Once you try one, you won\u2019t be able to live without it,\u201d said Shane Allis, marketing director of Kohler Sanitary Products. \u201cFrom intelligent toilets to cleansing seats that attach to existing toilets, modern day bidets are for consumers who are looking for an upgrade to their toilet routine.\u201d \nIn fact, according to a recent survey conducted by Kohler, about two-thirds of Americans would choose a toilet that would give them a cleaner, fresher feeling, and 3 in 5 think washing with water would give them a cleaner feel than toilet paper alone. \nAn overall fresher feeling and features like a deodorizer, night light and heated seat have strong appeal, according to the same survey, and those features are all offered in options like the Kohler Veil , an ultimate, one-piece intelligent toilet with integrated cleansing functionality that provides optimum hygiene and individual comfort. From personal cleansing to an LED nightlight to hands-free opening, closing and flushing \u2013 all of which are easy to control on a touchscreen LCD remote control \u2013 the toilet brings unexpected options to your bathroom. Explore the available models and learn more about intelligent toilets at Kohler.com/IntelligentToilets . \nShower with power \nWhether it\u2019s a playlist that energizes you for the day or soothing sounds to center you before an important meeting, you can give new meaning to singing in the rain with a showerhead that includes a built-in wireless, removable speaker that you can sync to your smartphone music library. \nWhen you take your shower digital, you can actually bring water, steam, music and light together into one sensory experience. Beyond that, it\u2019s even possible to configure your shower to cycle through spa programs that target different areas of your body with varied water sprays and temperatures. \nHydrotherapy haven \nA jetted tub is just the beginning when it comes to creating a spa-like atmosphere. Today\u2019s options let you trick out your tub with everything from bubbles and heat to sound and color. Advanced hydrotherapy options use air or sound to massage, soothe, invigorate or relax your body and your mind \u2013 all controlled at the touch of a button. Don\u2019t forget the heated back to keep you warm even longer. \nPerfect privacy \nIf you\u2019re blessed with a stunning view out the bathroom window or if you simply prefer the aura of natural light, you may be reluctant to hide behind heavy window treatments. Yet again, technology offers the solution. Shades you can power with a remote control and even film coverings that convert from transparent to opaque with the touch of a button can give you the freedom to embrace your privacy or celebrate the sun\u2019s rays. \nTech-sessories \nThe big features may deliver the wow factor, but little touches can add up for a big impact as well. Mirrors that recognize your face and voice to deliver customized media, such as news and music, can also be programmed to alter the temperature and lighting while you conduct your toiletry business. Other accessories to round out your high-tech renovation include devices such as smart scales that integrate with other devices to maximize your health and wellness routine. \nWith these tech upgrades and more, you can turn an ordinary bathroom into an entirely new, refreshing experience.
