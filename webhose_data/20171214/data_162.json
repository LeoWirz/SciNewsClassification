This isn\u2019t a done deal quite yet and perhaps markets have doubts. Can things improve from here? \nHere is their view, courtesy of eFXnews: \nBank of America Merrill Lynch FX Strategy Research discusses EUR/USD outlook and argues that markets do not appear to have full tax reform priced in at this point. \n\u201cTax reform would likely result in a combination of near-term stimulus and increased deficits that would imply in higher rates and a higher USD as well. \nHowever, the additional USD positive feature in tax reform would be the likelihood of a program that would have corporations repatriating profits that are overseas in attempts to minimize current tax bills. In our view, a considerable chunk of that cash is likely to be in foreign exchange, as much as 40% by our estimation as well as our own internal survey of corporations. This means that repatriation would imply sizable USD buying as a result. \nConsequently, we target 1Q USD strength, as we feel that the FX impact of repatriation as well as the macro results of tax reform would be priced in quickly,\u201d BofAML argues. \nIn line with this view, BofAML targets EUR/USD at 1.10, and GBP/USD at 1.26 by end of Q1 of 2018. \nFor lots more FX trades from major banks, sign up to eFXplus \nBy signing up to eFXplus via the link above, you are directly supporting Forex Crunch.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bank of america merrill lynch fx strategy research", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:16.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fb27b14895cf9e993f49af5db4469762be07babd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSu2pBmyvyP_UVfznq.FEr9ncTJ8cFdOqP9HJSU9qUUvxVf3cab62.gZSfMNjDkdL3oNqe3_aPiOwnbVmf8Pr.7pM5O6_.2Jl0-", "site_full": "hypixel.net", "site": "hypixel.net", "site_section": "https://hypixel.net/forums/skywars.91/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "SkyWars | Hypixel -

She was also given a copy of the chargesheet against her. By Zee Media Bureau | Updated: Dec 07, 2017, 14:46 PM IST \nDera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Insan\u2019s adopted daughter Honeypreet was on Thursday presented before a Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) court in Panchkula. She was also given a copy of the chargesheet against her. \nThe hearing in the case was, however, deferred to December 11. \nOthers named in the chargesheet were also presented before the court along with Honeypreet, who is currently lodged in Ambala jail. \nHoneypreet has been charged inciting violence in Panchkula after the rape case verdict against Ram Rahim. She has also been charged with sedition. \nThe 1200-page chargesheet was filed in a CBI court by a Special Investigation Team. \nHoneypreet, whose real name is Priyanka Taneja, was arrested on October 3 after remaining fugitive for 38 days after the August 25 violence. \nShe has been lodged in the Central Jail, Ambala, since October 23. The SIT took Honeypreet to various locations in Haryana to establish evidence of her involvement in the violence. \nA court in Panchkula had in September issued arrest warrants against top Dera functionaries -- Honeypreet, Aditya Insan and Pawan Insan. All three were booked by the Haryana Police on charges of sedition, inciting violence and being involved in a conspiracy to help the Dera chief escape after his conviction by a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court on August 25 on two counts of rape of female disciples in 1999. \nRam Rahim has been sentenced to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of over Rs 30 lakh. \nHis rape conviction led to violence in Panchkula and Sirsa in Haryana, leaving 41 people dead and over 260 injured. Isolated incidents of violence were also reported from Delhi and several places in Punjab.The Haryana Police had sounded an international alert against all three. \nHoneypreet`s ex-husband Vishwas Gupta had alleged illicit relations between her and the sect chief.The woman -- who has been claiming to be Ram Rahim`s \"adopted daughter\" -- starred as the lead heroine in five films he directed, produced and acted in over a period of three years. \n(With agency inputs)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dera sacha sauda", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "gurm", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "panchkula", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "rahim insan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pawan insan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aditya insan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honeypreet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "priyanka taneja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gurmeet ram rahim insan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ram rahim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vishwas gupta", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "zee news india honeypreet", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "central bureau of investigation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "punjab.the haryana police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zee media bureau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "haryana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central jail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ambala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sirsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panchkula", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:18.031+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2a75242575a5557010b67bd0de64d3d5f16869cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSEa1pAlyIppGEc3OC4WTJ6eARkNwdDGAIvd1dxrreE_0TK7vidKheBeUb4000Xqjkv1JOmHIyKxgazocB6pM74r1S.Q8FwNLocbayxyePrYwCD4B6m_IveLrHC3hyMaoOp5HTHUL6mOnDPj91DE9VshVp7ZddxTahKe9IdauEybXAi9pi1QnEItfvz8i9RW2lS3VnhgjJvtw--", "site_full": "social.technet.microsoft.com", "site": "microsoft.com", "site_section": "http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?category=windowsserver", "site_categories": ["windows", "computer_certification", "tech"], "section_title": "Technet forums - Windows Server ", "title": "Internal Website IIS Auto Synchronization Issue", "title_full": "Internal Website IIS Auto Synchronization Issue", "published": "2017-11-30T19:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fae5f833c780d17d497cc30ea2818ba01f6d7326", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSEa1pAlyIppGEc3OC4WTJ6eARkNwdDGAIvd1dxrreE_0TK7vidKheBeUb4000Xqjkv1JOmHIyKxgazocB6pM74r1S.Q8FwNLocbayxyePrYwCD4B6m_IveLrHC3hyMaoOp5HTHUL6mOnDPj91DE9VshVp7ZddxTahKe9IdauEybXAi9pi1QnEItfvz8i9RW2nUL6eKyskvq4W9imedfer2hiW1xAq_2YsA4ALB4D80rnL_7tMtA2fK", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Candy%20Luo", "published": "2017-12-07T19:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hi \uff0c\nWas your issue resolved?\nIf you resolved it using our solution, please \"mark it as answer\" to help other community members find the helpful reply quickly.\nIf you resolve it using your own solution, please share your experience and solution here.

Given the political pressures, there is no reason to assume that the decision will be based on the best interests of the refugees themselves.\nThe obligation of states is spelled out clearly in the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention, which stipulates that an individual may not be returned if \"his life or freedom may be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or opinion.\" Guidelines issued by the U.N. High Commission on Refugees dictate that, once granted asylum, refugees may be forcibly returned only when conditions in their home have changed fundamentally and enduringly, in such a way as to ensure a guarantee of protection to formerly persecuted people. \nIn practice, that standard has been routinely violated. In December 1996, for example, Tanzania gave 500,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees one month to go home, though revenge killings of Hutus were still common. In 2015, Kenya announced that it would close the giant Dadaab refugee camp and expel the 463,000 Somali refugees; they were stopped only after an international outcry. In 2016, Iran forcibly returned 410,000 Afghans, while Pakistan sent back another 253,000. \nThose are, of course, poor countries. The overwhelming fraction of refugees wind up in poor neighbors of the poor countries they flee. When the refugees are felt, fairly or not, to constitute an intolerable burden, they are at risk of expulsion, no matter the conditions at home. \nEuropean countries have never engaged in mass forcible expulsion. Then again, they've never had an influx like 2015. And they have begun to practice retail, if not wholesale, repatriation. In the fall of 2016, the European Union extracted from Afghanistan an agreement to accept and resettle - in \"a smooth, dignified and orderly\" manner - migrants who had made it to Europe. About 10,000 returned in 2016. Of those, 6,900 were deemed \"voluntary,\" though this often simply means that migrants have chosen to accept modest resettlement assistance rather than risk forcible return. \nOf course, the violence and chaos that provoked people to flee Afghanistan has only deepened in recent years. The EU has nevertheless invoked the doctrine of the \"internal flight alternative,\" which dictates that while refugees may not be able to return to their actual home, they can be sent back to places in the country considered safe. Those places are considered to include Kabul, currently the most violent place in Afghanistan. News accounts have highlighted the stories of children returned to strange places and refugees killed in bombing attacks and the like. The \"Joint Way Forward,\" as the pact is called, appears to be a giant exercise in hypocrisy. Indeed, German pilots are said to have refused on over 220 occasions this year to fly asylum-seekers back to Afghanistan. \nSyria is going to present a much more tempting target for repatriation than Afghanistan. \nGermany has some 200,000 Afghan asylum-seekers, but about 600,000 Syrians. And while Afghanistan's civil war only grows worse, Bashar al-Assad is likely to regain his grip on most or even all of the country after waging a pitiless war that has led to around 400,000 deaths. The kinds of fundamental changes across the country required by the UNHCR for safe return may not occur for a generation, but European states looking to reduce political pressure caused by anger over refugees and migrants may treat the end of widespread hostilities as a good enough standard. \nMany Syrian refugees have received asylum for one year, to be renewed as needed. Some of Germany's provincial interior ministers would like to shorten the period to six months in order to permit expulsions starting in June. They would start with those accused of crimes in Europe, and then perhaps begin deporting broader groups. Like Afghans, Syrians would be sent to zones deemed safe, or to \"de-escalation zones\" like Idlib province governed by fragile cease-fire agreements. \nWould it be acceptable to compel, say, families who have fled Aleppo to return to a home that is flattened but no longer violent? The answer is surely no, both for legal and for moral reasons. As Bill Frelick, the director of refugee rights at Human Rights Watch points out, while in a hearing for refugee status the burden of proof lies with the asylum-seeker, forcible repatriation shifts the burden to the state in question. Have the conditions that compelled flight changed fundamentally and enduringly? In Syria, the threat comes from the Assad regime itself. Even though barrel bombs have stopped falling on Aleppo, returnees would plainly be at risk of persecution and death from the regime and its militias. And no part of Syria can be deemed safe so long as Assad aspires to regain total control. A recent report by the Migration Policy Institute sensibly calls for an end to forced repatriation to all countries in conflict. \nThe deus ex machina of all refugee situations is voluntary return. Normally one knows that return is safe when refugees go back on their own - at first tentatively and then, once the news spreads, in a flood. But that's true only when refugees are perched across the border. Most Afghans returned home from Pakistan when the Taliban was routed; few of the Vietnamese boat people in the West went back when conditions improved. In the ensuing years, they had stitched their lives into a new and generally rewarding culture. One can imagine a situation some number of years from now - who knows how many - in which Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey start to return, but those in Europe stay put. And they will stay put. The 2015 refugees are there to stay, unless driven out. \nPain is always the best teacher, and there is a painful lesson here for Europe. The original sin in which the migration crisis was born, as I pointed out last year in Foreign Policy, was the failure to take decisive action while the storm was still on the horizon. If the EU had taken collective action in 2014, it could have avoided the chaotic human flood that in turn provoked a political backlash. If the West, more broadly - and here I include the United States - had had the sense to fully fund refugee efforts in the neighboring countries, far fewer people would have sought asylum in Europe. A humanitarian catastrophe in Syria need not have produced a political catastrophe in Europe. \nCan Europe learn this lesson? At the moment, perhaps not. The refugee crisis is only the most dramatic manifestation of the immense phenomenon of illegal, uncontrolled migration to Europe. The millions on the move pose a graver challenge to Europe's future than illiberal democracy in the east or financial profligacy in the south - or even Russia, for that matter.

People on Medicaid are prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But a new survey says that\u2019... \nBy RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVARAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - People on Medicaid are more prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

They\u2019ve had a gazillion matches together but they always somehow manage to bring something new and exciting to the table each time. Ahhh, the beauty of pro wrestling.\n\nWhat made this match even greater was that I had no idea who would win it. A predictable match can still be a good one, but this kept me wondering throughout, which made it even better. My heart told me my man, Rollins, and his partner would win, but my gut said otherwise because it still felt too early. I ended up by guessing correctly\u2014which doesn\u2019t happen too often\u2014so I felt happy but sad at the same time because my babies lost. Get \u2018em next time, boys! The chase isn\u2019t over!\n\nSamoa Joe made things even more interesting and beat up the challengers, who, in case you ever forgot, are 2/3rds of The Shield along with the Intercontinental Champion, Roman Reigns. This set up a 6-Man Tag match for next week in the most predictable way possible, but, I\u2019m glad there was a buildup to it instead of just having it randomly this week. \n\n\nSpeaking of Roman Reigns, Jason Jordan showed us a side he hasn\u2019t before! His frustrations have been building up since a little before Survivor Series and seems to continue to disobey his father\u2019s wishes, which ultimately comes back to bite him each time. It\u2019s almost as if the WWE is showing us that if you\u2019re a whiny, entitled little brat, nothing good ever comes out of it. This is his slow transition into becoming a heel, and we\u2019ve just yet to witness a major Jason Jordan outburst to solidify that. \n\n\nThe Cruiserweights put on an amazing match with well-deserved \u201cThis is awesome!\u201d chants. Dare I say, this match stole the whole show! The Fatal 4-Way match between Drew Gulak, Mustafa Ali, Tony Nese, and Cedric Alexander was so beautifully structured and executed, that I almost forgot who the winner was because all of them looked like winners after that. But yes, Gulak took home the victory which I think is fitting and interesting, considering he\u2019s been playing one of Enzo\u2019s little pets for a while now. Moreover, he\u2019s done a pretty good job at winning over the crowd with his hilarious promos! Gulak will then have to face Rich Swann next week to determine the real #1 Contender for Enzo Amore\u2019s Cruiserweight Title. This mini-tournament was a nice way to build something up out of nothing, all while having these guys showcase their abilities to its fullest potential on RAW . If you decided that this match was the time for your bathroom break, I feel sorry for you. \n\n\nSasha Banks vs. Paige has been the match of my dreams for the past year, and we all got it right here on free TV. It seemed too good to be on an episode of RAW and probably should have been saved for a PPV\u2026 But I guess this was fine, too, so my impatient ass wouldn\u2019t have to wait too long to see Paige in a very good and competitive singles match. This was really exciting albeit a predictable finish, all because it\u2019s been way too long since we\u2019ve seen the Diva of Tomorrow in action and I\u2019m sure we all wanted to see how she\u2019d do.\n\nI\u2019m still waiting for Triple H. It\u2019s like he just kept us majorly hanging and now the others either have to drop their storylines with him or feud with someone else for the meantime. Do they just expect us to remember it all once he feels like coming back?! ...Y-yes. But it shouldn\u2019t be that way. You should keep your storyline going while it\u2019s fresh in the audience\u2019s minds, before they lose interest. Otherwise, they can detach themselves from it! Nevertheless, it was a pretty decent show with really good matches and new feuds brewing up. They still managed to make things compelling enough for me to say that none of the matches nor segments were truly filler. So, I grade this a C !\n\nQuick hitters: So when are we getting the faces\u2019 retaliation on Absolution? When we\u2019re dead?  Finn B\u00e1lor is so lost at the moment\u2014maybe he and his abs should Waze their way into my arms instead.  Nia Jax... Man, I don't know. I'm not sure I want to know.  \nPhotos by WWE ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paige", "sentiment":

(\"Hill Top\") and Big Wind Capital Inc. (\"Big Wind\" or the \"Company\") (CSE: BWC)(CSE: BWC.CN)( CNSX: BWC )(OTC PINK: BGGWF) announce that Hill Top has filed a patent for a biometric security application designed to protect bitcoin and other crypto-currencies from theft and loss. Missing passwords and theft have become the biggest issues plaguing the crypto-currency industry, with more than 35 major reported hacks of bitcoin exchanges alone since 2011, leading to the theft of over 980,000 bitcoins. In total, as much as 23% of Bitcoins mined to date are estimated lost forever( 1 ) (approx. $US30 billion at current market value). Hill Top's biometric crypto-currency application helps solve this issue by adding a new, high-level of personalized security for crypto-currency users worldwide. Hill Top recently signed a letter of intent with Big Wind, pursuant to which Big Wind intends to acquire various interests in HTSI and its assets (the \"Transaction\"). \nThe patent filing covers UxToken: Biometric-enabled, GPS trackable crypto-currency private key safe storage. The new application was developed by Hill Top's in-house team, which is comprised of former US military officers and personnel. Importantly, this new crypto-currency security helps bridge the divide between completely anonymous transactional parties and a reasonable assurance of participant identity, that is aligned with compliance requirements in standard, market-based asset transactions. \nCorby Marshall, CEO of Hill Top Security, said, \"The potential of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is vast, however, it is becoming constrained by cyber crime, as well as missing passwords, which can render coins irretrievable. In fact, as many as 3.79 million Bitcoins are estimated as lost forever - that's nearly 23% of all Bitcoins in circulation, which is close to $30 Billion at current market value. This patent application covers our new biometric crypto-currency security app, which will provide biometric protection of these currencies, in particular, with offline (cold) storage and the recovery of lost passwords.\" \nCompletion of the Transaction is subject to a number of other conditions, including but not limited to acceptance by the Canadian Securities Exchange and entering into a formal definitive agreement. Further details regarding the proposed Transaction will be provided in a news release, when the parties enter into a definitive agreement.

That's where the dynamism of this fund comes handy - it can move from aggressive to conservative in its equity stance, even as it searches for value across other asset classes including bonds, offshore equity and going forward, REITs and InvITs. \n\n\nPerformance Scoreboard \n\nPast performance may or may not be sustained in future.
