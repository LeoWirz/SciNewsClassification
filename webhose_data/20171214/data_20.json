Dubbed \u2018Facts Don\u2019t Lie\u2019, the campaign is designed to educate the public on the role of biofuels in reducing carbon emissions from transportation. \nThe RICanada campaign, which calls for the federal government to increase mandates for renewable content in fuels, will feature print and digital ads (including Maclean\u2019s, The Hill Times and National Newswatch) in Ottawa and key markets across Canada. \nKey facts the campaign hopes to convey: Ethanol can reduce GHGs by 62% compared to gasoline. Biodiesel can reduce GHGs by over 100% compared to diesel. Canada\u2019s biofuels mandates reduce annual GHG emissions to the same extent as taking one million cars off the road. Each year, Canada\u2019s biofuels mandate removes as much C02 from the atmosphere as 21 million trees. Increasing the federal biofuels mandate could add 31,000 jobs and $5.6 billion to Canada\u2019s economy. Canada was once a world leader in implementing renewable fuel requirements. Today, over 40 countries require higher levels of biofuel blends in transportation fuels than Canada.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "meghan sapp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maclean", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "renewable industries canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national newswatch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ottawa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:28.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "09cc8b64dc1a50b42d19e294e4d7f0cc0427366a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT94pUn9vHWFFLxqAfHy4Qfhw6pXZsSm2LTcL6yZmnl4dgv_v8dk2zYG1vog80Mxh5rRSnZAox6qmCeUMLfc6SwcdrmKME0oLnPJBAs3bAr.toLk0F1scI_", "site_full": "www.kohls.com", "site": "kohls.com", "site_section": "http://www.kohls.com/catalog/bath-towels-bathroom-bed-bath.jsp?CN=Product:Bath%20Towels+Category:Bathroom+Department:Bed%20%26%20Bath+Price:%2410%20to%20%2425&BL=y", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Bath Towels - Bathroom, Bed &amp; Bath | Kohl's", "title": "Simply Vera Vera Wang Signature Bath Towel", "title_full": "Simply Vera Vera Wang Signature Bath Towel", "published": "2017-11-30T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.kohlsimg.com/is/image/kohls/2903626_Charcoal?wid=1000&hei=1000&op_sharpen=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "09cc8b64dc1a50b42d19e294e4d7f0cc0427366a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT94pUn9vHWFFLxqAfHy4Qfhw6pXZsSm2LTcL6yZmnl4dgv_v8dk2zYG1vog80Mxh5rRSnZAox6qmCeUMLfc6SwcdrmKME0oLnPJBAs3bAr.toLk0F1scI_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rhae", "published": "2017-11-30T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Simply Vera Vera Wang Signature Bath Towel", "text": "First impression was they are really soft and heavy.

The authors suggest that this means leavers are not primarily motivated by increased pay. \u2018Teachers appear to be more motivated by improved job satisfaction, reduced working hours and more opportunities for flexible working\u2019. This research chimes with my long-held view that there are three key factors in ensuring sufficiency in the teacher workforce: pay; conditions and morale. A government might be able to underplay one element, but to affect all three is to ensure a teacher supply crisis by increasing departure rates to a level where numbers leaving cannot be replaced by new entrants.\nLooking deeper into the NfER research, it is interesting to see the three groups used on page 5 of the report as the main outcomes for departure. 43% of leavers from state schools remain in schools, with the bulk switching to teach in the private sector. Only 1.6% in the NfER study become teaching assistants. This is low compared to the 15% NfER found in another study using a different cohort of interviewees.\nOverall, only 10% of teacher leavers went into other employment, with a further 5% becoming self-employed. This latter group are rather confusingly included in the economically inactive group of outcomes in this study. If anything, this whole group may be a smaller proportion than in the past when there were more active local advisory and inspection teams and more money was being spend on supporting professional development and research creating more job opportunities. However, there will always be a need for some people with a teaching background to move into other careers. As with the switch to teaching in private schools, it would have been helpful to try to assess whether the percentages discovered in this survey were increasing or declining over recent times?\nFinally, the percentage leaving the labour market and becoming economically inactive amounted to 49% of the total, with retirement account for 29% of the total for this group. Perhaps more significant was the 4% that reported being unemployed. Was this due to a partner\u2019s move to an area where there were fewer teaching opportunities or down to having had enough of teaching as a career and taking stock before moving on? More analysis of this group would be illuminating, especially their profile and locations.\nWhat is clear, as the National Audit Office reported earlier this year in their report, is that reducing departures from the profession helps alleviate the need to train more new entrants. The NfER research might have made it clearer that their study used data from a period when secondary school rolls were falling; it is interesting that they don\u2019t have a category for \u2018made redundant\u2019, perhaps these teachers are in the \u2018unemployed\u2019 group.\nWith school rolls now on the increase, the messages from this research takes on a greater urgency and, as others have said, the use of part-time working opportunities for an increasingly female dominate classroom teacher workforce in secondary schools is becoming an area where schools now need to pay particular attention to what they can offer staff as it may help to retain some teachers. But, on the evidence of this study, the gain won\u2019t be large. Even so, it is a necessary move.\n \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "national audit office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:29.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6eb7dfa9c56dbcbdf11fb923ba03d8caf047d267", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJpIKC16qphebO71efzjghbK4e1YMmydAqJc2O..XbieqM911.XJqK8tyuflvDdl2m4gJXHPgjqqgmNCTfIsGybLP52K4p0rTxMEBlpXRnRq6NVywAOneCBg--", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Holiday-Decorations-Christmas-Decorations-Christmas-Lights/N-5yc1vZc3tb/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "300- Clear Icicle Lights-TOL-300/6WB(C)C", "title_full": "Home Accents Holiday 300-Light Clear Icicle Lights-TOL-300/6WB(C)C - The Home Depot", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/e9553ae4-9740-41a5-9f12-42192a34a4db/svn/home-accents-holiday-icicle-lights-tol-300-6wb-c-c-64_300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 249, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b29654e80f6f36c2c156f7982a762bafc65ab415", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJpIKC16qphebO71efzjghbK4e1YMmydAqJc2O..XbieqM911.XJqK8tyuflvDdl2m4gJXHPgjqqgmNCTfIsGybLP52K4p0rTxMEBlpXRnRq7qK7kwrQyPyNimtD1z0Dzl", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Graycee", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "liked them, not as bright as expected tho! kind've...", "text": "liked them, not as bright as expected tho! kind've yellowish tinge", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 4.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:29.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6cae0bdb0381f208ba05bb5ae340102237ac8a0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pfguUTHYhAEFI8xSCI5gZYzgbPdtNpY3C", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/sci/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/sci/ - Science &amp; Math - 4chan", "title": "What is /sci/'s height and IQ?", "title_full": "/sci/ - What is /sci/'s height and IQ? - Science & Math - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T12:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 76, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.091, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae4fe5b7b30135a53cc18d296e4f91607ec0d5a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pfguUTHYhAEFI8xSCI5gZY5cAnnisJ9nJZW4.IKOEaXY-", "ord_in_thread": 72, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>9349065\nDoctors graduate top of classes in undegrad, and have to score stupidly highly on tests that are pretty much designed to do nothing but test your base cognitive ability (and a very basic scientific knowledge).\nOn the other hand, here you have a board full of people who either are clearly not even at uni, or are in their first year or two.\nWhat's more likely?

A large percentage of individuals prefer to use electronic cards when paying for their items. Therefore, a proprietor must find Credit Card Terminal Companies to work with to dispense these services. It would make no sense to have a company offering the best goods and services in town and the customers are not able to pay for them.\n\nThere are a number of issues to consider when choosing a company to work with. The amount charged is the first thing that should be taken into consideration. Different companies charge different fees to process the payment. Therefore, a company should seek to utilize the services of a company that is charging a fair amount. One can compare the prices with different companies before settling on one.\n\nNext, one must seek to understand the time it will take to fix the hardware and open an account. Each company has its own specific time lines for handling different issues. In addition, a business owner must find out if the company teaches its clients on how to handle the terminals. Plus, they ought to offer business support after installation to address any hardware failures that may arise.\n\nAn excellent terminal should have the capability to accept payments from popular credit and debit cards. Plus, the kind of technology used should be elaborate enough to accept gift and prepaid cards. If a customer is turned down because their preferred method of payment is incompatible to the terminal, then this can ruin the reputation of the store and consequently loose customers.\n\nTechnology is dynamic and keeps changing on a daily basis. A company offering terminal services ought to be techno savvy. Their technology ought not to be outdated neither and it should not be slow either. A lot of people are now preferring to use electronic wallets and mobile money to do their transactions and this should be taken into consideration.\n\nA good company should offer their customers excellent support services every day of the week day and night. They should have the capacity to act very fast to address any technological failures. It is important for any company in this industry to establish a contact center. This will ensure that all customers queries are captured and forwarded to the relevant individuals for immediate action.\n\nAfter coming up with a guideline to be followed when hiring a terminal provider, the next step should be to look for a company. There are different ways one can use when looking for a provider. Doing a search on the web is among them. Second, a proprietor may opt to seek referrals from friends, colleagues and family. They can point you to the right direction making it easier to find a good company.\n\nWhen choosing a company to work with, always put your needs and those of the customers first. Plus, when choosing the right kind of gadget that will work better for your business, you should consider the type of business that you are doing as well.

Ambuj Singh, who hails from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh and was living in Raipur Kalan in Chandigarh, was one of the five employees of Rohit Bansal , the owner of Timeless Jewellers Private Limited , and a resident of Sushma Elite Cross Society, Dhakauli. He had been working with Bansal for last seven years. On Monday, the shop's manager gave him the cash for depositing it in a private bank in Sector 20. Ambuj left for the bank on his motorcycle but never returned. Bansal sent his employees to the house of Ambuj but neighbours told them that he had picked up his bag and left on his motorbike. \"Ambuj was one of my old employees. That is the reason I trusted him and asked my manager to give him the money,\" Bansal said. Police said the accused had another rented accommodation in Ludhiana, where he used to go to meet his female friend. After tracing his location there, police managed to arrest him. A sum of Rs 91,000 was recovered from him. Inspector Vikash Kumar of Sector 20 police station said, \"He had spent Rs 9,000 at the time we caught him. The rest of the money and the motorbike has been recovered from the accused.\" Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App .

The tests are now available for the patients all over Europe through the online platform http://www.locus-medicus.com .

C ombined with the extremely high sensitivity of Real-Time PCR, t he Hidden-C\u00ae Test exceeds >95% sensitivity for screening the endometrium for the presence of pathogens revealing hidden infections in both the upper and the lower genital tract \" , says Doctor Vassilis Tsilivakos , Head of Research in Reproductive Medicine at Locus Medicus. \nEARLY PREGNANCY FAILURE AND RECURRENT MISCARRIAGES MAY ORIGINATE FROM THE SPERM \nLocus Medicus laboratories propose a comprehensive investigation of sperm, to identify hidden microorganisms inside the spermatozoa, which can have a crucial influence on the future pregnancy even after a successful conception. The SPI TM test (Sperm Pathogen Immunophenotyping Test) is the most sensitive test commercially available that allows the detection of intracellular pathogens which can lead to early miscarriage. \nThe \"Fertility Kit\" that can be purchased on http://www.locus-medicus.com and samples are collected by patients in the comfort of their home then sent to Locus Medicus in Greece .

CEO Mark Stogdill has been awarded the accolade of Best CEO- Telecommunications Industry, USA in this year's line-up. \nThe ever evolving world of tech and communications is hard for the average business leader to keep up with, but not so for Hammer Fiber's President. Mark Stogdill is firmly at the cutting edge of technology and launched the company himself in just 2014. Prior to taking the helm he'd already enjoyed a successful career in the telecoms industry, so was perfectly placed to set up a brand new and forward thinking organisation that would see him gaining worldwide recognition as an industry pioneer. \nIt's hard to remember a time when we weren't connected by the internet- it's become such an intrinsic part of our daily lives. Since the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) we've seen even more changes that have revolutionised the way businesses (and our personal lives) work, but there's still a significant part of the US where internet connections are far from perfect. Hammer Fiber was born out of Mark's desire to give everyone access to super-fast, reliable broadband no matter how remote their location- and he's achieved great success in just three years. \nThe company has recently joined forces with Go Long Wireless Ltd, a Florida based company that specialises in multichannel video distribution and data services. This meeting of two powerful and innovative organisations will target areas with lacklustre broadband, TV and internet phone services to bring enhanced communication and entertainment to residential and commercial customers. \nMark Stogdill puts his success down to his team of highly engaged employees, and team building and worker satisfaction is high on the company's agenda. \"The internet is a people business and delivering on our promises takes great people, from our esteemed Board of Directors down to our service technicians. Hammer's success is a team effort,\" he told our reporter. \nTo read more about Hammer Fiber visit http://www.hammerfiber.biz/ \nAn article on the company can also be found on BWM website \nhttps://www.bwmonline.com/2017/12/03/hammer-fiber-attack-the-digital-divide/ \nAbout Business Worldwide Magazine Business Worldwide Magazine is the leading source of business and dealmaker intelligence throughout the world.

The trial results were presented today at the International Diabetes Federation Congress 2017 (IDF 2017).[1] \"Millions of people with type 2 diabetes participate in Ramadan every year and we know that periods of prolonged fasting can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia,\" said lead investigator Dr Mohamed Hassanein of the Dubai Hospital, Dubai Health Authority, UAE and chair of the Diabetes and Ramadan International Alliance (DAR). \"This highlights the importance of people with type 2 diabetes preparing for Ramadan with their doctor and discussing treatment options for preventing episodes of hypoglycaemia.\" It is estimated that worldwide over 116 million Muslims with diabetes may choose to fast during Ramadan.[2] Muslims with type 2 diabetes who fast during Ramadan have up to a 7.5-fold increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia.[3] \"This trial has shown that Ryzodeg(R) is not only a simple treatment option which can make daily life easier for people with diabetes. Ryzodeg(R) also reduces the risk of potentially dangerous episodes of hypoglycaemia in people with type 2 diabetes who choose to fast during Ramadan,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. The trial was designed to investigate the effects of Ryzodeg(R) on blood sugar control and hypoglycaemia reduction versus BIAsp 30, both at the end of Ramadan and 4 weeks post-Ramadan. There was no difference in overall blood sugar control between Ryzodeg(R) and BIAsp 30.[1] About the trial The Ramadan trial compared the efficacy and safety of Ryzodeg(R) twice daily and BIAsp 30 (NovoMix(R)) twice daily in subjects with type 2 diabetes before, during and after Ramadan. The trial was a 28-week, international, open-label, randomised, treat-to-target trial involving 263 adults from five countries with large Muslim populations (Algeria, India, Lebanon, Malaysia and South Africa). The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to the end of the month of Ramadan (four-week period). Secondary confirmatory endpoints included rates of blood sugar confirmed, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia.[1] About Ryzodeg(R) Ryzodeg(R) is a combination of two distinct insulin analogues (insulin degludec and insulin aspart in the ratio of 70% and 30%), making it the first combination of a basal insulin with an ultra-long duration of action and a mealtime insulin in one pen for people with type 1 and 2 diabetes.[4]-[6] Ryzodeg(R) incorporates the benefits of the degludec molecule.[7],[8] Ryzodeg(R) is given as an injection once or twice daily with the main meal(s).[4] Ryzodeg(R) offers a simpler regimen with fewer injections than basal and bolus therapy, in one pen.[9] Ryzodeg(R) received its first regulatory approval in December 2012 and European Medicines Agency approval in January 2013. Since then, Ryzodeg(R) has been approved in more than 70 countries, including the US in September 2015. It is now commercially available in 13 countries.[4] About Novo Nordisk Novo Nordisk is a global healthcare company with more than 90 years of innovation and leadership in diabetes care.

for direct attach cable. Currently, there are many different types of DAC twinax cables on the market such as SFP+ DAC Cable and QSFP DAC Cable. Terminated with transceiver-style connectors, they are designed to be used in the same ports as a typical SFP+ or QSFP transceiver, with no need for adaptors or converters, replacing two optical modules and a connectorized optical fiber with a twinax copper cable assembly. Here in this post, we will mainly focus on 56G QSFP+ to QSFP+ DAC Twinax Cable.\nBasics on 56G QSFP+ to QSFP+ DAC Twinax Cable The 56G QSFP+ to QSFP+ DAC twinax cable, as implied in the name, uses QSFP+ MSA and by using the inexpensive copper twinax cable with QSFP+ connectors on both sides, and provides 56 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity between devices with QSFP+ interfaces\uff0cwhich is suitable for very short distances and offers a highly cost-effective way to establish a 56 Gigabit link connectivity. Unlike 40G (10Gx4) QSFP+ DAC twinax cable, a kind of 40gb ethernet cable , the 56G QSFP+ DAC twinax cable is designed for 56G (14Gx4) InfiniBand FDR interconnecting networking applications such as high-performance computing (HPC), enterprise networking including top-of-rack switching and network storage markets.\nThe 56G QSFP+ DAC twinax cable is fully comply with QSFP+ Multi-Source Agreement (MSA) standards SFF-8436 and InfiniBand FDR specifications. And it is developed specifically as a cost-effective and lower-power alternative to 56G QSFP+ optics and 56G QSFP+ active optical fiber cable (QSFP+ AOC).\nSpecification and Features of 56G QSFP+ to QSFP+ DAC Twinax Cable Now, many suppliers can provide 56G QSFP+ DAC twinax cable for customers. The key features and specification for these products are more ore less the same. Here, we take the generic compatible 56G QSFP+ cable DAC from FS for example.\nSpecification \nKey Features \nLower cost than 56G QSFP+ optics and active optical cable (AOC) Maximum aggregate data rate: 56 Gb/s (4 x 14Gb/s) Compliant with Infiniband QDR/DDR/FDR data rates Hot-pluggable QSFP+ 38-PIN footprint Low Insertion Loss and power consumption Operating temperature range: 0 to 70\u00b0C Summary 56G QSFP+ to QSFP+ DAC twinax cables are passive optic cables designed with high performance, low power consumption, long reach interconnect solution supporting 56G Ethernet. For suppliers like FS, their 56G QSFP+ to QSFP+ DAC and other twinax cable offer compatibility with a huge range of vendors, enabling the connectivity customers need within the Top of Rack and End of Row environments.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "infiniband", "sentiment": "none"},

What will then matter at the finals in Russia are factors such as the quality of preparation by each team, the mental state of the players and prayers from back home. \n\u201cWe are in a \u2018decent group.\u2019 \n\u201cWe are banking on good preparation and the belief that our young players have in themselves. I am also happy that CAF is weighing in with some good money ($500,000 each) to support the preparation of the African flag \u2013bearers. I can also tell you that CAF is looking to see an African team in the semifinals or even to go all the way to win the trophy.\u201d \nPinnick said nobody gave the Super Eagles any chance of defeating Argentina in a friendly in Krasnodar 20 days ago. \n\u201cWe have a coach who has the mentality of a winner, and he has imbibed the players with the same attitude. We can do very well at the World Cup in Russia. I am very delighted that we have a team for tomorrow; a team for the next (2022) World Cup finals. \n\u201cAfrican players light up the English Premiership every weekend. Liverpool FC appear not to be able to do without Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane, and Chelsea FC sometimes struggle without Victor Moses. We have bright prospects in Russia.\u201d \nNigeria is in the same group as two \u2013time world champions and reigning world vice champions, Argentina, Iceland and Croatia in Group D at Russia 2018.
