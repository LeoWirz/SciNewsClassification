All the practitioners had worked with children who had self-harmed. \nBarnardo\u2019s Chief Executive Javed Khan said, \"It is simply not acceptable that children are having to sacrifice their futures to care for the ones they love. \n\"Austerity has meant local authorities have had to cut back on adult social care and the result is children are picking up the pieces. A quarter of the children supported by Barnardo\u2019s young carers\u2019 services are carrying out more than 30 hours a week of caring \u2013 that\u2019s the equivalent of a full time job. \n\"It\u2019s clear from our research that there is a lack of awareness among teachers that needs urgently addressing. Schools need to take more responsibility to make sure young carers are properly supported. \n\"Looking after their family members is something that our young carers are incredibly proud of but it shouldn\u2019t be at the expense of their childhoods or their futures.\" \nUnder the Care Act and the Children and Families Act, teachers \u2013 and other professionals working with children \u2013 have a statutory duty to identify young carers and refer them to the local authority to be assessed for support. \nYoung carers carry out tasks including cooking, cleaning and shopping, as well as providing intimate personal care, administering drugs and taking care of household finances. \nThe poll of 800 teachers found that nine-in-10 teachers thought caring responsibilities could impact negatively on young carers\u2019 school lives as it could mean they were late or absent from school or have trouble keeping up with work. \nStacey, a young carer since she was three years old, dropped out of school in Year 10 because of the lack of support available there, and ended up going to a pupil referral unit. She also dropped out of college because of her caring responsibilities. \nShe says her school and college were only active and intervening when she was dropping out because they had to be seen to be doing something. \nShe cares for a parent with mental health problems who can be violent and Stacey herself has suffered from panic attacks, self-harm and anorexia. \nShe said, \"Every day I\u2019d go home and I\u2019d think \u2018will I have to call the police, what will happen today?\u2019 I get very stressed and overthink everything. It\u2019s very tiring. Every night I\u2019d have a breakdown. \n\"I don\u2019t think teachers understand that stress and that just puts extra stress on a young carer. It\u2019s continuous in Year 10 and 11. You have revision, exams, caring \u2013 you don\u2019t get time to stop. Something has got to snap eventually \u2013 one little thing can tip you over the edge. \n\"I think it can be hard for schools to notice a young carer; some schools are really good but a lot of schools aren\u2019t. It can be hard for schools to find out that you are a young carer if your family doesn\u2019t talk about it. Some schools know if a pupil\u2019s a young carer but aren\u2019t helpful and others schools just don\u2019t know.\" \nDespite recent changes to legislation which have led to more young carers being identified, there are still children with caring responsibilities slipping under the radar. And cuts to local authority budgets have meant that more and more children are taking on more and more caring responsibilities. \nCarrie, 20, has been caring for her mum and younger siblings since she was six but didn\u2019t realise until she learnt about young carers at school in Year eight, although she was carrying out caring responsibilities daily, including making dinner, bathing her mum and putting her to bed and helping her siblings with their homework. \nShe was referred to Barnardo\u2019s young carers\u2019 service in Year eight by a therapist after she stopped eating or speaking. \nShe said, \"I do caring seven days a week and there isn\u2019t a day I can take off. Other young people go home and their mums and dads do their washing and cooking so they can do their homework and play on their X Box until 11 or 12 o\u2019clock at night. \n\"When I finish my caring I do my homework. My teachers didn\u2019t understand how much of a role my caring actually was.\" \nCommenting on the report, Paul Whiteman, General Secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said, \u201cPupils learn best when there\u2019s a strong bond between the home and the school. For schools to support young carers effectively they need to be aware of their circumstances, which are often extremely challenging. These families can be some of the most isolated from the wider school community, making it harder to pick up the warning signs in the playground or at parents evenings, for example. \n\u201cMany of these families may also be on low incomes, and NAHT has consistently argued that children from these families should be automatically registered for the Pupil Premium. This funding is specifically targeted at students who face challenges not unlike those faced by young carers. They should get this support automatically, particularly as the person they are caring for may not be able to apply for the money themselves. The additional funding would help schools to properly resource the ways in which they can identify and help young carers. \n\u201cSupporting young carers mental health is another concern, but funding has not kept pace with this demand. The government\u2019s green paper on mental health this week includes some welcome proposals but NAHT has been pressing the government for some time to take a more rounded approach to mental health provision, particularly to take some of the emphasis away from schools and re-assert the importance of well-resourced and accessible local support services. \n\u201cAll too often we hear that young people are already in crisis by the time help arrives. That cannot be right, so the new four week waiting time for NHS children and young people\u2019s mental health services is extremely important step forward. As the Secretary of State has said, every young person should be able to grow up feeling confident about themselves and their future. We now need the government to deliver on this ambition. \n\u201cNAHT will continue to work closely with the government to make sure that schools are able to deliver their part of the mental-health jigsaw, so that families \u2013 no matter what their challenges \u2013 have a clear picture of how they can get help rather than facing the complex and often tragic puzzle of recent years.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barnardo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stacey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul whiteman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "javed khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carrie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national association of head teachers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:27.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb938d42e0bab148a64ac294ae959ddf0628e372", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQDkYuNJsZGgsLh.L82A8j5dPMwwiTn0zlMQmAONE4lI0FQ.SdfdP0j8JHNL_uiInZsOtJp_1bBxLdBOeJikffZCzU6C_2d0nYWT31mFodNnKB3QuU9mQih5Aaoda2TjgP88YfovLwXwn86J1q1ZfFJG95G3pqC6hyxXmQwACfWuOhLJCq8d6gZ", "site_full": "purduephil.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://purduephil.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Raising beef cattle on grass can create a higher carbon footprint than feedlots, new study suggests \u2013 The Beef Blog", "title": "Raising beef cattle on grass can create a higher carbon footprint than feedlots, new study suggests", "title_full": "Raising beef cattle on grass can create a higher carbon footprint than feedlots, new study suggests", "published": "2017-12-07T12:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cb938d42e0bab148a64ac294ae959ddf0628e372", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQDkYuNJsZGgsLh.L82A8j5dPMwwiTn0zlMQmAONE4lI0FQ.SdfdP0j8JHNL_uiInZsOtJp_1bBxLdBOeJikffZCzU6C_2d0nYWT31mFodNnKB3QuU9mQih5Aaoda2TjgP88YfovLwXwn86J1q1ZfFJG95G3pqC6hyxXmQwACfWuOhLJCq8d6gZ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Phil Reid", "published": "2017-12-07T12:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "Raising beef cattle on grass can create a higher carbon footprint than feedlots, new study suggests", "text": "Raising beef cattle on grass can create a higher carbon footprint than feedlots, new study suggests\nKimberly Hickok\nMongabay\nThe popularity of grass-fed beef owes much to the claim that the meat from cattle raised on pastures is superior to corn-fed beef.

But why use these special types of papers and not the regular sublimation paper? Your choice of paper actually depends on the application. \n Sublimation Papers \n\nIf you\u2019re using a rotary heat press, then by all means proceed with the regular paper type. But if you\u2019re afraid of ghosting, get our tacky paper to eliminate the risk. These papers have a so-called tackified coating. They are a type of sticky sublimation papers. The coated surface is activated upon heating. While transferring the image, tacky paper sticks to the fabric. This helps reduce chances of ghosting. While pressing, the image may get duplicated if the paper or the fabric moves upon lifting the press. However, sticky papers adhere to the fabric, removing the risk sufficiently. \n Sublimation Papers \n\nIf you\u2019ve had problems with ghosting while transferring an image, make sure to opt for tacky papers while purchasing the next batch. Tacky paper is often used in sublimation when,You\u2019re working with certain elastic or stretchable fabrics, these are more likely to move during the transferring process. You can\u2019t always use the non-stretchable, 100% polyester fabric, even though it produces the best results. Your business depends on the customer demand; you\u2019re bound to supply what the market requires. That is exactly what we are here for! We provide high quality sublimation papers  that you can use with these difficult fabrics. Produce beautiful results no matter what fabric you\u2019re printing on! \n Sublimation Papers \n\nControlling ghosting errors is necessary, in a rush, we often want things to get done quickly. Human errors while printing can occur at various stages. While transferring, sometimes, you may lift the press too quickly. This can cause the paper to lift too. When it falls down again, the position is slightly off. As the image gets transferred, ghosting may occur. This can be prevented while using the tacky paper too. It sticks to the fabric and doesn\u2019t move; no matter how quickly you lift the press. So, tacky paper rolls can help avoid during lifting and allow you to use different fabrics. Isn\u2019t it the ideal choice, then? If you\u2019re impressed by what these papers can help you achieve, order our tacky or full sticky sublimation papers today. \n Sublimation Papers \n\nSuzhou Full Color Paper Industrial Co.,LTD is professional sublimation printer manufacturer in China.We are mainly dealing with Sublimation Paper , Sublimation Ink, Heat Press Machine, Epson Inkjet Printer  also the Laser Cutting machine. \nMore info ,pls contact us : Company Name:Full Color Paper Industrial Co.,LTD Website:\u2002 www.sublimationstar.com \u2002\u2002 Email:  sales@sublimationstar.com Tel : 025-86628894 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "heat press machine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suzhou full color paper industrial co.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epson inkjet printer", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:28.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "27cd60adbec85fed37c4a9d867b7606e15a0cfce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwDcJgXF_Ka2QstvTrCqN8M-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "27cd60adbec85fed37c4a9d867b7606e15a0cfce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwDcJgXF_Ka2QstvTrCqN8M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mallikaram01", "published": "2017-12-07T12:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "http://yoineer.com/6FYE\r\nEtv", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:28.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cbd3f7da09e2ac9dd7b7672cb5656494a39aa58b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_A0bejLFNgtWcH20xvHDNZN7wl7aT.bPuAmbVOFqfljKLsD1SQ0h0jQ6sAPjm5wS5X6Jji8A.88pN83SsiVyiHmKs49QhwfaR.WISJdxnHOK16LYBPWkGD", "site_full": "www.wect.com", "site": "wect.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/Wect-News", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WECT-TV6 - Local", "title": "New Jersey to vote on bill barring drunken drone flying", "title_full": "New Jersey to vote on bill barring drunken drone flying", "published": "2017-12-07T07:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 70563, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cbd3f7da09e2ac9dd7b7672cb5656494a39aa58b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_A0bejLFNgtWcH20xvHDNZN7wl7aT.bPuAmbVOFqfljKLsD1SQ0h0jQ6sAPjm5wS5X6Jji8A.88pN83SsiVyiHmKs49QhwfaR.WISJdxnHOK16LYBPWkGD", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T07:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "New Jersey to vote on bill barring drunken drone flying", "text": "New Jersey to vote on bill barring drunken drone flying 2017-12-07T05:10:36Z 2017-12-07T15:43:13Z \nTRENTON, N.J.

It also would make using a drone to hunt wildlife and endanger people or property a similar offense. \nThe legislation has already cleared a committee in the Democrat-controlled Assembly.

CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data.

CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data.

The remaining question now is: when will the war break out,\" the spokesman said.\n\"We do not wish for a war but shall not hide from it, and should the US miscalculate our patience and light the fuse for a nuclear war, we will surely make the US dearly pay the consequences with our mighty nuclear force which we have consistently strengthened.\"\nThe comments were carried by the official Korean Central News Agency late Wednesday, hours after the United States flew a B-1B supersonic bomber over South Korea as part of a massive combined aerial exercise involving hundreds of warplanes.\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the Guam-based bomber simulated land strikes at a military field near South Korea's eastern coast during a drill with US and South Korean fighter jets.\n\"Through the drill, the South Korean and US air forces displayed the allies' strong intent and ability to punish North Korea when threatened by nuclear weapons and missiles,\" the South Korean military said in a statement.\nB-1Bs flyovers have become an increasingly familiar show of force to North Korea, which after three intercontinental ballistic missile tests has clearly moved closer toward building a nuclear arsenal that could viably target the US mainland.\nThe five-day drills that began Monday involve more than 200 aircraft, including six U.S. F-22 and 18 F-35 stealth fighters.\nNorth Korea hates such displays of American military might at close range and typically uses strong language to condemn them as invasion rehearsals. It has been particularly sensitive about B-1B bombers, describing them as \"nuclear strategic\" although the planes were switched to conventional weaponry in the mid-1990s.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike pompeo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pompeo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kcna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foreign ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "workers' party of korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korean central news agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joint chiefs of staff", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korean peninsula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:29.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e44194bed2798cddef596a078871923b9d78e136", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2b9o1J83z6.rPn9NuHWV48IhPmMz.QlMiaFTvSX6FPNIx47KmhKS3gTi55cmdEGoBoxhMwkq_KP4w0X9d.jL2IYf48vKtrEf5PXC7_BHopQ--", "site_full": "richardmlive.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://richardmlive.wordpress.com/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "www.theuncertainsmile.com", "title": "Top tracks of 2017 #18 \u2013 LCD Soundsystem, Bishop Briggs, Morrissey & Gulp", "title_full": "Top tracks of 2017 #18 \u2013 LCD Soundsystem, Bishop Briggs, Morrissey & Gulp", "published": "2017-12-05T16:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://richardmlive.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/lcd.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e44194bed2798cddef596a078871923b9d78e136", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2b9o1J83z6.rPn9NuHWV48IhPmMz.QlMiaFTvSX6FPNIx47KmhKS3gTi55cmdEGoBoxhMwkq_KP4w0X9d.jL2IYf48vKtrEf5PXC7_BHopQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Richardmlive", "published": "2017-12-05T16:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "Top tracks of 2017 #18 \u2013 LCD Soundsystem, Bishop Briggs, Morrissey & Gulp", "text": "Top tracks of 2017 Top tracks of 2017 #18 \u2013 LCD Soundsystem, Bishop Briggs, Morrissey & Gulp \nFrom the LCD Soundsystem \u2018comeback\u2019 American Dream album this is the lead track Tonite.

Of course the best album James Murphy has been involved with is the mighty Reflector by Arcade Fire, arguably the album of the decade so far. \nThe track itself occupies the middle ground between New Order and Talking Heads.

Well, I can tell you. It was 13 years ago, and his \u201cIrish Blood, English Heart\u201d record just scraped into my top 10. To be honest, I\u2019d pretty much lost interest in him since then, but as was evidenced by Grandaddy\u2019s appearance at number 19, I\u2019m not adverse to giving someone another listen. He played at the 6 Music Festival at Maida Vale in October, and although he\u2019ll clearly never dominate these charts in the same way he did in the mid-1980\u2019s, I feel his presence is a worthy inclusion. \u201cAnd I recommend to all of my friends that they \nStop watching the news \nBecause the news contrives to frighten you \nTo make you feel small and alone \nTo make you feel that your mind isn\u2019t your own\u201d Number 18\u2026", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "briggs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morrissey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james murphy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grandaddy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monty python/terry jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guto pryce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bishop briggs, morrissey & gulp top", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "maida vale", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:29.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b82c6f0c5fa781a7d35b68ba315795657b890eee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTc5xlTNwxDfqjFFWxo9n56fLNJ1iYDHbKPByXQilnv0_Haza86pFjEFSS1_TJAmZaj0HEJ2tFf09GPxQWHSvdWku7yF_UlpTfAiG0iL73v1eh8f9FX8nDG7YpfNLS3z3hiwzBidAr4Umo-", "site_full": "www.heraldscotland.com", "site": "heraldscotland.com", "site_section": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/", "site_categories": ["media", "climbing", "sports"], "section_title": "Sport | Herald Scotland", "title": "Rangers appeal red card shown to Ryan Jack in Premiership win against Aberdeen", "title_full": "Rangers appeal red card shown to Ryan Jack in Premiership win against Aberdeen | HeraldScotland", "published": "2017-12-04T18:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 38, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7141408/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31684, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "91e501536d6c6b4684e0b001b0b97e2c9f6871ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTc5xlTNwxDfqjFFWxo9n56fLNJ1iYDHbKPByXQilnv0_Haza86pFjEFSS1_TJAmZaj0HEJ2tFf09GPxQWHSvdWku7yF_UlpTfAiG0iL73v1eh8f9FX8nDG7YpfNLS3z3hiLnrM4W.kXECyWoMmeD5h5g--", "ord_in_thread": 38, "author": "martin falcon", "published": "2017-12-07T10:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Oh you're back talking about the ball again. \\r\\nIf the appeal panel are consistent there is zero chance of the appeal being successful.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:29.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a21ddf633207252e53f753bfe74a19c722b9b732", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWPLMDvZZiAbojDN2ZIQ6MlmpXlw.fg1qf9O0SBxvtXOJOYXurce2sqYLvLYkxjhmkdIc11RmHE6FaLDAO9C_pxXMtscoPa3a8U5hUojcCOAI6Pm_R7x5v_EN3StDb2fu.GWsijKJw8m_OUUGo82InrFpwEGbA6KOAuW4k6ZkWroUIdyFgISahVqPYIGaHD7jZ", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-stationery-craft/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Stationery &amp; Craft - Buy Stationery &amp; Craft at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "80 Colors Sets Touch Five Alcohol Graphic Art Twin Tip Pen Markers Broad Fine Point\uff08Black bar\uff09", "title_full": "80 Colors Sets Touch Five Alcohol Graphic Art Twin Tip Pen Markers Broad Fine Point\uff08Black bar\uff09 | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2016-11-10T10:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 21, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "801c6791baffaab540b158558195798deba41766", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWPLMDvZZiAbojDN2ZIQ6MlmpXlw.fg1qf9O0SBxvtXOJOYXurce2sqYLvLYkxjhmkdIc11RmHE6FaLDAO9C_pxXMtscoPa3a8U5hUojcCOAI6Pm_R7x5v_EN3StDb2fu.GWsijKJw8m_OUUGo82InrFpwEGbA6KOAuW4k6ZkWroUIdyFgISahVit3.8vQx76jeQjl04tPSOU-", "ord_in_thread": 21, "author": "Eugene Lyh", "published": "2017-12-04T20:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Shipment is slow", "text": "Item has been 2 weeks.

Despite its widely utilization, there seems to be a great variability in their organization, clinical practice, and safety among centers.Aim of the studyTo obtain updated information on clinical practice in different perioperative areas of the CRS-HIPEC.Patients and MethodsAll 25 members of the Spanish Surface Peritoneal Malignancy (GECOP), were invited to answer an online survey, to describe their usual practice in different perioperative areas of the CRS-HIPEC.ResultsSurvey was responded by 100% of centers. This study represents more than 800 patients treated annually. Seventy per cent of respondents perform CRS-HIPEC for more than 5 years. The most frequent technique was Coliseum (88%). Routinely non-invasive monitoring of cardiac output is used by 92% of centers. More than 50% of centers administer oxaliplatin (74%), or mitomycin-C (65%) in colorectal cancer; cisplatin in gastric cancer (73%) and mesothelioma (74%). Ovarian cancer is treated with cisplatin and various combinations, in 64%. Spillage protocol was available in 100% centers.ConclusionsData showed an important variability in volume of patients per center, selection of cytostatic agents, professional training and safety measures applied. The standardization of CRS/HIPEC procedures based on the best available evidence, the individualization of patients and the consensus among professionals, constitute an important part of the basis that will allow us to improve results of this complex procedure.\n\n\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2zXYANl\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "",

Now they have to iron out their differences. \nDecember 7, 2017 \nArchitect of the Capitol/Wikipedia The House and Senate passed their own versions of a tax reform bill surprisingly fast. But now the hard work starts, as they need to turn those two bills into one. The trick is to produce a bill that can pass both chambers again, meaning a bill that appeases some powerful interest groups while still making the budget math work. \nIn some respects, this conference process may be easier than we think. Once lawmakers have come this far with such a big bill\u2014when stakes are this high\u2014it's hard to imagine them not doing everything they can to cross the finish line. Helping in the process is the fact that their bills aren't so vastly different in terms of philosophy and provisions that it makes reconciling differences impossible. \nFor instance, both bills would permanently lower the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent. They would get rid of the state and local tax deduction but retain a $10,000 exception for property taxes and make changes to the mortgage interest deduction. They both would improve investment taxes and allow 529 college savings accounts to apply to some primary and secondary education expenses. \nYet they aren't identical. Some differences are small, such as the date of implementation of the corporate income tax reduction; the House chose 2018, and the Senate bill says 2019. Also, the Senate bill would sunset many of its provisions, including the child tax credit expansion and the reductions in individual rates, and the House bill wouldn't. But most people agree that this is a budget gimmick to make the math work in the Senate and that most of the sunset provisions would be extended when the time comes. \nOther differences are big. For instance, both chambers adopted very different treatment of pass-through income (for businesses such as partnerships, sole proprietorships, S corporations and limited liability companies), with the Senate bill making it so generous that it could lead to further problems down the road. Another major difference to overcome has to do with the monstrous alternative minimum tax. Created in 1969 to prevent wealthy taxpayers from using deductions and credits to avoid paying federal income taxes, the AMT has expanded over time to hit middle-income people it was never intended to tax. The House bill would repeal both the corporate and the individual AMT, but the Senate version wouldn't. \nIt's worth considering some worst- and best-case scenarios resulting from this conference process. Worst-case scenario, the final bill would water down the investment provisions and entirely preserve many tax preferences currently targeted in both bills. It would also preserve the House version's individual rates, including a 12 percent bubble rate for top income earners, which effectively would impose a marginal tax rate of 45.6 percent, as opposed to the current 39.6 percent. \nIt would expand the child tax credit value beyond the levels passed in the House ($1,600) and the Senate ($2,000). That change would remove a large number of taxpayers from the tax rolls, which would be problematic because Republicans also refuse to cut spending. This also would shift more burden to the top 10 percent (taxpayers making above $138,000), who already pay 70 percent of the total federal income tax. If members of Congress also were to expand the refundable part of the credit, it would dramatically increase government spending, too. \nThe cherry on a very unsavory tax cake would be if lawmakers adopted the House's tax base erosion provisions, which include an idiotic excise tax that resembles the dreaded border adjustment tax, which was killed in recent months. \nTo finish on a positive note, allow me to dream a little. My best-case scenario would maintain the permanent 20 percent corporate tax rate. It would also delay the adoption of anti-tax avoidance provisions until lawmakers get to assess the full impact that cutting the corporate tax rate has on avoidance behaviors by companies. Congress would adopt the Senate version of the individual tax rates or even cut the top marginal rate further. \nIt would get rid of the alternative minimum tax and the state and local tax deduction\u2014including the $10,000 exemption\u2014and it would go ahead with eliminating all the tax preferences to special interests targeted in the House bill. Finally, lawmakers would start working on shrinking the deficit by paying for tax reform with serious spending cuts. Throw in a repeal of the death tax and be done with it. \nPhoto Credit: Architect of the Capitol/Wikipedia \nVeronique de Rugy, Ph.D., is a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and a monthly columnist for the print edition of Reason .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george mason university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercatus center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol/wikipedia  veronique de rugy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:29.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "55a1ff67e107acdbba71a817ebd83e28c71f8778", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR.lEAoHTc__lku9eUqLYEH7DjAxTH8IytAcZAe6tttWnC50c.rELryx_NKQD2DBsm1Cj0Q8HQ87rysARZcJ.UH18qzuKeI.u6pJitiNsMvpNTZxG9dzVWq", "site_full": "www.offshorewind.biz", "site": "offshorewind.biz", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/OffshoreWindNews", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "News by topic \u2013 Offshore Wind", "title": "The Carbon Trust Chooses Windar LiDARs for New Project", "title_full": "The Carbon Trust Chooses Windar LiDARs for New Project", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.offshorewind.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/the-carbon-trust-chooses-windar-lidars-for-new-project.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "55a1ff67e107acdbba71a817ebd83e28c71f8778", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR.lEAoHTc__lku9eUqLYEH7DjAxTH8IytAcZAe6tttWnC50c.rELryx_NKQD2DBsm1Cj0Q8HQ87rysARZcJ.UH18qzuKeI.u6pJitiNsMvpNTZxG9dzVWq", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Offshore WIND", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "The Carbon Trust Chooses Windar LiDARs for New Project", "text": "zoom Image source: Windar \nThe Carbon Trust has selected Windar Photonics to supply LiDARs for a new project launched as part of the Offshore Wind Accelerator (OWA) programme. \nWindar will supply eight WindEYE sensors to be installed on offshore turbines as part of The Carbon Trust\u2019s EUR 2.3 million wind farm control trials (WFCT), designed to demonstrate how effective implementation of control strategies can reduce the cost of offshore wind. \nThe project, supported by EnBW, E.ON, innogy, Statoil and Vattenfall, will investigate the impact of focusing on strategies that aim to improve energy generation across an entire wind farm, rather than individual turbines and help to lower the levelised cost of energy (LCoE). \n\u201cI am delighted that Windar has been selected to supply WindEYE\u2122 sensors to such a significant project backed by major industry players. We are confident the project will focus industry attention on the multiple benefits of our WindEYE\u2122 systems, from increasing wind energy yield, reducing turbine fatigue, lowering operational and maintenance costs and ultimately reducing the levelised cost of energy for energy producers,\u201d J\u00f8rgen Korsgaard Jensen , Chief Executive Officer at Windar, said. \nThe WFCT intends to demonstrate a lower LCoE by increasing the total wind energy yield and reducing fatigue, therefore saving O&M costs, while also increasing the availability and lifetime of existing and future assets, as well as by implementing wind farm control strategies, including turbine nacelle mounted LiDARs, Windar said. \nJames Sinfield , Manager at The Carbon Trust, said: \u201cThe project has the potential to have a significant impact on cost reduction with a win-win on improving annual energy production and at the same time reducing operational and maintenance costs.\u201d \nThe programme is expected to be undertaken in 2018 with full results expected during 2019. \nOWA, The Carbon Trust\u2019s collaborative R&D programme with nine offshore wind developers, was set up in 2008. Over the past nine years, the programme has delivered nearly 150 projects, ranging from feasibility studies to multi-million pound, full-scale technology demonstrations. The projects undertaken by the OWA programme are selected to impact the LCoE by improving performance in offshore wind farm design, construction and operation.

Reuters\nAustralia became the 26th nation to legalise same-sex marriage on Thursday, prompting cheers and singing from a packed parliament public gallery in a country where some states ruled homosexual acts to be illegal until just 20 years ago.\nLawmakers, who had cast aside a conservative push to allow religious objectors to refuse service to same-sex couples, waved rainbow flags and embraced on the floor of the chamber, where earlier in the debate a politician had proposed to his same-sex partner.\nFewer than five of 150 MPs voted against the law.\n\"What a day. What a day for love, for equality, for respect,\" said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. \"...It is time for more marriages.\"\nThe laws, which will also recognise same-sex marriages solemnised in foreign countries, take effect from Saturday. Because a month's notice is required for the state to recognise a marriage, the first legal same-sex unions will be in January.\nAustralians had overwhelmingly endorsed legalising same-sex marriage in a postal survey run by the national statistics agency.\nThe bill cleared the upper house last month and had been expected to pass on Thursday after Turnbull's Liberal-National coalition government and the main opposition Labor Party had previously said they wanted to pass it by Dec. 7.\nBut religious organisations and conservative lawmakers had voiced strong opposition and proposed dozens of amendments.\nDuring parliamentary debate, they pressed for broad protections for religious objectors, among them florists and bankers, to refuse service to same-sex couples.\n\"These amendments, rather, are a shield for people and organisations that hold to a traditional view of marriage. They are not a sword to be wielded in the service of bigotry,\" government MP Andrew Hastie said in parliament.\nAmendments to permit lay celebrants to decline to solemnise same-sex marriages and businesses opposed to the unions to refuse service at wedding receptions were all defeated, one after the other, during three days of debate.\n\"Love has won, and it's time to pop the bubbly,\" Greens MP and same-sex marriage supporter Adam Bandt said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew hastie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam bandt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "labor party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal-national", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:29.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6d93e245537c88d2009aa1b3fdb6a881d48596e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPw7w75fLTFLX1guZbH4e5HbU6Mj2aHtx5mEMfs_FV13fvvjWgP8vXS7Djpnoh7O_qVgTOEs4lS7W.dmgr4.VmwUfSRiW2Bo7bannbykY9QVI-", "site_full": "www.military-technologies.net", "site": "military-technologies.net", "site_section": "http://www.military-technologies.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["table_tennis_ping_pong", "financial_news", "finance", "sports"], "section_title": "MilTech", "title": "Crystalline Solar Collectors Market Growth, Forecast and Value Chain 2016 \u2013 2024", "title_full": "Crystalline Solar Collectors Market Growth, Forecast and Value Chain 2016 \u2013 2024", "published": "2017-12-07T10:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6d93e245537c88d2009aa1b3fdb6a881d48596e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPw7w75fLTFLX1guZbH4e5HbU6Mj2aHtx5mEMfs_FV13fvvjWgP8vXS7Djpnoh7O_qVgTOEs4lS7W.dmgr4.VmwUfSRiW2Bo7bannbykY9QVI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Abhishek Budholiya", "published": "2017-12-07T10:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "Crystalline Solar Collectors Market Growth, Forecast and Value Chain 2016 \u2013 2024", "text": "Source: imported from this press release . \nIncreasing demands for clean energy is a major reason for the globally growing utilization of solar energy. Innovations in the development of the photovoltaic (PV) cells played a major role in capturing solar energy efficiently. PV cells can be combined in collector panels which convert solar energy into electrical energy through the photoelectric effect. Commercially crystalline silica and its oxides are used to manufacture PV cells. Silicon is abundantly present all around the world and is an environmentally safe element, and thereby the ideal choice. Crystalline solar PV collectors are mostly used in the industrial and residential sectors. Numerous innovations are also in progress to improve the efficiency of PV cells made from crystalline silicon so as to tap solar energy efficiently. Monocrystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, and amorphous silicon are major types of silicon presently used. Other materials which can be employed for this purpose are cadmium telluride and copper indium gallium selenide/sulfide. \nA majority of the world\u2019s PV solar collectors are based on different variations of silicon used in PV cell manufacturing technologies which distinguished them as monocrystalline and polycrystalline PV cells. These solar cells are made out of cylindrical silicon ingots which are further modified to make silicon wafers. Monocrystalline PV cells are made from an extremely pure form of silica which exhibits prominent solar conversion efficiency. Polycrystalline silicon solar cells are manufactured from less pure silicon and are therefore less efficient. Multiple types of solar collectors have been developed recently to improve the efficiency of solar energy collection such as thin-film solar cells, amorphous silicon (a-Si) collectors, cadmium telluride cells, copper indium gallium selenide-based collectors, and organic photovoltaic collectors. The main advantages of thin film PV collectors are their relatively low consumption of raw materials, high efficiency, reduction in sensitivity on overheating, improved integration & appearance, and excellent performance at high ambient temperatures. Their current drawbacks are their limited solar conversion efficiency and the industry\u2019s inadequate experience with lifetime performance. \nRequest Report Brochure @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=22286 \nA few recently developed solar collection technologies include solar thermoelectricity systems, dye sensitized solar cells and concentrated photovoltaic collector systems which may hold a significant share in the solar energy market if they become competitive enough to be commercialized. \nThe annual global production of solar energy is estimated to reach over 500GW by the end of 2020 (from 40 GW in 2013) which indicates that the global crystalline solar collector market is expanding rapidly displays excellent potential. China and Germany are the leading countries in terms of solar PV collectors and account for an installed capacity of more than 37 GW. The market is burgeoning in South East Asia due to growing energy demands and strict global environmental norms. Decreasing costs of PV cells, uncertainties in the global oil & gas industry, and advanced technological innovation are helping make solar panels smaller, cheaper and more customer friendly thereby attracting several countries to adopt them in their energy replenishment programs. \nRequest For Customization@ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=CR&rep_id=22286 \nMajor restraints for the crystalline solar PV collector market are the reduced solar conversion efficiency of the existing PV cells and use of modern crystalline materials which are expensive and toxic for the environment. Efforts are being taken to increase their efficiency of solar collectors through new technological breakthroughs such as nano-crystalline solar cells, thin-film processing, metamorphic multijunction solar cells, and polymer processing to propel the PV solar collector industry. Key global players in market include Wuxi Sutech Power Co., Ltd., First Solar Inc., Juwi Solar, Inc., Yingli Solar, Sharp Solar Energy Solutions Group, BP Solar, and Canadian Solar Inc. Major Indian manufacturers are SunFuel, SSL Ltd, and Emmvee Photovoltaic. PV is projected to produce about 10% of world\u2019s electricity by 2030. The Market\u2019s future prospects appears to be promising and it is poised to be a major contributor in energy replenishment of the world in the near future.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle":

The waiver and release specifically includes, without limitation, any and all rights and claims pertaining to the processing of personal data, including but not limited to any rights under any applicable data protection statute(s). If in any jurisdiction, any part of this disclaimer is held to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such part of this disclaimer shall be restricted or eliminated to the minimum extent and the remaining disclaimer shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. \nPlease note the information presented is deemed representative at the time of its original release. Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

In contrast, headlights weren't factored in for 2017 Top Safety Pick , and an acceptable headlight rating was enough to bump a 2017 award winner into \"plus\" territory. \nThe inclusion of a passenger-side crash test is a first for any IIHS award. The Institute developed the passenger-side small overlap front crash test after it became clear that some manufacturers weren't paying sufficient attention to the passenger side as they made improvements to achieve better performance in the driver-side small overlap front test. \nIn 2012, IIHS began rating vehicles for protection in small overlap crashes, which involve just the front corner of the vehicle, bypassing the main structural components. It wasn't surprising that automakers acted more quickly to improve protection on the driver side than on the passenger side, and improving driver-side protection was arguably more urgent, since every vehicle on the road has a driver, while not every one has a passenger. The ultimate goal, however, was symmetric protection. \nThe first official passenger-side ratings were released in October, following research tests last year. \n\"Drivers expect that their passengers, who are often family, will be protected just as well as they are,\" says IIHS President Adrian Lund. \"Manufacturers have been taking this issue seriously since we first shed light on it, and we're confident that good small overlap protection will become the norm on the passenger side, just as it has on the driver side.\" \nThe Institute's headlight ratings also are relatively new, with the first ones released in March 2016. Initially, few performed well in IIHS track tests, which measure how well low beams and high beams illuminate the road ahead on the one hand, and the amount of glare they produce for drivers of oncoming vehicles on the other. \n\"Headlights have long been treated as design elements instead of the critical safety equipment that they are,\" Lund says. \"We're pleased to see this changing. Every one of the 62 award winners for 2018 is available with headlights that are at least acceptable.\" \nThe 15 Top Safety Pick + winners include four small cars, three midsize cars, five large luxury cars, two midsize nonluxury SUVs and one midsize luxury SUV. No minivans, pickups or minicars earn the highest award. Models from a wider range of vehicle types earn Top Safety Pick , but there are no minicars in that category either. \nMost of the Top Safety Pick + awards go to two manufacturers: Hyundai Motor Co. \u2014 which owns the Hyundai, Kia and Genesis brands \u2014 has six models earning the award, and Subaru has four. Mercedes-Benz has two, while Toyota, BMW and Ford Motor Co. have one each. \nToyota Motor Corp. has the most vehicles \u2014 10 \u2014 on the Top Safety Pick list. Hyundai is the runner-up with nine. All but one of the seven vehicles in Subaru's 2018 lineup earn one of the awards. The Impreza, Legacy, Outback and WRX qualify for Top Safety Pick + when equipped with optional front crash prevention and specific headlights. The Crosstrek and the Forester earn Top Safety Pick , also with optional front crash prevention and specific headlights. The BRZ is the only Subaru model that doesn't qualify. \nAcross manufacturers, the vast majority of winners qualify only when optionally equipped because front crash prevention and acceptable or good headlights aren't part of their base trims. \nAutomakers have pledged to make autobrake standard on virtually all passenger vehicles by 2022, but for now the technology remains mostly optional, especially on nonluxury brands. \nAn exception is Toyota, which has equipped all but a handful of Toyota and Lexus models with standard autobrake and other advanced features. Seven models with standard autobrake \u2014 the Toyota Camry, Corolla, Prius, Prius Prime and Highlander and the Lexus IS and NX \u2014 also have standard acceptable or good headlights and qualify for Top Safety Pick without any added options. The addition of optional curve-adaptive headlights that earn a good rating boosts the Camry to Top Safety Pick +. \nIIHS has been recognizing vehicles with Top Safety Pick since the 2006 model year to help consumers identify vehicles with the highest safety ratings without having to wade through information about individual tests. The Top Safety Pick + accolade was introduced in the 2013 model year to recognize vehicles that offer a superior level of safety. Over the years, IIHS has added to and strengthened criteria for both awards, pushing automakers to speed up safety advances. \nThe Institute releases ratings as it evaluates new models, adjusting the list of winners throughout the year. By fall of 2017, 69 vehicles had earned 2017 Top Safety Pick + and 51 had earned 2017 Top Safety Pick . \n\"The improvements in occupant protection have been amazing over the past decades,\" says Lund. \"All automakers now recognize the important role of safety in consumer choice, and they are increasingly receptive to working with our engineers to understand the next steps in keeping people from harm in motor vehicle crashes and to make real changes in their vehicle designs.

Later, when Modi moved to Maninagar constituency, Vala continued his undefeated run till 2012.\nLater, after Vala was shifted to Karnataka, Vijay Rupani won the bypoll from the seat in 2014.\nThough Rajkot-West is a stronghold of the RSS, the Congress has mounted a strong challenge by bringing in Rajyaguru, the sitting MLA from Rajkot-East, to rework the caste combination in the party's favour.\nTo retain his seat, Rupani has to surmount the angry Patidars as well as the trading community, which is smarting under the impact of demonetisation and rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).\nOut of 3.15 lakh voters in the constituency, the number of Kadva and Leuva Patidars is the highest at 62,000, followed by Brahmins, Lohana and Jain communities.\nThe Congress is trying to direct the simmering anger among Patidars over lack of reservation in education and government jobs under the BJP rule against Rupani.\nThe quota agitation and Hardik Patel joining hands with Congress may dent the BJP's base among the Patidars, who till now were considered as the bedrock of the BJP's support base in Gujarat.\nCongress nominee Rajyaguru, the richest candidate in Gujarat elections, believes that he has won the \"initial battle\" against Rupani by keeping him busy in the constituency since the poll schedule was announced.\n\"I wanted to keep the chief minister busy in Rajkot-West constituency and morally I have won the initial battle as the chief minister has to visit his constituency more than once in a week,\" Rajyaguru claimed.\nHowever, Rupani has been unfazed and is confidant of his victory.\nHe earlier cited the work done by him for the people of the state as well as his constituency, especially bringing the Narmada river water to Rajkot.\nRupani had said that he was not facing any challenge in Rajkot West as it is a traditional bastion of the BJP.\n\"I will win the seat easily,\" he had told PTI in an interview recently.\nBJP's Saurashtra and Kutch spokesperson Raju Dhruv said that Rupani has always been ready to solve the problems faced by the people of Rajkot or elsewhere in Gujarat.\n\"As the CM, he has done well and because of his tireless efforts, Rajkot could get the Narmada water in less than five years of the project announced by then chief minister Narendra Modiji,\" Dhruv said.\nThe 182-member Gujarat Assembly will go to the polls in two phases -- on December 9 and 14 -- and the counting of votes will be taken up on December 18.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rupani", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dec", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dhruv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harshadba chudasama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hardik patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vajubhai vala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patidars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajyaguru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narendra modiji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lohana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leuva patidars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vijay rupani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raju dhruv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "press trust of india", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmedabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajkot west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saurashtra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karnataka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narmada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajkot-west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajyaguru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kadva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kutch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maninagar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajkot-east", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:30.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c3af4f56af881fd390559b47a30a78d5ca07c33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ35BfiwSk3DXxj1BMts3nQlDYQN_iUfvFX_s2XrK4l9v.AbDI9mz0tGtPH2_zmnuZjow_WqzXGcxyJxYrB72IGbpa37g8pMXq.w--", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/o-t-lounge/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "O-T Lounge | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Most Famous Person Who Is Your Eskimo Brother?

One university in Colorado is testing CBD on dogs with arthritis and epilepsy. (Dec. 7)\nMedia: Associated Press BEND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 Dr. Byron Maas surveys a supply of marijuana products for dogs that lines a shelf in his veterinary clinic. They're selling well.\n\"The 'Up and Moving' is for joints and for pain,\" he explains. \"The 'Calm and Quiet' is for real anxious dogs, to take away that anxiety.\"\nPeople anxious to relieve suffering in their pets are increasingly turning to oils and powders that contain CBDs, a non-psychoactive component of marijuana. But there's little data on whether they work, or if they have harmful side effects.\nThat's because Washington has been standing in the way of clinical trials, veterinarians and researchers say. Now, a push is underway to have barriers removed, so both pets and people can benefit.\nThose barriers have had more than just a chilling effect.\nWhen the federal Drug Enforcement Administration announced last year that even marijuana extracts with CBD and little or no THC - marijuana's intoxicating component - are an illegal Schedule 1 drug, the University of Pennsylvania halted its clinical trials. Colorado State University is pushing ahead.\nPhoto: David Zalubowski, AP Image 1 of / 11 11 In this Monday, Oct. 30, 2017, photo, Luke Byerly tends to his 14-year-old beagle, Robbie, during a break at Byerly's job as a technician at a veterinary clinic in east Denver.

The board is awaiting a recommendation from two group councils.\n\"The concern our membership has is worry about people extrapolating their own dosages, looking to medicate their pets outside the realm of the medical professional,\" Board Chairman Michael Whitehair said in a telephone interview. \"This is an important reason for us to continue the research.\"\nUtah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a conservative Republican, became an unlikely champion of this push when he introduced a bill in September that would open the path for more clinical research. While Hatch said he opposes recreational marijuana use, he wants marijuana-based drugs, regulated by the FDA, produced for people with disorders.\n\"We lack the science to support use of medical marijuana products like CBD oils, not because researchers are unwilling to do the work, but because of bureaucratic red tape and over-regulation,\" Hatch said.\nDawn Boothe, of Auburn University's College of Veterinary Medicine, is waiting for federal approval to begin a study of marijuana's effects on dogs with epilepsy. The classification of marijuana products containing CBD as a Schedule 1 drug, the same category as heroin and LSD, creates a \"major, major, major, terrible roadblock\" for researchers, Boothe said in a phone interview.\nResearchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine were studying CBDs' effects on dogs with osteoarthritis and pruritis, or itchiness, until the DEA released its policy statement.\n\"The ambiguity in this process has really brought us to a screeching halt,\" said Michael DiGregorio, director of the university's clinical trials center. \"It is research that needs to be done, because there are a lot of CBD products out there.\"\nWhen it clarified that marijuana CBD extracts are Schedule 1 drugs, the DEA said it was assigning a code number to those substances to better track them and to comply with international drug control treaties.\nDiGregorio complained that researchers seeking federal approval to study CBD products are told to provide certain data, but that data isn't normally available until the study is done.\n\"If you don't have the data, you can't get the registration to do the work,\" he said.\nOn a recent morning, Maas took a break from seeing four-legged patients in the Bend Veterinary Clinic. A stethoscope dangling from his neck over green scrubs, Maas said his clients have reported CBDs help relieve pain, arthritis, anxiety, loss of appetite, epilepsy and inflammation in their pets.\n\"Unfortunately there's not a lot of research out there, especially on animals, on CBD compounds,\" Maas said. \"The research is really necessary to help us understand how to actually use these compounds on our pets.\"\nVeterinarian Janet Ladyga of the Blue Sky Veterinary Clinic, also in Bend, said she doesn't recommend marijuana products because of the unknowns.\n\"We don't have a lot of evidence right now, so we don't know the toxicity or the safety profile ... and we don't have any good evidence to show either if it's safe or efficacious,\" she said.\nThe study at Colorado State University aims to provide some data. The roughly two dozen dogs in the arthritis study and the 30 in the epilepsy tests are given either CBD oil or a placebo. For the arthritis study, activity monitors are attached to the animals' collars, to determine if they're more mobile when they're taking CBD.\nPrincipal investigator Stephanie McGrath said she hopes the results will be a stepping stone for longer and more diverse studies, and that they provide useful information for human medicine.\n\"Every medication we're taking has been given to a dog first,\" the University of Pennsylvania's DiGregorio noted.\nMeanwhile, Boothe said she had everything ready to start her study in January, and was waiting for a green light from federal officials.\n\"I don't know what's taking so long,\" she said.\n___\nFollow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664246/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664218/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664227/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664218/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664221/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664247/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664215/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664221/3/920x920.jpg", "https://twitter.com/andrewselsky", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664247/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664226/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664245/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664228/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664227/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664226/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664246/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664228/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664245/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664215/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:30.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "769f35541698b99e3f89bd1dd35a8399c488ed2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.F_PTg4uy5TFzmteU4XGnZU4wxBe8cu65TM1mlUUUd6NlQBefLv3az0a9Ic9VfWo6fjjEUCVijHvxA5Q7AVNDZ", "site_full": "www.informationng.com", "site": "informationng.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "OMG!!!

Woman keeps baby in her fridge", "text": "Tope Alabi December 7, 2017 \nA woman was forced to keep the body of her dead baby in a freezer after a hospital told her to keep it until she had a death certificate. \nThe woman identified as Monica Palomino said her baby was born prematurely last Saturday after a gestation of only 25 weeks and died on Monday. \nBut under pressure from security personnel at Lima\u2019s Sergio Bernales hospital, she had to take the body home until she could begin the process of getting a death certificate. \n\u201cThey gave me my son when I was discharged. He\u2019s in the refrigerator in my house because they did not give me the time to do the paperwork for his death certificate,\u201d Palomino told ATV television. \n\u201cI want to bury him but to do so I need the death certificate,\u201d said the mother, who returned to the hospital on Tuesday to claim it. \nMeanwhile, the child\u2019s body remained in the freezer of the family refrigerator. On the door she placed a sign that says, \u201cDo Not Touch.\u201d \n\u201cThe woman in charge of the gynecology department did not want to let me leave the hospital if I didn\u2019t take my baby. My baby was wrapped in a diaper.\u201d \nHospital director Julio Silva said Wednesday it would investigate the woman\u2019s complaint, because he said the security guards had broken all the hospital\u2019s procedures. \n\u201cI assume full responsibility. What should have been done is wait in the mortuary for the death certificate to be issued, to then be able to remove the body,\u201d Silva told reporters. \nSource: ( ATV )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tope alabi", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "julio silva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palomino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergio bernales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monica palomino", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "atv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lima", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:30.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c3af4f56af881fd390559b47a30a78d5ca07c33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ35BfiwSk3DXxj1BMts3nQlDYQN_iUfvFX_s2XrK4l9v.AbDI9mz0tGtPH2_zmnuZjow_WqzXGcxyJxYrB72IGbpa37g8pMXq.w--", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/o-t-lounge/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "O-T Lounge | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Most Famous Person Who Is Your Eskimo Brother? 6", "title_full": "Most Famous Person Who Is Your Eskimo Brother? | Page 6 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T07:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9a2fa33df60ab14addec6b015a8d925eb7eeffd6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ35BfiwSk3DXxj1BMts3nQlDYQN_iUfvFX_s2XrK4l9v.AbDI9mz0tGtPH2_zmnuZjow_WqzXGcxyJxYrB72IGbrqylezrtp7Yzhykk6eKobs", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Vanilla Ice", "published": "2017-12-07T08:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: :\nVanilla Ice\nThat\u2019s right, bitch", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://imgz-fandroppingsllc.netdna-ssl.com/Images/Icons/IconPimp.gif"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:30.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c3af4f56af881fd390559b47a30a78d5ca07c33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ35BfiwSk3DXxj1BMts3nQlDYQN_iUfvFX_s2XrK4l9v.AbDI9mz0tGtPH2_zmnuZjow_WqzXGcxyJxYrB72IGbpa37g8pMXq.w--", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/o-t-lounge/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "O-T Lounge | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Most Famous Person Who Is Your Eskimo Brother? 6", "title_full": "Most Famous Person Who Is Your Eskimo Brother? | Page 6 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T07:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bdb6404b6750316c5f6f5c79e7e2e681fb934682", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ35BfiwSk3DXxj1BMts3nQlDYQN_iUfvFX_s2XrK4l9v.AbDI9mz0tGtPH2_zmnuZjow_WqzXGcxyJxYrB72IGbrqylezrtp7Y1DANSymmQuW", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "supadave3", "published": "2017-12-07T08:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "One of the Durans from Duran Duran...\nOh, and I'm possibly Eskimo Brothers with Mikee.

Before her public appearances, OWASA did not have a speaking limit for public petitions and requests. They implemented a 3 minute speech limit after they got tired of Daria continuing to question their conclusions and presumptions about the policy. This was admitted by Will Raymond in his speech at the same meeting - you can note that they are still playing these games with their 'technical difficulties' at the beginning.\n\nHere, Daria has helped organize more than 25 people to attend this incredibly boring OWASA meeting and raise awareness about their negligence and obstinate attitude towards the general public. She does a great job exposing their inability to address many of the principled and ethical arguments we make, that are blatantly ignored. Unfortunately, OWASA counts on the public not really taking interest, because they ignore us when we call them out on ignoring us. That is why we have to document and upload example after example so as to build a chronological expose of their continued willing negligence in this matter. \n\nPlease support Daria and her network trying to change this in Orange County: \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FluorideFree... .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daria barazandeh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "will raymond", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "owasa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "orange county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:30.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c6349381bfc4b52c245e844bb1372467f7618c57", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.y73yIunbVrstk3E2M4Z6WRW.l9Y8eWn33K1X_DnPmVHGroqm_luXCiNkS3Rz9rDXBNI8WRRUK3w00TjCef7ojIp2_6zZiXW4.bW26NQagOFS2pbatb00S0jos0caJgLQarpVMe88cv7VHWR79CsWZ5U2UdCSKE10-", "site_full": "www.burytimes.co.uk", "site": "burytimes.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.burytimes.co.uk/leisure/showbiz/rss/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Bury Times | Showbiz News", "title": "Eddie The Eagle director Dexter Fletcher signs up to make Queen film", "title_full": "Eddie The Eagle director Dexter Fletcher signs up to make Queen film", "published": "2017-12-07T10:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.burytimes.co.uk/resources/images/7151394/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c6349381bfc4b52c245e844bb1372467f7618c57", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.y73yIunbVrstk3E2M4Z6WRW.l9Y8eWn33K1X_DnPmVHGroqm_luXCiNkS3Rz9rDXBNI8WRRUK3w00TjCef7ojIp2_6zZiXW4.bW26NQagOFS2pbatb00S0jos0caJgLQarpVMe88cv7VHWR79CsWZ5U2UdCSKE10-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "Eddie The Eagle director Dexter Fletcher signs up to make Queen film", "text": "Eddie The Eagle director Dexter Fletcher signs up to make Queen film Dexter Fletcher (Matt Crossick/PA) \nQueen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody has a new director following the firing of Bryan Singer \u2013 British filmmaker and actor Dexter Fletcher. \nThe Eddie The Eagle director will replace Singer, who said his services had been \u201cterminated\u201d. \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, production on the movie will resume next week.

Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

Credit 2017 The Arshile Gorky Foundation/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York; Hauser & Wirth Some artists you enormously admire. Others you admire and enormously love. For many people, Arshile Gorky is a loved one. And much of what makes him cherishable is distilled in \u201c Ardent Nature: Arshile Gorky Landscapes, 1943-47,\u201d an exhibition as manic and tender as a Schubert song cycle, at Hauser & Wirth\u2019s Upper East Side space.\nOrganized by Saskia Spender , one of the artist\u2019s two granddaughters and president of the Arshile Gorky Foundation, it\u2019s a large exhibition: more than 30 paintings and drawings, on loan from museums and private collections, installed on three gallery floors. Yet its time frame, roughly four years, is tight. It coincides with the beginning of the artist\u2019s most fully developed work, ends a year before his death, and spans some of the happiest and saddest days of his short life.\nThat life was rarely easy. Gorky was born Vosdanik Adoian, around 1902 (the exact year is unclear) on the shores of Lake Van, in mountainous rural Armenia near the Turkish border. And for a brief time, in the beauty of that natural setting, in the closeness of his family, he experienced bliss.\nAs an adult he recalled that close to \u201cour house on the road to the spring, my father had a little garden with a few apple trees which had retired from giving fruit. There was a ground constantly giving shade where grew incalculable amounts of wild carrots, and porcupines had made their nest. There was a blue rock half buried in the black earth with a few patterns here and there like fallen clouds.\u201d He remembered a \u201cHoly Tree.\u201d He remembered \u201cthe sh-h-h-sh-h of silver leaves of the poplars.\u201d\nContinue reading the main story Photo \u201cUntitled,\u201d a 1944 work by Gorky. Credit 2017 The Arshile Gorky Foundation/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York; Hauser & Wirth These were memories he spent a lifetime revisiting, talking about, dreaming about, and trying to recover through art.\n In reality, this Eden soon ended. In 1908, his father immigrated to the United States. Within a few years, his mother, whom he adored, moved the household from the country into the city of Van. Then a nightmare began. In 1915, the Turkish government initiated a genocidal slaughter of the Armenian population. Gorky\u2019s family lived as hunted refugees, camping here and there. His mother died in his arms of starvation. Still in his teens, he escaped to America, where he took the name Gorky and turned himself into a modern artist.\n Why he decided to become an artist, we don\u2019t know, though we do know how he went about it, initially through a kind of ventriloquism of other artist\u2019s voices and styles. He began with C\u00e9zanne, moved on to Picasso, and further on to Surrealists like Joan Mir\u00f3, Andr\u00e9 Masson and Roberto Matta. He approached each model with an eye to what he could learn about color, texture, combining images and abstraction. As it happened, he was naturally gifted with an angel\u2019s hand and his editing of sources was substantial: He pared away what he didn\u2019t need and added his own increasingly autobiographical content.\nBy 1943, form and content were in sync in his art. And in his life, he was as close to a return to Eden as he would ever get. Two years earlier, this moody, outsider-minded man had, with joy, married a young woman named Agnes Magruder. Simultaneously, after decades of struggle, his career was finally starting to yield rewards. This allowed him to spend long stretches out of the city, first in Virginia, where his wife\u2019s parents had a farm, and later in rural Connecticut, where he drew and painted for weeks outdoors and turned a barn into a studio.\nAll the work in the show comes from this time of return to the natural world. Not just in memory, but in reality, he could \u201clook into the grass,\u201d as he put it, and up into the trees.\nContinue reading the main story Photo Installation view of \u201cArdent Nature: Arshile Gorky Landscapes, 1943-47,\u201d with \u201cStudy for Pastoral\u201d (1946\u201347), left, and \u201cPastoral\u201d (1947).

He finds a fantastical, earthbound world of abstract forms resembling slugs, fungi, pods and bulbs, glommed together parasitically and erotically. It\u2019s a mesmerizing vision, vivacious, but hungry and scary, the way the drawings of Samuel Palmer, that keyed-up Romantic soul, can be.\nThen within a few years, the forms thin down, grow lighter. A 1946 drawing titled \u201cVirginia-Summer\u201d is an allover web of scraps: like a centerless scatter of stems, clods and hard-shell insects turned up by a rake. (This allover tactic influenced Jackson Pollock and other Abstract Expressionists, for some of whom Gorky was a mentor.) Elsewhere, the view tends upward. A succulent green pastel drawing called \u201cApple Orchard\u201d suggests buds and leaves on a branch, maybe one of the trees in his father\u2019s Armenian orchard, in sudden, miraculous bloom.\nAnd in several large pieces, Gorky appears to pull back to take in whole landscapes, as in a pair of oil paintings, both titled \u201cPastoral,\u201d from around 1947. Even the messiest, most impetuous of his graphite drawings have a sense of precision and fineness of detail. But these two \u201cPastorals,\u201d one dark (a field of brown-black with pink-white patches), the other light (chrome-yellow and white with green scribbles), are so loosely painted as to seem unfinished. (The yellow-white one, at least, isn\u2019t: it\u2019s conspicuously signed on the front.)\nThis effect is partly from a change in painting method, possibly learned from Matta. For most of his career Gorky had applied paint thickly and precisely, within outlines, in a way that made his forms look inorganic, overly deliberated. But in the 1940s, he started to thin his oils with turpentine to a watercolor consistency, which brought a relaxed softness and fleetness to his art.\n \u201cI prefer not to see the strength of my arm in the painting but only the poetry of my heart,\u201d he wrote of this change. \u201cThe trouble is everyone uses their arms too much. I want to leave only the ghost of the painting to spur imagination.\u201d\nContinue reading the main story Photo \u201cGray Drawing for Pastoral,\u201d from around 1946-47, charcoal and crayon work on paper.

One titled \u201cThe Opaque,\u201d from 1947, is done almost entirely in gray oil washes, with a few white elements swimming behind. It\u2019s like a vision of nature sleepwalking, or veiled in mourning, or seen through a thick smoke haze.\nBy the time it was painted, Gorky\u2019s paradise had been lost again. In January 1946, his Connecticut studio caught fire, destroying more than two dozen paintings and many drawings and books. In February, he learned he had rectal cancer and underwent debilitating surgery. He spent a recuperative working summer on the Virginia farm, then in 1947 moved permanently with his family \u2014 he had two daughters by then \u2014 to Connecticut.\nA little before this, the Museum of Modern Art, which had acquired one of his paintings, asked Gorky, along with several other artists, to speculate on what single factor in their past had done most to shape their art. Without hesitation Quote: : \u201cThe fact that I was taken away from my little village when I was five years old yet all my vital memories are of these first years. These were the days when I smelled the bread, I saw my first red poppy, the moon, the innocent seeing.\u201d\nThat kind of seeing \u2014 the old, original bliss \u2014 proved irrecoverable, as calamity continued to hammer Gorky down. In June 1948, in a car crash, he broke his back and lost use of his painting arm. Shortly afterward, his wife moved out with the children. In July, wrecked and unhinged, he hanged himself in his barn, after writing the words \u201cGood-bye, my loveds\u201d in chalk on a crate.\nThis farewell, among the saddest monuments in 20th century art, is well known; it\u2019s part of why Gorky is treasured. Less familiar, I suspect, is what preceded it, the great surge of love for life, present and past, that is concentrated in his late art and that tingles with burning belief through this show.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arshile gorky", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "andr\u00e9 masson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "c\u00e9zanne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "picasso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joan mir\u00f3", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roberto matta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "genevieve hanson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samuel palmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agnes magruder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson pollock", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york times continue", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "arshile gorky landscapes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hauser & wirth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "museum of modern art", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arshile gorky foundation/artists rights society", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:31.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ffe08a03c04c8efc8ac1b0013e0e06645a6ca2af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9ZUgRWvzdToU8rZO7tsUCdbzhBIewGahBds4VmGCZjZ6nWYp5z8QHu_CSdTPOyzj51.tqW_V7SfD.oHVaZLI0X", "site_full": "www.cmsenergy.com", "site": "cmsenergy.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["web_design_html", "financial_news", "tech", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "CMS Energy Corporation - Newsroom - Leadership - Officers", "title_full": "CMS Energy Corporation - Newsroom - Leadership - Officers", "published": "2017-12-06T07:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.196, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ffe08a03c04c8efc8ac1b0013e0e06645a6ca2af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9ZUgRWvzdToU8rZO7tsUCdbzhBIewGahBds4VmGCZjZ6nWYp5z8QHu_CSdTPOyzj51.tqW_V7SfD.oHVaZLI0X", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T07:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "CMS Energy Corporation - Newsroom - Leadership - Officers", "text": "Careers \nDisclaimer \nPlease note that you are now entering a website directly or indirectly maintained by a third party (the \"External Site\") and that you do so at your own risk. \nCMS Energy, Corp.

happen.\" So a Creator has to be the answer to that. Who was the Creator? Christians believe that Jesus gave us the answer. Who is more credible as the One to worship than Jesus? Consider the founders of the major world religions and none has proof of divinity\nexcept Jesus. What is that proof? The witnesses to His miracles and to His death and resurrection - the apostles. They were all killed for preaching the gospel\nexcept for John, who died a natural death. Twelve men who left everything behind to follow Jesus, were taught by Him, suffered greatly in most cases. They would not have done this to perpetuate a lie if Jesus was a fake. Jesus was a real person, God Himself who took the form of a human being to come to earth and reveal Who and What God was like because He was God.\nThis is being said to give you hope; there is a time to be born and a time to die, but death is not the end. When you were created by God you were given a soul which is immortal - you will live forever. The question is where\nwill your soul (you) live in eternity. Jesus explained all this during His time on earth and laid out the path to spending eternity in Heaven or Hell. And we were given the power to choose for ourselves which path we wanted to take. Choose Jesus - choose eternal life in Heaven. Deny Jesus - choose eternal separation from God and the punishment that comes with it.\nI don't know if you were posing a serious question with your post. My answer will predictably bring forth a deluge of derisive comments but don't let that deter you from finding an answer to your question. Your answer is in the Bible. Seek and you will find. Knock and the door will be opened to you. Seriously, your eternal future is at stake - and you have to make your decision in this life. Choose wisely and you will find the peace you seek.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:31.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c7b833d4c041c076494df0b1ffa25e402074286", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9ZUgRWvzdToU8rZO7tsUCdz_mWRu11Jpi8O4IhqYzcp.OMPBGSSZN1EKUgA.w1swg97gz0FXIGZ6CzY4ZcajDwJKdg9yE_6jYFvqdkanCvFA--", "site_full": "www.cmsenergy.com", "site": "cmsenergy.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["web_design_html", "financial_news", "tech", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "CMS Energy Corporation - About CMS Energy - CMS Enterprises - Development", "title_full": "CMS Energy Corporation - About CMS Energy - CMS Enterprises - Development", "published": "2017-12-06T07:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.184, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4c7b833d4c041c076494df0b1ffa25e402074286", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9ZUgRWvzdToU8rZO7tsUCdz_mWRu11Jpi8O4IhqYzcp.OMPBGSSZN1EKUgA.w1swg97gz0FXIGZ6CzY4ZcajDwJKdg9yE_6jYFvqdkanCvFA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T07:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "CMS Energy Corporation - About CMS Energy - CMS Enterprises - Development", "text": "Careers \nDisclaimer \nPlease note that you are now entering a website directly or indirectly maintained by a third party (the \"External Site\") and that you do so at your own risk. \nCMS Energy, Corp.

The waiver and release specifically includes, without limitation, any and all rights and claims pertaining to the processing of personal data, including but not limited to any rights under any applicable data protection statute(s). If in any jurisdiction, any part of this disclaimer is held to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such part of this disclaimer shall be restricted or eliminated to the minimum extent and the remaining disclaimer shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. \nPlease note the information presented is deemed representative at the time of its original release. Changes in historical information may occur due to adjustments in accounting and reporting standards & procedures. \nNon-GAAP Information \nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, CMS may also disclose certain non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results of operations, including net income, earnings per share, and operating income that make certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are outlined in the schedules included in this website. CMS provides historical financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company\u2019s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company\u2019s reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. \nCMS and Virtua also take no responsibility for third party pricing data provided for informational purposes and certain ratio results formulated from the provided third party pricing data. The non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information used by other companies. The non-GAAP information should be considered supplemental information to assist in fully understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. \nA reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included as a separate link and also posted on the CMS website at www.cmsenergy.com .

There is significant public interest in us investigating Momentum to establish the facts in this matter and whether there have been any offences. \n\u201cOnce complete, the Commission will decide whether any breaches have occurred and, if so, what further action may be appropriate, in line with its enforcement policy.\u201d \nMore to follow...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "getty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "catherine neilan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jeremy corbyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob posner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "electoral commission", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "city a.m. follow catherine source", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ppera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:31.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a82c0921cc4d6e35a86bd2c5bc3e1362a5003dfa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBIkaKYD1onvANo2kBZXAKoCKWFS_.RJChyeX4hMVkkelWUwdGZC9yxHKv2oyvhg1LOX9GZMc3CcN2", "site_full": "www.lse.co.uk", "site": "lse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.lse.co.uk/shareChat.asp?view=thread&ShareTicker=YOLO", "site_categories": ["united_kingdom", "travel", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yolo Leisure Share Chat - Chat About YOLO Shares - Stock Quotes, Charts, Trade History, Share Chat, Financial Terms Glossary ", "title": "Yolo Leisure Share Chat - Chat About YOLO Shares - Stock Quotes, Charts, Trade History, Share Chat, Financial Terms Glossary", "title_full": "Yolo Leisure Share Chat - Chat About YOLO Shares - Stock Quotes, Charts, Trade History, Share Chat, Financial Terms Glossary", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.094, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 22289, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a82c0921cc4d6e35a86bd2c5bc3e1362a5003dfa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBIkaKYD1onvANo2kBZXAKoCKWFS_.RJChyeX4hMVkkelWUwdGZC9yxHKv2oyvhg1LOX9GZMc3CcN2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Doublingup", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "Yolo Leisure Share Chat - Chat About YOLO Shares - Stock Quotes, Charts, Trade History, Share Chat, Financial Terms Glossary", "text": "https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/08/17/electric_jukebox_rebrands_to_roxi_seeks_ipo/\nThis article made me chuckle - Electric juke box has a dildo and wants \u00a3100m", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/08/17/electric_jukebox_rebrands_to_roxi_seeks_ipo/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:31.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7997b29db3d8fb8e44da853f5f5aa74fc7d1962d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ3xc1PyokiRSfjSO9lUKxlUIIgL1aVow9YYKdlvV3G8hpPMimW6wdzD4-", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/o-t-lounge/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "O-T Lounge | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "How do you cope? 4", "title_full": "How do you cope? | Page 4 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T06:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7997b29db3d8fb8e44da853f5f5aa74fc7d1962d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ3xc1PyokiRSfjSO9lUKxlUIIgL1aVow9YYKdlvV3G8hpPMimW6wdzD4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Roman Candle Tag", "published": "2017-12-07T06:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "How do you cope? 4", "text": "Quote: :\nLife is suffering.

I\u2019ll freely admit that, given where I\u2019m at this week, it\u2019s either a few \u201cFast Five\u201d posts or the blog going dark for a week or two. I hope you\u2019ll agree that \u201cFast Five\u201d is the preferable option. \nToday\u2019s post features some of my favorite action shots from 1975 Topps Football, the only football set I\u2019ve ever completed. \nAlthough this is Greg Pruitt\u2019s card, the Steelers\u2019\u201cMean Joe\u201d Greene is the one who catches your eye. \nThe quarterback that Bill Stanfill is about to staple to the turf is the Bills\u2019 Joe Ferguson. \nThis photo is probably from the same Dolphins-Bills game as the Bill Stanfill card. Assuming it\u2019s from 1974 and in Buffalo, then the game was on September 22 and the Dolphins won 24-16\u2026. and that\u2019s Larry Csonka (#39) watching on the sidelines. \nLawrence McCutcheon tries to evade the Redskins\u2019 Chris Hanburger. \nThis last card has me mildly intrigued\u2026 #25 would seem to be the Colts\u2019 Ray Oldham\u2026 but Oldham was a defensive back and Zabel was a linebacker. So why would they be on the field at the same time? \nGuesses: 1) Special teams? 2) The photo\u2019s old enough that #25 was somebody other than Oldham 3) The photo\u2019s old enough that it shows Zabel as a tight end, which he was in his 1970 rookie season (but the Eagles jersey doesn\u2019t seem to match what they were wearing in 1970). \nFor what it\u2019s worth, the Colts did play in Philly in 1974; September 29th and the Eagles won 30-10.
