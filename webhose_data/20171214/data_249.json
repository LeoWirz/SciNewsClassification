Would you rather have 40% uptime on a 15% damage buff, or MG's 25% dot damage buff? Even factoring in that Haunt has a front loaded nuke (500% of spell damage) and the % modifier also affects Drain Soul, it's still not worth it.\nHaunt has less variance and is more forgiving of mistakes. I will risk a 2% difference in performance to play something that feels more versatile to me. I like that I can adapt to hectic add high movement boss fights, council fights, and still do decent enough single target dps.

We at POPSUGAR have got the test you need to try. The challenge? Can you do 50 burpees in five minutes? Related \nIt sounds like a lofty goal, but with a little guidance from Sarah Chadwell , NASM Certified Personal Trainer, combined with your grit, you can smash this challenge, too. Let's get started! Burpees: A Love-Hate Relationship \nBurpees! Did you shudder? Usually just the thought of them makes even the fittest people feel at least a little sick because this is one move that is renowned for being brutal. But you can't knock the results they bring! ADVERTISEMENT \n\"Burpees are a physically demanding exercise because they tax almost every muscle in your body. Just one repetition includes a squat, a plank, a push-up, a hip thrust, a forward jump, and a vertical jump,\" said Chadwell. Related Painfully Funny Quotes About Burpees \nAll of these movements mean that one burpee hits your quads, glutes, hamstrings, hip flexors, calves, chest, shoulders, triceps, and even your abs! Plus, burpees test your cardiovascular and muscular endurance. If you thought it was the worst exercise before, think again. They're actually the perfect exercise to get fit or in this case, to show off just how fit you will become in the next 25 days. Preparation to Complete 50 Burpees in 5 Minutes \nSo, how do you get to the point where you can do 50 burpees in five minutes? The answer isn't just doing burpees. In fact, you'll need to build up your cardio and muscular endurance in many ways beyond what this one exercise can do. Ahead is Chadwell's custom 25-day plan that will help you build up your total-body power and endurance. \nThe exercises you'll be doing for the next 25 days are squats, froggies, planks, burpees, and a fair amount of cardio. Here are Chadwell's tips on how to breeze through these moves on your way to 50 burpess in 5 minutes. How to do a bodyweight squat: Stand with your head facing forward and your chest held up and out. Place your feet shoulder-width apart. Extend your hands straight out in front of you to help keep your balance. You can also bend the elbows or clasp the fingers gently behind your neck. Sit back and down like you're sitting into an imaginary chair. Keep your head facing forward as your upper body bends forward a bit. Rather than allowing your back to round, let your lower back arch slightly as you descend. Lower down so your thighs are as parallel to the floor as possible, with your knees over your ankles. Press your weight back into your heels. Keep your body tight, and push through your heels to bring yourself back to the starting position. This counts as one rep. How to do a frogger: Begin in a plank position. Jump your feet to the outside of your hands, coming into a deep squat and keeping your hands on the floor. Jump your feet back to a plank to complete one rep. How to do a plank: Balance on your hands and toes with your body in one straight line, hands underneath the shoulders, and feet hip-distance apart. \nAnd of course \u2013 burpees: Lower into a crouching squat with your hands on the floor. Do a squat thrust by jumping your feet back into a plank position. Do one basic push-up, bending the elbows and then straightening back to plank. Jump the feet forward to the hands, and come into a squat. Do an explosive jump straight up, getting as much height as you can. Putting the Plan Into Action \nHere is the 50 burpees in five minutes workout plan. On your 25 th day of this journey, record some video evidence, upload it, and tag us @popsugarfitness to let the world watch you take and beat the challenge!

I wanted to read another opinion with some maths if possible.\nThe only way anyone is going to find the math on it is by doing it themselves, because when I looked through Simulationcraft at the actions list priorities. . . well it has more than a few times where it was utilizing time in the sample sequence on suboptimal spells during the Haunt uptime.\nWhile I could create a sequence in a few days of hard study and work on simcraft to learn and develop the necessary skill set to alter the action list priorities. . . I really just do not feel the need to.\nIn short, try it for yourself, compare it to the other builds, see which feels better and works better for you. Just be sure to optimize your gameplay for Haunt if you are going to use it. Also, on Hectic Add Cleave situations Haunt build was simming out higher even with the poor action list priority (due to less time to drain soul and utilize MG).\nJust one of those things that are good to know. Keep in mind, this is all done with my gear set, so numbers can vary greatly. Mastery is also scaling out lower for me than Haste is right now, and Drain Soul damage wasn't critting appropriately. . .

December 2017 \nSadisdorf tin-lithium project hosts an inferred resource of 25 Mt grading 0.45 % Li2O \nMannheim/Leipzig/Perth. The Joint Venture of Tin International AG and Lithium Australia NL reports today, that a maiden lithium Mineral Resource estimate has been completed for the Sadisdorf tin-lithium project, located in Saxony, Germany. The project is managed through Lithium Australia NL (ASX: LIT), a Perth-based lithium explorer and processing technology developer, who can earn up to 50 % of the project by spending a total of EUR 2 million on exploration. \nThe industry renowned consultancy firm CSA Global has estimated a JORC (2012) compliant inferred Mineral Resource of 25 million tonnes grading 0.45 % Li2O (0.15 % Li cutoff), based on re-analysis and re-interpretation of historical drilling and underground sampling at Sadisdorf. \nThis result substantially enhances the potential for progressing the historical Sadisdorf tin mine to a polymetallic deposit with value contributions from lithium, tin and tungsten, as well as potentially from a range of by-products such as potassium sulphate fertilizer and sodium silicate. With SiLeach\u00ae, Lithium Australia has developed an innovative hydrometallurgical technology which is able to produce such by-products and thereby unlock the full resource potential of the deposit. \nPreliminary SiLeach\u00ae testwork on the Sadisdorf outer greisen material returned encouraging results, with lithium leach extractions of zinnwaldite concentrates averaging 95 %. \nThis maiden lithium Mineral Resource estimate of the Sadisdorf project is in addition to the already existing JORC (2012) compliant tin Mineral Resource of 3.36 million tonnes grading 0.44 % Sn (0.25% Sn cutoff) whereby the modelled lithium and tin Mineral Resource estimates partially overlap. \nAdrian Griffin, Managing Director of Lithium Australia commented: 'Our previous testing demonstrates, that SiLeach\u00ae can unlock the potential of Sadisdorf as a true polymetallic operation, recovering lithium from the residues of conventional tin concentration processes. The size of the Sadisdorf resource is already significant, with the potential to feed a 25,000 tonnes per annum lithium carbonate plant for 10 years. Further exploration is likely to expand the resource significantly. It is noteworthy that Sadisdorf has similar grades to those of the nearby Cinovec deposit (Czech Republic) and is not far from the Zinnwald deposit of Deutsche Lithium GmbH. All of these deposits have similar characteristics, making them difficult, if not impossible, to commercialize using conventional lithium processing technology - SiLeach\u00ae provides the solution.' \nMannheim, 7 December 2017 \nDOWNLOAD PRESS RELEASE \nDeutsche Rohstoff identifies, develops and divests attractive resource projects in North America, Australia and Europe. The focus is on the development of oil and gas opportunities within the United States. Metals, such as gold, copper, rare earth elements, tungsten and tin complete our portfolio.

Talking to media after Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) proceedings, Khan deplored the ATC proceedings against him while stating that Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leaders view every peaceful protest against government as a terror act. Extending his support to Tahirul Qadri, the PTI chief invoked Model Town incident report findings to discriminate peaceful protests and terror acts. \u201cWe will join Qadri, if he takes to road to seek justice,\u201d Khan underlined. Moreover, the PTI chairman condemned US President Donald Trump\u2019s move of recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. \u201cFirst the Palestinians were deprived of their lands and now moving Israel\u2019s capital city to Jerusalem is deplorable,\u201d he added. Earlier today, Khan appeared before an ATC in cases pertaining to attack on State TV building, the parliament, and Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Asmatullah Junejo. It was his third appearance before the court in four cases. At the outset of court proceedings today, the investigation officer informed ATC Judge Shahrukh Ajrumand that Khan has joined investigation with police and extended full cooperation, hence he is no longer an absconder. He also submitted a report to the court. The anti-terrorism court then adjourned the hearing till December 11. Terrorism charges against political cousins The cases against two \u2018political cousins\u2019, Imran Khan and Tahirul Qadri, were registered back in 2014 during the sit-in staged by them in Islamabad. The two leaders held protests against alleged \u2018rigging\u2019 in the General Elections 2013. Earlier, the ATC approved the PTI chairman\u2019s bail for Rs 200,000 in each case after Imran Khan surrendered himself before the court last month. The court had then also ordered Imran Khan to cooperate with the investigation officers and get his statement documented with police.

But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n\u2014 Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n\u2014 Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n\u2014 Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vickie rose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan witters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kavita patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "witters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt salo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "medicaid", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "national association of medicaid directors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mid-delta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuttgart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ark.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clarendon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:10.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b635b755dfd6cc687a6da8e3d0e3fbd9cd049fe2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8XsydDXdnTYkHeDJPvgGMm5FT0GV0iddrFquSBHCkwXzN1YK1NY7oD", "site_full": "www.eurogamer.net", "site": "eurogamer.net", "site_section": "http://www.eurogamer.net/forum", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Forum \u2022 Eurogamer.net", "title": "Checkerboard rendering Gaming", "title_full": "Checkerboard rendering \u2022 Gaming \u2022 Eurogamer.net", "published": "2017-12-07T10:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5237, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "48c424557cd3a5469b74618883110a9173555225", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8XsydDXdnTYkHeDJPvgGMm5FT0GV0iddrFquSBHCkwX.vnAd5x0Qzw0yW3kc.egpi19U8vEkQh8Q--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "superdelphinus", "published": "2017-12-07T10:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3fterm=Google+Spaz&amp=true", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3fterm=Google+Spaz&amp=true"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:10.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5581ee984d341a85a023fa15f7892b0dc9a7af7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQApyRnPnOVUs6yz46Q04Go10834tJiqHfdwf4VoOa1uA--", "site_full": "vk.com", "site": "vk.com", "site_section": "https://vk.com/elina_nails_ufaa", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Elina Amineva", "title": "Elina Amineva", "title_full": "Elina Amineva", "published": "2017-12-04T12:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "RU", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5581ee984d341a85a023fa15f7892b0dc9a7af7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQApyRnPnOVUs6yz46Q04Go10834tJiqHfdwf4VoOa1uA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Elina Amineva", "published": "2017-12-04T12:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "Elina Amineva", "text": "Elina Amineva", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:10.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ff146b0f9848844822a2a0f934298e920c2ab758", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvi5VG1L8PWoe2l0cFmBm9JVB_mpPQrmiwELm_HnDY5Z1gTfvqScVfyIfxOBhM3UavIZX9Afs5BeTP7Luv50R0ceaT4kj.M6Yfjy4QfnpPvdyaQXdl5f7G5PlEeTLSI20b3u1jpWCMkT5nGCtzxDlzv6WOJ3VmMJ_cGQZBW6NWFNfseKj_ZmpLge7kCoDrqInXbghpOYMfNfA-", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news -

This covers commercial, industrial, agricultural, district heating, public sector and other non-domestic businesses and sectors (in the non-emissions trading sector). \nMinister Naughten said: 'The Support Scheme for Renewable Heat is a tangible and viable measure that will kick-start the biomass and biogas sectors. Crucially it will provide the basis to create new commercial opportunities for farmers in heat technologies including biomass boiler installations and new opportunities for foresters. It will also contribute to meeting Ireland's 2020 renewable energy and emission reduction targets'. \nUnder the 2009 Renewable Energy Directive, Ireland has a target of 12% of energy consumed in the heat sector to come from renewable energy sources by 2020. Currently 6.8% of energy consumed in the heat sector in renewable. \nBudget 2018 allocated \u20ac7 million to fund the initial phase of the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat next year. \nThe Scheme is designed to ensure that air quality impacts will be addressed to support sustainable biomass use in installations, using best available technology and emission abatement. \nThe development of the Support Scheme involved detailed economic analysis, extensive engagement with industry and the publication of two public consultations on the design and implementation of the scheme. \n'My Department received almost 200 submissions from the public and the final design of the scheme incorporates the findings from these submissions,' added Minister Naughten. \nThe Support Scheme for Renewable Heat will consist of two types of support mechanism : \no An on-going operational support (paid for a period up to 15 years) for new installations or installations that currently use a fossil fuel heating system and convert to using biomass heating systems or anaerobic digestion heating systems \no A grant (of up to 30%) to support investment in renewable heating systems that use heat pumps. \nThe maximum tariffs paid will be 5.66 cents per kilowatt hour of energy produced from biomass heating systems and 2.95 cents per kilowatt hour of energy produced from anaerobic digestion heating systems. The tariffs paid will reduce with increasing output reflecting the economy of scale associated with larger systems. \nThe Minister added: ' The economic analysis shows that biomass and anaerobic digestion have a significant role to play in Ireland's renewable energy future.' \nOther technologies and methods of support are under consideration, including biomethane grid injection, for subsequent phases of the Scheme. \nThe Minister noted: ' The production of biomethane from anaerobic digestion and its injection into the natural gas grid has significant potential in Ireland. In addition to being a source of renewable energy, it can also provide an outlet for farm wastes. My Department continues to examine how best to support biomethane production and, as part of this work, we will be holding a workshop with industry early in the new year. ' \nHighlighting the budgetary control measures in place, Minister Naughten added: 'The lessons learned from schemes in other jurisdictions have been included in the design of this support scheme. In particular, there are eligibility criteria that projects must conform to over the period of support payments. These criteria will ensure that heat generated under the Scheme is applied to useful purposes only. In addition, there are a number of budgetary controls in order to control overall costs including project budget caps, a Scheme budget cap and periodic reviews to prevent windfall gains.' \nThe Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) will administer the Scheme and develop the detailed Terms and Conditions, including eligibility and sustainability criteria and these must be approved by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. \nMinister Naughten concluded: 'Securing Cabinet approval this week was a key milestone in order to move to the next stage of the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat which will provide an opportunity for growth in the domestic biomass sector. ' \nEnds. \nNotes for Editors \nThe proposed tariffs for the Scheme are: \nTier Lower Limit (MWh/yr) Upper Limit (MWh/yr) Biomass Heating Systems \nTariff (c/kWh) \nAnaerobic Digestion Heating Systems (c/kWh) 1 0 300 5.66 2.95 2 300 1,000 3.02 2.95 3 1,000 2,400 0.50 0.50 4 2,400 10,000 0.50 0.00 5 10,000 50,000 0.37 0.00 6 50,000 N/A 0.00 0.00 The need for a renewable heat incentive is set out in the National Mitigation Plan, the Energy White Paper and the Programme for Government. The primary objective of the scheme is to increase the level of renewable energy in the heat sector. This will contribute to meeting Ireland's 2020 renewable energy targets and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \nThe scheme is aimed at supporting larger industrial and commercial installations outside of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. Budget 2018 allocated \u20ac7 million to fund the initial phase of the scheme. State Aid clearance from the European Commission will be required before the scheme can commence operation. \nWhy introduce a renewable heat incentive? \nUnder the 2009 Renewable Energy Directive, Ireland has a target of 16% of gross final energy consumption to come from renewable sources in 2020 with sub-targets for the electricity (40%), transport (10%) and heat (12%) sectors. In 2016, Ireland had reached a level of 6.8% (with a target of 12%) in the heat sector. The Government has introduced a range of measures across the electricity and transport sectors to help meet our targets, and a renewable heat incentive will expand this suite of support measures into the heating sector. The scheme will support the adoption of renewable heating systems by commercial, industrial, agricultural, district heating, public sector and other non-domestic heat users not covered by the emissions trading system. \nHow does this support scheme differ from other countries? \nThe lessons learned from similar schemes in other jurisdictions have been integrated into the design of this support scheme, as set out in the Scheme Overview (attached) \nIn particular, there are eligibility criteria that projects must continue to conform to over the period of support payments (of up to a maximum of 15 years). These criteria will ensure that heat generated is applied to useful purposes only. \nIn addition, there are a number of budget management mechanisms - including project budget caps, a scheme budget cap and periodic reviews to prevent windfall gains. \nWhat will be supported under the Support Scheme? \nBased on the economic analysis carried out, the scheme will support projects through one of the following support mechanisms: \n\u00b7 An on-going operational support (paid for a period up to 15 years) based on useable heat output in renewable heating systems in new installations or installations that currently use a fossil fuel heating system and convert to using the following technologies: \no Biomass heating systems; \no Anaerobic digestion heating systems. \n\u00b7 A grant (of up to 30%) to support investment in renewable heating systems that use the following technologies: \no Air source heat pumps; \no Ground source heat pumps; and \no Water source heat pumps. \nOther technologies and methods of support continue to be under consideration (including biomethane grid injection) for subsequent phases of the scheme. \nHow will the payment system for operational support work? \nThis support consists of a multi-annual payment (for a period of up to 15 years) on the basis of prescribed tariffs. The maximum tariffs paid will be 5.66 cents per kilowatt hour of energy produced from biomass heating systems and 2.95 cents per kilowatt hour of energy produced from anaerobic digestion heating systems. The tariffs paid will reduce with increasing output reflecting the economy of scale associated with larger systems. The tariffs are detailed in the Scheme Overview. \nEach tariff will set the amount of support that the Scheme participant will receive in respect of each unit of heat energy used for an eligible purpose. The tariff level for a particular project will generally be fixed for the period of support. Tariff levels will not be linked to indexation. However, adjustments may be applied to prevent windfall gains. \nThe payment under the Support Scheme will be tieredbased on the annual heat output (on a per kWh basis). \nThe participant will receive a payment according to the tariff (c/kWh) for Tier 1 up to the first threshold value; heat output greater than that threshold will be paid at a lower tariff level up to the Tier 2 threshold, and so on for higher Tiers. Since the cost of generating renewable heat typically falls with increasing installation size, the tariff will reduce from one Tier to the next. Therefore, the more renewable heat produced the less the applicant will get paid per unit output. \nWhat is covered by the installation grant? \nThe installation grant will support up to 30% of the cost of heat pumps (air source, ground source or water source). \nWho will administer the support scheme? \nThe Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) will administer the scheme and will be responsible for its operation, including evaluating and processing applications. The SEAI will also develop the draft Terms & Conditions of the Scheme for review with approval by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. \nWhen will the Scheme commence operation? \nThe next steps will be to develop the Terms & Conditions and seek European Commission State Aid approval. Subject to this approval, it is expected that the scheme will commence operation in 2018. \nENDS \nSupport Scheme for Renewable Heat Overview \nDepartment of Communications, Climate Action and

In a promotional video posted by Colors channel on Twitter, it can be seen that first Luv and Priyank are arguing with each other, then Priyank tells Luv that after last night, they are no more friends and a little later, Luv is seen in a very angry mood as Priyank has talked to him in an abusive language. Luv asks Priyank not to abuse while the latter challenged the former to do whatever he can. Hina Khan tried to pacify them but nothing helped and it seems as if the friendship of Luv and Priyank is on stake. \n\nSource Watch The Video: . @ipriyanksharmaa  and Luv Tyagi have a difference of opinion!

Sitting in a zone known as the ETP, or the Eastern Tropical Zone, approximately 1,100km south of the tip of the Baja Peninsula, on the west coast of Mexico, the uninhabited atoll\u2019s nearest neighbor is 945km away. Clipperton and its unique ecosystem are under threat from illegal commercial fishing and pollution. Its once pristine waters are a critical migration corridor for a number of threatened species of pelagic sharks. Following on from their sponsorship of The Clipperton Expedition, which was announced earlier this year, ORIS has launched the Oris Clipperton Limited Edition, a diver\u2019s watch based on thr Aquis diver\u2019s series. In tribute to the atoll and the work of Michel Labrecque and Julie Ouimet, the Cliperton LE has a gradient blue dial designed to reflect the color of the water around the atoll, which drops to 60 meters deep just offshore. Its 43.5mm multi-piece Stainless steel case, however is water-resistant to 300 meters and has a screwed case back embossed with an outline of Clipperton Island and its coordinates. Oris Clipperton is a registered trade mark. Additional diver\u2019s features include: a screw-down crown with integrated guard, a Sapphire crystal domed on both sides with anti-reflective coating inside and a unidirectional rotational divers bezel with black ceramic insert with 60-minute timer and zero marker filled with SuperLumiNova. The Clipperton LE is powered by an automatic movement, the Oris Cal. 733, which based on Sellita SW 200-1, with date at 6 o\u2019clock and a sweep-seconds indicator, which Oris has finished with a lollipop filled with luminescent SuperLumiNova. The Clipperton comes on either a black rubber divers strap with Oris-developed safety anchor and quick-adjust, sliding-sledge folding clasp with extension or on a Stainless steel bracelet with a quick-adjust, sliding-sledge folding clasp with a diver\u2019s extension. The Oris Clipperton Limited Edition\u2019s comes in a special presentation box made using environmentally friendly regenerative algae. Inside it has a Clipperton Island insignia.

The Getty Center lies shrouded in smoke as seen from Casiano Road in the Bel Air district of Los Angeles after the Skirball wildfire swept through, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017. \nBy AMANDA LEE MYERS and ANDREW DALTONAssociated Press \nVENTURA, Calif. (AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

Rough diamond sales by value amounted to USD 325.8 million, polished diamond sales - USD 8.4 million. \nIn January-November 2017, ALROSA's rough and polished diamond sales amounted to USD 4.029 billion. Rough diamonds were sold for USD 3.942 billion, polished diamonds - for USD 87.4 million. \n'Sales in November were consistent with our expectations. The core sales markets displayed strong demand for rough diamonds. The significant sales growth in monetary terms against last November (+36%) is due, in part, to the low base effect. As a result of the currency reform in India late last year, the demand for rough diamonds from small and middle-sized cutting and polishing companies in this country was temporarily reduced,' ALROSA Vice President Yury Okoemov commented on the sales in November. \nThis page was last updated on 07 December 2017 at 12.00 \nALROSA PJSC published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:06:03 UTC . \nOriginal document http://eng.alrosa.ru/alrosa-sells-rough-and-polished-diamonds-worth-usd-334-2-million-in-november/ \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/60A2551252ACBC58F84AA0CA914288E134460952", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yury okoemov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "alrosa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alrosa group", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alrosa pjsc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:13.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0eb3782f189f8c632b7c05ee7f34c640a56b217c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.JS7Q7yQa_w2JkwoE.D.O3g0xYCCOEV.te264NBp.iFCinhrrkPKyY28yBufWWPC8-", "site_full": "www.mustang6g.com", "site": "mustang6g.com", "site_section": "http://www.mustang6g.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=102", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Issues, Repairs, Warranty, TSB, Recalls - 2015+ S550 Mustang Forum (GT, GT350, GT500, Mach 1, Ecoboost) - Mustang6G.com", "title": "2018 Mustang GT vs 2017 911 GTS", "title_full": "2018 Mustang GT vs 2017 911 GTS - 2015+ S550 Mustang Forum (GT, GT350, GT500, Mach 1, Ecoboost) - Mustang6G.com", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bdd8631409b330c9153e2c361fc3c626b78f418c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.JS7Q7yQa_w2JkwoE.D.O3g0xYCCOEV.te264NBp.iFCinhrrkPKyY1ZrsYtQc5gnTK8pAJJgBOw--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Austinj427", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "If someone else is paying for it.

If you suffer from dyslexia then it becomes necessary to find a dyslexia therapist Michigan . Depending on the severity of the problem, the symptoms may vary as well. Its important to get an early diagnosis and treat this illness effectively otherwise it will lead to many other problems in the future.\n\nThere are situations where either, the diagnosis is not accurately made or the individual himself does not want to recognize that he is suffering from such an issue. Its not a wise decision to ignore your disability because if you ignore it, it means you are actually delaying your treatment and you need to resolve this problem in an efficient and effective manner.\n\nSome of the symptoms associated with dyslexia include difficulty in rhyming letters and recognizing them altogether. When a child reaches the age of seven or eight, he should be able to do these tasks without any difficulties but if they are actually struggling then there is some real issue and that needs to be dealt with in an effective manner.\n\nAnother problem that dyslexics face is that they find it pretty hard to copy anything from a book or a board. They find this task extremely difficult and stressful at the same time. Their writing pattern is very disorganized and its hard to make up what they have actually written. Besides writing, their other functional abilities are also very disorientated.\n\nTheir level of intelligence is sometimes superior as compared to other children of their age but when they speak out or write, they struggle to find the correct words. This makes them less confident about themselves and they tend to hide somewhere in the background because they do not want to be in the lime light anymore. They think their condition will never improve and they won't be able to lead a normal life as others do.\n\nIts very likely that the child no longer feels confident about his abilities and starts to loose his will power. Your child won't feel like going to school anymore and doesn't want to focus on his studies because he feels like he is not good enough. Its important that you do a proper diagnosis to find out what sort of disability your child is suffering from and what is its severity level.\n\nIts important that the diagnosis is done at an early age because if a child is diagnosed earlier, it becomes easy for him to get proper treatment at the right time. Although there is no cure that would lead to full recovery but the condition or the severity of the illness can be improved to make life a bit easier for that child. The child may require ongoing support throughout his learning life but it will benefit him in the long run.\n\nIt is a condition that would stay with you for your lifetime but with proper care and due attention you learn how to deal with it.
