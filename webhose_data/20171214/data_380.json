With the champagne flowing at Flagstaff Marine, Flagstaff's Graham Raspass says 'the award is recognition of the achievement of the design and production teams at Beneteau in collaboration with naval architects Berret Racoupeau Yacht Design and designers Nauta Design the competition. \n'With five other boats nominated, the competition was fierce but the jury of the Vela et Motore magazine voted the Oceanis 51.1 to be the best of the best...to the entire team we say congratulations, there is nothing quite like the excitement of winning a major international award\" The \"Barca Dell'Anno\" prize, was awarded to Beneteau at the gala night of the Genoa boat show in Italy, on Saturday 27 September 2017. \nA very clever collaboration The Oceanis 51.1 is the result of a stunning and clever collaboration between Berret Racoupeau, Nuata Design and Beneteau. It's no secret that with the entire first 12 months production pre-sold before the official launch, the Oceanis 51.1 is on track to be one of Beneteau's best selling yachts, and with the 51.1, Beneteau designers have honoured many much-loved Oceanis design features while setting new trends with a revolutionary new hull shape and sail plan. \nFlagstaff's Graham Rasmussen says 'The new Oceanis 51.1 is the first of the 7th generation of Oceanis yachts and marks the 30th anniversary of the line. The 51.1 is the first boat from Beneteau's gifted new head of design and production, Gianguido Girrotti who came on board with the intent and backing of Beneteau to make sure Beneteau remains the number 1 brand in the world.' 'There are three models available in the new 51.1; Smart-charter, Comfort- cruiser, and Performance- FIRST line. We knew from the outset the demand for this boat would be high and have already sold our first two boats into the Sydney market. Beneteau Oceanis 51.1 - photo \u00a9 Beneteau \nCustom-built perfection The customisation options on the 51.1 are endless. And because Beneteau are constantly pushing the boundaries to achieve sailing perfection, they have taken the idea of a 'custom made' yacht, and put it within reach, literally. With over 700 different configurations, the Smart, Comfort and Performance models can be built entirely around your sailing and comfort needs. \nQuality you expect from the world's best Beneteau continues to set the industry benchmark for quality and innovation. From architecture through to design, technology, process, production, materials, marketing, services and finances \u2013 not a single area escapes rigorous and meticulous attention to detail and quality assurance testing. Beneteau sailboats are also the most reliable and elegant production yachts on the water today. Beneteau integrate technology used on race winning boats across their entire range of yachts including the 51.1, for everyday sailors. Sail a Beneteau and you'll sail a high performing, award winning, robust boat made to sail any and every sea. \nMore awards on the horizon... Flagstaff are confident this is the first of many awards in the awards season. Sublime and impressive, the Oceanis 51.1 has also been nominated for 'Best Yacht of the Year in the 'Family Cruiser' Category (European Yacht Of The Year).

He hit two with 1:09 left to put Temple ahead 57-55, and two more to put it away with 4.6 seconds remaining as the Owls (5-2) won for the second time in four games. \n\nEthan Happ matched a season-high with 23 points, but was held scoreless over the final five minutes for the Badgers (4-6), who have dropped three of four. \n\nObi Enechionyia had 11 points, seven rebounds and four blocks, including two rejections of Happ inside over the final three minutes in Temple's home opener. \n\nAlston hit two free throws, the second his 50th straight to surpass Lynn Greer's record set in March 2001, to snap a tie. \n\nAfter an empty possession for each side, Wisconsin's Kobe King missed a straightaway 3-pointer before Alston finished it at the line. \n\nHapp hit 11 of 19 shots, and added six rebounds as the Badgers continued their difficult early-season schedule by winning their second straight game. Khalil Iverson added nine points and six rebounds. \n\nThe Owls, who entered 3-0 against Power 5 teams with victories over Auburn, Clemson and South Carolina, got two buckets from Quinton Rose in an 8-0 run to go ahead 47-41 with 10:47 left. \n\nHapp responded with three inside baskets in Wisconsin's ensuing 12-3 spurt. But Temple rallied to tie it with two minutes left after Enechionyia blocked Happ and Rose hit one free throw on the next possession. \n\nBIG PICTURE \n\nWisconsin: The Badgers are going through anything but a normal early season for a major conference school. They've already played four ranked teams, two Big Ten games and now have tripped up in a tough non-conference road game in Philadelphia. \n\nTemple: Only six Division I teams will play their first home game later than the Owls. They've maneuvered through a tough early schedule with four wins over Power 5 teams. Another big test awaits next week against No. 4 Villanova. \n\nVERSATILITY \n\nThe 6-foot-10 Happ showed his many skills when he grabbed a defensive rebound early in the second half, dribbled the length of the floor through traffic, stopped on the right baseline, then accelerated and finished a contested reverse layup. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shizz alston jr.", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "kobe king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enechionyia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khalil iverson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quinton rose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lynn greer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obi enechionyia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "happ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethan happ", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "temple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "villanova", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "badgers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "owls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "power", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clemson", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:19.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c33bb3f252666530d4c84a664d1d9c876fa0b4bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrersk20g92Ik50wchZ0ppzd2noApq11HTr93Ie3G5vVMAyUusyjeXo0kMPXAfV6xgqxEGHDLaJo3XGVO.1WW0U", "site_full": "texashuntingforum.com", "site": "texashuntingforum.com", "site_section": "http://texashuntingforum.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/forums/25/1/", "site_categories": ["hunting_shooting", "sports"], "section_title": "Open Hunting Discussion | Texas Hunting Forum", "title": "Lost deer lease stories.", "title_full": "Lost deer lease stories. | Open Hunting Discussion | Texas Hunting Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T08:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c33bb3f252666530d4c84a664d1d9c876fa0b4bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrersk20g92Ik50wchZ0ppzd2noApq11HTr93Ie3G5vVMAyUusyjeXo0kMPXAfV6xgqxEGHDLaJo3XGVO.1WW0U", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mickey Moose", "published": "2017-12-06T08:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "Lost deer lease stories.", "text": "Originally Posted By: Sneaky The whole lease thing is wearing me out.

That was 40.4 billion won (US$37.2 million) more than the government had initially requested. \u201cThis was the first time since 2011 that spending on national defense increased during the National Assembly\u2019s budget deliberations, and at 7.0%, the rate of increase in defense spending was the highest since 2009,\u201d the Ministry of Defense said in a statement released on Dec. 6. But since the total amount of the government\u2019s 2018 budget increased by 7.1% year on year, defense spending accounts for basically the same share of the government budget. For the most part, the extra funding that was allocated during deliberations in the National Assembly will go to improving the country\u2019s military capabilities, including the development of three key programs to respond to North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. Related programs included in the budget at the request of the National Assembly are the second phase of Patriot PAC-3 guided missiles (16.7 billion won; $15.3 million), a graphite bomb (also called a \u201cblackout bomb\u201d) R&D program (500 million won; $460,000) and a tactical surface-to-surface guided weapon program (400 million won; $368,000). Funds for strengthening the capability of the \u201cspecial mission brigade\u201d created on Dec. 1 to carry out \u201cdecapitation operations\u201d were also added to the budget during the National Assembly\u2019s deliberations. A total of 340 million won was allocated, including 300 million (US$276,000) for drones designed for special operations, 16 million won (US$150,000) for automatic grenade launchers and 5 million won (US$4,600) for a \u201csuicide drone\u201d that can self-destruct. The government\u2019s original budget had already allocated 6.5 billion won (US$5.98 million) for equipment for the special mission brigade, including through-the-wall radar and lightweight bulletproof vests. The National Assembly also got its way about earmarking 14.75 billion won ($US13.6 million) in the budget for acquiring MEDEVAC (medical evacuation) helicopters. This is apparently connected with problems with the military\u2019s medical system that came to light during a North Korean soldier\u2019s defection at Panmunjeom last month. In addition, 7.1 billion won (US$6.5 million) was added to the budget for safety equipment designed to prevent accidents at firing ranges. The monthly pay for soldiers doing their mandatory military service will go up 88%, from 216,000 won (US$200) this year to 405,700 won (US$373; calculated for the rank of sergeant), while the payment made for attending reserve training will go up from 10,000 (US$9.20) to 16,000 won (US$14.72). On the other hand, the number of noncommissioned officers will only be increased by 2,470, not 3,458 as the government had originally requested to make the military a more elite fighting force. This reduction was connected to a larger dispute between the ruling and opposition parties over a plan to increase the number of government employees.

Admirals and generals gather around him for photos. And he commands a prime sideline spot at Navy football games even while gruffly flaunting the military school\u2019s strict facial hair policy.\nBill\u2019s beard is long and thick.\nAnd like any BMOC worth his weight in mohair, he never goes anywhere without an entourage. His \u201cstaff\u201d is aptly called Team Bill.\nBill, of course, is a live Angora goat and the iconic mascot of the 172-year-old Naval Academy. And, yes, Bill the Goat is cared for at Navy football games by Team Bill \u2014 a small group of student handlers that includes a Latter-day Saint returned missionary, Midshipman Cathryn DeLong.\n(If you spot two goats on the sideline at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium, you\u2019re not seeing double.\nBill the Goat is actually plural. The current iterations of the Academy\u2019s animal mascots are Bill #36 and Bill #37. The goats are said to be full of spunk, energy and, of course, \u201cvitriol toward Army.\u201d)\nHead football coach Ken Niumatalolo may be the face of Navy football, but he\u2019s not the only Mormon at the Academy with a coveted job. Being a member of Team Bill, said DeLong, \u201cis actually pretty exciting \u2014 a lot of people want to be a part of it.\u201d\nDeLong and her fellow Mids\u2019 gameday duties are pretty straightforward: keep the Bills well hydrated; get them out of the sun if it gets too hot; and, of course, clean up after the goats do their business.\nTeam Bill also protects its thick-fleeced charges from the plebes (that\u2019s Navy-speak for freshman) who rush toward the end zone to do push-ups whenever Navy scores.\n\u201cThe plebes aren\u2019t thinking about watching out for the goats when they run out on the field, so we have to make sure the goats don\u2019t get run over,\u201d said DeLong.\nBeing part of Team Bill has been a welcome diversion for the State College, Pennsylvania, resident during her final year at the historic academy. In a few months she will graduate in operations research, be commissioned an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps and begin training to fly C-130 transport planes.\nA testimony of the restored gospel and its principles keeps the future Marine aviator well grounded. DeLong\u2019s studies at the Naval Academy were put on hold for two academic years while she served a mission in Russia. \u201cI enjoyed every second of my mission,\u201d she told the Church News . \u201cIt was hard work, but I loved it.\u201d\nDeLong will soon leave Annapolis with rich memories \u2014 including the many Saturday afternoons she spent caring for a couple of popular goats named Bill.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun being on the sidelines this season,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting being so close to the games.\u201d\nThe LDS Church News is an official publication of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

I can have a private life and have a public life, but when I choose to. And I think that's really important.\" \n\"There\u2019s a calmness, there\u2019s a stillness that I didn\u2019t have in the past,\" she added to U.S. TV show Extra. \"Life is moving good, it\u2019s fast but in a good calmer way.\" \nLindsay been hitting headlines in recent months due to claims that she's dating bodybuilder Je-yong Ha, also known as the \"Korean Hulk\". But the Mean Girls star denied the rumours, and insisted she's concentrating on herself before she worries about finding love again. \n\"I'm not in any relationship,\" she told ET. \"I don't think anyone could be in a relationship with me because I'm never there all the time.\" \nLindsay added to Extra: \"You can\u2019t look for love it just happens. I found love working with children now so that\u2019s my focus\u2026 It\u2019s better to just not be with anyone, love yourself more then maybe it will fall into place.\" \nThe actress was speaking as she attended the DailyMail.com holiday party in New York, after flying back to the U.S. to spend the festive season with her family.

Smith zoomed the rocket-powered Lockheed NF-104A to an unofficial world record altitude of 120,800 feet. This mark still stands as the highest altitude ever achieved by a United States aircraft from a runway take-off.\nA zoom maneuver is one in which aircraft kinetic energy (speed) is traded for potential energy (altitude). In doing so, an aircraft can soar well beyond its maximum steady, level altitude (service ceiling). The zoom maneuver has both military and civilian flight operations value.\nThe USAF/Lockheed NF-104A was designed to provide spaceflight-like training experience for test pilots attending the Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS) at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The type was a modification of the basic F-104A Starfighter aircraft. Three copies of the NF-104A were produced (S/N\u2019s 56-0756, 56-0760 and 56-0762). It was the ultimate zoom flight platform.\nIn addition to a stock General Electric J79-GE-3 turbojet, the NF-104A was powered by a Rocketdyne LR121-NA-1 rocket motor. The J79 generated 15,000 pounds of thrust in afterburner and burned JP-4. The LR-121 produced 6,000 pounds of thrust and burned a combination of JP-4 and 90% hydrogen peroxide. Rocket motor burn time was on the order of 90 seconds.\nThe NF-104A was kinematically capable of zooming to altitudes approaching 125,000 feet. As such, it was a combined aircraft, rocket, and spacecraft. The pilot had to blend aerodynamic and reaction controls in the low dynamic pressure environment near the zoom apex. He was also required to fly in a full pressure suit for survival at altitudes beyond the Armstrong Line.\nOn Friday, 06 December 1963, Bob Smith took-off from Edwards and headed west for the Pacific Ocean. Out over the sea, he changed heading by 180 degrees in preparation for the zoom run-in. At a point roughly 100 miles out, Smith then accelerated the NF-104A (S/N 56-0760) along a line that would take him just north of the base. Arriving at Mach 2.4 and 37,000 feet, Smith then initiated a 3.75-g pull to a 70-degree aircraft pitch angle. Turbojet and rocket were at full throttle.\nThings happened very quickly now. Smith brought the turbojet out of afterburner at 65,000 feet and then moved the throttle to the idle detent at 80,000 feet. The rocket motor burned-out around 90,000 feet. Smith controlled the aircraft (now spacecraft) over the top of the zoom using 3-axis reaction controls. The NF-104A\u2019s arcing parabolic trajectory subjected him to 73 seconds of weightlessness. Peak altitude achieved was 120,800 feet above mean sea level.\nOn the back side of the zoom profile, Bob Smith restarted the windmilling J79 turbojet and set-up for landing at Edwards. He touched down on the main runway and rolled out uneventfully. Total mission time from brake-release to wheels-stop was approximately 25 minutes.\nMuch more could be said about the NF-104A and its unique mission. Suffice it to say here that two of the aircraft ultimately went on to serve in the ARPS from 1968 to 1971. The only remaining aircraft today is 56-0760 which sits on a pole in front of the USAF Test Pilot School (TPS) at Edwards.\nBob Smith went on to make many other noteworthy contributions to aviation and his nation. Having flown the F-86 Sabre in Korea, he volunteered to fly combat in Viet Nam in his 40th year. Stationed at Korat AFB in Thailand, he commanded the 34th Fighter Squadron of the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing. Smith flew 100 combat missions in the fabled F-105D Thunderchief; many of which involved the infamous Pack VI route in North Viet Nam.\nBob Smith was a true American hero. Like so many of the airmen of his day, Smith was a man whose dedication, service, and courage went largely unnoticed and underappreciated by his fellow countrymen. Bob Smith\u2019s final flight came just 3 months shy of his 82nd birthday on Thursday, 19 August 2010.\nThe post Boom and Zoom appeared first on White Eagle Aerospace .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.whiteeagleaerospace.com/", "http://www.whiteeagleaerospace.com/boom-and-zoom/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert w. smith", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "bob smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edwards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "usaf", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "lockheed nf-104a", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "general electric", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "armstrong line", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aerospace research pilot school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korat afb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white eagle aerospace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "388th tactical fighter wing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "34th fighter squadron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rocketdyne", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "edwards air force base", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "viet nam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:22.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "181a3c6a334676a9592c8887acc1fb472285b489", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8v3BmVd24meuL1ei1Bo_4Wp0ZSkR.CSUYbWTJZC.Lac8KBkoQLBSDq9v1gqzGXIzqVmAEO.A4JEtK5E9Q1cjUUJjczFdQdesQUktlm0sLYTwOfyVhWKbKS8dqi1JytEJ4-", "site_full": "www.businessinsider.com", "site": "businessinsider.com", "site_section": "http://www.businessinsider.com/politics", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Politics - Business Insider", "title": "Philip Hammond blames low productivity on disabled workers", "title_full": "Philip Hammond blames low productivity on disabled workers - Business Insider", "published": "2017-12-07T12:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.048, "main_image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5a2908387101ad168a3a47fd-1190-625/philip-hammond-blames-low-productivity-on-disabled-workers.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 283, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "181a3c6a334676a9592c8887acc1fb472285b489", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8v3BmVd24meuL1ei1Bo_4Wp0ZSkR.CSUYbWTJZC.Lac8KBkoQLBSDq9v1gqzGXIzqVmAEO.A4JEtK5E9Q1cjUUJjczFdQdesQUktlm0sLYTwOfyVhWKbKS8dqi1JytEJ4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adam Becket", "published": "2017-12-07T12:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "Philip Hammond blames low productivity on disabled workers", "text": "Chancellor Philip Hammond in Downing Street Toby Melville/Reuters\nPhilip Hammond called \"ignorant\" after suggesting low productivity rates were because of more disabled people working.

Chancellor just linked low productivity growth to the labour market and specified the increased employment of disabled people.\n\"My experience of employing disabled people is that they are brilliant employees. The chancellor\u2019s comments are ignorant.\"\nBird said the remarks \"fundamentally undermine the Government\u2019s policy to get more disabled people into work, and the ambition set out by the Prime Minister just a week ago. The Chancellor must urgently withdraw them and offer a full apology.\"\nLabour productivity measured by output per hour fell 0.1% between March and June, according to ONS figures . The fall came despite more people being in work and working more hours.\nThe government aims to get one million more disabled people into work over the course of a 10-year plan, halving the difference between employment rates for disabled and non-disabled people, which stood at 32% in 2016.\nLabour's shadow disabilities minister Marsha de Cordova tweeted that it was \"shocking that Philip Hammond is trying to blame disabled people for low productivity!\n\"Disabled people contribute enormously and disability employment gap has barely changed since productivity started to stall.
