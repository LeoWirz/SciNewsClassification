This is an event for the whole Google Hardware division, though, so we should also see the launch of the Google Home Mini , a revision to the smartphone-powered Daydream VR goggles, and a new flagship Chromebook called the \" Google Pixelbook .\" \nThe Pixel 2 is expected to have the usual 2017 flagship smartphone specs, with a Snapdragon 835, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. The Pixel 2 XL is getting a slim-bezel front design reminiscent of the LG V30 (because the phone is manufactured for Google by LG), while the smaller Pixel 2 (manufactured by HTC) is expected to look a lot like last year's model. Both get a metal back with a glass window that looks like an evolution of last year's design , along with squeezable sides. The Pixel line is all about Google software, though, and this year we're hoping to see the debut of Google Lens , a visual search app along the lines of Google Goggles. \nJust as the Google Home was Google's answer to the Amazon Echo, the Google Home Mini is expected to be a Google version of an Amazon Echo Dot. It keeps all the smarts of a voice appliance while swapping the thumping speaker hardware for a smaller sound system designed less for music and more for voice output. The Google Home Mini is expected to be just $50, making it considerably cheaper to outfit a house with than the $129 Google Home. \nThe Pixelbook seems to be a new flagship Chromebook with a whopping $1,199 starting price. Chrome OS fansite ChromeUnboxed has been tracking the device under the codename \"Eve\" since 2016 , and the site has a great rundown here . The TL;DR is that the new laptop should have an Intel Kaby Lake chipset, a 12.3-inch 2400x1600 display, and storage that seems like crazy overkill for a Chromebook, with 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB options. The device represents a new generation of Chromebooks, with a lot of \"firsts\" for Chrome OS, like a $99 Wacom Active Electrostatic (AES) stylus (think Surface Pen or Apple Pencil), a fingerprint reader, and Google Assistant support with a hardware \"Assistant\" button. It also has a backlit keyboard and some kind of \"convertible form factor\" (a fold-back hinge?). \nThere might be some other surprises, like more Pixel Phone-specific software changes and maybe some Google headphones. \nNo matter what happens, we'll be there to cover everything live, and we'll go hands-on with all the new gadgets. Be sure to tune in for the liveblog! \nListing image by Droid Life Ron Amadeo Ron is the Reviews Editor at Ars Technica, where he specializes in Android OS and Google products.

Gitlin", "published": "2017-10-03T19:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "2017 Porsche Cayenne S E-Hybrid: not cheap but you get a lot for the money", "text": "Porsche might be known for sports cars like the 911, but today it makes its money selling SUVs. Four doors and voluminous cargo space may not be attributes we traditionally associated with the brand, but the Cayenne has proven it can hold its own in a segment that's extremely important to the car industry. The third-generation Cayenne is due before too long, but before it arrives on these shores, we thought we should take a look at the current model, in particular the 2017 Cayenne S E-Hybrid. Starting at just under $80,000, this plug-in hybrid is not cheap, but it turns out you do get a heck of a lot of vehicle for your money.\nPorsche probably owes its existence to the Cayenne. Adding an SUV to its line-up in 2002 opened the brand up to a far wider range of customers than its usual fare of mid- and rear-engined sports cars. And for all the wailing and gnashing of teeth by the purists, it's hard to dispute the model's success in the showroom. And because it doesn't have the same cult-like following as the nimble little sports cars, the company can use the platform for experiments, like a hybrid option.\nJust add electrons When the first hybrid Cayenne arrived in the US in 2010, it was a relatively tame example of electrification. Its nickel-metal hydride batteries were only rated for 1.7kWh, and its electric motor generated just 47hp (35kW). More recently, it got a significant upgrade. Under the hood is the same 333hp (248kW), 325ft-lb (441Nm) 3.0L supercharged direct-injection gasoline V6 engine borrowed from Audi, but now it gets much more help: the electric motor now provides 95hp (70kW) and 229ft-lbs (310Nm).\nUnderneath the cargo space in the rear, you'll find an even bigger improvement\u2014the Cayenne now sports 10.8kWh-worth of lithium-ion cells. That's sufficient for an EPA-estimated 14 miles (22.5km) of pure electric driving. Whether traveling on pure electricity or in hybrid mode, there's permanent all-wheel drive, for the electric motor is positioned between the engine and the eight-speed Tiptronic S transmission.\nBeing able to drive the Cayenne S E-Hybrid as a pure EV is great for short journeys, but we imagine the vast majority will spend their lives using engine and electric motor in harmony. (If you want an all-electric SUV your only option for now is the Tesla Model X.) In this mode, the hybrid Porsche can travel much farther\u2014range is quoted as 480 miles (772km), making this a good replacement for the diesel Cayenne that can't be sold in the US as a result of the VW emissions scandal.\nSome cars look good from every angle. That's probably not the case for the Cayenne, unfortunately. Jonathan Gitlin Acid green brake calipers and e-hybrid badges signify to the Porsche cognoscenti that this is a hybrid. Jonathan Gitlin The 333-hp supercharged V6 is borrowed from Audi. Jonathan Gitlin Our test Cayenne was the Platinum Edition, which costs $2,900 more than the regular Cayenne S E-Hybrid but is loaded down with goodies, including all the chocolate alcantara and leather you see here. Jonathan Gitlin If Tesla's button-free interiors are one end of a spectrum, the Cayenne interior is the opposite. Jonathan Gitlin These really are the most amazing front seats we've encountered all year. Jonathan Gitlin Riding in the back is no great hardship, though. Luggage space with the rear seats in use. Jonathan Gitlin If you don't need to worry about more than one passenger, you can fit a lot more stuff in a Cayenne. But take note: the rear seats do not fold completely flat. Jonathan Gitlin This has to be the most over-engineered cargo cover we've ever seen. Jonathan Gitlin Porsche has insisted on keeping the traditional five circular displays in front of the driver. To the left of the central speedometer is a multifunction display. Its size and shape works better when it's displaying your battery status than it does a map. Jonathan Gitlin The PCM infotainment system uses a 7-inch touchscreen. It's a Porsche UI on top of VW Group's MIB II platform, and that's no bad thing at all. Jonathan Gitlin The acid green hands on the clock keep the hybrid Cayenne on-message. Jonathan Gitlin I'm also a massive fan of these little knurled scrollers on the multifunction steering wheel (there's another one on the left spoke). Jonathan Gitlin The front brakes use 360mm ventilated rotors and six-piston calipers. Jonathan Gitlin At 330mm, the rear brakes are still pretty large by most standards, but here they're dwarfed by the optional 21-inch Cayenne SportEdition wheels. Jonathan Gitlin It drives like a giant hot hatch At more than 5,300lbs (2,400kg), we think the Cayenne must be the heaviest thing to wear a Porsche badge since the Porsche Diesel tractor back in the late 1950s. It's quicker, though; 0-60mph takes just 5.4 seconds, 100mph comes up in 13 seconds, and 0.8 seconds later, the Cayenne will cross the quarter-mile doing 103mph (166km/h). Obviously things get a little slower when using just internal combustion or electric power alone; when the battery is fully depleted, that dash to 60mph takes 6.8 seconds, with triple-digit speed requiring 17.7 seconds. Doing the same with just electrons and no fossil fuel is still not exactly slow\u20148.9 seconds to 60mph, although its electric-only top speed of 78mph (126km/h) puts paid to any other performance benchmarks.\nPorsche gives you several different drive modes to choose from. By default, the Cayenne operates as a hybrid, shutting off the V6 when possible and relying on electric power at low speeds. In Sport mode, the supercharged V6 engine is kept running all the time, with the electric motor chiming in as needed to give the driver a maximum of 416hp (310kW) and 435ft-lbs (590Nm).\nE-Power does what it sounds like, forcing the SUV to run on just electricity. We weren't quite able to match the claimed 14-mile EV range, but even lead-footed drivers ought to see 10 miles with a full battery. (As you can probably guess, you can only select E-power if the battery is sufficiently charged.) In this mode\u2014and in common with all EVs\u2014it's a very relaxed way to travel, gliding along silently on waves of electric torque.\nE-Charge does the opposite by siphoning some power from the engine to charge the batteries. Since our Cayenne arrived with a depleted battery, we tried this out on a 60-mile round trip. The 90-minute journey was mostly at freeway speeds and was able to bring the lithium-ion cells up to 50 percent. A better method is to plug the vehicle in to the wall. Do this and Porsche says it will take 2.7 hours to fully charge the battery using 240v power and the standard 3.6kW charger, or 1.3 hours with the optional 7.2kW charger. (If you're stuck with 110v, expect to spend at least 11 hours topping up those cells.) In practice, about 30 minutes on a level 2 charger at the supermarket was enough to add four or five miles of electric-only range to the Cayenne S E-Hybrid.\nWith so much mass to move, you'd be forgiven for assuming the big Porsche would be ponderous to drive. Commendably, that was not the case, and, from behind the wheel, the E-Hybrid felt considerably more like a hot hatch than a big SUV. We've already established it's quick in a straight line\u2014handy for impromptu toll booth and on-ramp drag races\u2014but it changes direction with an ease that belies that high center of gravity.\nHowever, although the Cayenne has three different suspension modes (Comfort, Sport, and Sport Plus, which are in addition to those various drive modes mentioned above), we were hard-pressed to feel any real difference. In Comfort, the Cayenne manages to resist rolling much as it corners, and, even in Sport Plus, the ride was never particularly harsh or jarring.\nEnlarge / Most car companies have settled on blue as the color they add to indicate you're looking at a hybrid. Porsche goes with this acid green, and we like it. Buttons, buttons, everywhere You need plenty of toys to be competitive in the luxury SUV market, and our test Cayenne was even better equipped than most. At $82,800, the Platinum Edition is nearly $3,000 more than the regular Cayenne S E-Hybrid. But given Porsche's notoriously expensive options list, this actually proves quite the bargain. This limited edition (which we think will remain on sale until the third-generation Cayenne arrives next year) comes with 20-inch \"RS Spyder\" design wheels, bi-xenon headlights, a Bose surround-sound system, and more. A particular standout were the front seats, which were well-bolstered to hold you in place while remaining supremely comfortable. In fact, they might just be the best seats we've ridden in all year.\nYou also get a vast number of buttons to press, push, and poke; all told, we counted more than 40 individual controls on the center console, with several more on the headlining. Someone in Porsche's design team must have been a firm believer in one function per switch when the company put together this interior. The infotainment system is Porsche's latest PCM system. It uses a seven-inch touchscreen, and it's basically a Porsche-specific UI on top of VW Group's current MIB II system. That's definitely no bad thing, for this is one of the very best infotainment systems in the market and a massive improvement over the systems Porsche used until now. The UI is intuitive, and it even includes Apple CarPlay (but not Android Auto).\nThe spec sheet has some curious omissions, though; for the money, we'd expect some kind of blind-spot monitoring system, and a rear-view backup camera was conspicuous in its absence. With regard to the latter, the Platinum Edition does include front and rear ultrasonic parking sensors, which is better than nothing but less than we'd expect.\nPerhaps our biggest surprise\u2014other than those amazing front seats\u2014was the efficiency of the Cayenne S E-Hybrid. During our week with the SUV, we averaged almost 26mpg over about 300 miles.

Four doors and voluminous cargo space may not be attributes we traditionally associated with the brand, but the Cayenne has proven it can hold its own in a segment that's extremely important to the car industry. The third-generation Cayenne is due before too long, but before it arrives on these shores, we thought we should take a look at the current model, in particular the 2017 Cayenne S E-Hybrid. Starting at just under $80,000, this plug-in hybrid is not cheap, but it turns out you do get a heck of a lot of vehicle for your money.\nPorsche probably owes its existence to the Cayenne. Adding an SUV to its line-up in 2002 opened the brand up to a far wider range of customers than its usual fare of mid- and rear-engined sports cars. And for all the wailing and gnashing of teeth by the purists, it's hard to dispute the model's success in the showroom. And because it doesn't have the same cult-like following as the nimble little sports cars, the company can use the platform for experiments, like a hybrid option.\nJust add electrons When the first hybrid Cayenne arrived in the US in 2010, it was a relatively tame example of electrification. Its nickel-metal hydride batteries were only rated for 1.7kWh, and its electric motor generated just 47hp (35kW). More recently, it got a significant upgrade. Under the hood is the same 333hp (248kW), 325ft-lb (441Nm) 3.0L supercharged direct-injection gasoline V6 engine borrowed from Audi, but now it gets much more help: the electric motor now provides 95hp (70kW) and 229ft-lbs (310Nm).\nRead 13 remaining paragraphs | Comments \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jonathan gitlin", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "porsche", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "audi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cayenne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:06:57.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "257d51a81f22e253575389ca9bd87ba6abc9366a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpYzFCDIzIkswuLlD6lVO4pb2W9ubiPxFDO7p5avAVJQ--", "site_full": "arstechnica.com", "site": "arstechnica.com", "site_section": "https://arstechnica.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Ars Technica", "title": "Liveblog: Google Pixel 2 (and more) launch event", "title_full": "Liveblog: Google Pixel 2 (and more) launch event", "published": "2017-10-03T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1109, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 74, "comments": 0, "shares": 74}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 24}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "257d51a81f22e253575389ca9bd87ba6abc9366a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpYzFCDIzIkswuLlD6lVO4pb2W9ubiPxFDO7p5avAVJQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ron Amadeo", "published": "2017-10-03T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Liveblog: Google Pixel 2 (and more) launch event", "text": "Droid Life \nView Liveblog On October 4 at noon ET (9am Pacific, 5pm UK), Google is having a major hardware event in San Francisco.\nJust like last year, the event will be headlined by a flagship smartphone launch\u2014this year, it's the Google Pixel 2.

Uber Judge blasts Waymo v. Uber lawyers, delays trial until December We\u2019re starting to see what arguments in the Waymo v. Uber trial will look like Waymo wants Uber to pay $2.6 billion in damages\u2014just for starters [Updated] Faced with a trove of new evidence in Uber case, Waymo asks to delay trial [Updated] Lawyers clash over an imaged hard drive as Waymo v. Uber hurtles toward trial View more stories A report that has long been fought over by lawyers at Waymo and Uber has been made public. Levandowski's lawyers fought to keep the Stroz Friedberg \"due diligence\" report on Uber acquiring his startup secret, but it was ultimately acquired by Waymo attorneys, who filed it as an exhibit late yesterday.\nAcquiring the report could be a turning point in the Waymo v. Uber lawsuit, which was filed in February . Waymo accused the head of Uber's self-driving car project, an ex-Googler named Anthony Levandowski, of stealing 14,000 files just before he left Google. Levandowski, who is not a defendant in the lawsuit, has pleaded the Fifth Amendment rather than answer questions about the allegations. Uber doesn't deny that the downloads took place but says none of the alleged trade secrets ever made it to its servers.\nA jury trial is scheduled to begin on October 10, although Waymo has asked for a delay, due to the overwhelming amount of information it has acquired in recent discovery.\nThings kept Levandowski \"seemed surprised at the amount of Google-related information on his laptop,\" Stroz reported. He had downloaded 50,000 Google work e-mails in 2014 and then accessed them as late as January 2016.\n\"It is difficult to believe that Levandowski was not, prior to his interview, fully aware of the extent of the data that he had retained,\" the report notes.\nFurther Reading Faced with a trove of new evidence in Uber case, Waymo asks to delay trial [Updated] The report contains a list of data pulled off Levandowski's devices and Web-based repositories, including a patent application for LIDAR and technical drawings and diagrams, such as \"a figure depicting radar technology... a LIDAR-related diagram, and Google Confidential PBR 0.7 optical cavity drawing.\" He also had source code \"snippets\" and e-mails from his Google account discussing Chauffeur-related issues.\nLevandowski's devices had \"pictures and videos related to the assembly of the Google self-driving car, the components of the car, and whiteboard snapshots of notes and diagrams.\" That included GoPro video of a self-driving car test, figures depicting radar technology, and a flowchart of software architecture at Google's Chauffeur division.\nIn March 2016, while gathering his devices together for Stroz Friedberg, Levandowski \"discovered that he possessed Google proprietary information on five disks in his Drobo 5D [storage device]... includ[ing] source code, design files, laser files, engineering documents, and software related to Google self-driving cars.\"\nLevandowski said he destroyed the disks at Shred Works, a commercial shredding facility. His Drobo 5D was clean of files when it was given to Stroz Friedberg.\nThings destroyed The Stroz report also carefully notes what files and devices Levandowski deleted. By March 2016, Levandowski was aware that Stroz would be taking steps to preserve and identify any Google material on his devices. \"At that point, the better course would have been to let that process control,\" Stroz writes.\nYet at that same time, Levandowski was deleting files. \"I'm gonna go get your stuff destroyed this afternoon btw,\" Rhian Morgan, head of HR for Ottomotto, told Levandowski on February 26, 2016. \"ill [sic] send you a bill and a pic/video.\" A few days later she said, \"i've [sic] been paying for shredding on my card, since it's not technically a business expense for OM [Ottomotto]. LMK if I should expense you or send you a bill instead :)\"\nFurther Reading Judge refers Waymo v. Uber lawsuit to criminal investigators [Updated] At a March 11 meeting, Levandowski told Uber that he had the Google disks. As Levandowski relayed it to Stroz, Uber CEO Kalanick \"wanted nothing to do with the disks and told Levandowski to 'do what he needed to do.'\" At that point, he took the disks to Shred Works in Oakland, where he said he watched the disks get shredded. He said he paid cash and got no receipt.\nLevandowski was deleting other things, too. On March 1 he texted an unknown recipient, \"Ok good reminder to delete the iMessages every night.\" On March 13, 2016, he texted an unknown recipient, saying, \"We're ready for junk King,\" the name of another local disposal company.\nStroz Friedberg visited Shred Works to confirm Levandowski's visit. No one there recognized a picture of Levandowski. A manager couldn't find any receipt from March 2016 with Levandowski's name on it, including any receipt from March 11, the day he said he went to Shred Works. The manager did find a receipt from March 14, 2016 that indicated five disks were destroyed and paid for in cash. The signature on that receipt was illegible.\nBuilding the team The report details how Levandowski began to have meetings with Uber executives, including ex-CEO Travis Kalanick, in June 2015\u2014several months before he quit working at Google. Levandowski straight up asked another Uber exec, Brian McClendon, how much Uber would be willing to pay for the Google self-driving car team, which was nicknamed Chauffeur. Between September and December of 2015, the conversations became explicit about Uber buying Levandowski's startup.\nFurther Reading Uber\u2019s Levandowski: Let\u2019s \u201cgive physics lessons about stupid shit Elon says\u201d As his time at Google neared an end, Levandowski met with more than 20 Google employees about joining his startup, talking with them on the Google campus or at coffee shops, restaurants, and homes. Two larger meetings took place at Levandowski's home in December 2015 and January 2016. At the second meeting, just prior to Levandowski's resignation on January 26, 2016, about 10 attendees were Google employees. The group \"discussed an exit strategy from Google and actively encouraged the employees to leave Google.\"\nRecruitment continued after Levandowski left. \"Its going amazing, just onboarded another 5 peeps today, 4 from former team,\" he wrote to ex-Uber CEO Kalanick on February 22, 2016. \"Looks like we're signing in a couple hours.\"\n\"Just reading text now... Pumped,\" responded Kalanick.\nThe report also performed \"due diligence\" on four other Uber employees. For one of those employees, Lior Ron, Stroz found multiple Internet searches from early 2016 regarding data destruction, including searches on \"how to secretly delete mac files,\" \"secure delete of trash on mac,\" and \"how to permanently delete google drive files from my computer.\"\nRon left Google on January 13, 2016, shortly before Levandowski. In March, Levandowski advised Ron via chat message, \"Make sure you delete all the messages tonight on both your PC and iPhone.\" Ron's interview with Stroz Friedberg took place later that month.\nTiming is everything Both Waymo and Uber have put out statements regarding the newest filings. A Waymo spokesperson said via e-mail:\nThe Stroz Report unequivocally shows that, before it acquired his company, Uber knew Anthony Levandowski had a massive trove of confidential Waymo source code, design files, technical plans and other materials after leaving Google; that he stole information deliberately, and repeatedly accessed it after leaving Waymo; and that he tried to destroy the evidence of what he had done. In addition, Mr. Levandowski used his smartphone to take thousands of covert photographs of computer screens displaying Google confidential files. Knowing all of this, Uber paid $680 million for Mr. Levandowski\u2019s company, protected him from legal action, and installed him as the head of their self-driving vehicle program. This report raises significant questions and justifies careful review.\nAn Uber spokesperson told Ars:\nBefore Uber acquired Otto, we hired an independent forensics firm to conduct due diligence because we wanted to prevent any Google IP from coming to Uber. Their report, which we are pleased is finally public, helps explain why\u2014even after 60 hours of inspection of our facilities, source code, documents and computers\u2014no Google material has been found at Uber. Waymo is now attempting to distract from that hard fact, even attempting to hide its core trade secrets case from the public and the press by closing the courtroom. In the end, the jury will see that Google's trade secrets are not and never were at Uber.\nWaymo has asked to delay the trial, and yesterday the company said that not only does it think an October date won't work, but a December trial will be too soon, as well. Uber just located another 15,000 Levandowski e-mails in discovery on September 28. In court documents, the company's lawyers and its technology vendors say that e-mail didn't properly migrate from Levandowski's \"a@ot.to\" and \"a@ottomotto.com\" addresses to his new Uber address.\n\"The volume of these materials produced at the last minute by Defendants require time to review, particularly given new information that has only come to light in the Stroz Report,\" a Waymo spokesperson told Ars via e-mail.\nUS District Judge Alsup will hear Waymo's motion to delay the trial today. He'll also consider a brief (PDF) filed by several media organizations, asking to keep the court as open as possible.\n\"No closure is proper unless and until Waymo demonstrates a substantial probability of harm to a compelling interest,\" states the brief, on behalf of 11 media organizations. At present, Waymo's \"recitation of speculative and largely generic harms falls woefully short of satisfying its burden.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:11:13.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2435742dec77fe2f8836ad3013bfb4b4d2d9e704", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpYzFCDIzIkswuLlD6lVO4qHNOdJRJA.WcE6EEiSppHNqpGdF..miU5QpJVQFYHh91SJcquAhTFoar3rPhEtsT.RE1WJ7xeh4Cn9WFmPBUOcBbaA9mwAa6ktPv4lYk7LM-", "site_full": "arstechnica.com", "site": "arstechnica.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Ars Technica", "title": "Russian Facebook ads featured anti-immigrant messages, puppies, women with rifles", "title_full": "Russian Facebook ads featured anti-immigrant messages, puppies, women with rifles | Ars Technica", "published": "2017-10-03T20:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/facebook-760x380.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1109, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a656c3f3f0a41c425f9d959d1d226d5faae9ccc1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpYzFCDIzIkswuLlD6lVO4qHNOdJRJA.WcE6EEiSppHNqpGdF..miU5QpJVQFYHh91SJcquAhTFoar3rPhEtsT.RE1WJ7xeh4Cn9WFmPBUOcBbaA9mwAa61NroE154QPEIC8rV571F.NPDVzAiIhRh", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "comhcinc", "published": "2017-10-03T15:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "", "text": "I'm pro 2 out of 3 of those things.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:11:15.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2435742dec77fe2f8836ad3013bfb4b4d2d9e704", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpYzFCDIzIkswuLlD6lVO4qHNOdJRJA.WcE6EEiSppHNqpGdF..miU5QpJVQFYHh91SJcquAhTFoar3rPhEtsT.RE1WJ7xeh4Cn9WFmPBUOcBbaA9mwAa6ktPv4lYk7LM-", "site_full": "arstechnica.com", "site": "arstechnica.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Ars Technica", "title": "Russian Facebook ads featured anti-immigrant messages, puppies, women with rifles", "title_full": "Russian Facebook ads featured anti-immigrant messages, puppies, women with rifles | Ars Technica", "published": "2017-10-03T20:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/facebook-760x380.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 1109, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 310, "comments": 0, "shares": 310}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 8}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2435742dec77fe2f8836ad3013bfb4b4d2d9e704", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpYzFCDIzIkswuLlD6lVO4qHNOdJRJA.WcE6EEiSppHNqpGdF..miU5QpJVQFYHh91SJcquAhTFoar3rPhEtsT.RE1WJ7xeh4Cn9WFmPBUOcBbaA9mwAa6ktPv4lYk7LM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Joe Mullin", "published": "2017-10-03T20:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Russian Facebook ads featured anti-immigrant messages, puppies, women with rifles", "text": "Monday, Facebook handed over some 3,000 ads, which it believes were bought by Russia, to congressional investigators.

is trying to beat Amazon at its own game, and the company's latest acquisition will boost that effort, at least in the New York City area. Walmart announced that it has acquired Parcel, a Brooklyn-based delivery company that specializes in scheduled and same-day package delivery of traditional items as well as groceries, meal kits, and other perishables. The acquisition price has not been disclosed by Walmart or Parcel, but a Recode report suggests that the deal closed at less than $10 million.\nFurther Reading Amazon made a package delivery locker specifically for apartments Parcel launched in 2013 to help city dwellers get their packages at convenient times. Signing up for Parcel meant you could schedule a two-hour window in which your package would be delivered. In metro areas like New York, it's not unheard of for packages to be lost or stolen if delivered when the recipient is not around to accept it. Amazon's apartment Hubs are the most recent attempted fix for this problem, but Parcel gives recipients more control over when their packages arrive. Parcel also sends live package updates via text message to the merchant and recipient, informing them of the location of the package through the last mile of delivery.\nAccording to Walmart's blog , Parcel will continue to serve its existing customers in the New York City area. Walmart will use Parcel's infrastructure and knowledge of the New York metro area to help its same-day delivery efforts. Walmart purchased Jet about a year ago for $3 billion and now offers free, same-day delivery through Jet in some areas. Parcel will help Jet complete same-day deliveries in the New York City area soon, while also allowing Walmart to lower operating costs even while experimenting with new delivery methods. Walmart and Jet plan to deliver both regular merchandise and perishable groceries with Parcel's help in the future.\nThis is Walmart's latest attempt to get on Amazon's level when it comes to distribution. Amazon already offers free two-hour delivery to Prime members for some common items as well as same-day delivery for a catalog of over one million items. While same-day and incredibly fast delivery may be more popular in big metro areas than other rural areas, it's a huge market for online retailers to prove their usefulness and speed. Walmart is hoping that Parcel's knowledge of the New York City area, along with its infrastructure that can support perishable and non-perishable goods, will help it compete with Amazon in one of the biggest retail markets.\nFurther Reading Amazon\u2019s Instant Pickup has your items ready in just minutes But there are a lot of other ways Amazon gets products to customers, particularly in New York. Convenience is key, and Amazon has a network of delivery mechanisms, including Amazon Lockers and Instant Pickup locations .

That's what conservatives did with Donald Trump.

I see the amazing people out there who get it, who understand that life is bigger than picking sides and sticking their fingers in their ears. They aren't overlooked or silent, it's just that tribalism is getting more air time than common sense.\nAt least the animals will be happy when they have the planet to themselves.

So far, nothing has.\nOn the kids point, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. I've found that when you focus less on the global and national animosity, you'll see that communities are getting stronger. Kids focus less on what people are and who they are - they are more likely to acknowledge and accept people for who they are rather than what they are. While grandma and grandpa and mom and dad and all their friends are out creating a fuss, they just seem to want to go out and have fun.\nMot importantly, if someone disagrees with them, then they just don't play together - but if something comes up and they are playing, they ignore what they disagree about and focus on what they do agree on.\nSoon enough, we'll all die.

Trump spent nearly $1,000,000,000.\nCall me when something significant is found.\nThis story in itself is small, but you're not looking at the bigger picture, consider the following summary posted elsewhere this morning:\nQuote: : 1) Cambridge Analytica (CA) was the data mining company used by Trump campaign and hired by Kushner. \u201cI called somebody who works for one of the technology companies that I work with, and I had them give me a tutorial on how to use Facebook micro-targeting,\u201d Kushner told Steven Bertoni of Forbes.\u201d\n2) CA is a company run by the Mercers that engages in types of Facebook targeting.\n3) Mercer hates Hillary and Bill\n4) CA is a subsidiary of Strategic Communications Laboratory. (SCL)\n5) Facebook users were targeted with anti Hillary ads and propaganda. Some of the same propaganda was used on Breitbart, also run by Mercer and Bannon.\n6) Bannon was on the board of Cambridge Analytica\n7) Flynn was an advisor of the SCL group in 2016.\n8) Twenty one state election systems were hacked by Russians.\n9)Manafort, DT Jr.and Kushner all \u201cforgot\u201d about their Russian contacts during the campaign.\n10)The Intelligence committee wants to interview the digital director for Trump's campaign, Brad Parscale, who worked closely with Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n11)Jared Kushner attempted to set up a backchannel line of communication with Russia last December\n12)Experts say that Russia most likely did NOT have data analysis info for Facebook bots, and must have been helped in getting the data.\n13)Brietbart is strategically trying to expand into Europe as a goal to break up the EU with an alt right agenda\n14)Bannon never left Breitbart and is still trying to spread the alt right/deconstruction agenda\n15)Russia has the same deconstruction agenda as Bannon\n16)Mueller just served Facebook with search warrants for Russian generated postings, which includes WHO bought the ads and HOW the data was targeted.\nThe run of events and level of coincidence involved is kind of staggering. The odds of all of this just being due to the way the stars aligned seems almost incalculable.\nThere's so much smoke, everyone is is likely to asphyxiate before we get the chance to find the actual gun\nEdit : sauce - re: FB marketing tools : https://www.washingtonpost.com/business ... ge%2Fstory Last edited by Kane2207 on Tue Oct 03, 2017 1:41 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:03:32.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2435742dec77fe2f8836ad3013bfb4b4d2d9e704", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpYzFCDIzIkswuLlD6lVO4qHNOdJRJA.WcE6EEiSppHNqpGdF..miU5QpJVQFYHh91SJcquAhTFoar3rPhEtsT.RE1WJ7xeh4Cn9WFmPBUOcBbaA9mwAa6ktPv4lYk7LM-", "site_full": "arstechnica.com", "site": "arstechnica.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/BAaf", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Ars Technica", "title": "Russian Facebook ads featured anti-immigrant messages, puppies, women with rifles", "title_full": "Russian Facebook ads featured anti-immigrant messages, puppies, women with rifles | Ars Technica", "published": "2017-10-03T20:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 29, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/facebook-760x380.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1109, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "db3a379435fa8665732710136e44288e0c191298", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpYzFCDIzIkswuLlD6lVO4qHNOdJRJA.WcE6EEiSppHNqpGdF..miU5QpJVQFYHh91SJcquAhTFoar3rPhEtsT.RE1WJ7xeh4Cn9WFmPBUOcBbaA9mwAa61NroE154QPEIC8rV571F.NZnB19Alu8O", "ord_in_thread": 26, "author": "Jason Honingford", "published": "2017-10-03T16:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "", "text": "This is not any worse than the ads that get served up now by Facebook.

It took many centries of development to reach:\n- current form factor (physical size, amount of content, optimial compositions/genre)\n- the way authors are trained and selected (the institutions and culture around training and selecting authors),\n- socio-economic value network (a community of reviewers and critics and publisher honor/reputation tracking system) to validate/review/filter published content,\n- a system to develop palate/taste and habit of readers through general education (our reading taste is strongly influenced by reading material we encounter during our education), etc. In fact most of our schooling still focuses on use of books.\nCompared to all this development, the web is at its very early stage. There is not a lot of training and selection in place for authors or publication. There is no systematic development of reader's criteria. There is no meaningful value network in place to filter out 'good' vs 'bad' web content in place. Some are coming, but unfortunately they lag far behind the level of development reached by matured media such as printed books.\nI don't think it's feasible to abandon the web and go back to the printed media.
