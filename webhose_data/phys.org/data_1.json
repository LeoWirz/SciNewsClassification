The finding, published Sept. 29 in the journal Physical Review Letters , may help explain water's curious, life-giving properties. It also challenges the very definition of what it means to be a glass. \nGlasses are typically made by cooling a liquid rapidly, and, according to current understanding, a glass inherits the order that was present in the original liquid. In the case of amorphous ice, however, as the liquid water cools, a new and orderly arrangement of molecules emerges. \n\"According to our results, these types of glass are not simply frozen liquids\u2014this picture doesn't hold anymore,\" said Fausto Martelli, an associate research scholar in the Department of Chemistry at Princeton. \"We are essentially saying that a notion that scientists have believed for many years is partially wrong.\" \nPrior to this study, researchers knew that the rapid freezing of water, which can occur at the extremely cold temperatures found in outer space, leads to the formation of a very different material than the ice of everyday experience. This material, known as amorphous ice, lacks regular ice's highly ordered crystalline structure, leading scientists to categorize it as a glass \u2014a liquid whose movement has slowed to a glacial pace. Amorphous ices are not common on Earth, but they are the most abundant form of water in the universe. \nThe new study found that the molecules in these amorphous ices arrange into a previously undetected internal pattern. This pattern, known as disordered hyperuniformity, is defined as order across large spatial distances even when there is no order across short distances. Disordered hyperuniform materials fall somewhere between a crystal, which is highly organized over long distances, and a liquid, which is only ordered over short distances. \n\"The existence of these large-scale structural correlations has not been fully appreciated, and that is really what we wanted to address in this study,\" said study co-author Salvatore Torquato, a professor of chemistry who, with Princeton senior scientist Frank Stillinger, first identified hyperuniformity more than a decade ago ( Physical Review E , 2003). \"The information present in these systems is quite striking, and leads to completely new insights about materials,\" he said. He and his colleagues have since identified hyperuniformity in a number of places, including the arrangement of cells in a chicken's eye ( Physical Review E , 2014). \nIn addition to Martelli and Torquato, the study authors included Roberto Car, Princeton's Ralph W. Dornte Professor in Chemistry, and Nicolas Giovambattista, an associate professor at Brooklyn College-The City University of New York. Torquato and Car are associated with the Princeton Institute for the Science and Technology of Materials. \nTo explore the internal structure of amorphous ices, Martelli used a computer model that tracks the behavior of over 8,000 water molecules to simulate what would happen if he cooled the water down to about 80 degrees Kelvin (about -316 degrees Fahrenheit). At this temperature, water molecules are so deprived of heat that they can no longer move from place to place, nor rotate in place. At this temperature and below, the researchers observed the hyperuniform pattern emerge in the data from the computer simulation. \n\"We are not used to looking for order on such large length-scales,\" Martelli said. \"However, mathematics allows us to shed light on patterns that our eyes are not able to see.\" \nThe simulations required months of time on high-performance research computers, including Princeton University's TIGRESS clusters through the Princeton Institute for Computational Science and Engineering. \nThe simulation enabled the researchers to ask questions about the nature of water, which has many anomalous behaviors that make it uniquely suited to supporting life. One such anomaly is that the crystalline form of ice is less dense than liquid water, allowing ice to float, which in turn allows life to exist under the ice in lakes and oceans. \nOne possible explanation for water's anomalies is that, at very cold temperatures, water may come in two liquid phases\u2014one denser than the other\u2014rather than just the one liquid state we find familiar. Detecting the transition of water between the high-density and low-density forms has proven elusive due to technical challenges. \nThe current study provides indirect support for the existence of the two forms, at least in computer simulations. Giovambattista simulated the application of high pressure to the model and observed that the pressure converted the low-density form of amorphous ice into a high-density form. The transition between the two forms of amorphous ice is consistent with the existence of two liquid forms of water. \nUnderstanding the long-range order present in amorphous materials is an active area of study because harnessing hyperuniformity could lead to practical applications. The hyperuniformity present in amorphous silicon may enable new ways to tune electronic properties. The ability to manipulate a material's hyperuniform long-range order may help scientists build stronger ceramics or longer-lasting glasses. \nAmorphous ices can be produced in laboratory settings, Martelli said, and it may be possible to find evidence of hyperuniformity in these experiments.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "catherine zandonella repr", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kelvin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giovambattista", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fausto martelli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roberto car", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph w. dornte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salvatore torquato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicolas giovambattista", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martelli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank stillinger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "torquato", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "princeton university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city university of new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of chemistry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "princeton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "princeton institute for the science and technology of materials", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tigress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "princeton institute for computational science and engineering", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn college-the city university of new york", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "princeton", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:01:36.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ec150f64345f31b0e3f95c4808c8bde1b9056dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaOBhqfyBADkDGtLKxPqfcOk.nQ3kZZCMtrQdYe7ocTm6jd1gB_IR7JOmjK6QnOhtO", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/rss-feed/", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Keeping moving\u2014flat worms shed light on role of migrating stem cells in cancer", "title_full": "Keeping moving\u2014flat worms shed light on role of migrating stem cells in cancer", "published": "2017-10-03T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/keepingmovin.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ec150f64345f31b0e3f95c4808c8bde1b9056dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaOBhqfyBADkDGtLKxPqfcOk.nQ3kZZCMtrQdYe7ocTm6jd1gB_IR7JOmjK6QnOhtO", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Keeping moving\u2014flat worms shed light on role of migrating stem cells in cancer", "text": "Keeping moving\u2014flat worms shed light on role of migrating stem cells in cancer October 3, 2017 Planarian worms are full of stem cells green, which divide to produce daughter cells (magenta) that together can make and replace all the different types cells in body (blue).

Credit: Prasad Abnave \nA new study carried out by the University of Oxford has used flat worms to look at the role of migrating stem cells in cancer. \nResearchers from the Aboobaker lab in the Department of Zoology have taken advantage of the species of worm which is full of stem cells . The worms , also known as planarians, are known for their ability to regenerate all their tissues and organs repeatedly. This process requires the activity of their stem cells that constantly divide to make all the new cells. \nCell migration - or the movement of cells from one part of the body to another - is a key function of cells in our bodies. New stem cells are constantly required to maintain tissue and organs functions, and they are expected to migrate to where they are needed. However, control of these movements can fail, and cancers can form when these cells migrate to places they aren't supposed to be. \nBy understanding how stem cells are programmed to move, what activates them and how they follow a correct path, researchers may be able to design new treatments for cancer. \n'We already knew that these worm stem cells have a lot in common with our own stem cells, but we knew nothing about how they migrate and if this process relates to how our cells migrate,' says Dr Prasad Abnave, first author of the study, published in Development . \n'We wanted to establish if the same mechanisms had been evolutionary conserved or not, we hoped that they would be, as this would make an excellent model for studying all aspects of stem cell migration.' \nHowever, before the team could start working with the worms, they had to overcome a small problem. 'Perhaps a little counterintuitively, the sheer abundance of stem cells in planarians makes it difficult to study migration,' said Professor Aziz Aboobaker. \n'In order to trace the movement of cells you need to create a field for them to move into so you can be sure of the direction and speed at which their moving, but if the cells you are interested in are already everywhere that is difficult to do.' (top panels) Both stem cells (green, detecting the gene expression of smedwi-1) and their daughter cells (magenta, detecting the gene expression prog-1) have simple rounded shapes characteristic of stem cells that are still undecided what type of cell to become. In order to move these cells mist form extensions that reach out into the surrounding tissue and then the rest of the cell follows along, allowing them to move. Credit: Prasad Abnave \nLuckily the team were able to draw on over 100 years of previous work. In one particular experiment that used x-rays to kill planarian stem cells, it was found that the animals survived the treatment if part of the worm was kept under a lead shield, as 'presumably the stem cells under the lead shield migrate to the rest of the animal and everything is fine.' said Abnave. \nWith the help of Dr Mark Hill at Oxford's Department of Oncology the group were able to design an apparatus that allowed them to use X-rays to leave behind a thin strip of stem cells. These cells could then be observed as they migrated through the rest of the organism to where the original stem cells had been killed. \n'This collaboration gave us a great opportunity to apply previous experience gained in studying cancer cells to a study involving cells in a whole organism. It will provide a useful tool to improve our understanding of stem cells, and their potential role in cancer,' said Mark. \n'It sounds simple, but it took a long time to design an apparatus and techniques with which we could study many worms at once. That was key in being able to study how migration was controlled and for performing high quality experiments that could really generate reproducible results,' said Aboobaker. \nProfessor Gillies McKenna, the Director of the CRUK / MRC Institute for Radiation Oncology and Biology commented: 'This project is an example of why Oxford is such a rewarding place to do research. People from different departments and disciplines bringing their expertise together to tackle a problem neither could do alone but together shedding new light on both fundamental biology and also on cancer.' \nBy studying how the worms respond to injury, the team found that stem cells migrated very precisely to the affected area. However in the absence of damaged tissue the cells sat still and did not migrate. \nUsing a technique called RNA interference the team were then able to remove the function of regulatory genes already known to be important in cell migration (and to play a role in human cancers) and found that they were all also required for migration of planarians stem cells. These genes included proteins known as transcription factors that are important because they act as ON/OFF switches for hundreds of other genes. \n'This was a very satisfying result as it confirmed our suspicion that our simple worms will be very useful for understanding stem cell migration, now we have proven the system we can look intensely for new mechanisms that control or interact with cell migration and have a real expectation that we find will also be true for our migrating cells\" said Abnave. One advantage of our worms is that they are easy to work with and we can make rapid progress.' \nNext the team hopes to look for new genes that control stem cell migration using the system they have developed.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abnave", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillies mckenna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aboobaker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prasad abnave", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prasad abnave  luckily", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aziz aboobaker", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "department of oncology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cruk / mrc institute for radiation oncology and biology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of oxford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxford", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:12:15.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "39a41ae4f997916c280e7b5de1c339e00150696f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaKkaUILrMMkMYY0hgbytYh1emsqMIfNriIPrbVAKvaujE8WlZlPzXNQ--", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&cf=all&ned=us&hl=en&topic=snc&output=rss", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Science - Google News", "title": "Private companies are launching a new space race \u2013 here's what to expect - Phys.Org", "title_full": "Private companies are launching a new space race \u2013 here's what to expect - Phys.Org", "published": "2017-10-03T15:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2017/7-privatecompa.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "39a41ae4f997916c280e7b5de1c339e00150696f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaKkaUILrMMkMYY0hgbytYh1emsqMIfNriIPrbVAKvaujE8WlZlPzXNQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Private companies are launching a new space race \u2013 here's what to expect - Phys.Org", "text": "Private companies are launching a new space race \u2013 here's what to expect October 3, 2017 by Monica Grady, The Conversation Credit: Pixabay, CC BY-SA \nThe space race between the USA and Russia started with a beep from the Sputnik satellite exactly 60 years ago (October 4, 1957) and ended with a handshake in space just 18 years later. The handshake was the start of many decades of international collaboration in space. But over the past decade there has been a huge change. \nThe space environment is no longer the sole preserve of government agencies. Private companies have entered the exploration domain and are propelling the sector forward more vigorously and swiftly than would be the case if left to governments alone. \nIt could be argued that a new space race has begun, in which private companies are competing against each other and against government organisations. But this time it is driven by a competition for customers rather than the urge to show dominance by being first to achieve a certain goal. So who are the main players and how will they change the science, technology and politics of space exploration? \nPut the phrase \"private space exploration\" into a search engine and a wealth of links emerges. Several have titles such as: \" Six private companies that could launch humans into space \", \" The world's top 10 most innovative companies in space \" or \"10 major players in the private sector space race\". What is immediately apparent is that practically all these companies are based in the US. \nThere is a big difference between building and launching satellites into low Earth orbit for telecommunications and sending crew and cargo to the International Space Station (ISS) and beyond. Private companies in several nations have been engaged in the satellite market for many years. Their contributions to the development of non-governmental space exploration has helped to lay the trail for entrepreneurs with the vision and resources to develop their own pathways to space. \nToday, several companies in the US are looking very specifically at human spaceflight. The three that are perhaps furthest down the road are SpaceX , Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic . The main goals of all three companies is to reduce the cost of access to space \u2013 mainly through reuse of launchers and spacecraft \u2013 making space accessible to people who are not specially trained astronauts. One thing these companies have in common is the private passion of their chief executives. \nSpaceX was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, a charismatic entrepreneur, engineer, inventor and investor. The ambition of SpaceX is \"to revolutionise space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets\". To this end, the company has specialised in the design, manufacture and launch of rockets, providing direct competition to the United Launch Alliance (between Boeing and Lockheed Martin) that had been the contract holder of choice for launch of NASA and Department of Defense rocket launches. \nIts success has been spectacular. Having developed the Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft , it became the first commercial company to dock a spacecraft at the ISS in 2012. The firm now has a regular run there, carrying cargo. But so far, no astronauts. However, the Falcon Heavy is comparable to the Saturn 5 rocket that launched the Apollo astronauts, and SpaceX has designed its vehicle with a view to sending astronauts to the moon by 2018, and to Mars as early as 2023. SpaceX Crew Dragon docking with the International Space Station. Credit: SpaceX \nOn September 29, Musk refined his plans, announcing the BFR project (which I like to pretend stands for Big F**king Rocket). This would replace the Falcon and Dragon spacecraft \u2013 and would not only transport cargo and explorers to the moon and Mars, but could also reduce travel times between cities on Earth. Musk calculates it could take as little as 29 minutes to fly from London to New York. \nWhether the company succeeds in sending astronauts to the moon in 2018 remains to be seen. Either way, a lot could be going on then \u2013 2018 is also the year when Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos , the technology and retail entrepreneur behind Amazon, aims to launch people to space. But its ambition is different from that of SpaceX. Blue Origin is focusing on achieving commercially available, sub-orbital human spaceflight \u2013 targeting the space tourism industry. The company has developed a vertical launch vehicle ( New Shepard , after the first American astronaut in space, Alan Shepard) that can reach the 100km altitude used to define where \"space\" begins. The rocket then descends back to Earth, with the engines firing towards the end of the descent, allowing the spacecraft to land vertically. Test flights with no passengers have made successful demonstrations of the technology. The trip to space and back will take about 10 minutes. \nBut Blue Origin has got some competition from Virgin Galactic, which describes itself as \"the world's first commercial spaceline\". Founded in 2004 by Richard Branson , also a technology and retail entrepreneur, it plans to carry six passengers at a time into sub-orbital space and give them about six minutes of weightlessness in the course of a two and a half hour flight. \nThe technology differs from that of SpaceX and Blue Origin in that the launch into space is not from the ground, but from a jet airplane. This mothership flies to an altitude of about 18km (about twice as high as regular aircraft fly) and releases a smaller, rocket-powered spacecraft (SpaceShip Two) which is propelled to an altitude of about 100km. The programme has been delayed by technical difficulties \u2013 and then by the tragic loss of pilot Mike Alsbury , when SpaceShip Two exploded in mid-air during a test flight in 2014. No date is yet set for the first passengers to fly. \nThere's also the Google Lunar XPrize competition , announced in 2007, with the tagline: \"Welcome to the new space race\". The aim of the prize is to launch a robotic mission to the moon, place a lander on the surface and drive 50 metres, sending back high-quality images and video. The competition is still in progress. Five privately funded teams must launch their spacecraft to the moon by the end of 2017. \nPowerful international ties \nThe changes are taking place against a backdrop of tried and tested international collaboration in space, which took off in earnest at the end of the space race. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the US and Russia space programmes complemented each other beautifully \u2013 though perhaps not intentionally. Following the cessation of Apollo in 1975, the US space programme focused its efforts on robotic exploration of the solar system. \nThe Voyager probes gave us amazing images of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. The Mariner and Viking missions to Mars led to Pathfinder, Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity. Messenger orbited Mercury and Magellan orbited Venus. When New Horizons launched to Pluto in 2006, it was a mission to visit the last planet left unexplored in the solar system. \nRussia, on the other hand, pursued the goal of human spaceflight , with its incredibly successful Mir orbiting space station and its programme of flights to transfer cosmonauts and cargo backwards and forwards to Mir. Human spaceflight in the US revived with the Space Shuttle and its mission to build and occupy the International Space Station (ISS). The list of nations that contribute to the ISS continues to grow. The shuttle programme finished in 2011 and, since its successor Orion (built in collaboration with European Space Agency, ESA) is not due to come into service until at least 2023, the international community has been reliant on Russia to keep the ISS fuelled and inhabited. \nToday, as well as the US and Russia, there are strong, vibrant and successful space programmes in Europe, Japan, India and China. The European Space Agency was established just two months before the historic handshake of 1975, following many years of independent aeronautical engineering research by individual nations. Similarly, the Chinese, Japanese and Indian space agencies can trace their heritages back to the 1960s. A number of smaller countries including the United Arab Emirates also have ambitious plans. \nOf course these countries also compete against each other. There has been widespread speculation that the entry of China into the field was sufficient to introduce a fresh imperative to the US space programme. China has a well-developed space programme and is currently working towards having a space station in orbit around the Earth by about 2020. A prototype, Tiangong-2, has been in space for almost a year, and was occupied by two astronauts (or \"taikonauts\") for a month. \nChina has also had three successful missions to the moon. And its next mission, Chang'e 5, due to launch towards the end of 2017, is designed to bring samples from the moon back to Earth. China also has a declared intent of landing taikonauts on the moon by 2025 \u2013 the same time frame in which the US will be testing its new Orion spacecraft in orbit around the moon. \nBut while there's an element of competition, the success of the past few decades certainly shows that it is possible to collaborate in space even when tensions rise on the ground. Indeed, space exploration may even act as a buffer zone from international politics, which is surely something worth having. It will be interesting to see how a wider role in space exploration for private companies will affect such international collaborations, especially since so much of the effort is based in the USA. \nHealthy competition or dangerous game? \nA benefit of the entry of the private sector into space exploration has been recognition of the high-tech companies that contribute to the growth of the economy as valuable targets for investment. Indeed, a recent presentation at an international investment bank \u2013 under a heading of \"Space; the next investment frontier\" \u2013 declared that \"investment interest has helped reduce launch costs and spur innovation across related industries, opening up a new chapter in the history of the space economy\". \nOne of the last engagements of Barack Obama's presidency was to chair the Whitehouse Frontiers Conference, where space exploration was discussed as much within the context of US industry as within the drive to explore new worlds. Contributors to the conference included NASA \u2013 but overwhelmingly the speakers were from private technology and investment companies. Pluto as seen by New Horizons. Credit: NASA \nPerhaps it is cynical to say \u2013 but once investment starts to flow, lawyers won't be far behind. And that is another aspect of the explosion of interest in space commerce and tourism. Laws, statutes and other regulations are necessary to govern the international nature of space exploration. At the moment, the United Nations, through its Office for Outer Space Affairs , is responsible for promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space . It also oversees operation of the Outer Space Treaty , which provides a framework for the governance of space and activities that might take place. While the obvious lack of \"space police\" means that it cannot be practically enforced, it has never actually been violated. \nThe operation is designed along similar lines to the international treaties that oversee maritime activities and the exploration of Antarctica. This is the closest that there is to international legislation and, since coming into operation in 1967 with the three inaugural signatories of the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the (then) USSR, the treaty has been signed by 106 countries (including China and North Korea). It is necessary to have such controls because although the risks that surround space exploration are high, potential rewards are even higher. \nIf we look at the way more conventional businesses operate, such as supermarkets, competition drives prices down, and there is little reason to believe that competition between space companies would follow a different model. In which case, greater risks might be taken in order to increase profitability. There is no evidence for this so far \u2013 but as the field develops and additional private companies move into space exploration \u2013 there will be a higher probability of accident or emergency. \nThe treaty says that a state launching a probe or satellite is liable to pay compensation for damage when accidents occur. However, the costs of space exploration are astronomical and crippling to poorer countries, making them increasingly depend on commercial launchers. But if a private company launches an object that subsequently causes damage in space, the struggling economy will have to pick up the bill. The treaty may therefore need to be updated to make private companies more liable. There are also serious issues around the safety of astronauts, who have the legal right to a safe existence when in outer space. But even lawyers aren't sure whether the law does \u2013 or should \u2013 extend to private astronauts. \nLooking to the future, there will be a need for an expanded version of a Civil Aviation Authority, directing and controlling routes, launches and landings on Earth, and between and on planetary bodies. All the safety and security considerations of air and sea travel will pertain to space travel at a vastly enhanced level, because the costs and risks are so much higher. There will have to be firm and well-understood protocols in the event of a spacecraft crashing, or two spacecraft colliding. Not to mention piracy or the possibility of hijack. All this might sound a little gloomy, taking the dash and exhilaration from space exploration , but it will be a necessary development that opens up the era of space travel for citizens beyond those with deep pockets. \nThe original space race resulted from the ideas and skills of visionary theoretician engineers including: Robert H Goddard , Wernher von Braun , Konstantin E.

Now, in research published in Physical Review E , an interdisciplinary group of physicists and biologists have used a mathematical model to determine how the cone cells in zebrafish\u2014a common experimental fish model\u2014are arranged in a specific pattern in all individuals. It turns out that small defects in the patterns lead the cells to arrange themselves into only one of two possible patterns that might otherwise emerge. \nThe eyes of these fish have four different types of cone cells , which sense blue, ultraviolet, and a combination of red and green. The \"double cone\" cells that sense red and green can be arranged in different orientations, so the cells can end up in a pattern of ultraviolet, blue, and red/green cells in different patterns . As the fish eyes develop, these cells originate from an area called the ciliary marginal zone, differentiate into the different cone cells , and arrange themselves into a random pattern. However, they eventually rearrange themselves into a certain pattern. One hypothesis is that the patterns emerge from the different adhesion force between the cells in various orientations. Essentially, they end up in a pattern that has the lowest energy level. \n\"While this is well known,\" explains Noriaki Ogawa, the first author of the paper, \"there is an unexplained problem. It turns out there are two patterns with the same lowest energy level, one parallel to the growth of the retina and the other perpendicular to it, so that they are simply the same pattern but rotated 90 degrees. In real fish, however, only one of the two patterns is actually found.\" \nThe authors realized there must be some mechanism leading to that pattern. They found that though the two patterns are equivalent if looked at using a static model , they were not so in a dynamic setting. Using a mathematical model , dynamic pattern selection, they discovered that small flaws that appear in the pattern can disrupt it and drive it to rearrange itself in a way that always leads to the pattern found in real fish . \n\"This is an important finding,\" explains Ogawa, \"because this could have implications for the development of other structures in many organisms.\" \"There is much work to be done to fully explain the situation,\" he continues. \"We do know that there are other mechanisms, namely concentration gradients of chemicals, known as morphogens, that direct the development process, and the polarities of cells. In order to fully understand how these patterns emerge in real organisms, we also need to understand the relationship between these mechanisms, and also to experimentally determine the actual adhesion strength between cells and other parameters.\" Mathematician discovers key aspect underlining distinctive patterns of the zebrafish September 28, 2017 \nA Cardiff University mathematician has thrown new light on the longstanding mystery of how zebrafish develop the distinctive striped patterns on their skin.

We prepared FePt nanoscale magnet which is atomically controlled. (Right) We applied external voltages to sample and performed synchrotron X-ray absorption experiment. Credit: Osaka University \nA research group led by Osaka University discovered a new principle to realize ultra-energy-efficient magnetic memory by electrically controlling the shapes of atoms. \nNon-volatile magnetic memory using nanometer-sized magnets, MRAM (magnetoresistive random access memory ), required magnetization reversal by applying voltage. Thus, ultra-energy efficient magnetization reversal in nanoseconds is preferable. However, figure-of-merit of the current technology, voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), was less than one-tenth of the level necessary for application. It is important to develop the VCMA effect using the new materials. \nAssociate Professor Shinji MIWA at Osaka University, Dr. Motohiro SUZUKI at the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute, Assistant Professor Masahito TSUJIKAWA at Tohoku University, Dr. Takayuki NOZAKI at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, and Dr. Tadakatsu OHKUBO at the National Institute for Materials Science, made a platinum monatomic layer placed on ferromagnetic iron (FePt|MgO system) that was controlled at an atomic level. (Figure.1. Left) \nSince there is correlation between a spin-orbit interaction and a VCMA, this group focused on FePt|MgO, which contains platinum with large spin-orbit interactions. Using the FePt|MgO, this group conducted experiments in order to clarify the VCMA at X-ray beamlines in the SPring-8 synchrotron radiation facility. (Figure.1. Right) Figure.2. Voltage control magnetic anisotropy is 30 fJ/Vm in Fe-MgO system, and that of FePt is 140 fJ/Vm. In this study, we find that voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy in FePt system possess two mechanism. We also find that FePt potentially possess voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy coefficient more than 1000 fJ/Vm. Credit: Osaka University \nFrom these experiments and theoretical calculations, this group discovered that the FePt|MgO system that demonstrated a VCMA of 140 fJ/Vm had two different mechanisms and potentially possesses an enormous VCMA beyond 1,000 fJ/Vm. (Figure.2.) \nThis group observed changes in magnetic dipole term by voltage in the experiment at SPring-8. From theoretical calculations, it was found that, in the FePt|MgO system, the VCMAs from conventionally known Mechanism A (the orbital magnetic moment inductino) and newly discovered Mechanism B (magnetic dipole term inductino) were partially cancelled out by one another, resulting in a VCMA of 140 fJ/Vm. \nAs shown in Figure 2, Mechanisms A and B have a VCMA value of 1,000 fJ/Vm or more, so designing materials to create a synergistic effect will allow development of materials with a VCMA of 1,000 fJ/Vm or more. \nThe use of this group's achievements in designing materials will make it possible to obtain a VCMA of 10 times larger than that of existing materials , which will allow for energy-saving non-volatile memory that can reduce heat generation. Figure.3. Voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy of FePt nanomagnet opssess two mechanism. Well known mechanism A can be described by charge doping, and it can be confirmed by measuring orbital magnetic moment. New mechanism B can be described by charge redistribution, and it can be confirmed by measuring magnetic dipole moment.

Credit: University of Mississippi \nA global team of scientists, including two University of Mississippi physicists, has found that the same instruments used in the historic discovery of gravitational waves caused by colliding black holes could help unlock the secrets of dark matter, a mysterious and as-yet-unobserved component of the universe. \nThe research findings by Emanuele Berti, UM associate professor of physics and astronomy, Shrobana Ghosh, a graduate student, and their colleagues appears in the September issue of Physical Review Letters , one of the most prestigious peer-reviewed academic journals in the field. \"Stochastic and resolvable gravitational waves from ultralight bosons\" is co-authored by fellow scientists Richard Brito, Enrico Barausse, Vitor Cardoso, Irina Dvorkin, Antoine Klein and Paolo Pani. \nThe nature of dark matter remains unknown, but scientists estimate that it is five times as abundant as ordinary matter throughout the universe. \n\"The nature of dark matter is one the greatest mysteries in physics,\" Berti said. \"It is remarkable that we can now do particle physics \u2013 investigate the \"very small\" \u2013 by looking at gravitational-wave emission from black holes , the largest and simplest objects in the universe.\" \nPRL is one of several publications produced by the American Physical Society and American Institute of Physics. It contains papers considered to represent significant advances in research, and therefore, published quickly in short, letter format for a broad audience of physicists. \nThis paper details calculations by the scientists, who work in Germany, France, Italy, Portugal and the U.S., show that gravitational-wave interferometers can be used to indirectly detect the presence of dark matter. \nA companion paper by the team, \"Gravitational wave searches for ultralight bosons with LIGO and LISA,\" also has been accepted and will appear in Physical Review D . \nCalculations show that certain types of dark matter could form giant clouds around astrophysical black holes. If ultralight scalar particles exist in nature, fast-spinning black holes would trigger the growth of such scalar \"condensates\" at the expense of their rotational energy, producing a cloud that rotates around the black hole, now more slowly-spinning, and emits gravitational waves, pretty much like a giant lighthouse in the sky. \n\"One possibility is that dark matter consists of scalar fields similar to the Higgs boson, but much lighter than neutrinos,\" Pani said. \"This type of dark matter is hard to study in particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, but it may be accessible to gravitational-wave detectors.\" \nThe team led by Brito studied gravitational waves emitted by the \"black hole plus cloud\" system. Depending on the mass of the hypothetical particles, the signal is strong enough to be detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, with instruments in Louisiana and Washington, and its European counterpart Virgo, as well as by the future space mission Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. \n\"Surprisingly, gravitational waves from sources that are too weak to be individually detectable can produce a strong stochastic background,\" Brito said. \"This work suggests that a careful analysis of the background in LIGO data may rule out \u2013 or detect \u2013 ultralight dark matter by gravitational-wave interferometers. \n\"This is a new, exciting frontier in astroparticle physics that could shed light on our understanding of the microscopic universe.\" \nLIGO has been offline for a few months for upgrades. The team plans to announce new, exciting results from its second observing run soon. \n\"Our work shows that careful analysis of stochastic gravitational waves in the data they have already taken may be used to place interesting constraints on the nature of dark matter ,\" Berti said. \nThis innovative work \"confirms the high quality of the work in astroparticle physics and gravitational-wave astronomy done by members of the gravitational physics group at UM, widely recognized as one of the leaders in the field,\" said Luca Bombelli, chair and professor of physics and astronomy at Ole Miss. \nMore information: Richard Brito et al.

Credit: Sharon Martinson \nn the tropical rainforests of Panama, Dartmouth's Hannah ter Hofstede is witness to what Charles Darwin called a \"struggle for existence.\" She studies a competition for survival that pits the cricket-like katydids rubbing their wings together to make their ultrasonic mating songs, and bats hearing that mating call as a dinner bell. \nTer Hofstede, an assistant professor of biological sciences, is exploring the acoustic world of bats and their insect prey. Assisting her are biologist Sharon Martinson and Neukom Fellow Laurel Symes, who climb high into the forest canopy to plant audio recorders to capture the katydid calls. \nHundreds of katydid species live on Panama's Barro Colorado Island, where the Dartmouth researchers conducted their studies. Some of their findings appear in the journal Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology . \nTer Hofstede first visited the island a decade ago while working on her PhD. \"I was just so amazed by the diversity. I was overwhelmed,\" she says. She also learned that the island insect population's life is not altogether idyllic. \n\"In Central America there is a group of bats from one particular family that specializes in gleaning,\" says ter Hofstede. \"Instead of flying around and catching insects in the air, they listen for sounds made by insects and fly down, grabbing them off vegetation.\" \nThe katydids must make their music to attract females, but this reveals their presence to predators. Bats similarly alert their prey, which are also listening for ultrasonic cues\u2014the echolocation sounds of bats on the hunt. \nThe scientists are searching for correlations between how obvious the katydids are to the bats and what kind of survival strategies the insects employ. Some listen for the echolocation sounds and then go quiet when they hear bats going by. \n\"Some katydids stay quiet, but then they increase their vibrational communication, shaking branches and things like that,\" she says. \"The bats, listening for the sounds the katydids typically make, don't seem to pick up on the branch shaking. Then there are katydids that produce a lot of sound but they always do it from thorny bushes or other places where the bats can't get at them.\" \nDarwin would have viewed all this as a tradeoff between selecting for more sound to entice mates and selecting for less sound to avoid predators. \"The combination of these conflicting selection pressures and the wide range of diversity in the katydid species suggests that there may be multiple solutions to this challenge,\" ter Hofstede says. \nTer Hofstede is now immersed in sifting through the enormous amount of data her team has collected over the past two years, looking for patterns of behavior across katydid species. \"My conclusion at this point is that every katydid species seems to be doing something different,\" she says. \nTer Hofstede says that her research examines the selection pressures animals contend with as they evolve and sheds light on the bigger picture of evolutionary biology. \n\"I don't think it is limited to katydids and bats where you get these kinds of conflicting pressures. Basically, every organism that exists needs to find food, mates, and avoid being eaten themselves. I think documenting the diversity of ways that animals do that is teaching us about the process of evolution for all animals.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "darwin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hofstede", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharon martinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hannah ter hofstede", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ter hofstede", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neukom fellow laurel symes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles darwin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dartmouth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "behavioral ecology and sociobiology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "panama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barro colorado island", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:55:23.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d1a57d4598bc9a1f71b4aad814849ec2e4243b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzya3oMFi9iXc.QflDwigWRoQ.RYSm_kpLhBLWViIq8GeXbOPvhLpeM8dSK3SLOAlQfV", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/xml-feed/biology-news/plants-animals/", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Plants &amp; Animals News - Biology news", "title": "Magpies can form friendships with people\u2014here's how", "title_full": "Magpies can form friendships with people\u2014here's how", "published": "2017-10-03T15:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2017/magpie.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d1a57d4598bc9a1f71b4aad814849ec2e4243b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzya3oMFi9iXc.QflDwigWRoQ.RYSm_kpLhBLWViIq8GeXbOPvhLpeM8dSK3SLOAlQfV", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Magpies can form friendships with people\u2014here's how", "text": "Magpies can form friendships with people\u2014here's how October 3, 2017 by Gisela Kaplan, The Conversation Credit: CC0 Public Domain \nCan one form a friendship with a magpie? \u2013even when adult males are protecting their nests during the swooping season? The short answer is:\" Yes, one can\" - although science has just begun to provide feasible explanations for friendship in animals, let alone for cross-species friendships between humans and wild birds. \nRavens and magpies are known to form powerful allegiances among themselves. In fact, Australia is thought to be a hotspot for cooperative behaviour in birds worldwide. They like to stick together with family and mates, in the good Australian way. \nOf course, many bird species may readily come to a feeding table and become tame enough to take food from our hand, but this isn't really \"friendship\". However, there is evidence that, remarkably, free-living magpies can forge lasting relationships with people, even without depending on us for food or shelter. \nWhen magpies are permanently ensconced on human property, they are also far less likely to swoop the people who live there. Over 80% of all successfully breeding magpies live near human houses, which means the vast majority of people, in fact, never get swooped. And since magpies can live between 25 and 30 years and are territorial, they can develop lifelong friendships with humans . This bond can extend to trusting certain people around their offspring. \nA key reason why friendships with magpies are possible is that we now know that magpies are able to recognise and remember individual human faces for many years. They can learn which nearby humans do not constitute a risk. They will remember someone who was good to them; equally, they remember negative encounters. \nWhy become friends? \nMagpies that actively form friendships with people make this investment (from their point of view) for good reason. Properties suitable for magpies are hard to come by and the competition is fierce. Most magpies will not secure a territory \u2013 let alone breed \u2013 until they are at least five years old. In fact, only about 14% of adult magpies ever succeed in breeding. And based on extensive magpie population research conducted by R. Carrick in the 1970s, even if they breed successfully every single year, they may successfully raise only seven to eleven chicks to adulthood and breeding in a lifetime. There is a lot at stake with every magpie clutch. \nThe difference between simply not swooping someone and a real friendship manifests in several ways. When magpies have formed an attachment they will often show their trust, for example, by formally introducing their offspring. They may allow their chicks to play near people, not fly away when a resident human is approaching, and actually approach or roost near a human. \nIn rare cases, they may even join in human activity. For example, magpies have helped me garden by walking in parallel to my weeding activity and displacing soil as I did. One magpie always perched on my kitchen window sill, looking in and watching my every move. \nOn one extraordinary occasion, an adult female magpie gingerly entered my house on foot, and hopped over to my desk where I was sitting. She watched me type on the keyboard and even looked at the screen. I had to get up to take a phone call and when I returned, the magpie had taken up a position at my keyboard, pecked the keys gently and then looked at the \"results\" on screen. \nThe bird was curious about everything I did. She also wanted to play with me and found my shoelaces particularly attractive, pulling them and then running away a little only to return for another go. \nImportantly, it was the bird (not hand-raised but a free-living adult female) that had begun to take the initiative and had chosen to socially interact and such behaviour, as research has shown particularly in primates, is affiliative and part of the basis of social bonds and friendships. \nRisky business \nIf magpies can be so good with humans how can one explain their swooping at people (even if it is only for a few weeks in the year)? It's worth bearing in mind that swooping magpies (invariably males on guard duty) do not act in aggression or anger but as nest defenders. The strategy they choose is based on risk assessment. \nA risk is posed by someone who is unknown and was not present at the time of nest building, which unfortunately is often the case in public places and parks. That person is then classified as a territorial intruder and thus a potential risk to its brood. At this point the male guarding the brooding female is obliged to perform a warning swoop, literally asking a person to step away from the nest area. \nIf warnings are ignored, the adult male may try to conduct a near contact swoop aimed at the head (the magpie can break its own neck if it makes contact, so it is a strategy of last resort only). Magpie swooping is generally a defensive action taken when someone unknown approaches who the magpie believes intends harm. It is not an arbitrary attack. \nWhen I was swooped for the first time in a public place I slowly walked over to the other side of the road. Importantly, I allowed the male to study my face and appearance from a safe distance so he could remember me in future, a useful strategy since we now know that magpies remember human faces. Taking a piece of mince or taking a wide berth around the magpies nest may eventually convince the nervous magpie that he does not need to deter this individual anymore because she or he poses little or no risk, and who knows, may even become a friend in future. \nA sure way of escalating conflict is to fence them with an umbrella or any other device, or to run away at high speed. This human approach may well confirm for the magpie that the person concerned is dangerous and needs to be fought with every available strategy. \nIn dealing with magpies , as in global politics, de-escalating a perceived conflict is usually the best strategy.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gisela kaplan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "r. carrick", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "magpies", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cc0 public domain  can", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:59:14.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f11b6de3d4c0d214bf6558b05f5723695b55123", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyazyNX4.Qi74GcVY9vCBb5eq3sVIaGWUmS4gokvKQzgmqq2mroYuI97MMei3pO48aOA3Pz.n6Caj0-", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/xml-feed/biology-news/plants-animals/", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Plants &amp; Animals News - Biology news", "title": "How gender and stereotypes can shape our relationship with dogs", "title_full": "How gender and stereotypes can shape our relationship with dogs", "published": "2017-10-03T15:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/howgenderand.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f11b6de3d4c0d214bf6558b05f5723695b55123", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyazyNX4.Qi74GcVY9vCBb5eq3sVIaGWUmS4gokvKQzgmqq2mroYuI97MMei3pO48aOA3Pz.n6Caj0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "How gender and stereotypes can shape our relationship with dogs", "text": "How gender and stereotypes can shape our relationship with dogs October 3, 2017 by Paul Mcgreevy And Fiona Probyn-Rapsey, The Conversation One man and his dog. Credit: Pierre Malou, Author provided \nThe relationship between people and their dogs can be a lasting and loving bond if the match is right. But when acquiring a dog, how do you know if that match will be a good one? \nResearch shows there is a difference in the way some dogs react to men and women, and it can also matter if the dog is a he or a she. \nThe challenge lies in understanding the interactions of dogs with humans. And part of that challenge can be influenced by gender stereotypes of both humans and dogs. \nThis shows why matching dogs to people is far more complicated than we might predict. \nHumans and dogs: a long history \nHumans have been co-evolving with dogs for thousands of years. We owe them a lot, including (perhaps surprisingly) the ways in which we experience and express gender via animals . \nThis often happens in negative ways, such as when women are referred to as bitches, cows, pigs, birds, chicks and men as wolves, pigs, rats. None of these animal metaphors have much to do with the animals themselves but more to do with how we use categories of animals to categorise humans. \nSo unpacking and challenging gender stereotypes might just also improve the lives of animals too. \nA 2006 landmark analysis of gender and dog ownership revealed that owners use their dogs as props to display their own gender identities . Dogs extend their innate social skills to humans. Credit: Paul McGreevy, Author provided \nParticipants in this study considered female dogs to be less aggressive but more moody than apparently more playful male dogs. They used gender stereotypes not only to select dogs, but also to describe and predict their dog's behaviour and personality. \nThe potential ramifications of this are important because such flawed predictions about dog behaviour can lead to a person giving up on their dog, which is then surrendered to a shelter. \nOnce surrendered, an aggressive bitch or uncooperative dog faces a grim future, with most dogs who fail a behavioural assessment being killed, adding to the troubling euthanasia rates in Australia. \nThat said, the predictive power of behaviour assessment in shelters is being questioned. Some say the ability of such assessments to reliably predict problematic behaviours in future adoptive homes is \" vanishingly unlikely \". Moreover, the assessments are likely to be informed by the gendered expectations and behaviours of the humans who assess, surrender or adopt. \nA small study in the UK in 1999 observed 30 dogs in shelters when approached by unfamiliar men and women. It found that the female dogs spent less time looking towards all the humans than the male dogs did. \nAll the dogs barked at and looked towards the women less than the men, which the researchers suggest shows that gender of the potential adopter plays a role in determining what a good match might look like, as well as the likelihood of adoption. \nEven the bond that dogs share with their primary care-giver may have gender differences. For example, in a 2008 Australian study (led by one of us, Paul), dog owners reported that male dogs showed elevated levels of separation-related distress compared to female dogs. They also reported that separation-related distress and food-related aggression increased with the number of human adult females in the household. \nDesexing, which is more than justified by the animal welfare benefits of population control, also complicates cultural beliefs about appropriate dog gender and may even influence a dog's problem-solving behaviour. A recent study published this year suggests that desexing may have a more negative effect on female than male dogs when it comes to aspects of cognition. Dogs and bitches may have different motivations. Credit: Paul McGreevy, Author provided \nA study (co-authored by one of us, Paul) published last month , that focused solely on working sheepdogs and their handlers (and so may have limited relevance to domestic companion dogs), is the first report of behavioural differences related to gender difference in both dogs and humans. \nGender stereotypes \nThese studies underline just how much the lives of dogs depend upon how they conform to gender expectations. In other words, it's not just how we humans interact with dogs that matters, it's how our genders interact as well. \nWhile we know how damaging stereotypes can be for humans, dog owners may not consider just how their conceptual baggage of gender stereotypes affects the animals they live with. \nMore research can help to shed light on the role that gender plays when it comes to making a good match between humans and their dogs; and by good match, we mean one that will result in a decrease in the likelihood of the dog being surrendered to a shelter or treated badly. \nThe take-home message from these studies is that, to be truly successful mutual companions, dogs don't need just any human, they need a complementary human who is open to reflecting critically on gender stereotypes. \nThanks partly to an uncritical adoption of gender stereotypes, the matching of dog and human is currently rudimentary at best. So we should not be surprised if dogs often fail to meet our expectations. \nWhen relationships go wrong, it's catastrophic for dogs, because it contributes to euthanasia rates in shelters. These deaths need to be better understood as a broader failure of human understanding about how their own beliefs and behaviour affect the dogs in their lives.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul mcgreevy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pierre malou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fiona probyn-rapsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:59:19.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b5ab3c980e435b6ab547f3afe839390f1c734772", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaJJu7atISJC7VCwYwBAtiXe2WA_Ly2Do0i7YGAVvsBS7uy_2BD9bSvFKYu7kCKTR3XJmuqdDi6V0-", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://phys.org/rss-feed/space-news", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Space News - Space, Astronomy, Space Exploration", "title": "Researchers conduct more accurate chemical analysis of the star 68 Tauri", "title_full": "Researchers conduct more accurate chemical analysis of the star 68 Tauri", "published": "2017-10-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/57-researchersc.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b5ab3c980e435b6ab547f3afe839390f1c734772", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaJJu7atISJC7VCwYwBAtiXe2WA_Ly2Do0i7YGAVvsBS7uy_2BD9bSvFKYu7kCKTR3XJmuqdDi6V0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Researchers conduct more accurate chemical analysis of the star 68 Tauri", "text": "Researchers conduct more accurate chemical analysis of the star 68 Tauri October 3, 2017 by Tomasz Nowakowski report The found abundance pattern in 68 Tauri: circles (Adelman and al.), dots (this work). Credit: Martinet et al., 2017. \n(Phys.org)\u2014French astronomers have recently presented a new abundance analysis of the star 68 Tauri (also known as HD 27962), which determines its chemical composition more precisely than previous studies. The results of the research are available in a paper published Sept. 28 on the arXiv pre-print repository. \nLocated some 150 light years from the Earth, 68 Tauri is a binary star in the Hyades open cluster. With an effective temperature of 9,025 K and a mass of nearly 2.3 solar masses, it is the hottest and most massive member of this cluster. \n68 Tauri was initially classified as main-sequence star of spectral type A. However, subsequent observations have shown that it is a chemically peculiar metallic-line star (Am star) due to its distinct underabundance of scandium and overabundances of the iron-peak and heavy elements. \nGiven that the last abundance analysis of 68 Tauri was performed in 2003, Sebastien Martinet of the Grenoble Alps University and Richard Monier of the Paris Observatory decided to conduct a new study with the aim of learning more about the composition of this star. The researchers used updated atomic data hoping to redetermine and expand the star's chemical composition . \n\"We have modeled the high resolution SOPHIE (R=75000) spectrum of 68 Tauri using updated model atmosphere and spectrum synthesis to derive chemical abundances in its atmosphere. In particular, we have studied the effect of the inclusion of the hyperfine structure of various barium isotopes on the determination of the baryum abundance in 68 Tauri. We have also derived new abundances using updated accurate atomic parameters retrieved from the NIST database,\" the paper reads. \nThe new analysis allowed the scientists to determine abundances of 68 Tauri more accurately, improving our understanding of chemical composition of this star. \nFor instance, the team found that 68 Tauri exhibits underabundance of scandium and slight underabundances in carbon, oxygen, magnesium, silicon and calcium, mild overabundances of the iron-peak elements and large overabundances of the rare-earth elements. \nFurthermore, as a result of including hyperfine structure of various isotopes of Barium, they found that the abundance of this element is significantly lower when compared to the study published in 2003. According to the study, this highlights the importance of hyperfine structure in such analyses. \n\"We find a large difference on the barium abundance when including the full hyperfine structure. (\u2026) We stress the importance of taking into account the hyperfine structure for all isotopes when available in order to derive accurate abundances,\" the researchers wrote in the paper. \nWhen it comes to abundances of other elements, the new study shows that they are consistent with the values presented in the previous study, except for scandium. The authors noted that the newly determined values generally differ from 0.01 dex up to 0.4 dex as a result of adopting new atomic data, confirming that 68 Tauri is a chemically peculiar Am star. \nMore information: Hyperfine Structure and Abundances of Heavy Elements in 68 Tauri (HD 27962), arXiv:1709.10068 [astro-ph.SR] arxiv.org/abs/1709.10068 \nAbstract HD 27962, also known as 68 Tauri, is a Chemically Peculiar Am star member of the Hyades Open Cluster in the local arm of the Galaxy.

The coffee table was cluttered with the artifacts of an all-nighter: an empty wine glass to calm her nerves alongside an empty coffee mug to fuel her through the night. \nSince midnight, Boyajian had been downloading and analyzing data from the Las Cumbres telescopes\u2014two on Maui, Hawaii, and two more on the Spanish island of Tenerife off the coast of West Africa\u2014that sat trained on an F-type star, bigger and hotter than the sun, near the constellation Cygnus. \nShe'd been working all night, but Boyajian had been waiting for this moment for four years. By 5 a.m., data from the telescopes in Maui confirmed what the ones in Tenerife had already said: The star formally known as KIC 8462852, now called \"Tabby's Star,\" had started to dim again. \nFor the next five days\u2014while Boyajian, her colleagues and a pack of crowdsourced amateur astronomers from around the world observed\u2014the star grew dimmer and dimmer. \n\"I don't think I slept for a week,\" says Boyajian, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Louisiana State University (LSU). \nAn event never seen on any star in the universe, it was as if the hand of God had turned a giant dimmer in the sky. Science proffered no explanations for what was causing the star to wane, how long it would last or how much light the star would lose. After the star had faded by 2 percent over the course of five days, the lights mysteriously rebounded more slowly than they dimmed. \nSince the star's discovery in 2009, the anomalous luminary has inspired theories behind its sensational odd-ball behavior. When astronomers and stargazers watch the star fade, are they witnessing the aftermath of a star devouring its planet? A catastrophic collision of planets? Or does the star's waning shed light on the ever elusive search for intelligent life? \nThis latest event in a string of inexplicable fluctuations could provide an answer. \nOn March 7, 2009, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched the Kepler Mission. Until May 2013, the Kepler spacecraft continuously monitored the same patch of sky in search of undiscovered exoplanets\u2014that is, planets that orbit stars other than our sun. \nWhile comprising less than one-tenth of a percent of the visible sky, the field under Kepler's gaze contained more than 150,000 stars. Throughout its mission, Kepler took a measurement known as a \"light curve\" of each star's brightness every 30 minutes. Dips in a star's brightness, also known as flux, can signal a planet is passing in front of it. \nThe light curves of more than 150,000 stars, captured every half-hour for four years, amount to more than 2.5 billion data points per year. Computer algorithms can search the data for light curves that would indicate the presence of an Earth-sized planet that orbits its star once a year but might not pick up planets whose orbits lasted longer than that. \nHumans, however, have unique pattern-recognition abilities. So, Boyajian and her colleagues at Yale University, where she was then a postdoctoral fellow, decided to crowdsource the data analysis. \nThey started Planet Hunters, a citizen science project through which amateur astronomers can mine the data captured by Kepler for trends computers don't detect. \nPosting their findings on an online forum, planet hunters sometimes detect patterns that lead to the discovery of a planet. Other times, they pick up on unusual behavior that puts certain stars on a watch list. That's what happened when amateur astronomer Adam Szewczyk saw that KIC 8462852 was dimming in a way planet transit couldn't cause. \nWhen Boyajian saw the posts in the forum about KIC 8462852, the skeptical scientist figured the data had to be wrong. After all, \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,\" she says, quoting Carl Sagan. \nWhen a planet passes in front of a star, it briefly blocks a miniscule shred of the star's light\u2014less than one-tenth of a percent\u2014for a few hours. Plotted on a graph, that slight dimming registers as a narrow, symmetrical dip in an otherwise straight line, like an icicle dangling from a rooftop. Once several of these dips are recorded, a pattern emerges, such as a star that loses .08 percent of its light for four hours every 75 days. That's how planets are discovered. \n\"But with this star, you don't have the regular, periodic dips,\" says Boyajian. \"There is no period in which you know dips will occur. The dips last for extraordinarily long periods of time\u2014different durations each time.\" \nThe shape of the dips on the light curve are irregular and asymmetrical\u2014and different every time. Taken together, these behaviors hardly suggest a planet is passing in front of the star at regular intervals. \nBoyajian was prepared to find an error in the data or a technical problem with the telescope itself. \n\"Stars just don't do that,\" she says. \nBut over the remaining years of the Kepler Mission, the telescope continued to record arbitrary dips in flux that were confirmed by several other space- and land-based telescopes pointed at the star. Its luminosity plummeted up to 22 percent in dips that lasted anywhere from five to 80 days. The star also faded cumulatively over those four years. What's more, other\u2014albeit hotly contested\u2014data captured through a different method before the Kepler Mission say the star faded by a full 16 percent between 1890\u20131989. \nBoyajian, several dozen other professional astronomers and 11 of the citizen scientists who helped uncover the star published a paper on its discovery in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , in which they cleverly asked, \"Where's the flux?\" and inspired followers of the luminary to call it the \"WTF Star.\" \nBoyajian suggests the flux could be hidden behind a swarm of comets that has fallen towards the star. Or perhaps rocky debris, stirred up after some sort of catastrophic collision, could be blocking the star's light at these unpredictable intervals. \nBut for each of the possible explanations Boyajian and her colleagues propose in their initial discovery paper, they offer solid reasons to question that theory. \n\"There's definitely nothing we know of now that's able to explain it,\" she says. \"Nature is a lot more creative than we are.\" Credit: Georgia State University \nMaybe so, but Tabby's Star has captured the imaginations of astronomers around the world. Their theories about what's blocking the star's light are nothing if not creative. \nA team of astronomers from Columbia University and the University of California (UC), Berkeley, says Tabby's Star might have devoured a planet or a moon more than 100 years ago. The energy intake froma meal like that would cause the star toshine brighter, which would explain the century of fading: The star was returning to its original luminosity after digesting the meal. \nAs for the random dips in flux since then, \"Anything that didn't quite get ealike leftover crumbs from a snack, could still be orbiting the star and occasionally blocking its light,\" says astronomer Jason Wright, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State University. \nWright keeps track of the latest theories on his blog. (Incidentally, he is the one who called KIC 8462852 \"Tabby's Star\" in an interview with a reporter, and the moniker stuck. \"Yes, it's all my fault,\" he admits.) \nWhile the planet-devouring theory explains the century-long dimming and the episodic dips, the architects of the theory acknowledge the statistical improbability of such an occurrence in their 2017 paper in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. \n\"The problem with Tabby's Star,\" says Daryll LaCourse, amateur astronomer and a co-author of the discovery paper, \"is that every explanation that doesn't involve aliens has some sort of problem, some unresolved big issue with that particular theory.\" \nAstronomers don't waste their time pinning alien theories on any old cosmic anomaly they encounter. They save these eyebrow-raising claims for oddities that simply can't be explained by natural causes. That makes Tabby's Star \"the most promising stellar SETI [search for extraterrestrial intelligence] target discovered to date,\" says Wright in his 2015 paper in the Astrophysical Journal . \nWright says a swarm of structures\u2014alien megastructures, he calls them\u2014built by other inhabitants of our universe could be orbiting the star to harness its energy, as humans do through solar panels. \n\"Imagine a flock of starlings flying in front of the sun,\" he says. In some places the flock would block out the sun's light; in others, fingers of light would poke through. Like a flock of birds, the formation of these alien structures could change, accounting for the irregular light curves. \nTo test any any of these hypotheses, astronomers needed more data than the Kepler Mission provided. They needed to observe the star for many more years and record many more dips in flux. But telescope time costs money. So Boyajian turned to Kickstarter, the online funding platform for creative projects. \n\"The most mysterious star in the galaxy,\" reads the title of Boyajian's campaign page. More than 1,700 backers contributed $107,421 to cover surveillance of Tabby's Star over a private, robotic network of telescopes. Las Cumbres Observatory gifted 200 hours on its Maui and Tenerife telescopes, which covered observation from March 2016 through February 2017. The Kickstarter funds covered observation thereafter, which will continue through May 2018. Data from the telescopes downloads to Boyajian's computer, where she plots it on a chart so she can identify when the star's light begins to drop. \nThat's what kept her up all night that Tuesday in May. \nAt 5 a.m., when it was clear the star was losing flux, Boyajian called Wright. \n\"It's time,\" she told him. \nThe beauty of scientific research that has been crowdsourced and crowdfunded almost from the start is that Boyajian can quickly send out an \"all hands on deck\" across the globe to people who want to help. She needed the support right away of anyone who could observe the dip via telescope or analyze the data the scopes produce. \n\"We had an awesome response from the entire astronomers' community, pitching in observations on telescopes we didn't know we had, folks taking their own time to take observations for us and figuring out how to share enormous amounts of data,\" she says. \nIt's a good thing Boyajian got to see her scientific support network in action. That way, she was ready for the next dip. By early June, Tabby's Star was bright again. Then, June 11, the flux began to trend back down. Like last time, the star faded by two percent, but this time the fading and rebounding took two weeks. \nData gathered from these events can help astronomers determine whether the material blocking the light is solid or diffuse. If the material is solid, alien megastructures can't be ruled out. \n\"As long as we don't have a convincing explanation for what's going on, and there's a possibility that what we're seeing is due to an advanced technology, we'll certainly continue to observe the star,\" says Andrew Siemion, director of UC Berkeley's SETI Research Center, who follows the star. \nAstronomers at Berkeley's SETI Research Center have spent a couple dozen hours observing Tabby's Star through the Green Bank telescope, the largest fully steerable radio telescope on Earth. In the spirit of crowdsourcing, the raw data will be made public so anyone with the skills can analyze it for signs that communication technology is present near the star. \nAliens capable of building massive structures that harvest the star's light would certainly have such technology. So far, no signs have been uncovered, but Siemion is undaunted. \n\"There is no more profound or fundamental question we can ask as scientists or human beings than whether there is other life elsewhere in the universe,\" he says. \"So, as long as I have a good idea and the means to pursue it, I will personally keep looking.\" \nSiemion is not alone. There's not a SETI researcher out there, he says, who hasn't looked at Tabby's Star. \nFor now, cosmic collisions, planet-devouring fireballs and, yes, even aliens are still on the table\u2014the coffee table in Boyajian's living room in Baton Rouge. \nBoyajian hasn't figured out exactly what's happening on her star yet, but she knows she's getting closer.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "adam szewczyk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tabby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boyajian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kickstarter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wright", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daryll lacourse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carl sagan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tabetha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason wright", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew siemion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kepler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siemion", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sonya collins credit", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "georgia state univer", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "kepler mission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia state university  maybe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penn state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal astronomical society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkeley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "astrophysical journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las cumbres observatory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lsu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tenerife", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tabby's star", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yale university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national aeronautics and space administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seti research center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uc berkeley", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baton rouge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las cumbres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkeley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tenerife", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:10:58.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2b881381dc7f1f8240384d55081d4e833b0b6f43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyacd0nwaWNlyny11eyR9b6QWGEBU6fzVDykhPD8zJVcRa8Qui5aMjRCtuWo.H0A7Hy", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/rss-feed/breaking/physics-news/", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Physics News - Physics News, Material Sciences, Science News, Physics", "title": "Scientists pinpoint the singularity for quantum computers", "title_full": "Scientists pinpoint the singularity for quantum computers", "published": "2017-10-03T15:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2017/1-scientistspi.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b881381dc7f1f8240384d55081d4e833b0b6f43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyacd0nwaWNlyny11eyR9b6QWGEBU6fzVDykhPD8zJVcRa8Qui5aMjRCtuWo.H0A7Hy", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Scientists pinpoint the singularity for quantum computers", "text": "Scientists pinpoint the singularity for quantum computers October 3, 2017 Dr Anthony Laing, Chris Sparrow and Alex Neville. Credit: University of Bristol \nResearchers from the University of Bristol have discovered that super-powerful quantum computers, which scientists and engineers across the world are racing to build, need to be even more powerful than previously thought before they can beat today's ordinary PCs. \nQuantum computers are a new type of machine that operate on quantum mechanical hardware and are predicted to give enormous speed advantages in solving certain problems. \nResearch groups at leading universities and companies, including Google, Microsoft and IBM, are part of a worldwide race to realise the first quantum computer that crosses into the 'quantum computational singularity'. \nThis represents a problem so complex that today's top supercomputer would take centuries to find a solution, while a quantum computer could crack it in minutes. \nNow a team of scientists from Bristol have discovered that the boundary to this singularity is further away than previously thought. \nThe research is reported this week in Nature Physics . \nThe results apply to a highly influential quantum algorithm known as 'boson sampling', which was devised as a very direct route to demonstrate quantum computing's supremacy over classical machines. \nThe boson sampling problem is designed to be solved by photons (particles of light) controlled in optical chips \u2013 technology pioneered by Bristol's Quantum Engineering and Technology Labs (QETLabs). \nPredicting the pattern of many photons emerging from a large optical chip is related to an extremely hard random matrix calculation. \nWith the rapid progress in quantum technologies, it appeared as though a boson sampling experiment that crossed into the quantum computational singularity was within reach. However, the Bristol team were able to redesign an old classical algorithm to simulate boson sampling, with dramatic consequences. \nDr Anthony Laing, who heads a group in QETLabs and led this research, said: \"It's like tuning up an old propeller aeroplane to go faster than an early jet aircraft. \n\"We're at a moment in history where it is still possible for classical algorithms to outperform the quantum algorithms that we expect to ultimately be supersonic. \n\"But demonstrating such a feat meant assembling a crack team of scientists, mathematicians, and programmers.\" \nClassical algorithms expert Dr Rapha\u00ebl Clifford, from Bristol's Department of Computer Science, redesigned several classical algorithms to attack the boson sampling problem, with the 1950's Metropolised Independence Sampling algorithm giving the best performance. \nThe simulation code was optimised by QETLabs researcher 'EJ', a former LucasArts programmer. Expertise on computational complexity came from Dr Ashley Montanaro, of Bristol's School of Mathematics, while QETLabs students Chris Sparrow and Patrick Birchall worked out the projected performance of the competing quantum photonics technology. \nAt the heart of the project and bringing all these strands together was QETLabs PhD student and first author on the paper, Alex Neville, who tested, implemented, compared, and analysed, all of the algorithms. \nHe said: \"The largest boson sampling experiment reported so far is for five photons. \n\"It was believed that 30 or even 20 photons would be enough to demonstrate quantum computational supremacy.\" \nYet he was able to simulate boson sampling for 20 photons on his own laptop, and increased the simulation size to 30 photons by using departmental servers. \nAlex added: \"With access to today's most powerful supercomputer, we could simulate boson sampling with 50 photons.\" \nThe research builds on Bristol's reputation as a centre of activity for quantum science and the development of quantum technologies. \nThrough QETLabs, the university has embarked on an ambitious programme to bring quantum technologies out of the laboratory and engineer them in to useful devices that have real-world applications for tackling some of society's toughest problems. \nIn addition to collaborations with tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Nokia, start-ups and new business activities focused on quantum technologies have emerged in Bristol. \nAn important theme across the overall quantum research activity is developing our understanding of exactly how quantum technologies can provably outperform conventional computers. \nRecently Dr Montanaro, together with Professor Noah Linden of the School of Mathematics, organised a Heilbronn Focused Research Group on the topic of quantum computational supremacy. \nThis meeting brought some of the world leaders in the field, from both industry and academia, to Bristol for a week of intense discussions and collaboration. Among the attendees was one of the theorists who devised boson sampling, Professor Scott Aaronson, from UT Austin. \nAlthough outperforming classical computers might take a little longer than originally hoped, Dr Laing is still optimistic about the prospects for building a device to do just that. \nHe said: \"We now have a solid idea of the technological challenge we must meet to demonstrate that quantum machines can out-compute their classical counterparts. For boson sampling, the singularity lies just beyond 50 photons. It's a tougher nut to crack than we first thought, but we still fancy our chances.\" \nWith Dr Laing's group focused on practical applications of quantum technologies , the current work puts bounds on the size and sophistication of photonic devices that will be required to tackle industrially relevant problems that are beyond the capabilities of today's classical algorithms.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris sp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "anthony laing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alex neville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris sparrow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott aaronson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rapha\u00ebl clifford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noah linden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick birchall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montanaro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashley montanaro", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucasarts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metropolised independence sampling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of bristol  researchers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of bristol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quantum engineering and technology labs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "school of mathematics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of computer science", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ut austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heilbronn focused research group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nokia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bristol", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:16:16.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42e4370044a5b1293ce1275987be33f347632cfa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaT4QvP3k0cR7tq.YlSzmA2MA1Pvgiajn8G6yBBftp4vw5Q3pEEZWiPEL0OFid.XomVGwe186TmGA-", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://phys.org/rss-feed/biology-news/biology-other/", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "General Biology news", "title": "Biologists on the trail of 'brain-eating amoebae'", "title_full": "Biologists on the trail of 'brain-eating amoebae'", "published": "2017-10-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/mbaribiologi.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "42e4370044a5b1293ce1275987be33f347632cfa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaT4QvP3k0cR7tq.YlSzmA2MA1Pvgiajn8G6yBBftp4vw5Q3pEEZWiPEL0OFid.XomVGwe186TmGA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Biologists on the trail of 'brain-eating amoebae'", "text": "Biologists on the trail of 'brain-eating amoebae' October 3, 2017 by Kim Fulton-Bennett Senior Research Technician Roman Marin III using a third-generation Environmental Sample Processor to collect water from the Gardner River in Montana.

But a recent field experiment in Yellowstone National Park saw MBARI researchers Kevan Yamahara and Roman Marin III dodging hordes of tourists and herds of elk while searching for \"brain-eating amoebae.\" \nThis might sound like the plotline for a bad B-movie, but for Yamahara and Marin it was just another chance to test out the water-sampling capabilities of MBARI's Environmental Sample Processor (ESP). For over 10 years, ESPs have been used to automatically collect and process water samples from New Zealand to Monterey Bay to Lake Erie to the Gulf of Maine. \nThe Yellowstone experiment is a part of a joint effort with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Montana State University to study a tiny amoeba, Naegleria fowleri. This amoeba is found in warm to hot bodies of freshwater around the world, and is relatively common in the U.S. South. It also shows up occasionally in hot springs, water heaters, and neti pots. \nIf you get water harboring Naegleria fowleri in your nose, there is a chance that the amoebae will migrate up your sinus nerve and into your brain, where they begin consuming nerve cells. The first symptoms, including headache, nausea, vomiting, and a stiff neck, appear in about five days. In another five days you are likely to be dead (the fatality rate is 97 percent).

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 40 people in the United States were infected with Naegleria fowleri between 2007 and 2016. \nAccording to the CDC, \"There are no rapid, standardized testing methods to detect and quantitate Naegleria fowleri in water\u2026 It can take weeks to identify the amoeba, but new detection tests are under development.\" The USGS is collaborating in the development process, which dovetails with a larger USGS effort to place automated water-monitoring systems on stream gauges around the country. \nThat's where the ESP could eventually come in handy, not only in monitoring disease-causing organisms such as Naegleria, but also in collecting environmental DNA that could be used to detect the presence of zebra mussels and other invasive species. (Environmental DNA is genetic material that is released by organisms into their surroundings through normal biological processes such as urination or sluffed skin.) \nIn the recent field experiment, MBARI researchers used two different types of ESPs to process water samples from the Gardner River, close to the Montana/Wyoming border. A small, portable, third-generation ESP was carried out into the field to filter and process samples taken directly from the river. An older, second-generation ESP was installed at Montana State University and used to process water samples that the researchers brought back from the river in carboys. ourists soak in warm waters of the Gardner River while Montana State University graduate student George Platt (center) collects a carboy of water for the study of brain-eating amoebae. Credit: Kevan Yamahara/MBARI \nAfter the ESPs processed and filtered the water samples, researchers removed filters from the ESPs and shipped them to USGS and CDC labs for further processing and testing for Naegleria. \nThough Marin and Yamahara enjoyed the Yellowstone scenery, it was hard work hiking to and from the river carrying batteries and heavy equipment, not to mention 60 liters of water. In addition, the stretch of river where the team collected the water samples turned out to be quite a busy place. While collecting water samples , the team had to work around travelers who flock to the river to soak its warm waters, apparently unconcerned about the (probably minor) risk of having their brains infected by amoebae. More inspiring was a herd of elk that wandered in and out of the sampling area, oblivious to both the researchers and the tourists. \nThis pilot project, funded by a USGS Innovation Center grant, is just the first in a series of tests to determine if the ESP can be used by the USGS to monitor waters across the United States. Like a migrating salmon, the ESP has begun making its way out of the ocean and into freshwater streams and lakes far inland.

The study reveals a shifting balance between evergreen oaks, which developed during warmer times with increased drought stress, and Atlas cedar, which expanded during cooler intervals. \nThe findings highlight the exposure of Northwest African forests to climate change , and underscore the particular threat to the endangered Atlas cedar from projected future warming. \nThe study also shows that forest cover in the Middle Atlas mountain range has now reached its lowest level since the end of the last Ice Age. A combination of drier climate, increased wildfire activity and farming are implicated in gradual forest decline during the last 4000 years. Human pressure on forest resources then appears to have increased significantly around 1300 years ago, during a time of social upheaval in North Africa during the Early Muslim period. \nNevertheless, climate-driven fluctuations are evident throughout the record, despite opening of the forest cover and intensification of human impact. \n\"Records of past ecological responses to climate change and human activity have a vital role to play in helping us to understand the fragility of natural environments in a changing world. Our long-term goal is to inform conservation measures for key species like the endangered Atlas cedar, and to ultimately mitigate against the most damaging impacts of global climate change ,\" says Dr William Fletcher. \nThe article is published in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution .

In the case of mildew, the project achieved a 50 percent reduction in the number of treatments required, and in relation to powdery mildew , the amount of product dropped by 25 percent in comparison with the usual model employed by wineries and vine-growers. \nOver a single hectare, this reduction leads to an economic savings of 28 percent in the case mildew and 90 percent in the case of powdery mildew. The results were presented at an event held in Arkaute. \nThe FITOVID project lasted for three years and focused on the treatment of mildew and powdery mildew, the two most common diseases in the vineyards of La Rioja Alavesa and txakoli vineyards. Work was carried out in plots located in two different agro-climate zones, one in Laguardia (Alava) and the other in Aia (Gipuzkoa). A diverse range of phytosanitary products were applied to the most representative vine variety in each region: Tempranillo in Laguardia and Hondarrabi zuri in Aia. The research work consisted of using new handling techniques with the most common phytosanitary products, as well as assessing the use of so-called 'zero residue' phytosanitary products as an alternative to conventional varieties. \nThe plots were divided into sub-plots, with a different combination of treatment being applied to each during the 2015 and 2016 seasons. The fruit and harvests obtained were analysed at the UPV/EHU in order to assess the persistence of phytosanitary products in the soil, water and vine products themselves (grapes, must and wine). AZTI was responsible for carrying out human toxicity and bio-accessibility analyses for these same products using zebra fish. Tecnalia's input consisted of the development of a device which is capable of detecting mildew before the moment that its symptoms become visible to the human eye. This tool will make it easier to decide when, exactly, to apply the first treatment in order to decrease the infectious pressure of the micro-organism which causes the disease. UPC has run training courses for vine growers and technicians working in the industry regarding how to calibrate the machinery used to apply phytosanitary products, paying special attention to the need to ensure optimum conditions in these machines in order to help reduce the amount of product released into the environment. Also, ensuring the correct dose reduces excess residue in the end product.

Researchers used a novel integrated respiratory assessment paradigm (IRAP) to screen both the fish's aerobic capacity and tolerance for low-oxygen (hypoxic) levels, grouping the fish into hypoxia tolerant and hypoxia sensitive phenotypic groups. They then exposed the fish to dispersed crude oil for 48 hours. \nThe fish's performance was retested nearly six months later\u2014much longer than most previous studies \u2013 to see if the exposure to oil had residual effects. \n\"After oil exposure, sea bass that were previously strong hypoxic performers lost their edge,\" said Yangfan Zhang, a UBC zoologist in the Faculty of Land and Food Systems and lead author on the study. \n\"Had we not distinguished the hypoxia tolerant and hypoxia sensitive phenotypes we would have missed an important effect. Obviously, this is concerning, not only in terms of the survival of certain individuals, but in terms of the impact that exposures might have on weakening the species' gene pool.\" \nSurprisingly, the researchers, who published the findings in Aquatic Toxicology, didn't find any long-term residual impacts on fish that were weaker hypoxic performers. Exposure to oil also had no long-term residual impact on the fish's aerobic performance. \n\"Ecologically, sea bass that can tolerate low oxygen represent an important component of the gene pool for this species to survive the periodic bouts of hypoxia in their habitat, which are increasing in frequency in a global sense,\" said study co-author Tony Farrell, with UBC's Faculty of Land and Food Systems and the Department of Zoology. \n\"So even subtle residual effects on this group of high performing fish could be of great concern for population dynamics, recruitment and production.\" \n\"Besides bringing new knowledge about the impact of oil exposure on a marine organism, this project highlights a fruitful collaboration between scientists and the oil industry, for the benefit of all,\" said project leader Guy Claireaux, professor at the University of Brest, France.

Credit: Thomas Splettstoesser (Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 4.0) \n(Phys.org)\u2014A team of researchers from the University of California and the University of Tokyo has found a way to use the CRISPR gene editing technique that does not rely on a virus for delivery. In their paper published in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering , the group describes the new technique, how well it works and improvements that need to be made to make it a viable gene editing tool. \nCRISPR-Cas9 has been in the news a lot lately because it allows researchers to directly edit genes\u2014either disabling unwanted parts or replacing them altogether. But despite many success stories, the technique still suffers from a major deficit that prevents it from being used as a true medical tool\u2014it sometimes makes mistakes. Those mistakes can cause small or big problems for a host depending on what goes wrong. Prior research has suggested that the majority of mistakes are due to delivery problems, which means that a replacement for the virus part of the technique is required. In this new effort, the researchers report that they have discovered just a such a replacement, and it worked so well that it was able to repair a gene mutation in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse model. The team has named the new technique CRISPR-Gold, because a gold nanoparticle was used to deliver the gene editing molecules instead of a virus. \nThe new package was created by modifying a bit of DNA to cause it to stick to a gold nanoparticle and then a Cas9 protein and also an RNA guide. The package was then coated with a polymer that served as a containment casing\u2014one that also triggered endocytosis (a form of cell transport) and helped the molecules escape endosomes once inside the target cells. The molecules then set to work\u2014the Cas9 cut the target DNA strand, the guide RNA showed what needed to be done and a DNA strand was placed where a mutation had existed. The result was a gene free of a mutation that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. \nThere is still a major problem to overcome with the technique, however\u2014it only works in localized applications. Ideally, a mass of packages would be injected into the bloodstream allowing for repair of all cell types, such as muscles impaired by a mutant gene. \nMore information: Kunwoo Lee et al.

However, it is challenging to develop homology-directed repair-based therapeutics because they require the simultaneous in vivo delivery of Cas9 protein, guide RNA and donor DNA. Here, we demonstrate that a delivery vehicle composed of gold nanoparticles conjugated to DNA and complexed with cationic endosomal disruptive polymers can deliver Cas9 ribonucleoprotein and donor DNA into a wide variety of cell types and efficiently correct the DNA mutation that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy in mice via local injection, with minimal off-target DNA damage.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob yirka", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kunwoo lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas splettstoesser", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wikipedia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nature biomedical engineering", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:27:10.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "de5eb36320828bd89ac6789989618bb8a58e3736", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaJHpe8VXl3mbwyBMjep8vScXbf8kH_9mlh_rdvR.n1LHCYtZXqe.PCA--", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/rss-feed/breaking/biology-news/", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Biology News - Evolution, Cell theory, Gene theory, Microbiology, Biotechnology", "title": "Clumps as temporary storage", "title_full": "Clumps as temporary storage", "published": "2017-10-03T15:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/clumpsastemp.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "de5eb36320828bd89ac6789989618bb8a58e3736", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaJHpe8VXl3mbwyBMjep8vScXbf8kH_9mlh_rdvR.n1LHCYtZXqe.PCA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Clumps as temporary storage", "text": "Clumps as temporary storage October 3, 2017 by Peter R\u00fcegg Yeast cells without protein aggregates (left) and those with (bright luminous spots): In times of starvation, the clumps serve as temporary storage for proteins. Credit: Matthias Peter / ETH Zurich \nResearchers at ETH have discovered that the formation of protein aggregates in yeast cells is reversible. This casts new light on human diseases that can be attributed to certain protein aggregates. \nProtein aggregates have a bad reputation. A number of human diseases, especially those of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are due to the clumping of degenerate proteins in nerve cells , creating aggregates that the cells cannot dissolve. This causes the cells to die. \nNow, researchers led by ETH Professor Matthias Peter and Reinhard Dechant have shed new light on protein aggregates in a study involving yeast cells . The corresponding paper has just been published in the journal Nature Cell Biology . In it, the ETH scientists show that protein clumps form in yeast cells in response to stress factors such as nutrient starvation or heat. If the cells survive the stress, they can dissolve the aggregates again, quickly recycle the individual components, and use them for cellular metabolism. \nClumps form in response to stress \nThe researchers' discovery of the enzyme Cdc19 is an example of a protein that clumps together under stress. The enzyme supplies energy to the cells. The researchers discovered that Cdc19 breaks down into four identical subunits upon glucose starvation. These subunits then change their original shape and clump together with other molecules, such as ribonucleic acids or other enzymes, to form aggregates. The researchers refer to these clumps as stress granules. Once incorporated into an aggregate of this kind, Cdc19 becomes inactive and is no longer able to produce fuel for the cell. During this time, the cell can neither grow nor multiply. \nHowever, the process is reversible. As soon as the stress has passed, the stress granules dissolve, and the four subunits of Cdc19 assemble together so that the enzyme can resume its role in glucose metabolism. \nThe clumps have a clear purpose, says Matthias Peter: \"The yeast cell uses aggregates as a sort of warehouse for important enzymes, so that these are protected from breakdown in stress situations and can be reactivated immediately after the cell survives the stress.\" The aggregates, he says, protect these molecules from being broken down by the cell's own disposal mechanisms. If the cell had to synthesise these compounds again after each stress situation, it would cost the cell a lot of time and energy. \nA simple sequence is sufficient for clumping \nThe researchers also clarified how and why Cdc19 is able to form clumps. In the structure of a Cdc19 subunit, they identified a short, unfolded subsection with a simple composition. In technical terms, these sections are known as \"low complexity regions\" (LCRs), and the researchers say they also occur in other aggregate-forming proteins in other organisms, including humans. \n\"The LCRs are exposed due to the breakdown of the enzyme complex and trigger the aggregation process,\" says Peter. \"It was therefore important for us to find a sequence of this kind in Cdc19. This confirms that there is a general mechanism.\" In the yeast's normal state, the LCR of Cdc19 is concealed, or has several phosphate groups that the LCR \"deactivates\". It is only in the event of nutrient stress that the LCR emerges and the phosphate groups are removed \u2013 and only then can aggregates form. \nAn important finding \n\"Our research has created a sense of a new awakening in the scientific community,\" says Reinhard Dechant, a group leader at the Institute of Biochemistry, who led the study together with Matthias Peter. Until now, he says, aggregates were primarily seen as pathogenic particles, because the only thing visible in patients is the result of the process \u2013 that is, insoluble protein plaques that cause a disease. \"Our paper also examines the start of aggregation and how it progresses,\" says Dechant, explaining that protein clumps will not form simply because of a disease, but rather because the cell needs them in order to survive a stress situation. \"For the first time, we were able to show that both the formation and the breakdown of aggregates is an important mechanism in cells.\" \nOther ETH Zurich research groups examining aggregates in yeast cells have made similar discoveries in the past. Accordingly, other ETH scientists were able to demonstrate that clumps of degenerate proteins work, among other things, like a memory and help the cells to store past (negative) experiences (as reported in ETH News). It therefore appears that the functional aggregation of certain proteins is a widespread regulatory mechanism.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter r\u00fcegg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "matthias peter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dechant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reinhard dechant", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eth zurich  researchers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nature cell biology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eth zurich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lcr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eth news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute of biochemistry", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:27:13.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b958ec75433f9aeadd3a095cdc2723622d7bbd1c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyawcT5ko2zddGb6oqnNv9Db1586drZP.rfjFqAkAvVpj6Wft73npeqWgvK_cJqeVnHgGH.ZmPrSVCkTpS5Vg91mQ--", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/rss-feed/chemistry-news/materials-science/", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Materials Science News - Chemistry News", "title": "New efficient catalyst for key step in artificial photosynthesis", "title_full": "New efficient catalyst for key step in artificial photosynthesis", "published": "2017-10-03T15:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2017/2-newefficient.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b958ec75433f9aeadd3a095cdc2723622d7bbd1c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyawcT5ko2zddGb6oqnNv9Db1586drZP.rfjFqAkAvVpj6Wft73npeqWgvK_cJqeVnHgGH.ZmPrSVCkTpS5Vg91mQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "New efficient catalyst for key step in artificial photosynthesis", "text": "New efficient catalyst for key step in artificial photosynthesis October 3, 2017 by Karen Mcnulty Walsh Research team leader Javier Concepcion (standing, left) with Yan Xie, David Shaffer, and David Szalda. Credit: Brookhaven National Laboratory \nChemists at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory have designed a new catalyst that speeds up the rate of a key step in \"artificial photosynthesis\"\u2014an effort to mimic how plants, algae, and some bacteria harness sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into energy-rich fuels. This step\u2014called water oxidation\u2014releases protons and electrons from water molecules, producing oxygen as a byproduct. \nThis \"single-site\" catalyst\u2014meaning the entire reaction sequence takes place on a single catalytic site of one molecule\u2014is the first to match the efficiency of the catalytic sites that drive this reaction in nature. The single-site design and high efficiency greatly improve the potential for making efficient solar-to-fuel conversion devices. \n\"The end goal is to break out those molecular building blocks\u2014the protons and electrons\u2014to make fuels such as hydrogen,\" said David Shaffer, a Brookhaven research associate and lead author on a paper describing the work in the Journal of the American Chemical Society . \"The more efficient the water oxidation cycle is, the more energy we can store.\" \nBut breaking apart water molecules isn't easy. \n\"Water is very stable,\" said Brookhaven chemist Javier Concepcion, who led the research team. \"Water can undergo many boiling/condensing cycles and it stays as H2O. To get the protons and electrons out, we need to make the water molecules react with each other.\" \nThe catalyst acts as a chemical handler, shuffling around the water molecules ' assets\u2014electrons, hydrogen ions (protons), and oxygen atoms\u2014to get the reaction to happen. Bubbles indicate the rapid production of oxygen (O2) when the catalyst is added to the solution. For each O2 molecule produced, four protons (H+) and four electrons are released\u2014enough to make two hydrogen (H2) molecules. Credit: Brookhaven National Laboratory \nThe new catalyst design builds on one the group developed last year, led by graduate student Yan Xie, which was also a single-site catalyst, with all the components needed for the reaction on a single molecule. This approach is attractive because the scientists can optimize how the various parts are arranged so that reacting molecules come together in just the right way. Such catalysts don't depend on the free diffusion of molecules in a solution to achieve reactions, so they tend to continue functioning even when fixed to a surface, as they would be in real-world devices. \n\"We used computer modeling to study the reactions at the theoretical level to help us design our molecules,\" Concepcion said. \"From the calculations we have an idea of what will work or not, which saves time before we get into the lab.\" \nIn both Xie's design and the new improvement, there's a metal at the core of the molecule, surrounded by other components the scientists can choose to give the catalyst particular properties. The reaction starts by oxidizing the metal, which pulls electrons away from the oxygen on a water molecule. That leaves behind a \"positively charged,\" or \"activated,\" oxygen and two positively charged hydrogens (protons). \n\"Taking electrons away makes the protons easier to release. But you need those protons to go somewhere. And it's more efficient if you remove the electrons and protons at the same time to prevent the build-up of excess charges,\" Concepcion said. \"So Xie added phosphonate groups as ligands on the metal to act as a base that would accept those protons,\" he explained. Those phosphonate groups also made it easier to oxidize the metal to remove the electrons in the first place. \nBut there was still a problem. In order to activate the H2O molecule, you first need it to bind to the metal atom at the center of the catalyst. David Shaffer injects the catalyst into the reaction solution as Javier Concepcion looks on. Credit: Brookhaven National Laboratory \nIn the first design, the phosphonate groups were so strongly bound to the metal that they were preventing the water molecule from binding to the catalyst early enough to keep the process running smoothly. That slowed the catalytic cycle down. \nSo the team made a substitution. They kept one phosphonate group to act as the base, but swapped out the other for a less-tightly-bound carboxylate. \n\"The carboxylate group can more easily adjust its coordination to the metal center to allow the water molecule to come in and react at an earlier stage,\" Shaffer said. \n\"When we are trying to design better catalysts, we first try to figure out what is the slowest step. Then we redesign the catalyst to make that step faster,\" he said. \"Yan's work made one step faster, and that made one of the other steps end up being the slowest step. So in the current work we accelerated that second step while keeping the first one fast.\" \nThe improvement transformed a catalyst that created two or three oxygen molecules per second to one that produces more than 100 per second\u2014with a corresponding increase in the production of protons and electrons that can be used to create hydrogen fuel. The new catalyst has a ruthenium (Ru) atom at its core, a \"pendant\" phosphonate group to act as a base that accepts protons (H+) from water, and a more flexible, or \"labile,\" carboxylate group that facilitates the interaction of the catalyst with water. Credit: Brookhaven National Laboratory \n\"That's a rate that is comparable to the rate of this reaction in natural photosynthesis, per catalytic site,\" Concepcion said. \"The natural photosynthesis catalyst has four metal centers and ours only has one,\" he explained. \"But the natural system is very complex with thousands and thousands of atoms. It would be extremely hard to replicate something like that in the lab. This is a single molecule and it does the same function as that very complex system.\" \nThe next step is to test the new catalyst in devices incorporating electrodes and other components for converting the protons and electrons to hydrogen fuel\u2014and then later, with light-absorbing compounds to provide energy to drive the whole reaction. \n\"We have now systems that are working quite well, so we are very hopeful,\" Concepcion said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "karen mcnulty wa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "concepcion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david shaffer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "javier concepcion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yan xie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david szalda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shaffer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "brookhaven national laboratory  chemists", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookhaven", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of energy's brookhaven national laboratory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chemical society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookhaven national laboratory", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:39:08.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c34d5b873c22122bef0065344f735016687bb156", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzya07bH3wXTNGLEg2OckIuuOPb0VZ7F4OJ979TJJLigAWpcuK3WLCiafw--", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/rss-feed/chemistry-news/materials-science/", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Materials Science News - Chemistry News", "title": "Chemists teach computer program to model forces between atoms accurately", "title_full": "Chemists teach computer program to model forces between atoms accurately", "published": "2017-10-03T15:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2017/chemiststeac.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c34d5b873c22122bef0065344f735016687bb156", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzya07bH3wXTNGLEg2OckIuuOPb0VZ7F4OJ979TJJLigAWpcuK3WLCiafw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Chemists teach computer program to model forces between atoms accurately", "text": "Chemists teach computer program to model forces between atoms accurately October 3, 2017 Credit: MIPT \nA team of researchers from MIPT, Skoltech, and Dukhov Research Institute of Automatics, led by Artem Oganov, used a machine learning technique to model the behavior of aluminum and uranium in the liquid and crystalline phases at various temperatures and pressures. Such simulations of chemical systems can predict their properties under a range of conditions before experiments are performed, enabling further work with only the most promising materials. The research findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports . \nComputer chemistry \nRapid advances in science over the last 100 years have resulted in the discovery of an astonishing number of organic and inorganic compounds, protein and lipid structures, and chemical reactions. But with all these new structures and molecules, an increasing amount of time is necessary to study their makeup, biochemical and physical properties, and to test the models of their behavior under various conditions and their possible interactions with other compounds. Such research can now be accelerated using computer modeling. \nThe force field approach is currently the dominant modeling technique. It makes use of a set of parameters describing a given biochemical system. These include bond lengths, angles and charges, among others. However, this technique is unable to reproduce the quantum mechanical forces at play in molecules accurately. Accurate quantum mechanical calculations are time consuming. Additionally, they only enable predictions of the behavior of samples that are at best several hundred atoms large. \nMachine learning approaches to molecular modeling are of great interest to chemists. They enable models that are trained on relatively small data sets obtained by means of quantum mechanical calculations. Such models can then replace quantum mechanical calculations , because they are just as accurate and require about 1,000 times less computing power. \nProgress made by machine learning tools modeling interactions between atoms \nThe researchers used machine learning to model the interactions between atoms in crystalline and liquid aluminum and uranium. Aluminum is a well-studied metal whose physical and chemical properties are known to scientists. Uranium, by contrast, was chosen because there are conflicting published data on its physical and chemical properties, which the researchers sought to define more accurately. \nThe paper details their study of such material properties as the phonon density of states, entropy, and the melting temperature of aluminum. \n\"The magnitudes of interatomic forces in crystals can be used to predict how atoms of the same element will behave under different temperatures and in a different phase,\" says Ivan Kruglov from the Computational Materials Design Laboratory at MIPT. \"By the same token, you can use the data on the properties of a liquid to find out how the atoms will behave in a crystal. This means that by finding out more about the crystal structure of uranium, we can eventually reconstruct the entire phase diagram for this metal. Phase diagrams are charts indicating the properties of elements as a function of pressure and temperature. They are used to determine the limits to the applicability of a given element.\" \nTo make sure that the data yielded by computer simulations is valid, they are compared to experimental results. The method used by the researchers was in good agreement with prior experiments. The information obtained with the approach based on machine learning had a lower error rate, compared to the modeling techniques using force fields. \nIn this study, the authors improve on their 2016 results in terms of the speed and accuracy of atomic system modeling using machine learning.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:39:11.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "21b00a11cf25c12e73b660b1ab411d11eb34d43b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyacd0nwaWNlyny11eyR9b6QbnLVqYgZyDBcrpLEdmKPNsctij4Fov_kywg1dgKC2tM5DwjzS9M56Ed_RNUZethAg--", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://phys.org/rss-feed/space-news", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Space News - Space, Astronomy, Space Exploration", "title": "Scientists behind the discovery of gravitational waves win the 2017 Nobel Prize for Physics", "title_full": "Scientists behind the discovery of gravitational waves win the 2017 Nobel Prize for Physics", "published": "2017-10-03T16:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/1-1-scientistsbe.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "21b00a11cf25c12e73b660b1ab411d11eb34d43b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyacd0nwaWNlyny11eyR9b6QbnLVqYgZyDBcrpLEdmKPNsctij4Fov_kywg1dgKC2tM5DwjzS9M56Ed_RNUZethAg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Scientists behind the discovery of gravitational waves win the 2017 Nobel Prize for Physics", "text": "Scientists behind the discovery of gravitational waves win the 2017 Nobel Prize for Physics October 3, 2017 by Ed Daw, The Conversation This year\u2019s winners. Illustration by N. Elmehed. Credit: NobelPrize.org, CC BY-SA \nThe Swedish Academy of Sciences has announced that the 2017 Nobel prize in Physics goes to three scientists for their foundational work leading to the discovery of ripples in the fabric of space and time known as gravitational waves. \nHalf of the \u00a3825,000 prize sum will go to Rainer Weiss of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the other half will be be shared by Kip Thorne of Caltech and Barry C Barish , also at Caltech. The scientists, all from the LIGO/VIRGO collaboration, conceived and played major roles in realising the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, which first detected the waves in September 2015. I'm pleased to see this achievement recognised on behalf of the thousands of scientists who work on LIGO, including the University of Sheffield group . I also know the recipients personally, in particular Weiss, who is a friend as well as a colleague. \nGravitational waves, predicted by Einstein in 1916, travel across our universe at the speed of light \u2013 stretching space in one direction and shrinking it in the direction that is at right angles. LIGO measures these fluctuations by monitoring two light beams travelling between pairs of mirrors down pipes running in different directions. \nThe source of the first detected signals was a pair of black holes, each being about 30 times the mass of the sun. These bodies once collided and converted in to one large spinning black hole \u2013 emitting three sun masses worth of pure energy in about a tenth of a second. For that short time, the source outshines the rest of the energy sources in the observable universe \u2013 combined! It's quite something to try and imagine. Despite being such a violent event, it is so far away that the effects on our local fabric of space and time here on Earth are very subtle \u2013 which is why a sophisticated detector like LIGO was needed to make the first detection. \nSeveral more binary black hole signals have been detected by the LIGO detectors since, and one announced just days ago was detected by the Virgo detector in Italy as well. Now that we know these signals exist and can be detected, a new field of gravitational wave astronomy will grow up, enabling us to probe the dark and puzzling universe \u2013 phenomena in the cosmos that don't emit much light but have a lot of mass. It's an exciting time. \nUnconventional, sharp and fun \nThose of us at LIGO who know Weiss will agree he is an unconventional fellow in the best sense of that description who has inspired a generation of experimental physicists, myself included. Aerial view of the facility. Credit: Kanijoman/Flickr, CC BY-SA \nThe first time I met Weiss properly was when he interviewed me for my first postdoc, at MIT. I was in my only smart suit, he walked in wearing a woolly hat, baggy sweater and jeans. I had to reassure him that this was the last time he'd see me dressed up that way. He looked relieved. \nWeiss has a refreshingly informal approach to physics, which is particularly helpful in encouraging others in their work, especially the young. But this informality and enthusiasm only just conceals his razor-sharp instinct for physics, particularly for sources of background noise and for electronics. \nAnd, because he is what I would call \"scientifically sociable\", Weiss naturally tends to learn things quickly by talking to people. When I was working at the LIGO lab at Livingston, I did an early systematic comparison of seismic noise between the two LIGO sites in a key frequency range. The tough thing back then was just gathering enough data from the seismometers to be able to make a meaningful comparison between the noise levels. \nI'd just made a graph of the results, and I was in the control room staring at it when Weiss walked in. He walked out a few minutes later with a copy of that plot, and the next thing I knew, he was using it in talks to the National Science Foundation when arguing for an upgrade to LIGO Livingston's seismic isolation system. That's Weiss in a nutshell. He's quick on the uptake, good at spotting the key points and problems, and authoritative enough to get others \u2013 physicists, engineers and funders on his side. \nWe also share a love of music. Once when I was invited to dinner at his house, I was asked to bring my cello and had to sight-read several cello sonata movements (rather shakily) with Weiss at the piano. He also showed up to a particularly memorable \"hoodoo party night\" at a club called Tabby's blues box in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where I was playing in a band. He brought along Gaby Gonzalez, who until recently was chairperson of the LIGO scientific collaboration and Peter Saulson, a professor of physics and thermal noise pioneer from Syracuse. A more unlikely crowd on the dance floor at Tabby's has probably not been seen before or since. They had a great time. \nThe future of gravitational wave physics is now intimately tied up with the future of astronomy. The field is set to expand rapidly, with more sensitive instruments needed to sense smaller signals and larger scale instruments needed to probe lower frequencies where many of the astronomical signals lie. We also need observers of the heavens, both to interpret the signals we measure, and to make the link between gravitational waves and other sources of information, such as gamma ray and neutrino bursts, and visible transients.

Credit: Huang et al. Published in Nature Communications \n(Phys.org)\u2014A new study shows that plant-consuming microorganisms that reside in coalbeds can convert plant carbohydrates into natural gas, potentially offering a sustainable, clean method of energy generation. \nFor more than a century, coalbeds have not only been a source of coal, but of natural gas as well. Until recently, it was thought that the natural gas in coalbeds formed millions of years ago, at the same time the coal itself was being formed. In recent years, however, scientists have discovered that there are microorganisms that currently live in coalbeds that feed on the hydrocarbons in the coal, and in doing so convert the coal into natural gas. \nUnfortunately, once the natural gas from coalbeds begins to be pumped from the wells, it becomes rapidly depleted within a few years. Research has shown that this depletion occurs because the microorganisms run out of bioavailable carbon content from the coal\u2014essentially, they have nothing left to eat. While there have been several attempts to biostimulate the microorganisms with additional nutrients, in the end the microorganisms still require bioavailable carbon from the coal to continue producing natural gas. \nNow in a new study published in Nature Communications , researchers Zaixing Huang et al., from the University of Wyoming and Taiyuan University of Technology, have investigated whether the microorganisms living in coalbeds might expand their appetite to consume plant-derived carbohydrates in addition to coal. \nThe researchers found that, when their diets were supplemented with carbohydrates from crops such as alfalfa, switch grass, miscanthus, and sugar beet, the microorganisms increased the production of natural gas. This is the first time it has been shown that microorganisms living in coalbeds can convert something other than coal into natural gas. \n\"The greatest significance of the research is to show that renewable natural gas can be produced within geological formations with unprecedented scalability and meanwhile reduce the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide ,\" Huang told Phys.org . \"There is the possibility to reduce the extent of heavy reliance on fossil fuels as primary energy and hence the opportunity of mitigating global warming.\" \nAs the researchers explain, the new process not only has the potential to increase the overall production rate of natural gas from coalbeds, but also to do so in a carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative way\u2014that is, the process may take in more carbon than it releases. When the microorganisms use coal as a food source, the natural gas produced from the coal is considered carbon-positive, as the coal had been sequestered in the earth for millions of years. \nOn the other hand, when the microorganisms use plants as a food source, the natural gas is considered carbon-neutral because the plants have only captured and fixed the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere into plant biomass (via photosynthesis) very recently. Further, some of the carbon injected into the coal seams is in the form of carbon dioxide gas . Since coal's porous surface gives it a strong affinity for adsorbing gases, the coalbeds effectively serve as a carbon capture and storage facility. In this case, the process may become carbon-negative. \nOverall, the researchers expect that using plant-derived carbohydrates as an alternative carbon source to coal may offer a cleaner fuel than fossil fuels\u2014both coal and the currently produced form of natural gas . With carbon credits, the process could also be economically viable, which may help bridge the gap between fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. \nIn the future, the researchers plan to demonstrate the new method in test sites around the world. \n\"The next step is to focus on field demonstration projects to evaluate the applicability of the technology in coalbeds,\" Huang said. \"The ultimate goal is to fully develop the technology so that it can be used universally, including for other geological formations. I hope the technology can be implemented and help developing countries in acquiring this affordable, clean renewable energy in the long run. Several sites (USA and Asia) have been selected as candidates for field demonstration. Preliminary studies and characterizations of these sites have started.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:39:35.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "67efc42d8143d4e0dd6e6a91f8a2037a3b9a8237", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaB.IlqZUGUsDrmIo4QOpDb75eSujjAZkilbDaJFzBnS_ZJLHO9Q2qpFU0spidECQxTDct5esc268-", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://phys.org/rss-feed/breaking", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Ancient petrified salamander reveals its last meal", "title_full": "Ancient petrified salamander reveals its last meal", "published": "2017-10-03T16:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/ancientpetri.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "67efc42d8143d4e0dd6e6a91f8a2037a3b9a8237", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaB.IlqZUGUsDrmIo4QOpDb75eSujjAZkilbDaJFzBnS_ZJLHO9Q2qpFU0spidECQxTDct5esc268-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ancient petrified salamander reveals its last meal", "text": "Ancient petrified salamander reveals its last meal October 3, 2017 Synchrotron tomography permitted access to the inside of the \"mummy\".

Organs preserved in three dimensions include the lung, nerves, gut, and within it, the last meal of the animal, according to a study published in the peer-reviewed journal PeerJ by a team of palaeontologists from France and Switzerland. \nAccessing the complete anatomy of an extinct animal , i.e. both its external and internal aspects, has often been the dream of palaeontologists. Indeed, in 99% of cases, fossils are only represented by hard parts: bones, shells, etc. Fossils preserving soft tissues exist, but they are extremely rare. However, their significance for science is enormous. What did the animal look like? What did they eat? How did they live? Most of these questions can be answered by exceptionally preserved fossils. \nThe newly studied fossil externally looks like a present-day salamander, but it is made of stone. This fossil \"mummy\" is the only known specimen of Phosphotriton sigei, a 40-35 million years old salamander and belongs to the same family as the famous living fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra). \nIt is unfortunately incomplete: only the trunk, hip and part of hind legs and tail are preserved. Until very recently, the only thing palaeontologists could tell about this specimen was visible anatomical details, such as the cloaca, the orifice used for reproduction and by digestive and urinary canals. Indeed, though it was discovered in the 1870s, it was never studied in detail. The video will load shortly. 3-D reconstruction of the skeleton of Phosphotriton sigei . Credit: J\u00e9r\u00e9my Tissier \nThanks to recent synchrotron technology, its skeleton1 and various organs2 could be studied. The specimen was scanned at the ID19 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble (France). This modern technology gave access to an incredible level of details that could never have been achieved before without slicing the specimen into a series of thin sections. \nThe quality of preservation is such that looking at the tomograms (equivalent of radiograms) feels like going through an animal in the flesh. At least six kinds of organs are preserved in almost perfect condition, in addition to the skin and skeleton: muscles, lung, spinal cord, digestive tract, nerves, and glands. \nBut the most incredible is the preservation of frog bones within the stomach of the salamander. Salamanders almost never eat frogs or other salamanders , though they are known to be quite opportunistic. Was it a last resort meal or a customary choice for this species? This, unfortunately, will probably never be known.

The skeleton, in grey, is perfectly preserved, as well as several soft organs such as the gut and lung. Within the stomach, the last meal of the animal is also preserved. Surprisingly, it fed on a frog, an extremely rare kind of prey for salamanders.

A new study gives researchers a better idea of olivine's strength, with implications for how tectonic plates form and move. Credit: John St. James/Flickr \nNo one can travel inside the earth to study what happens there. So scientists must do their best to replicate real-world conditions inside the lab. \n\"We are interested in large-scale geophysical processes, like how plate tectonics initiates and how plates move underneath one another in subduction zones,\" said David Goldsby, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania. \"To do that, we need to understand the mechanical behavior of olivine, which is the most common mineral in the upper mantle of the earth .\" \nGoldsby, teaming with Christopher A. Thom, a doctoral student at Penn, as well as researchers from Stanford University, the University of Oxford and the University of Delaware, has now resolved a long-standing question in this area of research. While previous laboratory experiments resulted in widely disparate estimates of the strength of olivine in the earth's lithospheric mantle, the relatively cold and therefore strong part of Earth's uppermost mantle, the new work, published in the journal Science Advances , resolves the previous disparities by finding that, the smaller the grain size of the olivine being tested, the stronger it is. \nBecause olivine in the earth's mantle has a larger grain size than most olivine samples tested in labs, the results suggest that the mantle, which comprises up to 95 percent of the planet's tectonic plates, is in fact weaker than once believed. This more realistic picture of the interior may help researchers understand how tectonic plates form, how they deform when loaded with the weight of, for example, a volcanic island such as Hawaii, or even how earthquakes begin and propagate. \nFor more than 40 years, researchers have attempted to predict the strength of olivine in the earth's lithospheric mantle from the results of laboratory experiments . But tests in a lab are many layers removed from the conditions inside the earth, where pressures are higher and deformation rates are much slower than in the lab. A further complication is that, at the relatively low temperatures of earth's lithosphere, the strength of olivine is so high that it is difficult to measure its plastic strength without fracturing the sample. The results of existing experiments have varied widely, and they don't align with predictions of olivine strength from geophysical models and observations. \nIn an attempt to resolve these discrepancies, the researchers employed a technique known as nanoindentation, which is used to measure the hardness of materials. Put simply, the researchers measure the hardness of a material, which is related to its strength, by applying a known load to a diamond indenter tip in contact with a mineral and then measuring how much the mineral deforms. While previous studies have employed various high-pressure deformation apparatuses to hold samples together and prevent them from fracturing, a complicated set-up that makes measurements of strength challenging, nanoindentation does not require such a complex apparatus. These examples of nanoindentation experiments using pyramidal (left) and spherical (right) indenter tips show how the mineral olivine deforms in response to a given load. Credit: University of Pennsylvania \n\"With nanoindentation,\" Goldsby said, \"the sample in effect becomes its own pressure vessel. The hydrostatic pressure beneath the indenter tip keeps the sample confined when you press the tip into the sample's surface, allowing the sample to deform plastically without fracture, even at room temperature.\" \nPerforming 800 nanoindentation experiments in which they varied the size of the indentation by varying the load applied to the diamond tip pressed into the sample, the research team found that the smaller the size of the indent, the harder, and thus stronger, olivine became. \n\"This indentation size effect had been seen in many other materials, but we think this is the first time it's been shown in a geological material,\" Goldsby said. \nLooking back at previously collected strength data for olivine, the researchers determined that the discrepancies in those data could be explained by invoking a related size effect, whereby the strength of olivine increases with decreasing grain size of the tested samples. When these previous strength data were plotted against the grain size in each study, all the data fit on a smooth trend which predicts lower-than-thought strengths in Earth's lithospheric mantle. \nIn a related paper by Thom, Goldsby and colleagues, published recently in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, the researchers examined patterns of roughness in faults that have become exposed at the earth's surface due to uplifted plates and erosion. \n\"Different faults have a similar roughness, and there's an idea published recently that says you might get those patterns because the strength of the materials on the fault surface increases with the decreasing scale of roughness,\" Thom said. \"Those patterns and the frictional behavior they cause might be able to tell us something about how earthquakes nucleate and how they propagate.\" \nIn future work, the Penn researchers and their team would like to study size-strength effects in other minerals and also to focus on the effect of increasing temperature on size effects in olivine.

Credit: shutterstock \nThe quality of women's relationships with their partner is diminished if they view their parenting division as unfair or want to spend more time working, our new study of employed parents in Canada has found. \nEmerging research shows women's larger housework share deteriorates relationship satisfaction and leads to divorce. Our study shows inequality across the domestic sphere \u2013 housework and parenting \u2013 jeopardises relationship quality . \nHousework and parenting: equally damaging? \nWomen consistently do more housework, even when employed full-time . They do more when they are married and after the birth of a child . Women also perform more of the least-pleasurable households tasks, like cleaning the bathroom. \nAlthough men have increased their housework time since the 1970s, they more typically perform the least-urgent chores, like changing lightbulbs or car maintenance. \nOur study found working mothers assumed a larger parenting share, and this inequality deteriorated relationship quality \u2013 but only under certain conditions. It deteriorated when mothers perceived their parenting division as unfair, or when they felt trapped in their primary carer role. \nSpecifically, mothers who performed a larger parenting share and worked part-time had the lowest relationship quality. This pattern was also evident for mothers who preferred more time at work. \nThese paradoxical findings \u2013 mothers with part-time employment and preferences for more time at work reporting worse relations with their partners due to their larger parenting burden \u2013 suggests feeling trapped in the role of mother. \nMothers are expected to be fully available to the demands and whims of children around the clock. They are expected not only to provide primary care, but also to carry the mental load for the household. The mental load captures all of the planning work that is required to keep the household functioning, from organising after-school care to ensuring there is enough milk for breakfast. \nThe demands of this role are intense. It leads many mothers to reduce to part-time employment when children are young. Yet many women may be dissatisfied with the pressure to assume the bulk of the parenting at the expense of their employment and, as a consequence, relationship quality suffers. \nSo, mothers can be trapped between gender role expectations of a \"good\" mother and their desires to be more engaged in the labour market . This dissatisfaction bleeds into the marriage. \nRelationship quality is better among some couples, such as those who equally share the parenting even when mothers work part-time, full-time or overtime hours. Simply, men's equal parenting participation, regardless of mothers' employment status, appears to be the linchpin for relationship quality. \nImplications for Australia \nAustralian mothers have some of the highest part-time employment rates in the world. The government offers little in terms of parenting or parental leave, meaning Australian families must find individual rather than government solutions for the care of young children. \nFaced with expensive childcare, many mothers reduce to part-time work or drop out of the labour market altogether to look after children. These employment decisions make mothers economically vulnerable if couples divorce and in older age: one-in-three women retire with no superannuation . \nOECD Chart: Part-time employment rate, Total, % of employment, Annual, 2016 \nFor many Australian families, the solution is mothers' reduced time in employment. Moreover, Australian parents become more traditional in their gender role attitudes after having a child, meaning more couples view mothers as the ideal carer for children once becoming parents. \nOur study suggests this combination of factors \u2013 preferences for mother-provided childcare and reductions in mothers' employment \u2013 may deteriorate relationship quality among Australian couples. Close to half (47%) of all divorces in Australia are among couples with children , and women are more likely to file for divorce than men. \nThe results from our Canadian sample suggest one reason women may experience lower relationship quality in their marriages is the unequal division of the domestic work \u2013 parenting and housework. \nMen's more active participation in the home and family-responsive policies, including the availability of universal government-subsidised child care, may have a two-fold benefit: increasing mothers ' labour market attachment, and improving relationship quality.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:42:38.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4a5693b98bfb5e0568f834a161dd1b453294678", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaT4QvP3k0cR7G701HNKp20PyFlkh36GzO_Zqcg2ezylFafLOvubwwbw--", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/physorg/SyvL", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Biosensor for heavy metals", "title_full": "Biosensor for heavy metals", "published": "2017-10-03T16:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/biosensorfor.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e4a5693b98bfb5e0568f834a161dd1b453294678", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaT4QvP3k0cR7G701HNKp20PyFlkh36GzO_Zqcg2ezylFafLOvubwwbw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Biosensor for heavy metals", "text": "Biosensor for heavy metals October 3, 2017 by C\u00e9line Elber Ramon Weishaupt during a series of tests using blood serum. Credit: Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology \nA team of Empa scientists has developed a biosensor which allows them to detect elevated concentrations of copper in a simple, quick and economic way. Copper, like other heavy metals is problematic in high concentrations, both for the environment and for human health. \nIt is no secret that heavy metals such as copper are dangerous substances which can have grave consequences for both our environment and for human health . Liver damage, Alzheimer's disease and even cancer have all been associated with high levels of copper. Despite this, the concentration of heavy metals is often very high, both in the atmosphere and in water sources, particularly in some developing countries. \nIn order to detect an excessive dose of heavy metals as early as possible, and thereby avoid the resulting health problems, highly sensitive analyses of samples such as blood are essential. However these tests are often expensive and time-consuming, requiring an appropriate level of laboratory infrastructure. In developing countries \u2013 where exposure to heavy metals at its highest \u2013 this often represents a problem. \nA protein with a weakness for copper \nEmpa doctoral student Ramon Weishaupt has studied a more economic and faster way of measuring copper concentrations. To do this he combined a red fluorescing protein called c-phycocyanin (which plays a role in the photosynthesis of cyanobacteria and binds to copper ions even at very low concentrations) with a nano-cellulose matrix to create a thin film. When copper ions bind to the bacterial protein the fluorescent emission becomes weaker, and this change can be quickly and easily measured with a spectrometer. The base material, micro-fibrillated cellulose, also stems from Empa's labs: the highly versatile fibrous material made of renewable raw materials was developed at the Laboratory for Applied Wood Materials. \nThe researchers have tested the new technology, which they have named CySense, on blood samples, among others. \"One drop of blood is sufficient for the method to detect a concentration of copper relevant to human health\" explains, Greta Faccio, Empa scientist. CySense can be economically produced, is easy to use and is quick and accurate. In addition, if the biosensor is washed clean with special chemicals and water, it can be used again and again over a one-week period. \nAs simple as measuring blood sugar \nThe team's findings, which are presented in a paper published in the scientific journal Advanced Functional Materials , open new avenues in the field of heavy metal analysis. Water and soil samples can be evaluated on the spot, for example, saving both cost and time. Or affected users could monitor copper levels in their own blood , using the CySense technique and a reading device similar to a blood sugar monitor, thus obviating the need for large, expensive instruments and highly trained personnel. \"Although CySense is still a prototype, once it has been implemented as a marketable system it could help to improve the health of a large number of people,\" predicts Greta Faccio.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "c\u00e9line elber ramon weishaupt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "greta faccio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramon weishaupt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "empa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "swiss federal laboratories for materials science and technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "empa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:48:29.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "665f1c994533855928593f12619c0983449b5e5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaCu9Ot5SGhtlf_x8TdklJmmiyzgZVSfXCJ2pdWlFr89M_k_fU6dsE26MfeE6vr6No98xuuaGzL3Y-", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/physorg/SyvL", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Confined within tiny carbon nanotubes, extremely cold water molecules line up in a highly ordered chain", "title_full": "Confined within tiny carbon nanotubes, extremely cold water molecules line up in a highly ordered chain", "published": "2017-10-03T16:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/confinedwith.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "665f1c994533855928593f12619c0983449b5e5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaCu9Ot5SGhtlf_x8TdklJmmiyzgZVSfXCJ2pdWlFr89M_k_fU6dsE26MfeE6vr6No98xuuaGzL3Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Confined within tiny carbon nanotubes, extremely cold water molecules line up in a highly ordered chain", "text": "Confined within tiny carbon nanotubes, extremely cold water molecules line up in a highly ordered chain October 3, 2017 Water molecules (red and white balls) forming a chain in a carbon nanotube (blue lattice) normally orient randomly (yellow arrows; left, top and bottom). As the temperature decreases (right), emission color of an empty nanotube shows a gradual shift (empty data points) whereas a sudden shift in the emission color can be seen at 150 K in the nanotube filled with water (filled data points). This shift is attributed to an unexpected ferroelectric alignment of the water molecules confined within the nanotube (left, middle). Credit: Wim Wenseleers, University of Antwerp \nSingle-walled carbon nanotubes act like tiny straws that are so narrow that water confined within cannot freeze into its normal crystal-like structure. In particular, in very thin nanotubes, water molecules align in a single-file manner.   each molecule remains orientated in a random direction, creating a disordered chain. For the first time, scientists observed that at a cool 150 K, these molecules go through a quasiphase transition. In this transition, the molecules orient themselves in a highly structured, classically hydrogen-bonded arrangement. \nClean water is vital to people, crops and livestock. Technologies using carbon nanotubes may benefit water purification and desalination. Creating such devices demands knowing how water confined in such tubes behaves. Also, knowing how water behaves in tight spaces will help scientists study other complex systems, such as how toxins move through cell walls. \nWhile scientists have known that molecules confined within single-walled nanotubes behave differently than their bulk counterparts, it has previously been impossible to study these interactions in a truly uniform environment. For the first time, scientists have been able to select nanotubes of the same chirality and with a very small diameter that can only be filled with one water molecule after the other, yielding a single-file chain. By studying the photoluminescence properties of empty nanotubes compared with water-filled nanotubes, researchers noticed a sudden shift in the emission color of filled nanotubes at ~150 K. Previous studies had observed more general shifts, but scientists could not determine the exact temperature of the shift and could only speculate at the cause behind the shift. In this controlled experiment, where a direct comparison was made between water-filled and empty nanotubes, researchers detected highly ordered structures of water within these nanotubes , a state that previously had only been predicted by theoretical simulations. \nThe group further performed molecular dynamics simulations on this system as a function of temperature. They determined that water dipole orientation is the basis of the phase transition. This finding makes room for more theory to explain the quasiphase transition while the entire study advances the understanding of confined molecules for use in studying complex natural systems and developing novel microfluidic applications.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lawrence livermore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wim wenseleers", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eth z\u00fcrich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rochester institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of antwerp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of groningen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of illinois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northeastern university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:48:33.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2123fd74cbdba2cec8566ac68e42d5414bbf66b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaIgHbJoeLNvfxwxV8gRWHX5A07ubPlyh1mpO4Ua8nr4qahp5RC.bCRJqpaF32RKd87l1lXH5XQJg-", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/physorg/SyvL", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Space-based data are aiding Great Lakes communities as they combat an invader", "title_full": "Space-based data are aiding Great Lakes communities as they combat an invader", "published": "2017-10-03T16:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/spacebasedda.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2123fd74cbdba2cec8566ac68e42d5414bbf66b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaIgHbJoeLNvfxwxV8gRWHX5A07ubPlyh1mpO4Ua8nr4qahp5RC.bCRJqpaF32RKd87l1lXH5XQJg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Space-based data are aiding Great Lakes communities as they combat an invader", "text": "Space-based data are aiding Great Lakes communities as they combat an invader October 3, 2017 Risk map for Phragmites australis near Collingwood, ON. Areas in red show a higher probability for Phragmites. Credit: NASA \nLocated on the southern shore of Georgian Bay in Ontario, the idyllic Great Lakes town of Collingwood has been battling a growing problem\u2014an invasive wetland reed called Phragmites australis. And the town is not alone in its fight. \n\"Phragmites are a very serious problem in the Great Lakes Basin,\" said David Ullrich, Executive Director of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative (GLSLCI). Phragmites, a nonnative subspecies of a natural Great Lakes reed, can quickly take over a location, crowding out native plants and animals with dense stands of stalks that grow more than 5 meters tall. \n\"They turn wetlands into monocultures that are much less attractive to fish and wildlife,\" Ullrich added. \"They also reduce the natural value of wetlands to cleanse water and help reduce flooding.\" Using NASA's eyes in the sky, a DEVELOP project helped guide Collingwood's battle from above. \nTracking a Tenacious Threat \nIn partnership with the Michigan Tech Research Institute (MTRI) and GLSLCI, a DEVELOP team led a project that built on earlier MTRI research on Phragmites in the region. The goal of this project was two-fold. The first was to create a current risk map based on habitat suitability for Phragmites throughout the basin. \n\"We focused our study within 10 kilometers of the U.S. and Canadian coastline, based on in situ data previously collected and the number of communities impacted by Phragmites,\" said team member Sean McCartney. Credit: NASA \nThe second goal was to create a future risk map for the entire basin through the year 2020. \"Forecasting results help local governments enact policies to plan for and mitigate the spread of Phragmites,\" McCartney added. \nTo do this, the project tapped into precipitation data from NASA's TRMM and GPM satellites, used Earth observations from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, and modeled variables such as soil drainage and topography. The current and predicted Phragmites risk maps gave guidance to the project partners' on-going monitoring and mitigation efforts. \nAnd, at GLSLCI's 2016 annual meeting in Niagara Falls, New York, the DEVELOP team shared its findings. Here, Great Lakes mayors and local officials from the U.S. and Canada were able to see the threat they faced from this noxious nuisance. \nArmed With Information \nFor Collingwood, which is in the second year of its \"Fight the Phrag!\" program, the data is now helping inform officials where to focus both control and eradication efforts around its marshes and shorelines. \n\"The Earth observations to map and model Phragmites makes it easier because in one image, a person can see the scope of the problem,\" Ullrich explained. \"If all of this information had to be gathered from groundlevel observations, it would take much longer, be much more labor intensive, and be much more costly.\" \nAnd that means Collingwood's Phrag fighters can save their time and resources for combat.

Credit: Alyssa Arre, CC BY-ND \n\"00O made it!\" There was some news to celebrate on Sept. 28 in the email chain of scientists who work at the Cayo Santiago Field Station . Cayo Santiago is a 38-acre tropical island off the coast of Puerto Rico and home to approximately 1,500 rhesus monkeys, earning it the local nickname \"Monkey Island.\" \nEach monkey on the island is assigned a unique three-character ID, which soon starts to feel like its name. Monkey Zero-Zero-Oh is a female we sometimes called \" .\" She is now an old lady in monkey years, beloved for her spunky personality, and we had just gotten word that she survived Hurricane Maria. \nA unique scientific resource \nThe Cayo Santiago Field Station is the longest-running primate field site in the world. Since it was founded in 1938, generations of monkeys have lived out their life with humans watching. Only monkeys live on the island; people take a 15-minute boat trip every day from Punta Santiago on Puerto Rico's east coast. \nOver the past 80 years, an amazing diversity of research has taken place on Cayo. Some scientists, like myself, study cognition. My students and I analyze how the monkeys think and solve problems . Do they follow where others are looking to find out what they see, as humans do? (Yes.) Can they reflect on their own knowledge to know when they don't know something \u2013 a hallmark of human reasoning? (Surprisingly, yes!) Rhesus monkeys on Cayo Santiago before Hurricane Maria. Credit: Alexandra Rosati, CC BY-ND \nOther scientists observe the monkeys' interactions to learn which ones are friends , which ones get into fights and who has many suitors . Researchers have tracked these animals' genes , their hormones and their skeletons after they die. We know who their parents are, how they treat their children and, ultimately, their fate. \nThe huge amount of data on each individual monkey's life, death and contributions to the next generation allow scientists to ask questions in biology, anthropology and psychology that can't be answered anywhere else. This microcosm of monkey society opens the door onto these highly intelligent and social primates' lives \u2013 thereby allowing us to better understand our own. \nAn island and a town destroyed \nAfter Hurricane Maria made landfall 30 minutes south of Cayo Santiago, scientists in the United States scrambled to make contact with students , staff and friends in Puerto Rico. Several days later we finally managed to reach Angelina Ruiz Lambides, the director of the research station. Scientists arranged a helicopter so that she could survey Punta Santiago and Cayo Santiago. The photos and videos she sent back were devastating. \nPunta Santiago, where many of the staff live, was destroyed. A photo taken from the helicopter showed a large chalk message: \"S.O.S. Necesitamos Agua/Comida\" \u2013 We need water and food. Research station staff return to Cayo Santiago after Hurricane Maria to start assessing conditions on the island. Credit: Angelina Ruiz, CC BY-ND \nCayo Santiago, formerly two lush islands connected by an isthmus, was unrecognizable. The forests were brown, the mangroves were flooded and the isthmus was submerged. Research labs and other infrastructure were in pieces. Yet the monkeys were spotted! Somehow, defying our expectations, many of the Cayo monkeys had weathered the storm. Over the next few days other staff traveled to Cayo in small boats and started searching for each individual monkey, like 00O \u2013 a process that will take weeks. \nMobilizing scientists \nA group of international scientists based at Cayo knew that we had to act. In addition to my group at the University of Michigan, researchers from the University of Buffalo, University of Leipzig, University of Pennsylvania, University of Puerto Rico, University of Washington, New York University and Yale University started organizing relief efforts. \nOne immediate concern was water: The monkeys depend on a system of rainwater cisterns to collect fresh water. As staff made contact, we learned that people in Punta Santiago also desperately needed clean water. Power was out, so other critical supplies included solar-powered lights, diesel fuel (which was being rationed), food and cash, since credit card machines and ATMs were down. \nOur group set up two GoFundMe sites for relief \u2013 one for the staff and local community; the other for the monkeys. So far the funds have raised over US$45,000 and almost $10,000, respectively. Now we are organizing shipments of equipment that is critical for both humans' and animals' welfare, such as cisterns, water purification systems and satellite phones. We also are working to evacuate staffers whose homes were destroyed. Cayo Santiago before Hurricane Maria. Credit: yasmapaz & ace_heart, CC BY-SA \nThe station has a supply of food for the monkeys, but we must ensure that it does not run out, especially now that all of the natural vegetation they could eat is gone. Over the long term, we are organizing to rebuild the research infrastructure that was destroyed. \nThe support that we have received reflects how much Cayo has touched the larger scientific community. Hundreds of researchers have worked at Cayo. I first visited there as an undergraduate student more than 15 years ago. Many students got their first taste of real science on Cayo, and they have come out in full force to donate and promote the relief campaigns. \nA crisis for humans and animals \nSome observers might question our focus on saving animals when people across Puerto Rico are suffering, but this is not an either/or choice. The Cayo Santiago Field Station is the livelihood of many dedicated staffers who live in Punta Santiago. We cannot aid the monkeys without helping to rebuild the town, and we aim to do both. \nThe staff and researchers who work at Cayo Santiago are stewards of these animals, who cannot survive without our help. Many of the Puerto Rican staffers on site have spent years caring for monkeys like 00O.

Erickson And Julia Brooks, The Conversation \nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, reporters warned of a \"stew of toxic chemicals, sewage, debris and waste\" in Houston's floodwaters. \nIt isn't just Harvey. Hurricanes Irma and Maria and other floods and storms heighten the risks for contamination, environmental hazards and disease . Public health experts frequently warn about the unique dangers to those evacuating from or returning to disaster-affected areas. Sadly, in the stress of the situation, these risks are often overlooked. \nBefore wading through floodwaters full of chemical spills, biotoxins, invasive species, waste, sewage and debris, it's important to know what to watch out for and how to avoid getting hurt. \nBacterial illness \nAfter epic hurricanes, bacterial illnesses are a common problem. \nHurricane floodwaters may be contaminated by sewage with E. coli bacteria, which can cause serious gastrointestinal illness . Bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus can lead to skin infections. Shigella can cause gastrointestinal illness in the form of diarrhea, vomiting, fever, stomach pain and dehydration. \nAfter Hurricane Katrina, surveys identified cases of Vibrio illness, a bacterial illness classically associated with exposure to saltwater or brackish water. This illness led to a handful of fatalities. \nStorms and floods also increase the risk for leptospirosis . This bacterial disease, if left untreated, can lead to kidney damage, liver failure and even death. \nInhaling airborne moisture droplets can also put you at risk for Legionnaires' disease , which is caused by Legionella, a freshwater bacteria that easily spreads to human-made water systems during floods. This can lead to pneumonia-type symptoms, as well as gastrointestinal illness. \nOne review found that storms heightened the risk of poisonings, wounds, gastrointestinal infections and skin or soft tissue infections , primarily from Staph and strep infections. \nMany of these bacterial illnesses resolve on their own, but some require antibiotics. Tetanus prophylaxis vaccines can prevent bacterial infections through open cuts. \nToxic chemicals and gases \nChemical leaks and spills in floodwater can pose serious risks to human health. \nWhen any flood or hurricane hits an urban industrial area, there's a risk of toxic gases, such as as methane and sulfur dioxide, as well as industrial chemicals like benzene and butadiene, which can potentially cause cancer after large or chronic exposures. After Hurricane Harvey, more than 40 sites reportedly released hazardous pollutants. \nHurricane Harvey caused flooding or damage to at least 14 Superfund toxic waste sites in and around Houston. These sites are contaminated with dioxins, lead, arsenic and mercury, as well as other dangerous industrial compounds. These can cause serious health issues in the brain, blood and kidneys. \nMany natural gas and other fuel lines were also broken during Hurricanes Harvey and Katrina. Abandoned buildings may host highly explosive gas vapors. Methane and other explosive gases may also accumulate from decaying materials. \nOther threats \nFloodwaters can make houses especially hospitable to mold , particularly in humid conditions like Texas, Puerto Rico and Florida. Multiplying mold spores carry serious public health risks, especially for people with existing mold allergies and asthma. \nStanding water is also likely to cause an uptick in mosquito populations. Mosquitoes are vectors for a number of serious viruses, including Zika and yellow fever. \nStanding water and humid conditions may also increase human encounters with venomous snakes , fire ants and stinging insects. Many of these animals may have been flooded out of their nests. Pro tip: Don't touch the floating fire ant colonies. They will ruin your day. #Harvey pic.twitter.com/uwJd0rA7qB \u2014 Mike Hixenbaugh (@Mike_Hixenbaugh) August 27, 2017 \nWhat's more, rates of death may increase by up to 50 percent in the first year after a flood, secondary to outbreaks of diseases such as hepatitis E, gastrointestinal disease and leptospirosis. \nWhat to do? \nIf you live in an area that's at risk for hurricanes and storms, you can take steps now to protect yourself. \nMake sure smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are properly functioning. You should also invest in basement sump pumps and flood insurance if you live near a river, coastline or floodplain. Flood insurance can give you the necessary support to quickly clean up, evacuate and repair damaged buildings. \nSurvivors of Harvey, Irma, Maria and other storms should make every effort to limit their contact with floodwater. Often, particularly in the aftermath, this can be unavoidable. If possible, wait until the water level goes down or try to obtain transportation by boat. \nOpen all windows when entering a building. If you smell gas or hear the sound of escaping gas, don't smoke, operate electrical switches or create any other source of ignition. Leave the building immediately, leaving the door open. Don't go back inside until you are told by authorities that it is safe to do so. \nRemove standing water as quickly as possible. Remove wet materials and discard those that cannot be thoroughly cleaned and dried. Materials that have been wet for longer than 48 hours may need to be discarded, as they will likely remain a source of mold. \nDry out the building. This will take time and may require the extensive disinfection and removal of some materials. Heavily contaminated floodwaters can penetrate deep into soaked, porous materials such as drywall and wood, later releasing microorganisms and other contaminants into air or water. Microorganisms will continue to grow as long as materials remain wet and humidity is high. \nWhen cleaning, limit exposure to airborne mold spores by wearing gloves, goggles and a respirator, if available, or a dust mask, so you can avoid breathing in contaminated vapor or mist. If there's no standing water in the building and it's safe to use electricity, use fans both during and after the use of cleaning products. \nExercise caution when disturbing building materials such as floor tiles, pipe insulation and paint. These may contain hazards such as asbestos and lead . \nMany will use gas-powered generators to pump out floodwater. But beware \u2013 those generators can produce poisonous carbon monoxide gas in enclosed areas. In fact, cases of poisoning by carbon monoxide typically increase after disasters due to the improper use of fuel-burning devices. \nYou should also be on the alert for leaking containers and reactive household chemicals, like caustic drain cleaners and chlorine bleach. Stay away from leaking or spilled chemicals \u2013 even if a container is broken, it's best to leave it undisturbed until it can be properly disposed of by authorities.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "legionella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike hixenbaugh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mothy b. erickson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julia brooks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zika", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "chemical", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vibrio", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:48:48.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7f2b7e1ecb0af781cf1bd5858ec59a8a9e313db5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaT4QvP3k0cR6Tab0268rmtoYlyLXMoMrqyZn2NvYpAw.DiXobACuRXwsw1nUEAt3ArET5S4yi1z8-", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/physorg/SyvL", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Bigger, more intensive dairy farms may also mean bigger milk footprints", "title_full": "Bigger, more intensive dairy farms may also mean bigger milk footprints", "published": "2017-10-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/biggermorein.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7f2b7e1ecb0af781cf1bd5858ec59a8a9e313db5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaT4QvP3k0cR6Tab0268rmtoYlyLXMoMrqyZn2NvYpAw.DiXobACuRXwsw1nUEAt3ArET5S4yi1z8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bigger, more intensive dairy farms may also mean bigger milk footprints", "text": "Bigger, more intensive dairy farms may also mean bigger milk footprints October 3, 2017 Credit: Bangor University \nA new study published in Global Change Biology challenges the idea that the trend towards larger, more intensive dairy farms mitigates climate change by shrinking the carbon footprint of milk production. A team of animal nutrition experts and environmental modellers from Bangor and Aberystwyth Universities looked beyond the farm-system boundaries of typical carbon footprint studies to account for indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emission consequences considering changes to dairy feed production and to beef farms that may compete with dairy farms for grassland. \nMilk and beef production are responsible for 9% of global GHG emissions. Previous studies have shown that dairy intensification reduces the carbon footprint of milk by improving feed conversion efficiency, but these studies didn't account for indirect consequences arising within interconnected crop and beef farm systems. The authors of the Global Change Biology paper quantified these indirect effects for intensification scenarios in which average grazing-based UK dairy farms consolidate into large, intensive dairy farms that feed more maize and concentrates to cows. \nJames Gibbons, lead investigator on the NRN S\u00ear Cymru funded \"CLEANER COWS\" research cluster, commented \"When we began this research, we anticipated some potentially important indirect GHG emission effects arising from changes to animal diets, but as the research progressed, we revealed new and unanticipated secondary effects incurred within interconnected farm systems.\" \nFirst applying a conventional foot-printing method, the authors found that intensification led to an apparent 10% reduction in the carbon footprint of each litre of milk produced, confirming the results of previous studies. However, when they expanded their accounting to consider indirect effects from maintaining beef production, they found that GHG emissions increased by up 43% following intensification. \nNotably, if reduced dairy-beef output in the UK is compensated by suckler-beef production at the \"global beef frontier\" in Brazil, a small reduction in UK GHG emissions is dwarfed by a large increase in Brazilian emissions \u2013 highlighting the risk that some intensification pathways may simply displace emissions to other countries. Conversely, if productive grassland spared by dairy intensification is used for intensive beef production, larger areas of lower quality grassland can be spared from extensive beef production, either in the UK or in Brazil, potentially leading to significant GHG mitigation through either afforestation or avoided deforestation. \nDavid Styles, lead author on the paper, concluded that \"carbon footprints are useful to benchmark the efficiency of dairy farms, but could support misleading conclusions on the climate efficiency of 'sustainable intensification' strategies owing to hitherto poorly-quantified implications for inter-connected global food chains. Intensification of UK dairy farms is only likely to achieve significant climate mitigation when coupled with intensification of beef production, leading to net sparing of land for afforestation.\" \nThe authors caveat that their conclusions apply to further intensification of high productivity dairy farms in industrialised countries, and may not apply to intensification of low productivity dairy farms in industrialising countries where there is more potential to reduce carbon footprints by improving feed conversion efficiency among low-yielding dairy cows.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "james gibbons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david styles", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "global change biology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberystwyth universities", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bangor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:49:02.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ff731ee2ab5134b5df386998d45355a5e3dc6c2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyauW19EvUKbBX18Rbd7OeKzys1UIGvgLevZcuqHdKicIaAqLVXKe2.F.qCpIcw4jnj", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/physorg/SyvL", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "First global pact backing indigenous land rights launched", "title_full": "First global pact backing indigenous land rights launched", "published": "2017-10-03T15:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/protestersin.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ff731ee2ab5134b5df386998d45355a5e3dc6c2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyauW19EvUKbBX18Rbd7OeKzys1UIGvgLevZcuqHdKicIaAqLVXKe2.F.qCpIcw4jnj", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "First global pact backing indigenous land rights launched", "text": "First global pact backing indigenous land rights launched October 3, 2017 by Marlowe Hood Protesters in Brazil in 2015 demand protection for indigenous people's rights \nIndigenous peoples could soon regain some control of their native forests with the creation of a new global institution dedicated to securing their land rights. \nThe International Land and Forest Tenure Facility, formally launched in Stockholm on Tuesday, aims to help communities protect their land resources as well as combat climate change . \nFunded by Sweden, Norway and the Ford Foundation, a US charity, the Tenure Facility has already provided grants and guidance for pilot projects in Peru, Mali, Indonesia and three other nations. \nDisputes over resources can prove deadly. According to non-governmental organisation Global Witness, more than 200 environmental campaigners were murdered in 2016 alone\u2014nearly half from indigenous tribes. \nA 2014 survey by US-based think tank World Resources Institute found restoring control of forests to original inhabitants can tackle global warming. \nIn Brazil, deforestation in indigenous community forests from 2000 to 2012 was less than one percent, compared to seven percent outside those areas. \n'Unrelenting conflicts' \nDepleted tropical forests and emissions from agriculture and livestock have accounted for more than a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions in recent decades. \nFord Foundation president Darren Walker told AFP that climate change and inequality are \"existential threats\" on a global scale. \n\"Creating mechanisms that allow indigenous peoples and local communities to gain tenure over their land or forests is a way to tackle both these problems.\" \nThe Ford Foundation has pledged $5 million (4.2 million euros), and Norway announced Tuesday a grant of $20 million over the coming years. Sweden pitched in $10 million during the pilot phase and will fund future projects. Walker said he expects donations rise to $100 million overall within a year. \nThe project aims to boost forestland properly titled to indigenous peoples by 40 million hectares, an area twice the size of Spain, within a decade. \nSuch efforts, they calculate, would prevent deforestation of one million hectares and the release of 500 million tonnes of CO2, more than the annual emissions of Britain or Brazil. \nCorruption and abuses \nMore than two billion people live on and manage half the world's land in customary or traditional systems, yet indigenous communities have formal legal ownership of just 10 percent. \nAnd even where they do have title, corruption and abuses have led to protracted conflicts with local and national governments, companies and migrant workers. \nNative populations can even run afoul of major green initiatives to fight climate change or stem biodiversity loss. \nA controversial UN-backed programme known as REDD+\u2014Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation\u2014creates incentives to keep forests intact, paid for by rich nations or companies seeking to offset pollution under carbon trading schemes. \nBut critics say the projects REDD+ finances can push aside the needs and rights of indigenous peoples who are often most directly affected by the changes. \nA peer-reviewed 2013 study concluded that less than half of some 50 projects in Africa, Latin America and Asia did anything to alleviate the poverty of forest -dependent peoples, though many did enhance their land rights.

Credit: shutterstock \nOur climate is out of balance: Increasing accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere has caused the Earth's temperature to increase by 0.8\u00b0 C since the beginning of the industrial revolution. According to a study by Thorsten Mauritsen from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg and Robert Pincus of the University of Colorado, even if we stopped all emissions from fossil fuels tomorrow, the Earth would still warm by a further 0.3\u00b0 C. In this interview, Mauritsen explains why it will take millennia for the Earth to get back into balance. \nMr. Mauritsen, what inspired you to carry out this study? \nI was a bit surprised that the 1.5\u00b0 C target was even being discussed at the 2015 Paris talks. I was convinced that we were already past that point. So I wanted to show, using simple methods, that that goal was simply no longer achievable. But as I started to dig down into the literature and carried out more and more calculations, however, at some point I had to concede that this scenario is not entirely unrealistic. That's kind of a positive result. \nYou have determined that the Earth would warm by a total of 1.1\u00b0 Celsius even if all emissions from fossil fuels stopped tomorrow. Why is that? \nThe Earth as a system is out of balance. More energy is flowing into the system than is flowing back out. This excess energy is mainly absorbed by the oceans. Water has a high heat capacity and consequently a long reaction time. As a result, at present the oceans are cooling the air. Over time, however, the deep ocean layers will also warm up, until finally, after thousands of years, the climate will settle down at a higher average ocean and atmospheric temperature. If there were no new emissions, the temperature at the end of this century would be 1.1\u00b0 Celsius higher than before the industrial revolution . \nWhat other factors are involved? \nWhen we burn fossil fuels , in addition to CO2, we also pump aerosol particles into the atmosphere. These aerosol particles probably cool the Earth slightly, so working in opposition to the CO2. If we stopped burning coal and oil, these aerosols would vanish within a few weeks, whilst the CO2 would remain in the atmosphere. There would therefore be a sudden spike in warming. Over a longer timescale, however, the deep oceans absorb some of the CO2. This means that the 'committed warming' by the end of this century is about 0.2 to 0.3\u00b0 C less than it would be if the amount of CO2 were to remain constant. Nature gives us a bit of a helping hand. \nWhat about the effect of other greenhouse gases, such as methane and nitrogen oxides? \nThese gases have a fairly short life span \u2013 maximum ten years. Of course, ten years doesn't sound like such a short period of time, but when you're looking at warming over hundreds of years, then it is. Emissions of these gases mean that the Earth is a bit warmer now. Their disappearance from the atmosphere would therefore slightly reduce global warming. \nHow did you determine the 'committed warming'? \nTo do that, we needed to know two things. Firstly, we needed to find out how sensitive the Earth's climate is, i.e. how sensitively it reacts to an increase in atmospheric CO2 over a timescale of a century (the transient climate sensitivity). This can be estimated from data on previous temperature rises and ocean warming. We also need to know how strong the effect of the disappearance of aerosols, methane and nitrogen oxides will be. From there, we can estimate warming through to the end of the century. \nHow does this differ from previous studies? \nWe used data from observations to estimate sensibilities. Previous studies were based on results from climate models which incorporated a lot more assumptions. Our results broadly support the results from model-based studies, however. \nWhat do the results teach us? In the real world, stopping emissions immediately is, unfortunately, impossible. \nWe can see how far we are from the climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement, which state that the Earth should not warm by more than 1.5\u20132\u00b0 C. According to our study, there is a 13 percent probability that we have already exceeded the 1.5\u00b0 C target. We have also shown that, based on current emissions, we still have 30 years until the probability of staying under the 1.5\u00b0 C target falls to 50 percent. \nHow do you explain the amount of attention your study has received? \nWe've clearly hit a nerve. According to surveys, a great many people believe that global warming will stop if we stop emitting greenhouse gases . Many even assume that temperatures will fall back to pre-industrial levels within a couple of decades. But climate scientists have long known that that's not the case. CO2 has a much longer life span than that \u2013 it stays in the atmosphere for thousands of years. So, we need to state quite clearly: Global warming will not stop when emissions stop.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

October 3, 2017 by Julien Lagache Ireland's High Court ruled that the Court of Justice of the European Union must decide the rules on the transfer of data from European Facebook users to the US \"to ensure consistency\" \nIreland's High Court on Tuesday asked the EU's Court of Justice of the European Union to decide on rules on the transfer of data from Europe to the US in a case with far-reaching implications for industry. \nJudge Caroline Costello said that \"only a decision of CJEU can resolve the potential for inconsistent applications\" of the mechanism used by giants such as Facebook to transfer European users' data to the US. \n\"I therefore have decided to ask the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling,\" she concluded. \nThe legal action follows a complaint by Austrian privacy lawyer Max Schrems to Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) about Facebook's use of so-called standard contractual clauses (SCCs) to transfer personal data from Europe to the US, via its European headquarters in Dublin. \nSCCs are now widely used by data exporters and are intended to allow for the legal transfer of data from EU citizens as long as \"adequate protection\" is in place. \nIn an emailed statement, Facebook said it was \"essential the CJEU now considers the extensive evidence demonstrating the robust protections in place under Standard Contractual Clauses and US law, before it makes any decision that may endanger the transfer of data across the Atlantic and around the globe.\" \nSCCs \"are essential to companies of all sizes, and upholding them is critical to ensuring the economy can continue to grow without disruption,\" the statement said. \nSchrems argues that the SCCs offer no redress for European citizens in the US in the event of their data being accessed by a third party, such as US intelligence services, or compromised in some other way. \nHis legal team claimed that the Irish watchdog already had the power to stop data transfers from Facebook and should use it. \nFollowing the ruling, Schrems told AFP that he did not want to \"strike down international data transfers, because 90 percent of the cases are not a problem,\" and was instead focussed on companies \"which are involved in mass surveillance\". \n\"I suspect that she (Judge Costello) wanted to kick up the case and not deal with it too much,\" he said. \n\"Right now we can just raise the issue over and over again by kicking up the courts, but fundamentally this is a political decision,\" Schrems said. \nData flow vital to EU economy \nFacebook argues there is nothing wrong with the current system and that there is no need for a referral. \nMason Hayes & Curran, the Dublin-based legal team acting for Facebook, has pointed to estimates that if services and cross-border data flows were to be disrupted, the European Union's gross domestic product (GDP) could be hit by as much as 1.3 percentage points. \nFacebook was forced to switch to SCCs last year after the European Court of Justice ruled in 2015 that the Safe Harbour framework, which had governed the EU-US flow of personal data, contravened EU law because the privacy of European citizens could not be guaranteed in the US. \nThe SCCs are considered as something of a stopgap measure designed to allow the transfer of data, pending agreement on a more comprehensive regime. \nThe Data Protection Commissioner issued a statement saying it welcomed the judgment. \n\"The High Court has confirmed it shares the Commissioner's concerns about the protection of those rights (protection of data privacy).\" \n\"It invites the CJEU to consider whether, under EU law, SCCs in their present form can and should be retained as a basis for the transfer of personal data from the EU to the US.\"",

exploring new ways to engage sports fans, tapping into their passion as it fights its corner in the cutthroat world of social media \nTwitter is exploring new ways to engage sports fans, tapping into their passion as it fights its corner in the cutthroat world of social media. \nTheo Luke, Twitter's sports partnership director for Europe and the Middle East, told Leaders Week in London that sport is a major driver of activity on the social networking site. \nLast year, when British voters chose to leave the European Union and Donald Trump swept to the US presidency, \"in the United Kingdom sport was the biggest topic of conversation,\" Luke said on Monday. \n\"Indeed, twice as many used Twitter for that than either Brexit and Donald Trump being elected (for example the night Leicester City won the Premier League title saw 360,000 tweets and England being knocked out of Euro 2016 generated 331,000).\" \nLuke said Twitter has around 15 million users in Britain and one in two of those who say they like sport are passionate about it. \n\"This corresponds with a study by Loughborough University that looked at sports fans and what platforms they used. They found that the more passionate you were about a team the more likely you were to use Twitter because we are the home of real-time information.\" \nTwitter sees a surge in users on matchdays, according to Luke. A panel of \"Twitter insiders\" with software on their phones enables the site to monitor the apps the users are interacting with. \n\"What you find as you get closer to a live game is our usage spikes as people want to interact with the live experience,\" said Luke. \n\"The space we operate in and pound for pound where we are doing really well in is the live environment and that is why live clips and live videos make so much sense to us.\" \n'End of Twitter' \nTwitter has taken steps to keep up with the demand from fans, even though it faces a challenge to compete with rivals with deeper pockets\u2014Amazon outbid it to acquire NFL streaming rights this year. \n\"We acquired Periscope as an app for consumer experience and last year (signed) a deal with the NFL for 10 Thursday games,\" said Luke. \n\"We worked with the NFL to package up the live experience and lots of clips to take us out to sponsors. We didn't win the next round for this season. Our friends at Amazon won it for a five-fold mark-up.\" \nIn Britain football is a major driver of activity on Twitter and the company teamed up with Sky on transfer deadline day. \nLuke, who has also worked at YouTube, said Twitter had defied the doomsayers who predicted that it was falling behind newer, flashier online rivals. \n\"Eighteen months ago we were being faced with headlines like 'End of Twitter' and 'Losing customers and stocks falling'. It was not a pleasant place to be. \n\"We faced challenges such as an abuse problem which took a long time to solve but we are overcoming them and now seeing emphatic results shown by users coming back to the platform.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "theo luke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "periscope", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pirate irwin twitter", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "twitter", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "leicester city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leaders week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loughborough university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:15:09.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d5918bedfd23cfb54e56bfad6f6b22b6e2199682", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaS5jE4sNFMsowQguz6qbbMlNt7E2uiL.fqWKkxrFAGk8OaTqFl0hN7aHuhO6BBK_1", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/physorg.rss", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "House sparrow decline linked to air pollution and poor diet", "title_full": "House sparrow decline linked to air pollution and poor diet", "published": "2017-10-03T16:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2017/sparrow.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d5918bedfd23cfb54e56bfad6f6b22b6e2199682", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaS5jE4sNFMsowQguz6qbbMlNt7E2uiL.fqWKkxrFAGk8OaTqFl0hN7aHuhO6BBK_1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "House sparrow decline linked to air pollution and poor diet", "text": "Homepage / Diet / House sparrow decline linked to air pollution and poor diet House sparrow decline linked to air pollution and poor diet Credit: CC0 Public Domain \nDespite being well-adapted to urban life, house sparrow numbers are falling.

Credit: \u00a9 2016 KAUST \nVibrating mechanical switches that can be cascaded to perform complex computational operations could take computing significantly further than today's technologies. KAUST researchers have demonstrated an alternative technology based on mechanical vibrations. \nThe microcomputer processors found inside every computer, mobile phone and microwave comprise mind-bogglingly complex networks of millions or billions of microscopic transistors \u2014electrical switches that turn on when a current flows across their terminals. These transistors are networked together to construct logic gates that perform operations, such as AND (when two inputs are on) and OR (when either input is on). In turn, these logic gates are connected to much larger networks to allow increasingly complex operations. \nWith each transistor consuming electrical current and generating heat even when not being actively switched, and with transistors approaching their physical limits of miniaturization and efficiency, the search is on for alternative technology that will eventually replace the electrical transistor and take computing into the future. \nSaad Ilyas and Nizar Jaber, doctoral researchers in the laboratory of Mohammad Younis, have now demonstrated a scalable, efficient alternative technology, not based on electrical current, but on mechanical vibrations excited by multifrequency electrical inputs. \n\"Electromechanical systems offer a major advantage over existing technology in that they are leakage free: that is, unlike electrical transistors, they only consume power when switched,\" explains Ilyas. \"They also require fewer gates per computing function, resulting in lower complexity, and they can be fabricated with higher integration densities\u2014it is even predicted that these systems could be scaled down to the molecular level.\" \nMicroelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have been investigated in the past for logic operations, but it has been a challenge to devise a mode of operation that allows the MEMS logic gates to be cascaded to form arbitrary computational functions. Jaber and Younis have come up with a novel technique to perform logic operations using MEMS based on frequency mixing, which holds great potential for cascading. \n\"We use an electrical signal as an input, which causes a clamped polymer microbeam to vibrate at a certain resonance frequency,\" says Jaber. \"This in turn generates motional current as an electrical signal with the same frequency, which could then be cascaded into the input of another MEMS logic gate.\" \nThe team demonstrated various logic operations at a single operating frequency, which is an important step towards cascading as the next milestone in MEMS resonator-based computing. Their logic gates are also compatible with existing fabrication techniques.

Credit: \u00a9 2017 Ibrahim Hoteit \nA collaboration between KAUST and several UK institutes has revealed that surface currents are important pathways for gene flow in the Red Sea, a finding which will help guide marine management programs. \nThe team, led by KAUST professor Ibrahim Hoteit, combined satellite imagery and simulations to explore the role of currents in the Red Sea biosphere. Coral communities are relatively homogenous throughout most of the Red Sea, although a genetic break separates the southern communities. \nThe team used satellite measurements of the color and height of Red Sea surface waters to infer current flows. By estimating chlorophyll concentrations from the color data, they also determined which currents were able to carry biological material. Their analysis identified significant variability in Red Sea eddies which could facilitate transport and dispersal throughout the whole basin. \nBuilding on their findings, the team simulated how these currents would disperse particles through the Red Sea. By calculating connectivity values between different sites, they showed that the central Red Sea is quite well connected to the rest of the basin, while the southern region is the least connected. \nNext, the researchers compared the results of the circulation flow with genetic data from Red Sea clownfish. The genetic distance between clownfish populations correlated well with connectivity, suggesting that water circulation patterns played a significant role in determining the population's distribution. \"It was exciting to establish that Red Sea connectivity can be characterized by flows based on satellite data, matching extremely well the patterns of clownfish gene data that were collected at the eastern coast,\" says Hoteit.

Reproduced with permission from reference. Credit: Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. \nThe molten surface of a sodium-based material could assist the direct conversion of methane to useful building blocks. \nFor natural gas to be efficiently converted into useful industrial products requires the right catalytic process. Researchers from KAUST and the US combine state-of-the-art techniques for material characterization to demonstrate a unique reaction pathway that shows that molten catalysts based on sodium can provide all the chemical species required to optimize the process. \nFree radicals, molecules with an unpaired valence electron, such as the hydroxyl radical, play a crucial role in the industrially important conversion of natural gas, primarily methane, to ethylene: a vital organic compound that forms the building blocks of many commodities and polymers. To enhance this process, known as oxidative coupling, it is vital to develop selective catalysts. \nThe KAUST team\u2014led by Kazuhiro Takanabe and his student Abdulaziz Khan\u2014used in situ tools to measure the state of a catalyst under reaction conditions. They discovered that the active species in the catalytic reaction that exits on the molten surface of the sodium tungstate, a chemical necessary for the reaction, is sodium peroxide. This catalyst is unique in that instead of activating methane directly, it firsts activates water and then generates gaseous hydroxyl radicals. \nOxidative coupling of methane converts methane and oxygen to ethylene in a single reactor. Previous research in Takanabe's lab had indicated that by using sodium tungstate at temperatures above 700 \u00b0C, the presence of water can both the increase the rate of methane conversion and enhance product selectivity. This could potentially occur via the formation of hydroxyl radicals and sodium peroxide, but there was no direct evidence for the presence of these species. \nNow, Takanabe and his co-authors provide direct evidence for the formation of these free radicals on the molten surface of sodium tungstate. They combine a wide range of experimental techniques, including X-ray diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, laser-induced fluorescence spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, to observe an outer layer of molten sodium tungstate that is rich in sodium hydroxide. \"We exclusively identified the catalyst's active phase in a unique state under reaction conditions,\" explains Takanabe. \nThis in turn confirms that a sodium -based catalyst can form hydroxyl radicals from a mixture of oxygen and water, a reaction that has never been seen. \"This catalyst and the unique reaction pathway have great potential for use in various catalytic reactions for natural gas conversion, petroleum refinery and combustion reactions,\" says Takanabe. \nMore broadly, this success also demonstrates the importance of combining in situspectroscopic and microscopic techniques to better understand high-temperature gas-phase chemistry.

Credit: Dr. Krushnamegh Kunte, NCBS-TIFR \nWhat do CPUs, stockbrokers, and butterflies have in common? They are good at investing their resources in the right place at the right time so as to maximize their returns! Trade-offs are a way of life for butterflies and other small insects that must budget their energy between numerous morphological features and activities during their short lifespans. Time, food, and space are always at a premium, and optimizing resource use is particularly important for migratory butterflies that must prepare for arduous journeys in uncertain environments. A new study by researchers at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS-TIFR, Bangalore) reports on butterfly migrations in peninsular India and explores the effect of migration on resource investment strategies of migratory butterflies. It reveals that migration affects the morphology and physiological states of female butterflies much more prominently compared to that of males. \nMilkweed butterflies (so called because they feed on plants with a milky sap) are commonly found in gardens and wooded areas in southern India. Every year, four species - the Double-branded Crow (Euploea sylvester), Common Crow (Euploea core), Dark Blue Tiger (Tirumala septentrionis), and Blue Tiger (Tirumala limniace) - undertake a bidirectional migration between the Western Ghats and the southern Eastern Ghats and surrounding eastern plains. Swarms composed of millions of these butterflies grace the environs of Bangalore on their way. This spectacular phenomenon first occurs between April and June, before the southwestern summer monsoons hit the Western Ghats, when butterflies are driven by pre-monsoon showers to the eastern plains and hills. The return migration to the Western Ghats, undertaken by newly emerged butterflies of the next generation, takes place between October and December, after the south-west monsoons are over. \nDuring the migration, these butterflies fly for long hours through unfamiliar landscapes and unpredictable environments, and still manage to remain in stable conditions that allow them to breed at the end of the migration. Migration allows these butterflies to escape the torrential monsoonal rains in the Western Ghats, but the physically exhausting and energetically demanding 350-500 kilometer journey also forces these insects to make some peculiar changes to their lifestyle. This must take some carefully balanced investments in flight morphology and reproductive tissue that allow them to switch their physiological states and deploy fat reserves when needed. How do they do this? \nTo find out, Ms. Vaishali Bhaumik, a PhD student at NCBS-TIFR and SASTRA University (Thanjavur) and her advisor Dr. Krushnamegh Kunte decided to study reproductive dynamics and physiological states of the migratory species in relation to their investments in flight and reproductive tissue. Typically, non-migratory butterflies start breeding within a few days after emerging from their pupae, with females growing bigger abdomens to accommodate eggs and fat tissue. Migrants, however, remain reproductively inactive during migration, i.e., in reproductive diapause. On comparing the abdomens of migrating butterflies in reproductive diapause with those of breeding individuals, Bhaumik found that being in a state of active reproduction has a disproportionately large effect on the body proportions of females. While the gonads of both sexes grow in size during the breeding season, the abdominal burden is significantly higher in females because of the sheer size and number of eggs they carry and the fat reserves required to sustain such an energetically costly reproductive effort. \n\"Our results indicate that female butterflies may have a lot more to lose if they do not invest optimally in flight over reproduction during migration. A hiker wouldn't carry around an unnecessarily heavy burden during her trek, and neither would a butterfly,\" said Bhaumik, adding, \"Migrants live longer than their resident (non-migratory) and reproductive cousins. They have distinct physiological states in their lifespans to meet the unique demands of a gruelling migratory flight, followed by reproduction.\" The butterflies die soon after laying eggs, and this could mean that investing in reproduction speeds up their ageing process. This strategy of entering reproductive diapause during migration and then breeding at the new location after migration thus allows females to fly across peninsular India with a lighter abdomen, and to produce a large number of eggs when the migration is over. \nA new generation of butterflies returns to the Western Ghats before the northeastern winter rains in November to January. However, this return migration is not frequently seen by butterfly watchers on the ground. This could be because there are fewer migrants in the returning swarms, they fly along different routes in a more loosely organized fashion, or fly at higher altitudes than those observed during the plains-ward journey in April-July. \nFuture work on this migration will concentrate on the climatic, behavioural, and genetic aspects, say the researchers. \"We would like to find out exactly what environmental conditions drive the switch between migratory and reproductive bouts,\" said Kunte. \"Our ongoing investigations into any possible genetic and hormonal differences between the migratory and non-migratory populations will go a long way in explaining this phenomenon.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bhaumik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krushnamegh kunte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tirumala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vaishali bhaumik", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national centre for biological sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sastra university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "thanjavur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangalore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:00:40.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e221c064c449724f0142335a148fe7dd5f03ce3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaQQl4uyYFuWFcXZQwGcXIqNfLvOc2SrqbagyoP7bfuE3zFeR1A3txiaaGvqTox2ezdggfst2QPKI-", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/physorg.rss", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Breaking the rules: Heavy chemical elements alter theory of quantum mechanics", "title_full": "Breaking the rules: Heavy chemical elements alter theory of quantum mechanics", "published": "2017-10-03T17:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2017/breakingther.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6e221c064c449724f0142335a148fe7dd5f03ce3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaQQl4uyYFuWFcXZQwGcXIqNfLvOc2SrqbagyoP7bfuE3zFeR1A3txiaaGvqTox2ezdggfst2QPKI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T17:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Breaking the rules: Heavy chemical elements alter theory of quantum mechanics", "text": "Breaking the rules: Heavy chemical elements alter theory of quantum mechanics October 3, 2017 by Kathleen Haughney Thomas Albrecht-Schmitt is the Gregory R. Choppin Professor of Chemistry at Florida State University. Credit: Bill Lax/FSU Photography Services \nA series of complicated experiments involving one of the least understood elements of the Periodic Table has turned some long-held tenets of the scientific world upside down. \nFlorida State University researchers found that the theory of quantum mechanics does not adequately explain how the heaviest and rarest elements found at the end of the table function. Instead, another well-known scientific theory\u2014Albert Einstein's famous Theory of Relativity\u2014helps govern the behavior of the last 21 elements of the Periodic Table. \nThis new research is published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society . \nQuantum mechanics are essentially the rules that govern how atoms behave and fully explain the chemical behavior of most of the elements on the table. But, Thomas Albrecht-Schmitt, the Gregory R. Choppin Professor of Chemistry at FSU, found that these rules are somewhat overridden by Einstein's Theory of Relativity when it comes to the heavier, lesser known elements of the Periodic Table. \n\"It's almost like being in an alternate universe because you're seeing chemistry you simply don't see in everyday elements,\" Albrecht-Schmitt said. \nThe study, which took more than three years to complete, involved the element berkelium, or Bk on the Periodic Table. Through experiments involving almost two dozen researchers across the FSU campus and the FSU-headquartered National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Albrecht-Schmitt made compounds out of berkelium that started exhibiting unusual chemistry. \nThey weren't following the normal rules of quantum mechanics. \nSpecifically, electrons were not arranging themselves around the berkelium atoms the way that they organize around lighter elements like oxygen, zinc or silver. Typically, scientists would expect to see electrons line up so that they all face the same direction. This controls how iron acts as a magnet, for instance. \nHowever, these simple rules do not apply when it comes to elements from berkelium and beyond because some of the electrons line up opposite of the way scientists have long predicted. \nAlbrecht-Schmitt and his team realized that Einstein's Theory of Relativity actually explained what they saw in the berkelium compounds. Under the Theory of Relativity, the faster anything with mass moves, the heavier it gets. \nBecause the nucleus of these heavy atoms is highly charged, the electrons start to move at significant fractions of the speed of light. This causes them to become heavier than normal, and the rules that typically apply to electron behavior start to break down. \nAlbrecht-Schmitt said it was \"exhilarating\" when he and his team began to observe the chemistry. \n\"When you see this interesting phenomenon, you start asking yourself all these questions like how can you make it stronger or shut it down,\" Albrecht-Schmitt said. \"A few years ago, no one even thought you could make a berkelium compound.\" \nBerkelium has been mostly used to help scientists synthesize new elements such as element 117 Tennessine, which was added to the table last year. But little has been done to understand what the element\u2014or several of its neighbors on the tables\u2014alone can do and how it functions. \nThe Department of Energy gave Albrecht-Schmitt 13 milligrams of berkelium, roughly 1,000 times more than anyone else has used for major research studies. To do these experiments, he and his team had to move exceptionally fast. The element reduces to half the amount in 320 days, at which point it is not stable enough experiments.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:00:45.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fabda90c4cfbfc77c12443abe832147acea3cfbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyacd0nwaWNlympYgLzfl7JeDfhzOCR5M1FRnnnuDpPA9w-", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/rss/physorg-science.xml", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Scotland says no to fracking", "title_full": "Scotland says no to fracking", "published": "2017-10-03T18:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/scotlandsgov.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fabda90c4cfbfc77c12443abe832147acea3cfbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyacd0nwaWNlympYgLzfl7JeDfhzOCR5M1FRnnnuDpPA9w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T18:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Scotland says no to fracking", "text": "Scotland says no to fracking October 3, 2017 Scotland's government said it would be banning fracking, extending the current moratorium \"indefinitely\" following a consultation that found widespread opposition to shale gas extraction. \nFracking will be banned in Scotland following a widespread public backlash against onshore drilling, the government said on Tuesday. \nThe government said \" fracking cannot and will not take place in Scotland\" after a scientific review and a comprehensive public consultation. \nOver 60,000 people responded to the consultation, the second largest response to any consultation in Scotland, and 99 percent were in favour of a ban. \nScottish Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said the health impacts of fracking were unclear, insisted fracking would detract from Scotland's climate change targets, and would add just 0.1 percent to GDP. \nBut Conservative Party opponents said the ruling Scottish National Party had disregarded the potential jobs and economic benefits fracking could deliver. \nThe semi-autonomous government does not currently have the power to issue or revoke fracking licenses, but it can prevent fracking through the planning permission system. \nThe Scottish Government has now written to local authorities informing them that any applications for fracking in Scotland will be opposed by ministers. \nWheelhouse said: \"This action is sufficient to effectively ban the development of unconventional oil and gas extraction in Scotland\". \nThe decision is expected to be approved by the Scottish Parliament with the support of Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Greens, but the centre-right Conservatives insist it is \"a short-sighted and economically damaging decision\" designed to appease nationalists in the environmental lobby. \nMurdo Fraser, Scottish Conservative finance spokesman, said: \"There's also a huge hypocrisy from the SNP here.

But harvesting grinds to a halt every time the combine operator has to climb down out of the cab to manually check for quality\u2014whole, un-split beans without stray husk material. Researchers from Kyoto University and University of Illinois recently developed a machine to automate the process, evaluating bean quality on the fly, so harvesting can go on uninterrupted. \n\"The main objective was to develop an efficient, compact, on-board quality -monitoring system to evaluate soybeans as they are harvested, providing the combine operator with real-time grain quality information,\" says Md Abdul Momin, lead scientist on the project. \nMomin explains that when the threshing speed is too high, the soybeans split or break as they are harvested. This is undesirable because whole beans are considered to be higher quality and bring a higher price. \n\"Without this machine, operators need to periodically stop threshing and manually check the tank to evaluate the quality and make adjustments,\" Momin says. \"With this machine, operators can look at a screen and make adjustments as they go, without stopping.\" \nThe machine, which includes a high-speed camera, is mounted inside the tank of the harvester. It takes images of the beans as they pass by and a computer program analyzes the beans in real time. One key is that it is a double-imaging system. It uses a combination of both front and back lighting so the camera can see the complete shape of the beans, making it possible to identify those that are truly split. \nMomin tested the system first in the laboratory and then in field conditions. The prototype is currently in the hands of a Japanese company that is working to develop a higher-speed camera and ultimately to produce the machine. \n\"The same system can be used in the processing industry with a $100 web camera , making it very affordable,\" Momin says. \"Mounting it inside of the combine is more ambitious because it needs a super high-speed camera to evaluate the soybeans as they pass rapidly by.\"Momin says soybean growers in Japan are eager to use this new technology to evaluate beans during the harvest.

Bates Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines erupting on June 12, 1991. A much larger eruption occurred three days later. Credit: U.S. Geological Survey \nExplosive volcanic eruptions in the tropics can lead to El Ni\u00f1o events, those notorious warming periods in the Pacific Ocean with dramatic global impacts on the climate, according to a new study. \nEnormous eruptions trigger El Ni\u00f1o events by pumping millions of tons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, which form a sulfuric acid cloud, reflecting solar radiation and reducing the average global surface temperature, according to the study co-authored by Alan Robock, a distinguished professor in the Department of Environmental Sciences at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. \nThe study, published online today in Nature Communications , used sophisticated climate model simulations to show that El Ni\u00f1o tends to peak during the year after large volcanic eruptions like the one at Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991. \n\"We can't predict volcanic eruptions, but when the next one happens, we'll be able to do a much better job predicting the next several seasons, and before Pinatubo we really had no idea,\" said Robock, who has a doctorate in meteorology. \"All we need is one number - how much sulfur dioxide goes into the stratosphere - and you can measure it with satellites the day after an eruption.\" \nThe El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is nature's leading mode of periodic climate variability. It features sea surface temperature anomalies in the central and eastern Pacific. ENSO events (consisting of El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a, a cooling period) unfold every three to seven years and usually peak at the end of the calendar year, causing worldwide impacts on the climate by altering atmospheric circulation, the study notes. \nStrong El Ni\u00f1o events and wind shear typically suppress the development of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says. But they can also lead to elevated sea levels and potentially damaging cold season nor'easters along the East Coast, among many other impacts.

Credit: Richard Hoblitt/U.S. Geological Survey \nSea surface temperature data since 1882 document large El Ni\u00f1o-like patterns following four out of five big eruptions: Santa Mar\u00eda (Guatemala) in October 1902, Mount Agung (Indonesia) in March 1963, El Chich\u00f3n (Mexico) in April 1982 and Pinatubo in June 1991. \nThe study focused on the Mount Pinatubo eruption because it's the largest and best-documented tropical one in the modern technology period. It ejected about 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide , Robock said. \nCooling in tropical Africa after volcanic eruptions weakens the West African monsoon, and drives westerly wind anomalies near the equator over the western Pacific, the study says. The anomalies are amplified by air-sea interactions in the Pacific, favoring an El Ni\u00f1o-like response. \nClimate model simulations show that Pinatubo-like eruptions tend to shorten La Ni\u00f1as, lengthen El Ni\u00f1os and lead to unusual warming during neutral periods, the study says. \nIf there's a big volcanic eruption tomorrow, Robock said he could make predictions for seasonal temperatures, precipitation and the appearance of El Ni\u00f1o next winter. \n\"If you're a farmer and you're in a part of the world where El Ni\u00f1o or the lack of one determines how much rainfall you will get, you could make plans ahead of time for what crops to grow, based on the prediction for precipitation,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "todd b. bates moun", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alan robock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard hoblitt/u", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa mar\u00eda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pinatubo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robock", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "el nino", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "department of environmental sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la ni\u00f1a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la ni\u00f1as", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el ni\u00f1o", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el ni\u00f1o southern oscillation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pinatubo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rutgers university-new brunswick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nature communications", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el ni\u00f1os", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national oceanic and atmospheric administration", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "east coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el ni\u00f1o", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clark air force base", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el chich\u00f3n", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pinatubo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guatemala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount agung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount pinatubo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:40:57.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d6fbed3e9c2fc868195d19bf9a9c45f9756b8aba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaySigQEzWrPGDCX7b1cmURlk3Ojr0DBqp5XQGIxLKsEoedxSa7b0gS9JhTQOjGtMJ", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/rss/physorg-science.xml", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Research suggests social action may give youth a career edge", "title_full": "Research suggests social action may give youth a career edge", "published": "2017-10-03T18:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cf3e497594.site.internapcdn.net/tmpl/v5/img/phys_308px.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d6fbed3e9c2fc868195d19bf9a9c45f9756b8aba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaySigQEzWrPGDCX7b1cmURlk3Ojr0DBqp5XQGIxLKsEoedxSa7b0gS9JhTQOjGtMJ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T18:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Research suggests social action may give youth a career edge", "text": "Research suggests social action may give youth a career edge October 3, 2017 by Michael Staton \nWhen disadvantaged youth engage in social activism, they tend to have high-status occupations in adulthood, according to Clemson University and University of Michigan researchers. The findings also suggest there's a place for more discussion of social issues in our educational systems. \n\"We have strong evidence that directly addressing and challenging\u2014instead of avoiding\u2014 inequality is good for historically marginalized youth. This implies that when educators provide a space for students to reflect, discuss and challenge inequalities, those students engage and learn more,\" said Luke Rapa, an assistant professor of adolescent development at Clemson, who co-authored the study. \nThe research published in the journal Developmental Psychology used data from the Maryland Adolescent Development in Context Study, a long-term research project that has followed a sample of children from 23 public middle schools in Maryland since 1991. Rapa, along with paper co-authors Matthew Diemer and Josefina Ba\u00f1ales of the University of Michigan, studied a subsample of these students from ages 17 to 29 that was made up of poor and working-class African-Americans. \nExamples of social action, for the study's purposes, ranged from a donation of time or money to political action groups, participation in women's rights groups and even protests. These are all examples of action arising from critical consciousness and awareness of social inequalities. \n\"Youth in the sample we studied who were engaged in social action had higher expectations for their own career trajectories,\" Rapa said. \"This suggests that students who engage in social action take the time to reflect critically on their surroundings. That critical thinking motivates them and that same sense of motivation may be what pays off for them in whatever career they choose.\" \nDiemer originally became interested in questions of critical consciousness from his time in classrooms with children struggling to make sense of inequalities in their day-to-day lives. It's in settings like this that Diemer hopes the real impact of the research will be felt; the study's results strongly imply that educators should meet topics related to social justice head on in classroom settings instead of shying away from them. \nDiemer said time for reflection and discussion helps schools achieve their mission and often helps students attain jobs that are more prestigious and higher paying as adults. He said teachers should take the opportunity to tackle all issues related to social inequalities whether they appear large or small on the surface. \nDiemer said teachers may be reluctant to do so because of concern they will discourage students, fear of becoming too political in the classroom and a feeling they are not adequately prepared to broach such topics. The researchers hope their findings might help ease some of those fears, both for teachers and administrators. \n\"It's meaningful to see that by broaching these topics and supporting the development of critical consciousness in students, educators are actually opening the door for marginalized youth to better navigate the structures that marginalized them in the first place,\" Rapa said.

Credit: Hutson Laboratory, Vanderbilt University \nIn a sharp and pointy world, wound healing is a critical and marvelous process. Despite a tremendous amount of scientific study, many outstanding mysteries still surround the way in which cells in living tissue respond to and repair physical damage. \nOne prominent mystery is exactly how wound-healing is triggered: A better understanding of this process is essential for developing new and improved methods for treating wounds of all types. \nUsing an ultrafast, ultraprecise ultraviolet laser, a team of physicists and biologists at Vanderbilt University has taken an important step toward understanding the nature of these trigger signals. Their new insights are described in a paper titled \"Multiple mechanisms drive calcium signal dynamics around laser induced epithelial wounds\" published Oct. 3 by the Biophysical Journal . \nPrevious research had determined that calcium ions play a key role in wound response. That is not surprising, because calcium signaling has an impact on nearly every aspect of cellular life. So, the researchers\u2014headed by Professor of Physics and Biological Sciences Shane Hutson and Associate Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology Andrea Page-McCaw\u2014targeted cells on the back of fruit fly pupae that expressed a protein that fluoresces in the presence of calcium ions. This allowed them to track changes in calcium ion concentrations in the cells around wounds in living tissue (as opposed to the cell cultures used in many previous wound response studies) and to do so with an unprecedented, millisecond precision. The video will load shortly. A team of physicists and biologists at Vanderbilt University have used an ultraprecise ultraviolet laser to track the calcium signaling produced by cell injury that triggers healing with unprecedented precision. Credit: Michael Todd, Vanderbilt University \nThe team created microscopic wounds in the pupae's epithelial layer using a laser that can be focused down to a point small enough to punch microscopic holes in individual cells (less than a millionth of a meter). The laser's precision allowed them to create repeatable and controllable wounds. They found that even the briefest of pulses in the nanosecond to femtosecond range produced a microscopic explosion called a cavitation bubble powerful enough to damage nearby cells. \n\"As a result, the damage the laser pulses produce is quite similar to a puncture wound surrounded by a crush wound\u2014blunt force trauma in forensic terms\u2014so our observations should apply to most common wounds,\" said first author Erica Shannon, a doctoral student in developmental biology. \nThe researchers were testing two prevailing hypotheses for the wound-response trigger. One is that damaged and dying cells release proteins into the extracellular fluid which surrounding cells sense, causing them to boost their internal calcium levels. This increased calcium concentration, in turn, triggers their transformation from a static to a mobile form, allowing them to begin sealing off the wound. The second hypothesis proposes that the trigger signal spreads from cell to cell through gap junctions, specialized intercellular connections that directly link two cells at points where they touch. These are microscopic gates that allow neighboring cells to exchange ions, molecules and electrical impulses quickly and directly. The video will load shortly. Fluorescent proteins track the spread of calcium signals following a wound. Credit: Hutson Laboratory, Vanderbilt University \n\"What is extremely exciting is that we found evidence that cells use both mechanisms,\" said Shannon. \"It turns out cells have a number of different ways to signal injury. This may allow them to differentiate between different kinds of wounds.\" The experiments revealed that the creation of a wound generates a complex series of calcium signals in the surrounding tissue: First comes a rapid influx of calcium into the cells immediately around the wound. This matches the footprint of the cavitation bubble. Calcium levels in the extracellular liquid are much higher than they are within the cells. Because of the rapidity with which it occurs (less than a tenth of a second) the researchers argue that this influx is caused by micro-tears in cell membranes ripped open by the force of the micro-explosion; Next, a short-lived, short-ranged wave spreads through healthy neighboring cells. The bigger the wound, the faster the wave spreads. The speed with which the wave moves suggests that it travels through gap junctions and is made up either of calcium ions or some other small signaling molecule. About 45 seconds after wounding a second wave appears. This wave moves much more slowly than the first wave but spreads considerably farther. The researchers interpret this to mean that it is being spread by larger molecules, most likely special signaling proteins, that diffuse more slowly than ions. However, they caution that further experiments are required to confirm this supposition. The second wave only occurs when cells are killed, not when they are just damaged, suggesting that it is dependent on the extent of the damage. The first two waves spread relatively symmetrically through the tissue. After the second wave, however, the area of high calcium concentration begins sending out \"flares\"\u2014directional streams of calcium uptake that spread farther into the surrounding tissue. Each flare lasts for tens of seconds and new flares continue starting for more than 30 minutes after the injury. \n\"Once we understand these trigger mechanisms, it should be possible to find ways to stimulate the wound healing process in people with conditions, like diabetes, that slow down the process or even to speed up normal wound healing ,\" said Hutson.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shane hutson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael todd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrea page-mccaw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erica shannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hutson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "biophysical journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hutson laboratory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanderbilt university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:18:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c79fc8a2a2a5a9bedb624c0b3dd651538b3072d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyacHNvzG5X52XWKJ59EvvENAPYmwIW2v_EqvBsm4mBBZMurZ8OQNsSfsMdGKa4rbhBKCfhRuQFVoY-", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://phys.org/rss-feed/biology-news/ecology/", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Ecology News - Biology News", "title": "Livestock grazing harming giant panda habitat", "title_full": "Livestock grazing harming giant panda habitat", "published": "2017-10-03T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2017/2-livestockgra.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c79fc8a2a2a5a9bedb624c0b3dd651538b3072d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyacHNvzG5X52XWKJ59EvvENAPYmwIW2v_EqvBsm4mBBZMurZ8OQNsSfsMdGKa4rbhBKCfhRuQFVoY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Livestock grazing harming giant panda habitat", "text": "Livestock grazing harming giant panda habitat October 3, 2017 A giant panda eats bamboo in Wanglang National Nature Reserve. Credit: Binbin Li \nIncreased livestock grazing in China's Wanglang National Nature Preserve has damaged one third of all giant panda habitat in the park, a new study by Chinese and U.S. scientists finds. \nThe habitat degradation coincides with a nine-fold increase in livestock numbers within the park over the past 15 years. \n\"Increasing numbers of free-ranging livestock inside the reserve's forests have caused tremendous impacts on bamboos, which constitute 99 percent of the giant pandas' diet,\" said Binbin Li, assistant professor at Duke Kunshan University's Environmental Research Centre, who led the study. \n\"What is worse, overgrazing has reduced the regeneration of these bamboos,\" Li said. \"Local communities leave their livestock to free range in the forests and only come to feed them salt twice a month. So the livestock feed on the bamboos year-round, especially in winter.\" \nLi and her colleagues from Duke University, Peking University and Wanglang National Nature Reserve published their findings Oct. 3 in the peer-reviewed journal Biological Conservation . \nThe Wanglang reserve is located in the Min Mountains of Sichuan Province, home to the largest population of wild giant pandas in China. The park is one of the oldest and most important of the 67 nature reserves China has established in recent decades to protect wild giant pandas. National forest conservation policies have helped halt deforestation in these parks, but as the new study shows, increased livestock grazing presents a new threat. Effects of ten years of livestock grazing on bamboo forests can be seen at this site in Wanglang National Nature Reserve. Credit: Binbin Li \nTo conduct the analysis, Li and her team used 20 years of monitoring data to survey changes in the geographic distribution of bamboos, pandas and livestock within the park. This allowed the scientists to model where degradation or loss of panda habitats has occurred. Livestock movements were tracked by GPS collars. \n\"This long-term monitoring shows that the pandas are being driven out of the areas that are heavily used by the livestock, especially the park's valleys,\" said Stuart Pimm, Doris Duke Professor of Conservation Biology at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment. \"These lower elevation areas are crucial for giant pandas , especially during winter and spring.\" \nOn-the-ground observations of panda activity in the park's valleys support the model's findings. \n\"We have found many fewer signs of pandas in these areas in recent years,\" said Luo Chunping, a staff scientist at Wanglang National Nature Reserve. Livestock grazing has damaged one-third of all giant panda habitat in one of China's oldest and most important panda preserves. Credit: Binbin Li \n\"If grazing is left uncontrolled, we are going to lose huge amounts of suitable panda habitats, to which we have devoted so much effort to protect in the past decades,\" Li said. \nNumerous factors could be driving local communities to increase their use of the reserve for livestock grazing, the study's authors noted. These factors include the federal ban on logging and the policy to revert previously cleared cropland on steep slopes back into forests. They could also include increased consumer demand for meat in local markets; a sharp drop in tourism income in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake that hit the region in 2008; and unclear government policies about financial compensation for farmers who agree to remove their livestock from protected areas. \nWith the loss of so many other sources of income, raising livestock in the forested areas has become an increasingly popular livelihood. The researchers are working with local communities and other stakeholders to more fully understand the socio-economic drivers of the rapid increase of livestock grazing in the park's forests in recent years, and identify potential solutions. \n\"These problems are not unique to our study area, but common throughout the panda nature reserves and habitats. It is not just an ecological problem, but also a gamble between the communities, the nature reserves , local governments and other stakeholders,\" said Li Sheng, assistant professor of conservation biology at Peking University. \n\"Instead of just a livestock ban, we need to find alternative livelihood practices for the local community, like job opportunities in tourism or forest stewardship, which are preferred by the locals we interviewed,\" Li said. \"Reduce the number of livestock in panda habitats, promote better ways of raising livestock , and find the balance between panda conservation and local development.

Researchers have recently attributed this ability to a chemical reaction that takes place within the eye and whose success depends on the field direction. However, University of Oxford researchers report October 3 in Biophysical Journal that the current form of this \"radical-pair mechanism\" is not sensitive enough to explain the disruption of the avian magnetic compass by certain radiofrequency magnetic fields, raising new questions about this popular example of quantum biology. \nUnder most reaction conditions with most molecules, the Earth's magnetic field is far too weak\u2014roughly 200 times feebler than a refrigerator magnet\u2014to have any impact on the amount of products produced. But under special reaction circumstances, a burst of energy, perhaps from a light source, creates two short-lived radicals\u2014compounds with one unpaired electron each. These high-energy intermediates, and consequently the outcome of the reaction, are quite sensitive to even weak magnetic fields . In bird eyes, suitable radicals are believed to be generated within cryptochrome, a light-absorbing protein that produces an as-yet-unidentified signaling molecule in a quantity determined by the field direction, resulting in an avian magnetic compass. \n\"The radical-pair mechanism of magnetoreception is still just a hypothesis, and arguably the best evidence we have for it so far is the effect of time-dependent radiofrequency magnetic fields on the ability of migratory birds to detect the direction of the Earth's magnetic field,\" says senior author Peter Hore, an Oxford biophysical chemist specializing in magnetic influences on chemical reactions. \nExperimental studies of avian magnetic-compass disruption have largely used two different kinds of field frequencies. One approach involves a field oscillating at a single frequency, whereas the other uses broadband noise spread over a range of frequencies. To date, experimental evidence has been unable to agree on which setups actually confuse avian navigation and to what extent. \nFaced with the conflicting body of experimental work, the researchers took a computational approach to the problem and designed a new method to simulate the effects of broadband radio noise along the birds' routes. They applied this method and analogous preexisting methods for single-frequency radiation to three plausible radical pairs that might form within cryptochrome and respond to changes in magnetic intensity. \nAlthough the simulations showed that identical radiofrequency conditions imposed different spin-sensitivity patterns for the different proposed radical pairs, the researchers determined that current experimental evidence is insufficient to identify one responsible radical pair from among the choices. \"Even with generous assumptions about the properties of the radicals, we predict tiny effects of these radiofrequency fields, and the main conclusion that we come to is that the current understanding of the radical-pair model can't explain any of the reported behavioral results,\" says Hore. \nThis inability to explain the experimental performance of the avian magnetic compass raises a whole series of questions. These include the overall validity of the radical-pair mechanism, whether birds might have evolved to be able to detect minute magnetic changes and have thus become susceptible to human-produced radio noise as a side-effect, or even whether applied electromagnetic fields might be affecting a different behavior\u2014such as motivation\u2014altogether. \n\"It is possible that we're just barking up the wrong tree and there's a different mechanism entirely,\" Hore says. \"I prefer to think that there is some aspect of the mechanism that we're completely missing that amplifies the effect of time-dependent magnetic fields on the radical pairs and makes them more sensitive to changes than our simulations predict.\" \nTo help elucidate the workings of the compass once and for all, the researchers propose a number of experimental conditions inspired by cases they analyzed with their computational methods. In particular, they identify bands of radiofrequency noise not yet studied in behavioral experiments and predict that these would substantially affect specific biologically plausible radicals. \n\"Those experiments will probably be quite challenging because of the high-frequency fields involved, but their outcome should finally tell us whether it is a radical-pair mechanism or not, and if it is, what the radicals are,\" Hore says.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter hore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hore", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "biophysical journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of oxford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cc0 public domain  the", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:31:49.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0dd03c9be178fbf8cc3b2a76aaae7c50b785ccf7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaDw8_1Mjqh8DLwGKB4abc0OAq2wfIrN5Zec3P9QqnxMSLDVF5kWRh5e5D9vbYKmHW", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/rss-feed/", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Study suggests hydrogen, oxygen, water and carbon dioxide generated in Earth's mantle", "title_full": "Study suggests hydrogen, oxygen, water and carbon dioxide generated in Earth's mantle", "published": "2017-10-03T19:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/utastudyshed.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0dd03c9be178fbf8cc3b2a76aaae7c50b785ccf7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaDw8_1Mjqh8DLwGKB4abc0OAq2wfIrN5Zec3P9QqnxMSLDVF5kWRh5e5D9vbYKmHW", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T19:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Study suggests hydrogen, oxygen, water and carbon dioxide generated in Earth's mantle", "text": "Diamonds show Earth still capable of 'superhot' surprises September 22, 2017 \nDiamonds may be 'forever,' but some may have formed more recently than geologists thought.

Credit: Robert Hubner, WSU Photo Services \nTo keep pace with the fast-evolving study of cellular plant science, an international team of researchers has created terminology and definitions likely to become everyday language in laboratories and university classrooms worldwide. \nDirected by plant cell biologist Andrei Smertenko of Washington State University, the group of 22 scientists developed a glossary of terms that puts scientists\u2014ranging from plant biologists and botanists to biochemists\u2014on the same page. \nIn a current article published in the journal Trends in Cell Biology , the authors put forth a lexicon that identifies certain structures and processes associated with the last phase of cell division in plants, called cytokinesis . \nThe rate of emerging ideas and insights related to cytokinesis was outpacing the language to convey them, said Smertenko. \n\"Certain cytokenetic structures and processes were being referred to by different words and with slightly different definitions. This was generating confusion among experts and students alike,\" he said. \nCytokinesis occurs when the parent cell builds a wall that separates the two daughter cells . Until now, no uniform vocabulary existed for the phragmoplast stage, when a scaffold-like structure forms to support construction of that wall, known as the cell plate. \n\"To foster further research in the field and ensure that students are taught correctly, we came up with exact words to convey precise meanings,\" Smertenko explained. \nOne of those words is \"disk phragmoplast,\" which scientists had been calling by at least three different terms, he said. \nThe paper's authors, from countries including the United States, the Czech Republic, Greece and Japan, reached a consensus on 34 terms and definitions by exchanging numerous emails and talking by phone. \n\"We had long discussions with some heated debates. When you work on something so closely and get used to calling it by a certain term, letting go can be hard,\" Smertenko said. \nA deeper understanding of cytokinesis could accelerate the breeding process in trees for production of materials that would substitute oil and natural gas. This approach would also reduce mounting pressure on existing natural forests and reduce carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere.

Credit: Saige Kelmelis \nDuring the Middle Ages, nearly everyone in Europe was exposed to the disfiguring, painful and ostracizing disease of leprosy. But did contracting the disease necessarily increase a person's chances of dying? \n\"You'd think it would be a shut case,\" says ASU-SFI Center Postdoctoral Fellow Mike Price, an author on a new paper in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology . \"But interpreting archaeological data is tricky. Archaeologists must study the bones of people who have died, and dead people are not representative of the living. It's like making conclusions about modern, healthy people by observing sick people in hospitals.\" The paper lays out a model that offers a way to explore both morbidity\u2014contracting a disease \u2014and mortality\u2014dying from it\u2014through a unique data set of bones recovered from a rural monastery in Denmark. \n\"Our paper does say, yes, if you have leprosy, you will die sooner. But there are subtleties,\" says Price. Sex and social status also likely played roles in a person's risk of death from leprosy. \nLeprosy first presents outwardly as boils on the skin. As it progresses, it can form lesions on the bones, allowing for paleopathological study of the disease. \n\"There's a paradoxical component to looking at skeletons,\" says Penn State bioarcheologist Saige Kelmelis, lead author, who analyzed the skeletons. Say you have bones of two people who were born in the same year. One died at age 25, and their bones are pristine while the other, who died at age 50, has lesions all over their skeleton. Which person was healthier? \"This model takes into account how we calculate age of death and errors in that, and lesion data, to get a picture of someone's risk of death. Then we can say something tangible about what the living population would have been like.\" \nToday, leprosy shows up in different populations in different ways. It's very rare in the US, but is still an enormous problem in other parts of the world, and people in lower socio-economic statuses are at greater risk says Kelmelis. \"Knowing the current state of the disease, we wondered if we could see similar patterns in the past.\" Ancient skeleton shows leprosy may have spread to Britain from Scandinavia May 13, 2015 \nAn international team, including archaeologists from the University of Southampton, has found evidence suggesting leprosy may have spread to Britain from Scandinavia.

Now there's evidence that they can also be sources of spoilage molds. \nResearch from Cornell University mycologist Kathie Hodge and doctoral candidate Megan Biango-Daniels reveals varying levels of mold contamination in commercial sea salts. Among those molds were important food spoilage molds like Aspergillus and Penicillium , and even some notorious producers of mycotoxins. \n\"This new finding contradicts the conventional wisdom that salts are sterile ingredients,\" said Biango-Daniels. The research stressed the importance of understanding the risk of using sea salt during food production. \nStarting with seven different commercial salts, the researchers extracted living fungi and grew them in the lab for identification. The fungi discovered in the salt have the potential to spoil food when used as an ingredient and can introduce mycotoxins or allergens when consumed. \nAt the levels discovered in the study, about 1.7 spores per gram, you're not risking your health by sprinkling sea salt on food you are about to eat. But big problems may result when sea salts are used at home or industrially to make cured meats, fermented pickles or brined cheeses that mature over time - when molds introduced with sea salt can begin to grow and spoil food, maybe even rendering it toxic. \n\"Fungi can survive in surprisingly hostile places. They can't increase or grow in a container of sea salt - nothing can - but spores of some fungi survive quite happily there. Later they can wake up and make trouble in our food,\" said Hodge, associate professor in the Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology Section in Cornell's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. \nFungi likely make their way into sea salts during their production from seawater or during storage and packaging. Sea salt production starts with seawater trapped in outdoor ponds called salterns. As the seawater evaporates, salt crystals form and are scraped up from the ponds and dried. Fungi may remain from microbes that live in the salterns, or their spores may fall in from the air over weeks of evaporation. Once fungi are in the salt, they have the potential to grow again once they encounter a moister environment. The researchers said microbial safety standards for this currently unregulated ingredient are needed to prevent food spoilage. Fungal toxins easily become airborne, creating potential indoor health risk June 23, 2017 \nToxins produced by three different species of fungus growing indoors on wallpaper may become aerosolized, and easily inhaled.

Credit: Concordia University \nA team of 98 scientists from 22 countries has compiled the most comprehensive database of past global temperature records to date, spanning 1 CE to the present. \n\"This is a shining example of large-scale cooperative science,\" says Jeannine-Marie St-Jacques, assistant professor in Concordia's Department of Geography, Planning and Environment, who contributed to the publication. \n\"Together we did what we couldn't do independently or in small groups.\" \nThe culmination of three years of painstaking collaborative work, the PAGES2k 2,000 Year Multiproxy Database contains 692 records from 648 locations across the globe, including new additions from all continents and ocean basins. \nThe records include trees, corals, glacier ice, lake and marine sediments, as well as documentary evidence. Together, they form the largest body of climate records with the highest temporal resolution available, ranging from the biweekly to the bicentennial. \nThe data set is the result of an initiative of the Past Global Changes (PAGES) Project, an association of paleo-scientists whose mandate is to promote and improve understanding of past global environmental and climatic changes in the Earth system. It is an updated version of the influential 2013 PAGES2k database, which also sought to reconstruct surface temperature across the globe over two millennia. \nThe improved and expanded version was published online in Nature: Scientific Data in July. \nThe database was uploaded in various formats as an open-access document. The authors hope this accessibility measure will give scientists and citizens in general more accurate tools for studying the causes and patterns of global temperature changes. \n'We're warming, as we feared, and very fast' \nStudying the past is key to providing context for long-term climatic variability. In particular, it's important for distinguishing between the anthropogenic and natural causes of climate change. \nAs St-Jacques points out, instrumental measurements of global observed temperature changes only date back 150 years or so, at the very best. In much of Canada, it's about 50 years. \nData from before that period must be taken from proxy records\u2014indirect sources of climate information. These range from ice cores and tree rings in higher latitudes, to corals in the tropics, to pollen worldwide. \nSt-Jacques is an expert specializing in trees, diatoms and pollen. She contributed pollen records to the database. \nThe 692 records were collected from scientific literature and online repositories. The individual temperature records were then averaged out and compared. They show a long-term cooling trend followed by a sharp warming increase beginning in the 19th century. The result, which holds across the proxy data, is consistent with previous climate change research. \n\"The instrumental records show a steep rise in temperatures, but they don't show what we're coming out of,\" St-Jacques says. \n\"For that, you need to go to the paleo records. Now that we have the broadest yet most stringent collection of temperature data, we can say yes, we're still seeing that hockey stick pattern that earlier researchers have found.\" \nIn other words, St-Jacques adds, \"It confirms that we're warming, as we feared, and very fast.\" \nNew records are being added to the database as they become available, and a number of subgroups from the initial consortium of scientists have already been tasked with writing scientific reports based on the collected data. \nSt-Jacques has just finished preliminary work in the Gasp\u00e9sie this summer as part of an effort to get more temperature-sensitive tree rings for this purpose. She sees the work as a necessary part of responsible data stewardship\u2014research that will ultimately help us better understand and prepare for the full impacts of future climate change . \n\"This kind of housekeeping is something that we as scientists have to do.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "st-jacques", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeannine-marie st-jacques", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "concordia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "concordia university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:53:55.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c3a96ff7953a10bd9566f7d754a944ce66c892bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaCdUbGd8eFb11Tp1oaxzHq4XGqX4RO.RcNkvgU06v.QWpRr.65MHcarcMXTtqc.1q", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/rss-feed/", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Nrl receives patent for carbon capture device\u2014a key step in synthetic fuel production from seawater", "title_full": "Nrl receives patent for carbon capture device\u2014a key step in synthetic fuel production from seawater", "published": "2017-10-03T19:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/nrlreceivesu.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c3a96ff7953a10bd9566f7d754a944ce66c892bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaCdUbGd8eFb11Tp1oaxzHq4XGqX4RO.RcNkvgU06v.QWpRr.65MHcarcMXTtqc.1q", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T19:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nrl receives patent for carbon capture device\u2014a key step in synthetic fuel production from seawater", "text": "Nrl receives patent for carbon capture device\u2014a key step in synthetic fuel production from seawater October 3, 2017 by Daniel Parry The Electrolytic-Cation Exchange Module (E-CEM), developed at the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), provides the Navy the capability to produce the raw materials necessary to develop synthetic fuel stock for production of LNG, CNG, F-76, and JP-5, at sea, or in remote locations.

With around 38,000 gigatons (Gt) of carbon, our world's oceans contain 16 times as much carbon as that found on land or in the atmosphere combined. \n\"With greater attention being directed at mitigating the effects CO 2 can have on the environment, an interesting and attractive alternative is to recycle the gas into energy-rich molecules,\" said Dr. Heather Willauer, research chemist, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). \"The process, based on Fischer-Tropsch technology, is CO 2 neutral and eliminates the emission of sulfur and nitrogen compounds that are produced from the combustion of petroleum derived fossil fuels.\" \nBuilding on the concept of capturing this natural resource, researchers at NRL have developed and received patent 9,719,178 , issued Aug. 1 by the U.S. Patent and Trade Office (USPTO), for an electrolytic-cation exchange module (E-CEM) . Under this design, the E-CEM is capable of simultaneously extracting CO 2 from seawater and producing hydrogen (H2). \n\"In our previous work, the initial scale-up and integration of the E-CEM into a skid platform provided us the data needed to establish faster acidity equilibrium for future modules and improve energy efficiencies and production,\" said Willauer. \"This technology provides the Navy the capability to produce fuel stock, at sea or in remote locations, for the production of synthetic LNG, CNG, F-76, and JP-5 petroleum products.\" \nLocated at NRL's Marine Corrosion Facility, Key West, Florida, the next generation, modified E-CEM, demonstrates the progressive steps forward toward integrating and commercializing these systems.

Their study - Pollination by the locally endangered island flying fox ( Pteropus hypomelanus ) enhances fruit production of the economically important durian ( Durio zibethinus ) - has been published in the Journal of Ecology and Evolution . \nThe video footage was captured on Tioman Island by a team led by Dr Sheema Abdul Aziz as part of her PhD at the Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle (France) in collaboration with the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus. Dr Sheema said: \"These are very important findings because they shed more light on the crucial ecosystem services provided by flying foxes. Previously it was known that the smaller, nectar-feeding bats are pollinators for durian - but many people believed that flying foxes were too large and destructive to play such a role. Our study shows the exact opposite: that these giant fruit bats are actually very effective in pollinating durian trees.\" \nThe spikey tropical durian fruit, with its spikey skin and distinctive odour, is highly prized throughout Malaysia and Thailand. A ubiquitous icon of Southeast Asian culture, it is also a lucrative industry, generating millions of US dollars in local and international trade. The new findings suggest these economic profits owe a huge debt to large fruit bats such as flying foxes - as they were previously believed to be destructive rather than beneficial. \nDr Ahimsa Campos-Arceiz, from the School of Environment and Geographical Sciences of the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus and one of the coauthors of the study, said: \"The durian is a fascinating plant that, with its flowers pollinated by bats and its seeds dispersed by large animals like elephants, beautifully exemplifies the importance of plant animal interactions. The durian fruit is particularly famous for its pungent smell and unique taste, adored by most people in Southeast Asia and so often misunderstood - abhorred? - by westerners. We hope this study brings attention to the urgency of conserving flying foxes in Southeast Asia.\" The video will load shortly. Flying foxes eating Durian. Credit: RIMBA \nFlying fox populations in severe decline \nThe island flying fox is already classified as 'endangered' on Malaysia's National Red List. \nLarge fruit bats of the genus Pteropus are severely threatened by hunting and deforestation. They are often sold and eaten as exotic meat due to an unsubstantiated belief that consuming them can help cure asthma and other respiratory problems. They are also persecuted and killed as agricultural pests, as some people claim that the bats cause damage and economic loss by feeding on cultivated fruits. \nConsequently, these factors have led to a severe decline in flying fox populations worldwide. \nRepercussions for tropical ecosystems \nThis study shows that these bats play important roles as seed dispersers and pollinators in rainforests, especially on islands. Their disappearance could therefore have repercussions for tropical ecosystems. \nThis international team of researchers from Malaysia, France, India, and Thailand, in collaboration with Tree Climbers Malaysia, has found that Southeast Asia's durian supply could be affected too. \nDr Sheema said: \"If people end up hunting flying foxes to extinction, it's not hard to see that there could be serious implications for Southeast Asia's beloved 'King of Fruits'.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "durio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahimsa campos-arceiz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheema abdul aziz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of nottingham malaysia campus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "school of environment and geographical sciences of the university of nottingham malaysia campus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "southeast asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tioman island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:00:42.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ee752822c4a7c27b4e9c379a8d71216ce347c5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaM6Iyxz7Ex.q6Qq6m.yYADQuc2GKbhFa3eYAw6DXCyuuPIbTLoBOiaQ--", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/rss-feed/", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org -

Smith was the lone witness at the first of several Capitol Hill hearings this week. No current Equifax official testified. \n\"The criminal hack happened on my watch, and as CEO, I am ultimately responsible, and I take full responsibility,\" Smith said. \"I am here today to say to each and every person affected by this breach, I am truly and deeply sorry for what happened.\" \nDemocrats favor legislation that they say would establish strong data security standards and prompt notification and relief for consumers when their information is hacked. But Republicans tamped down expectations for any congressional action as this year the GOP-led Congress has rolled back several Obama-era rules affecting businesses and the financial sector. \n\"Equifax deserves to be shamed in this hearing, but we should also ask what Congress has done, or failed to do, to stop data breaches from occurring,\" said Rep.

Bob Latta, R-Ohio, the chairman of the subcommittee examining the breach, said there are already laws on the books that require companies to secure sensitive consumer data. He said that hearings before four House and Senate panels this week should run their course before lawmakers make a decision about what to do next. \n\"The big thing we heard today is it was a very human error on their part\" Latta said. \nSmith offered a timeline of what went wrong, saying the Department of Homeland Security warned the company on March 8 about the need to patch a particular vulnerability in software used by Equifax and other businesses. The company disseminated that warning by email the next day and requested that applicable personnel install the upgrade. The company's policy requires the upgrade to occur within 48 hours, but that did not occur. The company's information security department also ran scans on March 15 that did not pick up the vulnerability. \nIn late July, data security officials noticed suspicious activity on a website, which Smith said \"happens routinely around our business.\" He said an internal investigation ensued and he was alerted the next day, but he had no knowledge at that time that consumers' personal information had been accessed.

On Aug. 1 and 2, Equifax Chief Financial Officer John Gamble and two other executives, Rodolfo Ploder and Joseph Loughran, sold a combined $1.8 million in stock. \nSmith described the executives as \"honorable men, men of integrity.\" He said at that point in time the company was unaware that consumer data had been accessed. \nSchakowsky said \"for a lot of Americans, that just doesn't pass the smell test.\" \nSmith said the full extent of what occurred emerged during a meeting he had with cybersecurity experts and outside counsel on August 17.

He said the company has increased its number of customer service representatives and the website has been improved. He said more than 400 million consumers contacted the company in the weeks following the announcement of the breach.

Credit: NYU Tandon School of Engineering \nTitanium is the preferred material for surgical fixation procedures ranging from knee replacement to jaw implants. However, since this super-strong metal is not absorbed by the body over time, it can cause complications like infection, fistulization (particularly following radiation therapy), interference with skeletal growth, intolerance, thermal sensitivity, and interference with MRI and other imagining procedures. Additional procedures to remove hardware are among the most common surgeries worldwide and a major cost for hospitals. \nA promising alternative is magnesium, a safely biodegradable metal and cofactor for many enzymes in DNA repair that also promotes bone health. But while its physical properties make it suitable for load-bearing sites, such as the temporomandibular region of the jaw, its rapid breakdown in the body sometimes results in the formation of hydrogen bubbles that can lead to serious complications. \nIn a unique collaboration, researchers at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, NYU School of Medicine, and NYU Dentistry are developing and testing alloys of magnesium that are treated to improve strength and slow down the degradation process, thereby avoiding the formation of these bubbles. \nIn research published in the Journal of Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery , the team, which includes Nikhil Gupta, associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at NYU Tandon; Paulo Coelho, the Dr. Leonard I. Linkow Professor at NYU Dentistry; Eduardo D. Rodriguez, Helen L. Kimmel Professor of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery and chair, Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss Department of Plastic Surgery at NYU School of Medicine; and Andrea Torroni, MD, associate professor, Wyss Department of Plastic Surgery at NYU School of Medicine, reported on their tests of a magnesium alloy that was subjected in Gupta's lab to a process called T-5 tempering, involving heating at 210 degrees Celsius for 48 hours. \nAfter surgically implanting small samples of the alloy in the fronto-nasal region of study animals, the team examined the accumulation of the element in the lymph nodes, finding no difference between animals with no implants and the study animals. The researchers also implanted untreated\u2014or \"as-cast\"\u2014alloy, finding that both the as-cast samples and T-5 heat-treated alloys showed good biocompatibility and promoted bone growth in test animals. The T-5 alloy, however, was much more stable, with an eight-fold lower degradation rate than the as-cast alloy. \nGupta said he was not surprised by the positive results, as they mirrored what he had observed during in vitro studies at NYU Tandon. \n\"In our lab we put both as-cast and the heat-treated alloy in a solution of sodium chloride to simulate body fluid environments. Not surprisingly, the as-cast version corroded a lot. However, the heat-treated version did not corrode at all,\" he said. \"What we have discovered is that by employing heat treatment we can change the alloy completely from a degradable, resorbable structure to one that doesn't degrade over time. In essence, heat treatment makes magnesium behave, in vitro and in vivo, more like titanium.\" \nTorroni thinks the results auger well for eventual clinical applications of T-5 magnesium, whose mechanical properties are comparable to titanium, even in mandibular fractures, where stress on bone is particularly high. \"The T-5 is really the best candidate for these high-stress applications. It has superior properties that are very close to those of bone and is very good for fixation of fractures,\" he explained. \"It exhibits lower long-term risks because it resorbs. And it can promote bone formation and bone healing. It is totally biocompatible with no risk of rejection, and limited risk of infection.\" \nThe team also discerned no post-surgical morbidity, even in the control animals that received implants of untreated magnesium. \n\"Because of magnesium's systemic absorbability, this is not a problem,\" said Coelho. \"The key idea is to make an implant that can be either non-absorbable, as a permanent support, or absorbable, like sutures that go away after some time.\" Gupta said that the research would not have been possible without collaboration between NYU institutions. \"The breadth of this research takes it from the lab all the way to a clinical setting,\" he added.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gupta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrea torroni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leonard i. linkow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paulo coelho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nikhil gupta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eduardo d. rodriguez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helen l. kimmel professor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coelho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "torroni", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nyu tandon school of engineering", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hansj\u00f6rg wyss department of plastic surgery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyu tandon school of engineering  titanium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reconstructive plastic surgery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wyss department of plastic surgery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyu dentistry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyu school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyu tandon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:05:41.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0b41ed638603cbb7612beac569e3b919fcf0d8ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaPVlbiuTVaiHv32Gj48a9tIVA1IK9alSSNYktPh.CyGVJV9FcNo7HRPKd2Laxd1JJjOUWcvMwyyTTNrZ3sk2fSA--", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/rss-feed/", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Researchers identify free-flowing aerosol particles using holograms, lasers", "title_full": "Researchers identify free-flowing aerosol particles using holograms, lasers", "published": "2017-10-03T19:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2017/69-researchersi.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0b41ed638603cbb7612beac569e3b919fcf0d8ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaPVlbiuTVaiHv32Gj48a9tIVA1IK9alSSNYktPh.CyGVJV9FcNo7HRPKd2Laxd1JJjOUWcvMwyyTTNrZ3sk2fSA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T19:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Researchers identify free-flowing aerosol particles using holograms, lasers", "text": "Researchers identify free-flowing aerosol particles using holograms, lasers October 3, 2017 Two overlapping lasers are helping Kansas State University physics researchers create holographic images of free-flowing air particles, which may help climate scientists and biological weapons watchdogs monitor what's in the air.

We have solved the inverse problem.\" \nReferring to a problem that is worked backward from results to cause, Berg said before this study, the inverse problem with aerosol particles was largely educated guesswork based on mathematical calculations. Researchers could not objectively define free-floating aerosol particles because merely capturing a particle and looking at it under a microscope could change its physical shape or size. Now, they can bounce light waves off the particle and measure the deflection. The green laser is the traditional method that can be used to measure the light deflection, left. By providing the red laser, researchers also get a 3-D image that can subjectively account for a variety of particle shapes, middle.

The green laser is the traditional method that can be used to measure the light deflection; by providing the red laser, they also get a 3-D image that can subjectively account for a variety of particle shapes. \n\"We get the two properties\u2014size and shape\u2014that we've always wanted to get,\" Berg said. \"We still have all the advantages that people had with the last 50 years\u2014light scattering, contact free and measurements can be done rapidly\u2014and then we can put it on an instrument and fly it around in the air.\" \nBerg is working to put the laser setup on an unmanned aircraft to measure free-flowing aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Removing the particles from their natural environment can change the particle form, Berg said. For example, if the particles are frozen in the atmosphere and scientists collect them to bring them back to the ground to study, the particles could melt and change their shapes and sizes. \n\"If we think about climate science, they want to know the size and shape of particles floating in the atmosphere,\" Berg said. \"This information can help climate scientists account for how much sunlight those particles scatter back into space or absorb\u2014and if they absorb, by how much will it heat up the surrounding atmosphere .\" Image: Giant berg on the move September 21, 2017 \nWitnessed by the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission on 12 July 2017, a lump of ice more than twice the size of Luxembourg broke off the Larsen C ice shelf, spawning one of the largest icebergs on record and changing the outline ...

The iPhone maker, as well as Ireland, have appealed the decision. \nOnce found at fault, a country must recover the amount granted in illegal state aid, potentially a huge amount of money given that some of the tax deals date back many years.

Credit: Nikita Taparia, University of Washington \nAbout one quarter of the world's population suffers from anemia, a disease caused by a concentration deficiency of hemoglobin in red blood cells. To reduce the burden of anemia, health officials need a better picture of the disease's global impact, an understanding made viable by a portable and affordable way to analyze blood. \n  Washington developed a device smaller than a toaster that can detect the level of hemoglobin in whole blood samples using optical absorbance. The work is published this week in AIP Advances . \nHemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells that transports oxygen throughout the body. As the concentration of hemoglobin decreases, the body becomes starved of oxygen, often resulting in dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath, and abnormal heart rate. \nBlood analyzers currently on the market measure hemoglobin by chemically rupturing the red blood cells in a sample. This technique requires hands-on expertise to prepare and run a sample, limiting the ability to monitor anemia in many parts of the world. \n\"The most exciting aspect to this analyzer is that it uses whole blood and does not require the additional steps and reagents to prepare a sample,\" said Nathan Sniadecki, associate professor in mechanical engineering at the University of Washington and one of the authors. \nThe device only requires a few drops of blood for analysis. \n\"You just run blood into the channel and that's it,\" said Nikita Taparia, a doctoral candidate in Snaidecki's lab and another author. \"It can be used anywhere.\" \nThe analyzer takes advantage of the optical properties of blood, such as absorption and scattering, to measure hemoglobin concentration . Anemic blood transmits more light compared to normal blood, so the severity of anemia can be measured as a ratio of transmitted to original light intensity. \nTo simulate anemia, the researchers diluted blood samples with a buffer solution. The blood analyzer was effective at predicting cases of moderate to severe anemia , defined as less than 10 grams per deciliter of hemoglobin in a sample. The analyzer did not produce any false negative results. Nikita Taparia stands with a microfluidic card in her hand, next to the optical analyzer. Credit: Nikita Taparia, University of Washington \nThe optical density of samples did not increase linearly, so a higher concentration of hemoglobin defines the upper limit of detection for the device. \nThe primary cause of anemia is iron deficiency, but it can co-occur with other conditions, such as malaria and genetic disorders like sickle cell. Severe anemia can lead to increased maternal and child mortality. It also impairs cognitive and physical development in children. \n\"It has been really rewarding to be part of a project from start to finish that produced a device that will really help people,\" Taparia said. \"This analyzer is meant for people who have disease.\" \nThe current design is a prototype that could be integrated with other microfluidic devices to analyze whole blood samples in parallel to diagnose anemia and other underlying factors that could contribute to the disease.

Credit: CC-BY-SA-2.5,2.0,1.0 \nBullying is a pervasive problem for U.S. kids. Recent studies show that between one in four to one in three children have been bullied at school. About one in 10 are victimized regularly. \nResearch suggests that this isn't just harmless \"kids being kids\" behavior, says Marissa Smith, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in behavioral pain medicine at Children's National Health System. Bullied children have a greater risk of experiencing overall negative academic outcomes, such as greater school avoidance, decreased classroom engagement and lower academic achievement than children who aren't bullied. They also suffer emotionally, with more depression, anxiety and withdrawal, as well as suffering physically, reporting more headaches, stomachaches and sleep difficulties. \nIn response to these harmful consequences, researchers in Finland in 2009 developed the KiVa Anti-Bullying Program. This school-based program combats bullying through a series of teacher -led lessons provided to students throughout the academic year that aim to shift the entire school's ethos. \nResearch in Finland demonstrating the success of KiVa has encouraged school systems around the world to pilot and evaluate the KiVa program in their schools. However, Smith cautions, differing school cultures could lead to differing results. \n\"Compared with Finland, teachers in the United States juggle many more competing demands on their time and, at times, have fewer resources and less institutional support in fulfilling those demands,\" she explains. \"Consequently, it's not clear whether a program like KiVa would be as realistic here.\" \nTo see how implementing KiVa might differ in an American setting, Smith and colleagues helped fourth- and fifth-grade teachers at nine elementary schools in one Delaware school district roll out the program to 1,409 students during the 2013 to 2014 school year. Each teacher completed a three-hour training course at the beginning of the year\u2014already a drastic cut from the two full days of training that is standard in Finland\u2014due to competing demands on American teachers' professional development time. \nDelaware teachers also completed questionnaires at the start of the year about variables that might affect how well they would be able to implement the program, such as their level of professional burnout, perceived principal support, self-efficacy at teaching, and perceived feasibility and efficacy of KiVa. Students completed questionnaires at the beginning and end of the academic year that measured levels of victimization and bullying. \nOnce a month, teachers were to give their classes standard KiVa lessons. To track what they actually completed, teachers answered online questionnaires. They also met with a graduate student once monthly to learn tips about implementing the program. \nResults published online Aug. 29, 2017 in Journal of School Psychology by Smith and co-authors showed that this program accomplished its goals of significantly reducing bullying and victimization by the end of the year. Precisely how successful these measures were hinged on what instructional \"dose\" of the program students received, Smith says. On average, teachers provided only half of the activities that were intended to be included in each lesson. They also gave an average of 7.8 KiVa lessons out of a possible total of 10. \nWhen Smith and colleagues assessed which teacher variables correlated with a reduction in KiVa instruction, professional burnout had the highest impact. It's hard to say what leads teachers to experience burnout; however, Smith explains, it might be an overall symptom of U.S. teaching culture. \n\"Teachers are highly regarded in Finland\u2014at the same level as doctors\u2014but U.S. teachers are not afforded nearly the same levels of respect,\" she says. \"Burnout here may speak to this lack of respect. Other factors that contributed to diminished KiVa instruction include lower levels of resources and institutional support, teachers' own degree of emotional investment in the school and teachers' perception they actually can accomplish the things they set out to do.\" \nEach of these differences, Smith adds, could contribute to KiVa not being as effective in the United States as it is in Finland. \nOne way to improve the success of this program in the United States, the study notes, might be to distill KiVa's tenets to the bare minimum necessary to maintain positive outcomes, allowing more efficient lessons. Additionally, outsourcing lessons to guidance counselors or other school staff versed in social and emotional topics might ease teachers' workloads. \n\"Schools in the United States differ significantly from those in Finland, where this program started,\" she says. \"Our results suggest that supporting U.S. teachers in ways that reduce burnout could lead to better implementation and less bullying\u2014which could lead to real and lasting improvements to their students' lives.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marissa smith", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "larkmead school", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "children's national health system", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kiva", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kiva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delaware", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T22:16:46.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cef4af4f9b2cc1e90806f41c651e632b30b26c57", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaByeAiaZPHR41bD246BAcYzz9PkW65JX2NfjbPIDnAeALYzsIGSIhfc_CllFg48WT", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://phys.org/rss-feed/", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Microsoft touts VR headsets that pair with Windows 10", "title_full": "Microsoft touts VR headsets that pair with Windows 10", "published": "2017-10-03T22:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cf3e497594.site.internapcdn.net/tmpl/v5/img/phys_308px.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cef4af4f9b2cc1e90806f41c651e632b30b26c57", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaByeAiaZPHR41bD246BAcYzz9PkW65JX2NfjbPIDnAeALYzsIGSIhfc_CllFg48WT", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T22:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Microsoft touts VR headsets that pair with Windows 10", "text": "Microsoft touts VR headsets that pair with Windows 10 October 3, 2017 \nMicrosoft is touting virtual reality headsets made by other companies in hopes of establishing personal computers running on its Windows 10 operating system as the best way for people to experience artificial worlds. \nThe devices unveiled Tuesday include a Samsung headset called the HMD Odyssey.

Credit: Lanny Nagler for UConn Health \nProgramming a molecular biology experiment can be similar to playing Sudoku; both are simple if you're working with only a few molecules or a small grid, but they explode in complexity as they grow. Now, in a paper published on Oct. 3 in the Biophysical Journal , researchers at UConn Health's Virtual Cell Project ( vcell.org ) have made it far easier for cell biologists to build complex biological models. \nThe Virtual Cell, or VCell as it's known, is a software platform that offers the most comprehensive set of modeling and simulation capabilities for cell biology in the world. It allows biologists without strong math or computer programming skills to build models and simulate how a cell functions. VCell first came online almost 20 years ago, in 1998, and the UConn Health team headed by biophysicist Leslie Loew has developed and maintained it since. Using VCell, a biologist can predict what happens when a certain drug encounters a filtration cell in the kidney, for example, or how a hemoglobin molecule in a red blood cell deals with a spike in carbon dioxide. \nBut until now, a biologist still needed strong programming skills to do detailed cell models at the molecular level, and even more than that, patience. Each molecule involved in a model has a certain number of states, or things it can do and places it can be. Each possible combination of molecules and their states had to be coded out by hand. And as the number of moving parts increases, the number of lines of computer code do, too. If you increase the size of a Sudoku grid to nine by nine, you suddenly have 6.7 sextillion possible scenarios ... and you get an idea of the nightmare molecular biologists faced when they tried to code even a slightly complex biological system. The common name for this problem is a \"combinatorial explosion,\" and the solution to it, called \"rule-based modeling,\" was developed 12 years ago by VCell team member Michael Blinov and colleagues James Faeder and William Hlavacek, who all worked during that time at Los Alamos National Laboratory. \nHowever, every modeler using rule-based modeling faced a complication. The program detailing interactions among molecules had to be written out in text. In this age of iPhones and computers you can navigate with swipe and click, everyone expects a computer to have a gorgeous graphic interface. Until now, using rule-based modeling wasn't like that. It looked more like the text command boxes you can call up if you need to navigate the guts of your machine quickly. But it gets tiresome fast, and catching mistakes in thousands of lines of repetitive, almost-but-not-quite-identical code can be maddening. Cell biology models quickly get so unwieldy that only an experienced modeler or programmer can handle them. This sharply limited who could use such modeling. \n\"Before, only programmers or experienced modelers could create rule-based models to describe details of molecular interactions,\" says Loew. \"We wanted to make rule-based modeling available to the cell biologists who really need it.\" \nLoew and the VCell team of Michael Blinov, Ion Moraru, James Schaff, and Dan Vasilescu decided to make things easier. In their new paper, they describe a user interface for VCell that uses colored shapes to represent molecules. The shapes look a bit like colored bricks. Bubbles show binding sites, and lines show links between molecules. The links can also be different colors and shapes to represent different interactions. A simple model describing hemoglobin resembles a map or wiring diagram. \nInstead of writing thousands of lines of code, biologists using VCell can now just define their molecules and explain to VCell how they can interact with each other. The biologist doesn't have to worry about the combinatorial explosion. The computer - all 60 teraflops, 3,000 processors, and 2 petabytes of storage hosted at UConn Health's Cell and Genome building - handles it. \nLoew and Blinov believe the new version of VCell will dramatically expand the number of people who can use rule-based modeling. This is because it allows scientists to use the comprehensive set of simulation methods available in VCell with rule-based models in a single, unified, user-friendly software environment. \nNow, a trained biologist should be able to take a day to go through the tutorials on the site and learn enough to figure out how to model a new problem on VCell. Previously, there were about 5,800 active users of VCell globally (you can log in from anywhere that has an internet connection). Those modelers had created 76,600 models and run about 479,000 different simulations on them. These simulations test everything from whether a certain mutation causes cancer to how a new drug might interact with the heart. And with the newly released version of VCell, the number of active users should increase. \nSo far, VCell hasn't helped with a Sudoku game. But someone might just write a model for that.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kim krieger uconn health biophysici", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ion moraru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loew", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lanny nagler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael blinov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blinov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william hlavacek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan vasilescu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leslie loew", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james faeder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james schaff", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "uconn health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vcell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uconn health  programming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "biophysical journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for cell analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los alamos national laboratory", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T22:38:03.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "206fdec555112a489bc12d8b86b4a660cdbe39da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyafizkjuGW.Jys3Yg71I3vc6xSV8A2qzMKL0sCyCX3D24tWdlymUrQeMBoDWtb6HC.82ZCNPdggpw-", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://phys.org/rss-feed/", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Women firefighters can improve safety, but department culture must change", "title_full": "Women firefighters can improve safety, but department culture must change", "published": "2017-10-03T22:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/womenfirefig.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "206fdec555112a489bc12d8b86b4a660cdbe39da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyafizkjuGW.Jys3Yg71I3vc6xSV8A2qzMKL0sCyCX3D24tWdlymUrQeMBoDWtb6HC.82ZCNPdggpw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T22:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Women firefighters can improve safety, but department culture must change", "text": "Women firefighters can improve safety, but department culture must change October 3, 2017 by Frank Otto Credit: Drexel University \nIncorporating new ideas from women can improve safety in traditionally male fire departments, but the hypermasculine culture in some can make female firefighters feel unwelcome and less likely to share their ideas, according to a new qualitative study from Drexel University. \nThe Center for Firefighter Injury Research & Safety Trends (FIRST), run by Jennifer A. Taylor, PhD, associate professor in Drexel's Dornsife School of Public Health, conducted the study. Utilizing interviews and focus groups of female firefighters and leaders in various departments, the study sought to see what unique safety behaviors women bring to the job, how such practices might contribute to a safer fire service, and what cultural barriers exist to implementation. \nMany women in the study said that they felt shunned simply for their gender. When that's the case, it makes it harder to engage in good safety practices because they could be frowned-upon by colleagues. \n\"[A] hyper masculine environment limits all firefighters' ability to speak up and, thus, address safety concerns,\" wrote Yasin Kahn, Andrea L. Davis, and Taylor in their article published in the Journal of Workplace Behavioral Health . \nIn spite of that, according to the study's participants, women firefighters are more likely to try more diverse ergonomic techniques when performing a task. It's important to note that tasks on the job can be challenging to anyone, regardless of gender, because of body size and biomechanics. \n\"We use better technique and lot of guys get hurt because they just try to muscle it or, God forbid, they ask a woman to help with a ladder,\" said one female firefighter with more than 15 years of experience. \n\"What we have heard loud and clear is that not every firefighter\u2014male or female\u2014has the physique of an NFL defensive tackle,\" Taylor said. \"Fire departments need to be more diverse in their training academies to be sure people know of multiple strategies to apply to each task.\" \nOne of those strategies includes asking for help, which can be looked down upon as being weak, the study's participants indicated. As such, many women who already felt under the microscope, didn't want to give the impression of weakness, even if it meant risking injury. \n\"I'm afraid of [how] it looks to the public that, 'Oh look, that guy had to move in and left that cot for that woman because she couldn't lift it,' when that's not the case,\" a 15-year female firefighter said. \nThat goes hand-in-hand with reporting injuries. \n\"Participants explained that injury reporting was akin to asking for help,\" especially for men, the study's authors wrote. \n\"When [male firefighters] get hurt, they're going to go, 'I don't want to say something because that'll make me look weak and stupid,'\" a 15-year female fire veteran said. \"Whereas [women are] more like, 'I want to make sure I'm covered [by workers' comp] so if I really, truly get hurt, I'm going to be taken care of.'\" \nSometimes leaving injuries unreported can be career-ending, the study found, so a willingness to speak up actually helps departments as a whole. \nBut what can be particularly damaging to firehouses are hostile cultures toward women. \nWhen it comes to training, female fire service members recounted being put through \"girl drills,\" which amounted to extra or harder training that only women had to complete. That included anything from extra ladder carry drills to something as dangerous as practicing fire calls with their oxygen packs being turned off. \nOn top of that, multiple participants in the study recounted sexual harassment as a form of hostility in firehouses they'd served in. \n\"My last straw there was a lieutenant that kept touching me and he finally slapped my butt,\" a female firefighter of five years said. \"The chief told me, 'Oh, he's just joking. You got to learn to deal with that.' That was the answer for everything.\" \nTaylor believes the study showed such harassment makes the actual physical part of the job more difficult to deal with, affecting the health of an entire firehouse. \n\"If you're not psychologically safe, you can't be physically safe,\" Taylor said. \"Sexual discrimination and hostile work environments will not help you retain a diverse workforce that looks at problems from multiple perspectives. In today's fire service where budgets are growing tighter and the nature of the work is changing (to more EMS calls), we need that now more than ever.\" \nSo what can fire departments and firehouses do to make themselves more welcoming to women in their ranks? \nTaylor laid out three things. \nFirst, understanding that everyone, no matter their gender, have different biomechanics and physiologies. \n\"Make the job fit the worker, not the other way around,\" Taylor said. Second, historically and statistically, women have lower injury rates than men. \n\"Some of that can be explained by the types of employment men and women have traditionally held, but not all of it can,\" Taylor said. \"Women and men are socialized differently around risk. Men are told to embrace it, women are told to avoid it.

Credit: Edward Kalkreuter \nResearchers from North Carolina State University have engineered designer biosensors that can detect antibiotic molecules of interest. The biosensors are a first step toward creating antibiotic-producing \"factories\" within microbes such as E. coli. \nMacrolides are a group of naturally occurring small molecules that can have antibiotic, antifungal or anticancer effects. The antibiotic erythromycin is one example - it is a macrolide produced by soil-dwelling bacteria. Researchers are interested in using these natural antibiotics and the microbes that produce them in order to develop new antibiotics; however, microbes that produce antibiotic macrolides only make small amounts of a limited variety of antibiotics. \n\"Our ultimate goal is to engineer microbes to make new versions of these antibiotics for our use, which will drastically reduce the amount of time and money necessary for new drug testing and development,\" says Gavin Williams, associate professor of bio-organic chemistry at NC State and corresponding author of a paper describing the research. \"In order to do that, we first need to be able to detect the antibiotic molecules of interest produced by the microbes.\" \nWilliams and his team used a naturally occurring molecular switch - a protein called MphR - as their biosensor. In E. coli , MphR can detect the presence of macrolide antibiotics being secreted by microbes that are attacking E. coli . When MphR senses the antibiotic, it turns on a resistance mechanism to negate the antibiotic's effects. \nThe researchers created a large library of MphR protein variants and screened them for the ability to switch on production of a fluorescent green protein when they were in the presence of a desired macrolide. They tested the variants against erythromycin, which MphR already recognizes, and found that some of the MphR variants improved their detection ability tenfold. They also successfully tested the variants against macrolides that were not closely related to erythromycin, such as tylosin. \n\"Essentially we have co-opted and evolved the MphR sensor system, increasing its sensitivity in recognizing the molecules that we're interested in,\" says Williams. \"We know that we can tailor this biosensor and that it will detect the molecules we're interested in, which will enable us to screen millions of different strains quickly. This is the first step toward high-throughput engineering of antibiotics , where we create vast libraries of genetically modified strains and variants of microbes in order to find the few strains and variants that produce the desired molecule in the desired yield.\" \nThe research appears in ACS Synthetic Biology , and was funded by the National Institutes of Health (grant GM104258) and the NC State Chancellor's Innovation Fund.

This discovery could help astronomers better understand how giant black holes grow and how they may produce the strongest gravitational wave signals in the Universe. \nThe new evidence reveals five pairs of supermassive black holes, each containing millions of times the mass of the Sun. These black hole couples formed when two galaxies collided and merged with each other, forcing their supermassive black holes close together. \nThe black hole pairs were uncovered by combining data from a suite of different observatories including NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Wide-Field Infrared Sky Explorer Survey (WISE), and the ground-based Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. \n\"Astronomers find single supermassive black holes all over the universe,\" said Shobita Satyapal, from George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, who led one of two papers describing these results. \"But even though we've predicted they grow rapidly when they are interacting, growing dual supermassive black holes have been difficult to find.\" \nBefore this study fewer than ten confirmed pairs of growing black holes were known from X-ray studies, based mostly on chance detections. To carry out a systematic search, the team had to carefully sift through data from telescopes that detect different wavelengths of light. \nStarting with the Galaxy Zoo project, researchers used optical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to identify galaxies where it appeared that a merger between two smaller galaxies was underway. From this set, they selected objects where the separation between the centers of the two galaxies in the SDSS data is less than 30,000 light years, and the infrared colors from WISE data match those predicted for a rapidly growing supermassive black hole . \nSeven merging systems containing at least one supermassive black hole were found with this technique. Because strong X-ray emission is a hallmark of growing supermassive black holes, Satyapal and her colleagues then observed these systems with Chandra. Closely-separated pairs of X-ray sources were found in five systems, providing compelling evidence that they contain two growing (or feeding) supermassive black holes. \nBoth the X-ray data from Chandra and the infrared observations suggest that the supermassive black holes are buried in large amounts of dust and gas. \n\"Our work shows that combining the infrared selection with X-ray follow-up is a very effective way to find these black hole pairs,\" said Sara Ellison of the University of Victoria in Canada, who led the other paper describing these results. \"X-rays and infrared radiation are able to penetrate the obscuring clouds of gas and dust surrounding these black hole pairs, and Chandra's sharp vision is needed to separate them\". \nThe paper led by Ellison used additional optical data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey to pinpoint one of the new black hole pairs. One member of this black hole pair is particularly powerful, having the highest X-ray luminosity in a black hole pair observed by Chandra to date. \nThis work has implications for the burgeoning field of gravitational wave astrophysics. While scientists using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the VIRGO interferometer have detected the signals of merging black holes, these black holes have been of the smaller variety weighing between about eight and 36 times the mass of the Sun. \nThe merging black holes in the centers of galaxies are much larger. When these supermassive black holes draw even closer together, they should start producing gravitational waves. The eventual merger of the dual supermassive black holes in hundreds of millions of years would forge an even bigger black hole. This process would produce an astonishing amount of energy when some of the mass is converted into gravitational waves. \n\"It is important to understand how common supermassive black hole pairs are, to help in predicting the signals for gravitational wave observatories,\" said Satyapal. \"With experiments already in place and future ones coming online, this is an exciting time to be researching merging black holes. We are in the early stages of a new era in exploring the universe.\" \nLIGO/VIRGO is not able to detect gravitational waves from supermassive black hole pairs. Instead, pulsar timing arrays such as the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) are currently performing this search. In the future, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) project could also search for these gravitational waves . \nFour of the dual black hole candidates were reported in a paper by Satyapal et al. that was recently accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal , and appears online .

But time was running out: one of the principal German engineers, Wernher von Braun, was already working for the Americans. \nAfter three years of work and three rocket accidents, the fourth R-7 with a dummy warhead successfully hit its target in Kamchatka, in the Far East, in August 1957. The test was hailed as successful although the rocket head disintegrated in flight. \nCreating a new rocket head would take six months, much too long as the Soviets wanted to pre-empt the launch of a US satellite in 1958. So Korolyov suggested creating a simple satellite made of two hemispheres containing sensors, a radio and a battery pack. \nIn just two months, the apparatus measuring 58 centimetres (22 inches) in diameter and weighing 83.6 kilogrammes (184.3 pounds) was ready, remembered Shiganov, whose lab created the aluminium alloy and came up with a new welding technique used to make the Sputnik and the R-7. \n'A tiny dot' \nThough the satellite captured imaginations, with radio amateurs tuning in around the world to hear its simple calls, Sputnik was secondary to its inventors, Shiganov said. Sputnik was in orbit for 92 days, making 1,440 circles around Earth, before losing speed and burning up in the atmosphere \n\"The most important thing was that it proved the effectiveness of the R-7 rocket.\" \nThe secrecy around the project meant Shiganov didn't learn of the actual launch until he heard on the radio that the first Earth satellite was put in orbit on October 4, 1957 from a testing range in Kazakhstan, the future Baikonur cosmodrome. \nOn a sunny October Sunday, Shiganov was able to see the glint of Sputnik with his naked eye. \n\"It was a tiny dot which shone in the sun because of its glossy surface,\" he said. \nSputnik was in orbit for 92 days, making 1,440 circles around Earth, before losing speed and burning up in the atmosphere. Several replicas are now on show in museums. \nShiganov's colleague Eduard Bolotov, 84, actually saw Sputnik as a young rocket trajectory engineer of 24, even gaining access to the depot where the rocket stood during final preparations. \nThe miniscule satellite sat atop the rocket and Bolotov, with other young specialists, patted the rocket's side and signed his name on the inside of the nozzle. \n\"I watched the actual launch through a gap from my post,\" Bolotov said. \nAlthough workers were summoned to the launchpad with secret letters, crowds of people also turned up, he said. \"Their relatives had told them about the launch.\" \n\"Only at 3 am we found out that Sputnik was in orbit, and radios all over the world started to register its beeps.\" \n\"Then we went back to our dorms and drank pure alcohol for victory of our rocket,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bolotov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adolf hitler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eduard bolotov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wernher von braun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shiganov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergei korolyov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nikolai shiganov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "marina lapenkova sixty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korolyov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kamchatka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ussr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "far east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kazakhstan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soviet union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sputnik", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T23:11:38.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a6ce317f3291578abd2be42c68b8a97d2a53345", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaKkaUILrMMkOoqHf721TzBwU6dgFnaRttctx95k_qxD3Dqr2CaWiyEtHqVElQoXD.87jQfDXXt9E-", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/physorg.rss", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "A growing problem: Lightening the carbon footprint of cannabis farms", "title_full": "A growing problem: Lightening the carbon footprint of cannabis farms", "published": "2017-10-03T22:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2015/cannabis.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8a6ce317f3291578abd2be42c68b8a97d2a53345", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyaKkaUILrMMkOoqHf721TzBwU6dgFnaRttctx95k_qxD3Dqr2CaWiyEtHqVElQoXD.87jQfDXXt9E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T22:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "A growing problem: Lightening the carbon footprint of cannabis farms", "text": "A growing problem: Lightening the carbon footprint of cannabis farms October 3, 2017 by Louis Hansen, The Mercury News Cannabis indica. Credit: Wikipedia \nConsider a typical cannabis farmer, growing an indoor crop. \nIn a protected, controlled environment, they can grow a profitable mix of high-potency, medicinal marijuana and any number of milder strains appealing to a new market. \nBut the venture comes with both a business and social overhead: high energy bills and a heavy, carbon footprint. \n\"It's a big problem,\" said Tim Hade, co-founder of micro-grid company Scale. \"It has an impact far beyond cannabis consumption.\" \nA recent study estimated a single, indoor marijuana plant takes the equivalent of 70 gallons of oil to grow. Energy demand at Colorado's largest utility grew about 2 percent after marijuana was legalized. \nHade said the growing industry could wipe out gains the country made in the last decade that kept energy consumption stable even as the population and economy grew. As the legalized marijuana industry expands in California, it could seriously challenge state goals to reduce greenhouse emissions. \nThe cannabis industry is starting to address the issue. Startups are hunting for ways to make growing more efficient. Farmers are innovating and experimenting. \nEvan Mills, an energy and climate change scientist based in California, said the cannabis industry could make efficiency gains in almost every step of its process. According to Mills' research, the total amount of energy used to power marijuana farms is equivalent to powering 2 million homes, with emissions equal to 3 million typical U.S. cars. \nMills said the key change in the industry is a trend toward large-scale cannabis cultivation \"which may prove to be far more energy intensive\" than the current collection of small-growers. \nScale, based in New York, combines solar, battery storage and natural gas generators in a system that can cut energy cost by up to 35 percent. \nHade, an Air Force veteran and Stanford Graduate School of Business grad, said the system uses excess heat from generators to fuel air conditioning. With about 30 percent of a farmer's overhead spent on fuel and electricity, he said, \"you have to be sophisticated about energy management.\" \nJP Martin, founder of GrowX, a company in the cannabis accelerator Gateway, has focused his company on making indoor growing more efficient. The startup has produced prototypes for an aeroponic growing system, with sensors, lights and a mesh growing medium. It's testing the system with two customers. \nMartin said the system uses less energy and water than hydroponic growing, and eliminates possible impurities and disease developed from soil. \nCannabis grown indoors is often believed to be more potent - and is more expensive - than crops grown outdoors. \n\"Traditional farming is a broken model,\" Martin said. \nBut even the promise of new technology - including energy saving LED lighting, sensor-filled growing pods and a network of artificial intelligence and high-efficiency electronics - may not be enough. \n\"In this warming world, indoor farming is an environmentally unaffordable luxury,\" Mills said. \"Even deep energy savings leave indoor grows as energy-intensive as most ordinary buildings.\" \nSome farmers have taken a traditional, natural approach to growing. \nCyril Guthridge, owner and operator of Waterdog Herb Farm in Mendocino County, Calif., plants outdoors.

Barish and Thorne won the Nobel Physics Prize on Tuesday for detecting faint ripples flying through the universe, the gravitational waves predicted a century ago by Albert Einstein that provide a new understanding of the universe. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) \nThree U.S.-based astrophysicists won the Nobel prize in physics Tuesday for their discovery of gravitational waves, a phenomenon Albert Einstein predicted a century ago in his theory of general relativity. Here's what their discovery means and why they won the prize worth $1.1 million (9 million kronor). \nWHO WON? \nRainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a German-born scientist who initially flunked out of MIT, won half the prize as the astronomer who initially spearheaded the push for the $1.1 billion project called LIGO. Theorist Kip Thorne and physicist Barry Barish, both of the California Institute of Technology, split the other half. \nSo far the LIGO twin detectors in Louisiana and Washington\u2014and a new one in Italy\u2014have spotted four gravitational waves in about two years since going online in September 2015. \nWHAT IS A GRAVITATIONAL WAVE? \nGravitational waves are extremely faint ripples in the fabric of space and time that come from some of the most violent events in the universe. The four observations came from the merger of two black holes. The first one was 1.3 billion light-years away. \nThese waves stretch in one dimension\u2014like left and right\u2014while compressing in another, such as up and down. Then they switch, Weiss explained. \n\"They are ripples that stretch and squeeze space and everything that lives in space,\" Thorne said. \nWHAT IS SPACE-TIME? \nSpace-time is the mind-bending, four-dimensional way astronomers see the universe. It melds the one-way march of time with the more familiar three dimensions of space. \nEinstein's general relativity says that gravity is caused by heavy objects bending space-time. And when massive but compact objects like black holes or neutron stars collide, their immense gravity causes space-time to stretch or compress. Rainer Weiss poses for a photograph at his home, Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2017, in Newton, Mass. Weiss, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is one of three awarded this year's Nobel Prize in physics for their discoveries in gravitational waves. (AP Photo/Josh Reynolds) \nWhen two black holes collide you get \"a storm in the fabric of space-time ... vortices of twisting space fighting with each other,\" Thorne said. \nIronically, Einstein would have been quite surprised because even though he theorized about gravitational waves, he didn't think humans would ever have the technology to spot them. And he didn't believe black holes existed, Weiss said. \nWHY IS IT IMPORTANT? \nUnlike other types of waves that go through the universe such as electromagnetic waves, gravitational waves go through matter\u2014stars, planets, us\u2014untouched. So it's an entirely new type of astronomy, with experts comparing it to Galileo's observations of the solar system. There's information in gravitational waves that cannot be found elsewhere. \nThe first gravitational wave detected was in the form of an audible chirp that some call the music of the cosmos. University of Florida's Clifford Will said it offers a new way of observing the cosmos beyond light and particles. \nHOW IS THIS \"HEARING\" THE COSMOS? \nScientists mostly use the word \"hear\" when describing gravitational waves, and the data does, in fact, arrive in audio form. The researchers can don headphones and listen to the detectors' output if they want. But Weiss said it is not quite like sound waves. \nWHAT'S NEXT? \nScientists are waiting to detect crashes of neutron stars, which many thought would be the first collision to be heard. \nOther types of gravitational detectors are being built including one in India. \nThe European Space Agency is planning a multibillion-dollar probe to be launched in about 17 years that would look for gravitational waves from space. With better technology, Weiss hopes astronomers will learn more about nuclear physics, states of matter, how heavy elements are made and detect information from \"the very moment when the universe came out of nothingness.\" \n\"We expect surprises,\" Weiss said. \"There has to be surprises.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "seth borenstein scienti", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "einstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barry barish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weiss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kip thorne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thorne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainer weiss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clifford will", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert einstein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "massachusetts institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european space agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ligo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galileo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap photo/josh reynolds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pasadena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T23:11:40.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "23e656756f0dff4f64eb2574c1b0764b22174d9e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyacd0nwaWNlyny11eyR9b6QR2xZDboDiaIhb3fmzqVJIVTikFb4FQWuQRA3fNLsQDrvEujySTj6bzfiGjAofn5QQ--", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/physorg.rss", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Scientists bring new insights into the heritability of HIV infection severity", "title_full": "Scientists bring new insights into the heritability of HIV infection severity", "published": "2017-10-04T00:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2016/hiv.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "23e656756f0dff4f64eb2574c1b0764b22174d9e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyacd0nwaWNlyny11eyR9b6QR2xZDboDiaIhb3fmzqVJIVTikFb4FQWuQRA3fNLsQDrvEujySTj6bzfiGjAofn5QQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T00:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Scientists bring new insights into the heritability of HIV infection severity", "text": "Scientists bring new insights into the heritability of HIV infection severity October 3, 2017 HIV infecting a human cell. Credit: NIH \nHIV's pernicious persistence in human populations\u2014despite more than 25 years of heroic HIV research efforts \u2014owes in part to its particular abilities to exploit its human hosts, constantly adapting and mutating to enhance its infectiousness and virulence. \nUsing a population of HIV-1 infected individuals (the 2014 Swiss HIV Cohort Study data), an international research team of 17 institutions, led by ETH Zurich's Roland Regoes of the Institute of Integrative Biology, has now examined all aspects of HIV virulence , with a particular focus on how it ravages the human immune system. \nThe study investigated the heritability of three different aspects of HIV virulence: set point viral load (SPVL; which measures the virus' ability to exploit the host by measuring the amount of HIV circulating in the blood), CD4+ T cell decline (which measures the damage caused by the virus), and CD4+ T cell decline relative to set point viral load (which measures the damage for a given level of exploitation, also called 'per pathogen pathogenicity' or PPP). Per-pathogen pathogenicity captures how virulent a viral strain is irrespective of its load in the infected individual. \nThey investigated if HIV virulence, measured by the rate of decline in CD4+ T cells, and PPP are heritable from donor to recipient and therefore not solely dependent on the environment of the virus population (i.e. the human host). \nUsing the Swiss Cohort donor-recipient pairs, and phylogenetic methods, they suggest that HIV virulence and its effect on the human immune system is heritable. \nThey found that the heritability of the decline of CD4+ T cells and per-pathogen pathogenicity is 17 percent. \n\"Our analysis shows that the viral genotype affects virulence mainly by modulating the per-parasite pathogenicity, while the indirect effect via the set-point viral load is minor,\" said lead author Roland Regoes. \nWith the results, Regoes, study first author Frederic Bertels et al. have brought important new insights into the role of HIV genotype in infection severity. \nWith a new understanding of the different facets of HIV virulence, the study will stimulate further research on HIV and other pathogens.

It then declines over winter, but when supplementary feeding ceases in February, we see a second peak. \n\"Captive-bred pheasants may be at risk after release from pens because they have not learned survival skills. \n\"Being raised in the absence of parents, they simply lack the opportunity to learn.\" Pheasants are commonly roadkill, but the recent increase in their artificial rearing and release has changed the time of year when most fatalities occur Credit: Bev Milne \nDr Madden, whose work was funded by the European Research Council, added: \"Certain simple steps might help reduce pheasant roadkill, such as feeding them away from roads and continuing feeding them from February to May, after the shooting season has ended, to stop them wandering on to roads.\" \nThe researchers used roadkill figures from citizen science group Project Splatter, established and coordinated by Dr Sarah Perkins, of Cardiff University. \n\"Our work demonstrates how changes in animal behaviour can be revealed by roadkill data reported by members of the public, and the value of citizen science,\" Dr Perkins said.

(Brian Lawless/PA via AP) \nThe European Court of Justice has been asked to consider whether Facebook's Dublin-based subsidiary can legally transfer users' personal data to its U.S. parent, after Ireland's top court said Tuesday that there are \"well-founded concerns\" the practice violates European law. \nIn a case brought after former U.S. defense contractor Edward Snowden revealed the extent of electronic surveillance by American security agencies, the court found that Facebook's transfers may compromise the data of European citizens. \nThe case has far-reaching implications for social media companies and others who move large amounts of data via the internet. Facebook's European subsidiary regularly does so. \nIreland's data commissioner had already issued a preliminary decision that such transfers may be illegal because agreements between Facebook and its Irish subsidiary don't adequately protect the privacy of European citizens. The commissioner asked the High Court to refer this finding to the European Court of Justice because the data sharing agreements had been approved by the European Union's executive Commission. \nIreland's data commissioner \"has raised well-founded concerns that there is an absence of an effective remedy in U.S. law . for an EU citizen whose data are transferred to the U.S. where they may be at risk of being accessed and processed by U.S. state agencies for national security purposes in a manner incompatible\" with the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights, the High Court said Tuesday.

The Safe Harbor regime had been established in 2000 by the EU executive Commission, which found that U.S. data protection laws were adequate to protect the rights of EU citizens. \nThe Irish Data Commissioner decided to seek judicial review of standard contractual clauses in part because of \"the very significant commercial implications arising from the value of data exchanges to EU-U.S. trading relationships.\" \nThe U.S. government and three other parties were allowed to file friend of the court briefs in the case.

Ours is the first comprehensive long-time study that investigates the microbial load, diversity and dynamics in a closed habitat - a mock-up spacecraft - for 520 days, the full duration of a simulated flight to Mars.\" \nThe team of researchers from Germany, UK and Austria, led by the German Aerospace Center (DLR), found that apart from the crew who were the main source of human-associated bacteria inside the habitat, confinement appeared to be the strongest trigger shaping the bacterial community - the microbiota - which remained highly dynamic over time. \nHuman-associated microorganisms, including Bacillus and Staphylococcus species were the most frequent, indicating that humans were the main source for microbial dispersal, according to the researchers. For example, Staphylococcus, which is frequently found in the nose, respiratory tract, and on the skin, was probably dispersed via skin flakes shed by the crew. Although Staphylococcus will not always cause disease, it is a common cause of skin infections, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems. \nIn order to find out which bacterial species may be present in the air and on the surfaces inside spacecraft and how the composition of the microbiota may change during human habitation, a crew of six male \"Marsonauts\" lived inside a mock-up spacecraft, located in Moscow, from 3rd June 2010 to 5th November 2011. During the isolation period the crew members remained fully confined - they never left the closed habitat. Simulating conditions during a manned mission to Mars, they followed a strict diet and schedule, which included cleaning the habitat and conducting scientific experiments. They collected 360 microbial samples from 20 locations (9 air, 11 surface) at 18 time points, using air filters and swabs. \nWhile a core microbiota of the same bacteria was present in all areas of the mock-up spacecraft, the authors noticed specific bacterial signatures for each individual area, or module, indicating that - much like in other indoor environments - microbial presence is associated with human presence as well as the type of activity that an area is used for. Communal areas, sleep areas, the gym, and the toilet had the highest numbers and greatest diversity of bacteria, while the lowest numbers of bacteria were found inside the medical module. \nDr Schwendner said: \"We also saw the impact of cleaning agents. Although we located some microbial hotspots, where the number of bacteria was much higher than in other areas, we were quite relieved to find that the overall bacterial counts were within the acceptable limits. Due to appropriate cleaning measures, the microbial community inside the habitat was under control at all times with no or little risk for the crew.\" \nThe researchers also noticed that the microbial diversity decreased significantly over time which means that there were fewer different species of bacteria present. This may indicate potentially problematic developments within the microbial community during long-duration isolation, according to the authors. High microbial diversity is normally associated with systemic stability and health. \nDr Schwendner said: \"In addition to potential health risks for the crew, some of these microorganisms could have a negative impact on spacecraft, as they grow on and might damage spacecraft material. To ensure the systems' stability, countermeasures may be required to avoid development of highly resistant, adapted microorganisms, and a complete loss of microbial diversity . Our study provides valuable insights into the quality of habitat maintenance and improves the selection of appropriate microbial monitoring approaches, allowing for the development of efficient and adequate countermeasures.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "petra schwendner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schwendner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cc0 public domain", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "university of edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "german aerospace center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T03:29:16.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b495abb58d1524629c9c358ff0725a04e8a86882", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyacyMll6J0ZPB0Nbcu4OoLAx0GyJxh7k.IwXxgYotXpXQ-", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://phys.org/rss-feed/breaking", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Two intelligent vehicles are better than one", "title_full": "Two intelligent vehicles are better than one", "published": "2017-10-04T10:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2017/twointellige.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b495abb58d1524629c9c358ff0725a04e8a86882", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyacyMll6J0ZPB0Nbcu4OoLAx0GyJxh7k.IwXxgYotXpXQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T10:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Two intelligent vehicles are better than one", "text": "Two intelligent vehicles are better than one October 4, 2017 Milos Vasic, PhD, and Alcherio Martinoli, head of the Distributed Intelligent Systems and Algorithms Laboratory. They made two regular cars intelligent using off-the-shelf equipment. Credit: Copyright Alain Herzog/EPFL \nIntelligent vehicles get their intelligence from cameras, Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensors, and navigation and mapping systems. But there are ways to make them even smarter. Researchers at EPFL are working to improve the reliability and fault tolerance of these systems by combining the data they gather with that from other vehicles. This can, for example, extend the field of view of a car that is behind another car. Using simulators and road tests, the team has developed a flexible software framework for networking intelligent vehicles so that they can interact. \n\"Today, intelligent vehicle development is focused on two main issues - the level of autonomy and the level of cooperation,\" says Alcherio Martinoli, who heads EPFL's Distributed Intelligent Systems and Algorithms Laboratory (DISAL). Over the past several years, his team has been working on cooperation issues, which have yet to garner much attention from the automotive industry. As part of his PhD thesis, Milos Vasic has developed cooperative perception algorithms, which extend an intelligent vehicle's situational awareness by fusing data from onboard sensors with data provided by cooperative vehicles nearby. \nThe researchers used the cooperative perception algorithms as the basis for the software framework . For example, in a scenario in which one car overtakes another car on a two-lane road, they developed an assistance system that assesses the risk of the overtaking manoeuver. The risk assessment factors in the probability of an oncoming car in the opposite lane as well as kinematic conditions such as driving speeds, the distance required to overtake and the distance to the oncoming car. Cooperative perception means that an intelligent vehicle can combine its own data with that of another vehicle - such as the one it wants to overtake, which has a wider field of view. In this way, the decision whether or not to overtake can be made safely. According to Vasic, \"cooperative perception makes overtaking safer and more fluid.\" The video will load shortly. When EPFL researchers fused the data from two intelligent vehicles, the result was a wider field of view, extended situational awareness and greater safety. Credit: Copyright EPFL \nSeeing two pedestrians instead of one \nAt first, the team used a simulator to test their algorithms under various scenarios, both with and without cooperative vehicles nearby. Then, with help from Groupe PSA, they took their project on the road. Two Citroen C-Zero electric cars were retrofitted with a Mobileye camera, an accurate localization system, a router to enable Wi-Fi communication, a computer to run the software and an external battery to power everything. \"These were not autonomous vehicles,\" says Martinoli, \"but we made them intelligent using off-the-shelf equipment.\" \nSuccess did not come easily, however. One of the difficulties in fusing data from the two vehicles involved relative localization. The cars needed to be able to know precisely where they are in relation to each other as well to objects in the vicinity. If a single pedestrian does not appear to both cars to be in the same exact spot, there is a risk that, together, they will see two figures instead of one. By using other signals, particularly those provided by the LIDAR sensors and cameras, the researchers were able to correct flaws in the navigation system and adjust their algorithms accordingly. This exercise was all the more challenging as the data had to be processed in real time while the vehicles were in motion. \"Because of this, the project also helped improve the accuracy of localization more generally,\" Vasic says. Although the tests involved only two vehicles, the longer-term goal is to create a network between multiple vehicles as well with the roadway infrastructure. \nOutstanding questions \nIn addition to driving safety and comfort, cooperative networks of this sort could eventually be used to optimize a vehicle's trajectory, save energy and improve traffic flows. The team is aware, however, that many questions - which are beyond the scope of their research - remain unanswered. To begin with, there is the issue of liability in the case of an accident. Determining liability - which already involves the owner, car manufacturer and software designer or supplier - becomes even more complicated when vehicles cooperate. \"The answers to these issues will play a key role in determining whether autonomous vehicles are accepted,\" adds Martinoli.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alcherio martinol", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "milos vasic", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "martinoli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vasic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alcherio martinoli", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "epfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "groupe psa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "distributed intelligent systems and algorithms laboratory", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T10:32:33.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1f83485c0c86c61e389737dca1f18db000ca983", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzya0QaunItyG3.3N83E5.v_45bDwebhjlUPwd8tHin8hrfx6MZSJjz6UjoQHBGsH58i", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://phys.org/rss-feed/breaking", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Benchmarking computational methods for metagenomes", "title_full": "Benchmarking computational methods for metagenomes", "published": "2017-10-04T10:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/benchmarking.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d1f83485c0c86c61e389737dca1f18db000ca983", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzya0QaunItyG3.3N83E5.v_45bDwebhjlUPwd8tHin8hrfx6MZSJjz6UjoQHBGsH58i", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T10:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Benchmarking computational methods for metagenomes", "text": "Benchmarking computational methods for metagenomes October 4, 2017 Table showing partial results of assemblers applied to the 1st CAMI Challenge, Dataset 1. Click here to see the full table. \nThey are everywhere, but invisible to the naked eye. Microbes are the unseen, influential forces behind the regulation of key environmental processes such as the carbon cycle, yet most of them remain unknown. For more than a decade, the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE JGI), a DOE Office of Science User Facility, has been enabling researchers to study uncultured microbes unable to grow in the lab, using state-of-the-art approaches such as high-throughput genomic sequencing of environmental communities (\"metagenomics\") and the development of computational tools to uncover and characterize microbial communities from the environment. To tackle assembling metagenomes into a set of overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA or contigs, then binning these contigs into genome bins, and finally conducting taxonomic profiling of genome bins, analysts around the world have developed an array of different computational tools, however until now there was a lack of consensus on how to evaluate their performance. \nPublished October 2, 2017 in Nature Methods , a team including DOE JGI researchers described the results of the Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI) Challenge, the first-ever, community-organized benchmarking assessment of computational tools for metagenomes. The CAMI Challenge was led by Alexander Sczyrba, head of the Computational Metagenomics group at Bielefeld University and formerly a DOE JGI postdoctoral fellow, and Alice McHardy, head of the Computational Biology of Infection Research Lab at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research. \n\"It is very difficult for researchers to find out which program to use for a particular data set and analysis based on the results from method papers,\" said McHardy. \"The data sets and evaluation measures used in evaluations vary widely. Another issue is that developers usually spend a lot of time benchmarking the state-of-the-art when assessing the performance of novel software that way. CAMI wants to change these things and involves the community in defining standards and best practices for evaluation and to apply these principles in benchmarking challenges.\" \nThe CAMI Challenge took place over three months in 2015. To assess the computational tools, the organizers developed 3 simulated metagenome datasets using more than 300 draft genomes of bacterial and archaeal isolates sequenced and assembled by the DOE JGI, which were part of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaeal project published recently in Nature Biotechnology . These genomes were shared with to the CAMI Challenges consortium before being released to the public to facilitate the objective benchmarking of different tools. The datasets also included around the same number of genomes from the Max Planck Institute in Cologne, Germany, along with circular elements and viruses. The simulated datasets were a single sample dataset of 15 billion bases (Gb), a 40 Gb dataset with 40 genomes and 20 circular elements, and a 75 Gb time series data set comprised of five samples and including hundreds of genomes and circular elements. \n\"JGI has a strong interest in benchmarking of tools and technologies that would advance the analysis of metagenomes and improve the quality of data we provide to the users. Having published the very first study on the use of simulated datasets for benchmarking of metagenomics tools from the JGI, it is great to see how this methodology has expanded over the years and now through this study, evolving into a model for standardized community efforts in the field,\" said Nikos Kyrpides, DOE JGI Prokaryote Super Program head. \n\"JGI is very vested in not only benchmarking of lab protocols, but also computational workflows,\" added DOE JGI Microbial Genomics head Tanja Woyke. \"This makes our participation in critical community efforts such as CAMI so important.\" \nWith more than 40 teams signed up for the Challenge, and the CAMI organizers received 215 submissions from 25 programs around the world, though only 17 teams were willing to have their software implementations published. The CAMI organizers evaluated computational tools in 3 categories. Half a dozen assemblers and assembly pipelines were evaluated on assembling genome sequences generated from short-read sequencing technologies. In the binning challenge, five genome binners and 4 taxonomic binners were evaluated on criteria including the tools' efficacy in recovering individual genomes. Finally, 10 taxonomic profilers with various parameter settings were evaluated on how well they could predict the identities and relative abundances of the microbes and circular elements. The benchmarking results are available on https://data.cami-challenge.org/results . \nThe CAMI organizers are already planning future benchmarking challenges, for example to evaluate and aid method development for long read sequencing technologies. \"CAMI is an ongoing initiative,\" noted Sczyrba. \"We are currently further automating the benchmarking and comparative result visualizations. And we invite everyone interested to join and work with CAMI on providing comprehensive performance overviews of the computational metagenomics toolkit, to inform developers about current challenges in computational metagenomics and applied scientists of the most suitable software for their research questions.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nikos kyrpides", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sczyrba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander sczyrba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alice mchardy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tanja woyke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mchardy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "max planck institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doe jgi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "computational biology of infection research lab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helmholtz centre for infection research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bielefeld university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doe office of science user facility", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cami challenge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "computational metagenomics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of energy joint genome institute", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cologne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T10:32:35.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15f08f512c6e210fe4398dec2802ed341bb0be4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyavO58ct.4yE1R8bKDoUpGouerytKkEjOAh7m8KMH3d0hRQ8u4zGQmvA--", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://phys.org/rss-feed/breaking", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "title": "Surrounded by potential: New science in converting biomass", "title_full": "Surrounded by potential: New science in converting biomass", "published": "2017-10-04T10:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2017/1-surroundedby.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "15f08f512c6e210fe4398dec2802ed341bb0be4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyavO58ct.4yE1R8bKDoUpGouerytKkEjOAh7m8KMH3d0hRQ8u4zGQmvA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T10:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Surrounded by potential: New science in converting biomass", "text": "Surrounded by potential: New science in converting biomass October 4, 2017 by Laura Millsaps TEM image of Ce-P-Pd elemental map. Credit: Igor Slowing \nIn every plant\u2014from trees to crops\u2014there exists a substance that makes up its wood or stems, fiber, and cell walls. This substance is a complex natural polymer called lignin, and it is the second largest renewable carbon source on the planet after cellulose. \nThis natural abundance has drawn high interest from the research community to chemically convert lignin into biofuels. And if plant life really does hold the building blocks for renewable fuels, it would seem that we are literally surrounded by potential energy sources everywhere green grows. \nBut untangling the complex chains of these polymers into components, which can be useful for liquid fuel and other applications ranging from pharmaceuticals to plastics, has presented an ongoing challenge to science and industry. \nThere are currently two common ways of processing lignin. One requires an acid plus high heat, and the other is pyrolysis, or treating with high heat in the absence of oxygen. Besides being energy-consuming processing methods, the results are less than optimal. \n\"You end up with individual molecules that are unstable and reactive, and they easily re-polymerize. It's kind of a horrible mess, really,\" explains Igor Slowing, an expert in heterogeneous catalysis at the U.S. Department of Energy's Ames Laboratory. \"We need to be able to deconstruct lignin in a way that is economically feasible and into stable, readily useful components.\" \nSlowing and other scientists at Ames Laboratory are working to reach that commercialization goal, experimenting with chemical reactions that decompose lignin models at low temperatures and pressures. There are already known ways of salvaging useful byproducts out of lignin through the addition of a stabilization process . But Slowing and his research team took both the decomposition and stabilization processes further, by combining the two into one multi-functional catalyst, using phosphate-modified ceria. \n\"Our process does the breaking of lignin-like material and the stabilization in a single step in very mild conditions,\" said Slowing. \"The interesting thing is that though there are two different types of chemical processes happening in a single material, they appear to be working synergistically, and are able to do that at a lower temperature.\" \nIn another experiment, Slowing's research team was able to process a related material, phenol, into useful industrial precursors for nylon production. This work used a catalyst made of ceria and palladium doped with sodium, which increased the reactivity of the process significantly. They also eliminated the use of hydrogen, which is produced from steam-treatment of natural gas, and used an energy-conserving alcohol-based hydrogenation process instead. \nResearch continues. \"Both of these results were very promising, and our next step is to combine the two experiments into one, and achieve lignin deconstruction using hydrogen from a renewable source,\" said Slowing.

Another set of almost 100 studies assessed feline diet. \nWoinarski said that while previous research had looked at the impact cats had on Australia's mammals, this was the first nationwide assessment on birds. \nIt found the highest rates of predation were on Australia's islands and in remote arid areas, where the number of birds killed each year could reach 330 per square kilometre. \nFeral cats, which number in their millions across the country, are also considered the main culprit behind Australia's high rate of mammal extinction. \nThey have wiped out entire populations since being introduced by Europeans who settled in the country two centuries ago, with efforts to cull or sterilise them so far failing to slow their march. \nThe researchers found evidence of cats killing 338 bird types\u2014almost half of Australia's native species, including 71 threatened species such as the spotted quail thrush, the squatter pigeon, and the night parrot. \n\"We found that the birds most likely to be killed by cats are medium sized birds, birds that nest and feed on the ground, and birds that occur on islands or in woodlands, grasslands and shrublands,\" said Woinarski. \n\"For Australian birds, cats are a long-standing, broad-scale and deeply entrenched problem that needs to be tackled more effectively.\" \nAustralia's Threatened Species Commissioner Sebastian Lang called the study \"extremely important and of great concern\". \n\"Our knowledge of the impacts of cats on threatened mammals was a major stimulus for our first-ever national Threatened Species Strategy, which prioritised actions to control feral cats,\" said Lang. \n\"This new research emphasises the need to continue working to reduce the impact of cats on our native biodiversity.\" \nUnder the government's Threatened Species Strategy, more than Aus$30 million (US$23 million) has been mobilised for projects to reduce the impact of feral cats on wildlife. \nIn June, construction began on a huge cat-free zone in the desert covering 69,000 hectares (170,500 acres) to allow native animals that have been pushed to the brink of extinction by the predator to be reintroduced.

Credit: Yuhang Wang \nAs China struggles to find ways to remedy the noxious haze that lingers over Beijing and other cities in the winter, researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology have cast serious doubt on one proposed cause: high levels of ammonia in the air. \nThe wintertime air pollution has gained attention in the scientific community in recent years, prompting some scientists to propose that ammonia , emitted into the air from agricultural activities and automobiles, could be a precursor that strongly promotes the formation of the haze. \nGeorgia Tech researchers countered that theory in a study published September 21 in the journal Scientific Reports . The study was sponsored by the National Science Foundation. \n\"With China and other countries exploring ways to reduce air pollution, it's important to understand the chemistry behind how that haze forms,\" said Rodney Weber, a professor in Georgia Tech's School of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences. \"What we've found is that the atmospheric ammonia is not a large driver of those air conditions, as has been proposed.\" \nThe researchers used advanced computer modeling to examine the chemistry of how sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide - two gases pumped into the atmosphere from coal-burning power plants and other fossil fuel combustion - interact to form sulfate aerosol, one major cause of the haze that can wreak havoc on human and ecosystem health. \n\"Typically, sulfate aerosol is produced through a chemical reaction that oxidizes sulfur dioxide to form sulfate particulates,\" said Athanasios Nenes, a professor and Johnson Faculty Fellow in the School of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences and the School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering. \"In that process, water is absorbed by the sulfate as it is produced and tends to make the particle very acidic, which shuts down certain pathways for further sulfate formation.\" Athanasios Nenes, a professor and Johnson Faculty Fellow in the School of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences and the School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering. Credit: Georgia Tech \nSome scientists have recently suggested that Beijing's high levels of ammonia - which is a base, or on opposite side of the acidity scale - could subvert the normal sulfate process, keeping the particle neutral long enough to form much higher concentrations of sulfate through a new chemical pathway. \nThe researchers at Georgia Tech tested that theory with a computer model that performed a thermodynamic simulation of the aerosol conditions over cities in the East China Plains. The researchers tested numerous atmospheric scenarios by altering the mix of aerosols, gases and meteorological conditions several ways. Consistently, the model showed that elevated ammonia had relatively little impact on the acidity of the pollutant particles. Even a 10-fold increase in ammonia above normal conditions made the aerosol only a tiny amount - only one pH unit - less acidic. The effect was also true in the reverse; lowering ammonia 10-fold made the air only slightly more acidic. The researchers concluded that particles remain too acidic, even for the very high levels of ammonia in Beijing, for sulfate haze to be formed through the proposed new pathway. Hongyu Guo, Georgia Tech grad student and Rodney Weber, a professor in Georgia Tech's School of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences. Credit: Georgia Tech \n\"If ammonia played a big role in the production of sulfate , efforts to control it could have wide-ranging implications, such as considering limiting agricultural activities to improve air pollution of this kind,\" Weber said. \"But, we show that this is likely to be largely ineffective, in this case.\" \nThe researchers found that the mildly acidic air over Beijing could promote high rates of sulfur dioxide oxidation through interaction with transition metals such as iron, copper and manganese emitted into the air from local sources such as car brakes, fly ash and mineral dust, which could be another important contributor to extreme pollution events and a source of intense particle toxicity. \nOther researchers at Georgia Tech have attributed the extreme haze in China in recent years to changing weather patterns as a result of climate change. \n\"Controlling ammonia emissions overall seems to be the proposed strategy for mitigating air quality problems in many regions of the globe, but our work shows that it is not necessarily the most cost effective way to go,\" Nenes said. \"You certainly don't want to ignore ammonia emissions , but there can be other ways to get the biggest bang for the buck in terms of air quality improvement, such as limiting sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from coal burning power plants.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "weber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodney weber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yuhang wang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athanasios nenes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hongyu guo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nenes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "georgia tech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "school of chemical & biomolecular engineering", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia tech's school of earth & atmospheric sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scientific reports", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnson faculty fellow in the school of earth & atmospheric sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national science foundation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taiyuan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east china plains", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T11:35:28.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d3d4f4d146a7a08e9ddb8fb0340431926ccdb7e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuiqJqGkfLk9b7Hbd2hzyafSvDbbSE7p9fmoR_HG2JQ1w7ZFHQfivQHCmUkRzgqFGDjdxIqv6qnQ--", "site_full": "phys.org", "site": "phys.org", "site_section": "http://www.physorg.com/physorg.rss", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Phys.org -

Credit: Michael Houtz \nClimate change will not significantly impair animal agriculture in the Northeast region of the United States, according to a multidisciplinary team of researchers, who point out there are many variables in the future scenario they envision. \nAlthough a projected increase in hot days will cause more heat stress in dairy cows and economic challenges for the equine industry, some animal agricultural endeavors in the Northeast may actually benefit from warming, predicted lead researcher Alex Hristov, professor of dairy nutrition, College of Agricultural Sciences, Penn State. \nWarmer conditions could result in poultry producers incurring lower energy costs for heating chicken housing fall through spring. Researchers also suggest a warmer, wetter environment could boost the ability of beef cattle producers to grow and provide forage for their animals. \nResearchers noted that climate models for the Northeast predict, on average, more warm days exceeding 77 degrees; more extremely warm nights\u2014with minimum temperature above 70 degrees; fewer extremely cold nights\u2014temperatures below 32 degrees; warmer average winter and summer temperatures ; more days with heavy rain exceeding 2 to 3 inches; and higher annual precipitation. \n\"Increased temperatures will alter the forage growing season timing and extend its length; however, changes in relative humidity\u2014which can exacerbate summer heat stress in dairy cattle\u2014are expected to be minimal through the current century,\" Hristov said. \"We are confident that we know what is going to happen\u2014the new, down-scaled climate models portray the evolution of current trends in the Northeast through the 21st century.\" \nThe research, which was published recently in Climatic Change , analyzed the coming impacts of warmer, wetter conditions in the Northeast on forage production and quality; manure management; emerging pathogens and disease; the production of dairy cattle, beef cattle and poultry; and equine enterprises. \nFor forage crops, researchers believe more warm days and higher annual precipitation, combined with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, will either increase or decrease forage productivity, depending on the crop. \nPredicted temperature increases may decrease fertility in dairy cattle and heat stress-induced inflammation may limit energy available for productive functions. A slight decline in milk production due to decreased feed intake could occur. \nProjected temperature changes, hotter nights and fewer cold days, may reduce maintenance costs for beef cattle. More forage availability may increase grazing days in the region and boost the relevance of the beef cattle industry. \nAccording to the researchers, poultry broiler production in the region may benefit from warmer winter and summer temperatures, but future housing will require greater insulation and ventilation fan capacity. Providing adequate housing and ventilation to offset climate changes will also be important for the layer industry and could increase the price of eggs. \nClimate change is expected to have an economic impact on the horse industry in the region by requiring additional management of land and forage resources, buildings to provide cool shelters for animals, and heat-abatement measures at equine events. \nTwo aspects related to all animal agriculture\u2014nutrient management and disease\u2014are expected be complicated and exacerbated by warmer, wetter conditions in the Northeast, Hristov explained. In the case of emerging pathogens, it is difficult to predict the severity of ensuing problems. \n\"Increased temperatures and more intense storms will increase losses of nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon as well as gaseous emissions from animal manure,\" he said. \"Losses of these nutrients contribute to environmental issues such as eutrophication (algal takeover) of surface waters and ground water contamination.\" \n\"Uncertainties about how host animals , pathogens and disease vectors will respond to climate change are the wild card in predicting the effect of climate-induced changes in animal agriculture in the region.

The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2017 is awarded to Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson for the development of cryo-electron microscopy , which both simplifies and improves the imaging of biomolecules. This method has moved biochemistry into a new era. In this picture released by the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, Jacques Dubochet, chemistry professor at the University of Lausanne (UNIL), poses in his office, in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2006.

(University of Lausanne/Keystone via AP) \nA picture is a key to understanding. Scientific breakthroughs often build upon the successful visualisation of objects invisible to the human eye. However, biochemical maps have long been filled with blank spaces because the available technology has had difficulty generating images of much of life's molecular machinery. Cryo-electron microscopy changes all of this. Researchers can now freeze biomolecules mid-movement and visualise processes they have never previously seen, which is decisive for both the basic understanding of life's chemistry and for the development of pharmaceuticals. \nElectron microscopes were long believed to only be suitable for imaging dead matter, because the powerful electron beam destroys biological material. But in 1990, Richard Henderson succeeded in using an electron microscope to generate a three-dimensional image of a protein at atomic resolution. This breakthrough proved the technology's potential.

(Jean-Christophe Bott/Keystone via AP) \nJoachim Frank made the technology generally applicable. Between 1975 and 1986 he developed an image processing method in which the electron microscope's fuzzy twodimensional images are analysed and merged to reveal a sharp three-dimensional structure. \nJacques Dubochet added water to electron microscopy. Liquid water evaporates in the electron microscope's vacuum, which makes the biomolecules collapse. In the early 1980s, Dubochet succeeded in vitrifying water \u2013 he cooled water so rapidly that it solidified in its liquid form around a biological sample, allowing the biomolecules to retain their natural shape even in a vacuum. \nFollowing these discoveries, the electron microscope 's every nut and bolt have been optimised. The desired atomic resolution was reached in 2013, and researchers can now routinely produce three-dimensional structures of biomolecules. In the past few years, scientific literature has been filled with images of everything from proteins that cause antibiotic resistance, to the surface of the Zika virus. Biochemistry is now facing an explosive development and is all set for an exciting future.

Credit: Tuomas Kankaanp\u00e4\u00e4 \nResearchers from the Universities of Turku and Helsinki, Finland, have discovered the prey species of adult dragonflies and damselflies, as modern laboratory techniques enabled the study of the insects' diet. In the study, prey DNA was extracted from tiny dragonfly droppings and the researchers managed to identify dozens of prey species from the samples. The results shed light on dragonflies' position in natural food webs with an unprecedented specificity. \nDragonflies and damselflies, i.e. the odonates, are numerous and quite large insects. As adults, they control the air space as the apex predators of invertebrates. The diet of dragonflies has never before been resolved comprehensively, as it is difficult to observe them catching or eating their prey . \nThe dragonflies' menu was studied by extracting and identifying the DNA of prey species from faecal samples. With this method, the researchers were able to identify in detail which insects the three studied dragonfly species had eaten and a large group of different prey species was identified as their prey. At the same time, the researchers discovered that the three dragonfly species prey upon practically the same species\u2014and that they share their diet with birds and bats, which are the dominant vertebrate predators. \nThe research group included researchers from the Biodiversity Unit of the University of Turku, the Department of Agricultural Sciences of the University of Helsinki, and Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. \n\"This study is very significant as dragonflies are at the top of the insect food webs all over the world and regulate the number of many other insect species. Therefore, it is important to know exactly which species they eat. From there, we can, for example, assess the dragonflies' impact on the populations of those insects that are harmful to humans. Yet so far, the information on the diet of adult dragonflies has practically been based on individual visual observations of their prey,\" says Kari Kaunisto from the Biodiversity Unit of the University of Turku. \nIn the study, the researchers also tested the applicability of different methods for extracting DNA, and their results can be utilised in future research. \n\"When Kari told me of his idea, I was immediately interested. It was surprising that no one had done this before and I accepted the challenge at once. Often in research, earlier studies provide a starting point for laboratory work, but in this case we had to start from the beginning. In a new project, it's a good idea to test different methods and we wanted to lay a good foundation for future studies,\" says researcher Eero Vesterinen from the University of Helsinki, who in his earlier research has specialised in the research of feeding biology, especially by applying molecular research methods based on DNA. \n\"As dragonflies are large insects, they have long interested researchers as well as nature lovers. The number of the odonate species is relatively small and identifying different species is easier than with other insect groups.

They live in several types of forest ecosystems, from dry to riparian and rainforest. Although the forests they inhabit are being increasingly lost to deforestation for agriculture, howler monkeys are categorized as \"Least Concern\" by the IUCN Red List, meaning that they are considered to be not threatened with extinction. However, increasing deforestation rates and the howler monkey's susceptibility to yellow fever outbreaks call for a reassessment of their status. \nNow, a paper appearing in the journal PloS One shows that populations of howler monkeys from Argentina and Paraguay are divided among four groups and that their effective population sizes \u2013 meaning the population that actually is reproducing \u2013 is very low, which makes them more susceptible to negative impacts, such as yellow fever outbreaks. \nThe study looked for genetic differentiation in black-and-gold howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya) from 10 localities in eastern Paraguay and northeastern Argentina, covering the full range of forest types in which howler monkeys live. The researchers found that howler monkeys from these 10 places can be divided into four management units and that landscape features, such as the presence of native forest or rivers, for instance, are important determinants of population connectivity among populations of howler monkeys. They also found that genetic variability tended to be low in howler monkeys from these areas. Populations with a high genetic variability are able to cope with stressful events, such as a yellow fever outbreak, much better than population with low genetic variability. In fact, the black-and-gold howler monkey population with the lowest genetic variability analyzed by the biologists was later decimated, and went extinct, due to a yellow fever outbreak. \nForests of Argentina and Paraguay are under increasing risk of deforestation, mainly to increase the area for agriculture. Dr. Luciana Oklander, biologist at the Institute of Subtropical Biology and the leading author of the paper, reflects on the significance of the study: \"Based on the results of our work, we believe that the Red List's conservation status of the black-and-gold howler monkey should be upgraded to from Least Concern to Vulnerable.\" She adds, \"Effective conservation of Paraguay's and Argentina's forests is urgently needed because they are key to keep populations connected.\" \nProvided by: National University of Misiones 4 shares U-M researchers leading effort to explain recent howler monkey deaths in Nicaragua February 25, 2016 \nTwo University of Michigan-based scientists are leading an effort to explain the recent deaths of at least 75 howler monkeys living in the tropical forests of southwestern Nicaragua.

That could be days or months away, depending on what the volcano does next. \nAll sorts of vessels from water taxis to commercial ships have helped ferry people to nearby islands since officials gave the evacuation order last week.

Past observations of such unusual auroras can therefore allow researchers to determine the frequency and severity of magnetic storms. The more information that can be gathered about historically intense magnetic storms, the greater the opportunity to mitigate disruption of power grids in a future event. \nHistorical documents are becoming much more accessible for research as newly discovered records surface from private collections around the world. Researchers at Tokyo's National Institute of Japanese Literature (NIJL) and National Institute for Polar Research (NIPR) examined a detailed painting from a Japanese manuscript Seikai (\"Understanding Comets\") with associated commentary describing a red aurora occurring over Kyoto on 17 September 1770. They also investigated detailed descriptions of the event from a newly discovered diary of the Higashi-Hakura family of Kyoto. \n\"The enthusiasm and dedication of amateur astronomers in the past provides us an exciting opportunity,\" Kiyomi Iwahashi of NIJL says. \"The diary was written by a kokugakusha [scholar of ancient Japanese culture], and provides a sophisticated description of the red aurora, including a description of the position of the aurora relative to the Milky Way.\" \nUsing astrometric calculations of the elevations of the Milky Way as it would have been viewed from Kyoto on 17 September 1770, the researchers were able to calculate the geometry of the red aurora and check the results against the details from the Seikai painting and the diary. The description of the aurora according to the historical documents allowed the researchers to estimate the strength of the magnetic storm that caused the September 1770 aurora.

The 1859 storm was the largest magnetic storm on record in which technological effects were widely observed,\" says Ryuho Kataoka of NIPR. \"It was lucky for us that the 1770 storm predated our reliance on electricity.\" \nSo how likely are such magnetic storms? \"We are currently within a period of decreasing solar activity, which may spell the end for severe magnetic storms in the near future,\" Kataoka says. \"However, we actually witnessed an extremely fast coronal mass ejection only several days ago [10 September 2017], which might be powerful enough to cause extreme storms. Fortunately, it just missed the Earth.\" \nRegardless of the specific likelihood of another perfect magnetic storm , interdisciplinary historical and scientific collaborations are invaluable in providing important physical details that could help us to understand the greatest magnetic storms in history and prepare for any potential future event. The geometry of the auroral appearance as seen from Kyoto on Sept. 17 1770, is calculated for its reconstruction. Diamonds show the positions of the red aurora tangentially mapped to the flat plane of the 60 by 80 field-of-view, plotted every 100 km in east-west direction and every 10 km in vertical direction. The main body of the emissions is assumed to be in the range of 200 km to 500 km, with an inclination angle of 45 along the local magnetic field. Elevation angles are shown by angle markings on the vertical axis with plus signs.

Credit: Dr Bertrand Collignon \nTiny mobile robots are learning to work with insects in the hope the creatures' sensitive antennae and ability to squeeze into small spaces can be put to use serving humans. \nWith a soft electronic whirr, a rather unusual looking ant trundles along behind a column of its arthropod comrades as they march off to fetch some food. \nWhile the little insects begin ferrying tiny globules of sugar back home, their mechanical companion bustles forward to effortlessly pick up the entire container and carry it back to the nest. \nIt is a dramatic demonstration of how robots can be introduced and accepted into insect societies. \nBut the research, which is being conducted as part of the EU-funded CyBioSys project, could be an important step towards using robots to subtly control, or work alongside, animals or humans. \n'The idea is to be able to solve (a) problem with a better solution than they (the robots and insects) can produce individually,' said Dr Bertrand Collignon, who is leading the research at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, in Switzerland. \nThe robots, which 'live' with the ants, pick up signs that food has been discovered through a camera mounted inside the nest. The camera alerts the robots when it detects an increasing numbers of ants are departing \u2013 a sign that food has been found. \nThe robots \u2013 reprogrammed off-the-shelf Thymio bots managed by simple Raspberry Pi computers \u2013 then use sensors to follow the columns of exiting ants. Once the ants have led their robotic counterparts to their discovery, the robots take over, using their superior muscle power to lug it home. \nDr Collignon described this as a 'cyber-biological system', which improves both on the natural order, and on what robots could achieve on their own. By getting ants and robots to collaborate, each community plays to its strengths, he says. \n'The ants are good at exploring the environment very efficiently, with many scouts patrolling the vicinity of the nest at the same time,' said Dr Collignon, who is a Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie action fellow. 'But individual ants are not able to transport large amounts of food and some can get lost between the food and the nest.' \nRobots are like pack animals in comparison, carrying an order of magnitude more food than an ant can, and accomplishing in a few minutes what would have taken the ants hours. \nDr Collignon believes it is the first project to consider an insect swarm as a biosensor and then embed in a robot the ability to extract data from the colony. \nBut he also believes this research could be combined with other work teaching robots to communicate with animals. Instead of relying on top-down instructions\u2014like a shepherd dog herding sheep\u2014this would work by subtly influencing them from a position as one of the group. \nAs many social insects such as ants and bees can form aggressive colonies that normally do not respond well to outsiders, influencing them from within may offer a new approach. \nIn a previous EU-funded project, LEURRE , a team pioneered the creation of small mobile robots that could interact with cockroaches and influence their collective behaviour. \nWhen kept in a pen together, cockroaches will gradually gather under the same dark shelter. They achieve this simply by following two rules: stay close to other cockroaches, and head for somewhere dark. \nBut when the researchers released small robots into the pen programmed with slightly different rules\u2014stay close to other cockroaches but prefer a lighter refuge\u2014in time the cockroaches, along with the robots, gathered in the lighter shelter instead. \nDr Collignon believes that the two types of robotic work \u2013 collaboration and communication \u2013 could find applications in search and rescue, exploring environments too dangerous or inaccessible for humans. Eventually, small animals could be used to get into restricted environments such as collapsed buildings. \nBy integrating artificial systems, such as robots, into more natural ones \u2013 such as a warehouse full of chickens \u2013 it could lead to new solutions to help control animal behaviour on farms. An example might be preventing deadly mass panic attacks amongst intensively reared animals by using robots that can detect the early signs of an impending stampede and diverting one by behaving in a different way. \n'The first step is to be able to track what natural agents are doing and react appropriately to that,' he said. 'That's already a tricky thing. Once you have sensed what nature is doing, you can then interact.
