Boosting Brown Fat Through Diet Written By Michael Greger M.D. FACLM on October 3rd, 2017 \nUntil about ten years ago, brown adipose tissue (BAT) was considered to be biologically active only in babies and small children where it generates heat by burning fat. But now, there is no doubt that active brown fat is present in adult humans and is involved in cold-induced increases in whole-body calorie expenditure and, thereby, helps control of not only body temperature but also how fat we are. \nIn 2013, researchers showed that one could activate brown adipose tissue if you chill out people long enough, specifically, by exposing them to two hours of cold every day for six weeks, which can lead to a significant reduction in body fat. You can see an illustrative graph in my video Boosting Brown Fat Through Diet . Although researchers demonstrated the effective recruitment of human brown fat, it would seem difficult to increase exposure to cold in daily life. Thankfully, our brown fat can also be activated by some food ingredients, such as capsaicin, the compound that makes hot peppers hot. \nWhile physical activity is usually recommended to increase energy expenditure, there are specific food components, such as capsaicin, that are known to burn off calories. For example, one study found that there was a significant rise in energy expenditure within 30 minutes of eating the equivalent of a jalape\u00f1o pepper. \nNormally when we cut down on calories, our metabolism slows down, undercutting our weight loss attempts; but sprinkling a third of a teaspoon of red chili pepper powder onto our meals counteracts that metabolic slow down and promotes fat burning. Researchers wanted to try giving participants more chili pepper in order to try to match some of the studies done in Asia, but the Caucasian subjects couldn\u2019t take it. But by adding more than a tablespoon of red pepper powder to a high-fat meal, Japanese women burned significantly more fat. \nWe\u2019ve known for decades that cayenne pepper increases metabolic rate, but we didn\u2019t know how. But studies show that this class of compounds increases energy expenditure in human individuals with brown fat, but not in those without it, indicating that individuals increase expenditure right off the BAT. Additionally, there is a variety of structurally similar flavor molecules in other foods, like black pepper and ginger, that may activate thermogenesis as well, but they haven\u2019t been directly tested. \nAll these results suggest that the anti-obesity effects of pepper compounds are based on the heat-generating activity of recruited brown fat. Thus, repeated ingestion can mimic the chronic effects of cold exposure without having to freeze ourselves. \nConsumption of spicy foods may help us lose weight, but what about the sensory burn and pain on our tongues and sometimes in our stomachs as well as further on down? Are our only two options for boosting brown fat to freeze our legs or burn our butts? \nArginine-rich foods may also stimulate brown adipose tissue growth and development through a variety of mechanisms, which is achieved by consuming more soy foods, seeds, nuts, and beans. \nFor more on brown adipose tissue, see Brown Fat: Losing Weight Through Thermogenesis . \nWhat about arginine? Check out Fat Burning Via Arginine . And, did you know arginine may also play a role in the effects nuts may have on penile blood flow? I discuss this in Pistachio Nuts for Erectile Dysfunction . \nFor more on spicy foods, see my videos Cayenne Pepper for Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Chronic Indigestion to learn how digestive disorders may be helped and Hot Sauce in the Nose for Cluster Headaches? for information on how the hot pepper compound can be a lifesaver for people suffering from \u201csuicide\u201d headaches. \nIn health, \nMichael Greger, M.D. \nPS: If you haven\u2019t yet, you can subscribe to my free videos here and watch my live, year-in-review presentations:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:25:51.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d63d884dbe46fbe273211168fd3b53a8f713fc23", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlB1dKZB0dDBMuE8yS1eI1G_e_RjoZvZzAsxNzNHk6LTo1ZIAxRhFbz7JsjzK0w6hS0-", "site_full": "nutritionfacts.org", "site": "nutritionfacts.org", "site_section": "http://nutritionfacts.org/feed?post_type=video", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "health", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Videos \u2013 NutritionFacts.org", "title": "Does Cell Phone Radiation Cause Cancer?", "title_full": "Does Cell Phone Radiation Cause Cancer?", "published": "2017-10-04T14:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2017/10/38-10-Does-Cell-Phone-Radiation-Cause-Cancer-1200x675.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23349, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d63d884dbe46fbe273211168fd3b53a8f713fc23", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlB1dKZB0dDBMuE8yS1eI1G_e_RjoZvZzAsxNzNHk6LTo1ZIAxRhFbz7JsjzK0w6hS0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM", "published": "2017-10-04T14:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Does Cell Phone Radiation Cause Cancer?", "text": "  4.93 (98.67%) 60 votes \nDo mobile phones cause brain tumors or not?

To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. \nWhen it comes to the potential human health effects of cell phone use, sure, if you text excessively, you might end up with a crick in your neck, or even a broken neck for you or someone you hit, if you do it while driving. On the other hand, think of the countless lives that have been saved on the road, because people are now able to so quickly phone in emergencies. \nBut, what about cancer? Since the turn of the century, there\u2019ve been studies suggesting up to a doubling of brain tumor risk with long-term cell phone use on the side of your head where you use it to talk. That\u2019s important, since the radiation only really penetrates a few inches into your head. Looking from the back of someone\u2019s head or from the top, you can see why you might develop cancer on the one side of your head, over the other. \nSince it\u2019s such a local effect, you can see why there are recommendations for using like the speaker function or using a hands-free headset, which can reduce brain exposure by a factor of 100 or more, and this includes Bluetooth headsets. This may be particularly important in children, who have thinner skulls. \nYeah, but cell phone radiation isn\u2019t like nuclear radiation; it doesn\u2019t damage DNA directly, like gamma rays from an atomic bomb or something. Ah, but it does appear to be able to damage DNA indirectly by generating free radicals. Out of 100 studies that looked at that, 93 confirmed these oxidative effects of the kind of low-intensity radiofrequency radiation that comes out of cell phones. Okay, but does that oxidative stress translate out into DNA damage? Most studies found it did, finding signs of genotoxicity\u2014damage to our genes, our DNA, our chromosomes. Yeah, but a lot of those studies were in petri dishes or lab animals. I\u2019m less interested in whether Mickey or Minnie are at risk; what about brain tumors in people? \nYes, some population studies found increased cancer risk; other studies did not. Hmm, I wonder if the source of funding of those studies had anything to do with it. Some of the studies were funded by cell phone companies. Researchers suspected that studies would be less likely to show an effect if they were funded by the telecommunications industry, which has the obvious vested interest in portraying the use of cell phones as safe. \nSo, they ran the numbers and surprise, surprise, found that the studies funded exclusively by industry were indeed substantially less likely to report significant effects. Most of the independently funded studies showed an effect; most of the industry-funded studies did not\u2014in fact, had about ten times fewer odds of finding an adverse effect from cell phone use. \nThat\u2019s even worse than the drug industry! Studies sponsored by Big Pharma about their own products only had about four times the odds of favoring the drug, compared to independent researchers, though Big Tobacco still reigns supreme when it comes to Big Bias. \nWhy do research articles on the health effects of secondhand smoke reach different conclusions? Well, turns out studies funded by the tobacco industry had a whopping 88 times the odds of concluding it was not harmful; so, ten or so times for telecom puts it more towards the drug industry end of the bias spectrum. \nThere\u2019s conflicts of interest on both sides of the debate, though\u2014if not financial, then at least intellectual, where it\u2019s human nature to be biased towards evidence that supports your personal position. And so, you\u2019ll see flimsy science, like this, published where there appears to be a \u201cdisturbingly\u201d straight line between the states with the most brain tumors, and the states with the most cell phone subscriptions. But, come on, one can think of lots of reasons why states like New York and Texas might have more brain tumors and cell phones than the Dakotas, that have nothing to do with cell phone radiation. \nSometimes, you might even see outright fraud, with allegations that academic researchers that authored two of those genotoxicity papers\u2014and this very review\u2014were involved in scientific misconduct, which they deny, pointing out that their lead accuser turned out to be a lawyer working for the telecom industry, and on and on. \nWhenever there\u2019s a trillion-dollar industry involved, whether it\u2019s the food industry or the tobacco industry, the drug industry or the telecom industry, there\u2019s so much money involved that the science can get manipulated. \nTake the nuclear energy industry. \u201c[D]ecades of\u2026high-level, institutional\u2026cover-up[s]\u201d as to \u201cthe health consequences of\u2026Chernobyl,\u201d for example, with the official estimates of resulting health problems a hundred or even a thousand times lower than estimates from independent researchers. Was it just 4,000 who would eventually die from it, or nearly a million people? It depends who you ask, and who happens to be funding whoever you\u2019re asking. That\u2019s why, when it comes to cancer, all eyes turn to the IARC, the official World Health Organization body that independently, and objectively, tries to determine what is and is not carcinogenic. We\u2019ll find out what they concluded about cell phones, next. \nPlease consider volunteering to help out on the site.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mickey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "big pharma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iarc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "big tobacco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "big telecom", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dakotas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T21:35:30.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a44913346e641afb3cca38f1d6cc4b2c551d4c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2sXsDupUmNE082Rae2e709J_Fzv9sIkdFB7KW3umeOpHgYh8RsjhGuA9EGWxZEBgn2srY69rjN0k-", "site_full": "nutritionfacts.org", "site": "nutritionfacts.org", "site_section": "http://nutritionfacts.org/feed", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "health", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "NutritionFacts.org", "title": "Choosing to Have a Normal Blood Pressure", "title_full": "Choosing to Have a Normal Blood Pressure", "published": "2017-10-05T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2017/10/Oct-5-Blood-Pressure-1200x675.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23349, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a44913346e641afb3cca38f1d6cc4b2c551d4c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2sXsDupUmNE082Rae2e709J_Fzv9sIkdFB7KW3umeOpHgYh8RsjhGuA9EGWxZEBgn2srY69rjN0k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM", "published": "2017-10-05T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Choosing to Have a Normal Blood Pressure", "text": "Home > Dr. Greger\u2019s Medical Nutrition Blog > Choosing to Have a Normal Blood Pressure Image Credit: Lily Lvnatikk / Unsplash. This image has been modified. Choosing to Have a Normal Blood Pressure Written By Michael Greger M.D. FACLM on October 5th, 2017 \nFor the first 90% of our evolution, humans ate diets containing less than a quarter teaspoon of salt a day. Why? Because we ate mostly plants . Since we went millions of years without salt shakers, our bodies evolved into salt-conserving machines, which served us well until we discovered salt could be used to preserve foods. Without refrigeration, this was a big boon to human civilization . Of course, this may have led to a general rise in blood pressure, but does that matter if the alternative is starving to death since all your food rotted away? But where does that leave us now, when we no longer have to live off pickles and jerky? We are genetically programmed to eat ten times less salt than we do now. Even many \u201clow\u201d-salt diets can be considered high-salt diets. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical to understand what the concept of \u201cnormal\u201d is when it comes to salt. \nAs I discuss in my video High Blood Pressure May Be a Choice , having a \u201cnormal\u201d salt intake can lead to a \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure, which can help us to die from all the \u201cnormal\u201d causes, like heart attacks and strokes. \nDoctors used to be taught that a \u201cnormal\u201d systolic blood pressure (the top number) is approximately 100 plus age. Babies start out with a blood pressure around 95 over 60, but then as we age that 95 can go to 120 by our 20s, then 140 in our 40s, and keep climbing as we age. (140 is the official cut-off above which one technically has high blood pressure.) That was considered normal, since everyone\u2019s blood pressure creeps up as we get older. And if that\u2019s normal, then heart attacks and strokes are normal too, since risk starts rising once we start getting above the 100 we had as a baby. \nIf blood pressures over 100 are associated with disease, maybe they should be considered abnormal . Were these elevated blood pressures caused by our abnormally high salt intake\u2014ten times more than what our bodies were designed to handle? Maybe if we ate a natural amount of salt, our blood pressures would not go up with age and we\u2019d be protected. Of course, to test that theory you\u2019d have to find a population in modern times that doesn\u2019t use salt, eat processed food, or go out to eat. For that, you\u2019d have to go deep into the Amazon rainforest. \nMeet the Yanomamo people, a no-salt culture with the lowest salt intake ever reported. That is, they have a totally normal-for-our-species salt intake. So, what happens to their blood pressure on a no- or low-salt diet as they age? They start out with a blood pressure of about 100 over 60 and end up with a blood pressure of about 100 over 60. Though theirs is described as a salt- deficient diet, that\u2019s like saying they have a diet deficient in Twinkies. They\u2019re the ones, it seems, who are eating truly normal salt intakes, which leads to truly normal blood pressures. Those in their 50s have the blood pressure of a 20-year-old. What was the percentage of the population tested with high blood pressure? Zero. However, elsewhere in Brazil, up to 38% of the population may be affected. The Yanomamos probably represent the ultimate human example of the importance of salt on blood pressure. \nOf course, there could have been other factors . They didn\u2019t drink alcohol, ate a high-fiber and plant-based diet, got lots of exercise, and had no obesity. There are a number of plant-based populations eating little salt who experience no rise of blood pressure with age, but how do we know what exactly is to blame? Ideally, we\u2019d do an interventional trial. Imagine if we took people literally dying from out-of-control high blood pressure (so called malignant hypertension) where you go blind from bleeding into your eyes, your kidneys shut down, and your heart fails, and then we withhold from these patients blood pressure medications so their fate is certain death. Then, what if we put them on a Yanomamo level of salt intake\u2014that is, a normal-for-the-human-species salt intake\u2014and, if instead of dying, they walked away cured of their hypertension? That would pretty much seal the deal. \nEnter Dr. Walter Kempner and his rice and fruit diet. Patients started with blood pressures of 210 over 140, which dropped down to 80 over 60. Amazing stuff, but how could he ethically withhold all modern blood pressure medications and treat with diet alone? This was back in the 1940s, and the drugs hadn\u2019t been invented yet. \nHis diet wasn\u2019t just extremely low salt, though; it was also strictly plant-based and extremely low in fat, protein, and calories. There is no doubt that Kempner\u2019s rice diet achieved remarkable results, and Kempner is now remembered as the person who demonstrated , beyond any shadow of doubt, that high blood pressure can often be lowered by a low enough salt diet. \nForty years ago, it was acknowledged that the evidence is very good, if not conclusive, that a low enough reduction of salt in the diet would result in the prevention of essential hypertension (the rising of blood pressure as we age) and its disappearance as a major public health problem. It looks like we knew how to stop this four decades ago. During this time, how many people have died ? Today, high blood pressure may kill 400,000 Americans every year\u2014causing a thousand unnecessary deaths every day. \nI have a whole series of videos on salt, including Sprinkling Doubt: Taking Sodium Skeptics with a Pinch of Salt , The Evidence That Salt Raises Blood Pressure , Shaking the Salt Habit and Sodium & Autoimmune Disease: Rubbing Salt in the Wound . \nCanned foods are infamous for their sodium content, but there are no-salt varieties.

Beyond heart health, reducing salt intake could also help our kidneys ( How to Treat Kidney Stones with Diet ) but if you cut down on salt, won\u2019t everything taste like cardboard?

BTW with no sleep aid. this is one of the biggest success stories i have run across. now she is watching videos on here and wants to go completely WFPB too. 4 October 9th, 2017 at 7:52 am \nYour analogy of cell phones and induction cooktops is interesting, but not accurate. The problem is not the amount of energy used but it has to do with the Frequency of the energy. The power of the induction Cooktops interfere more with the schumann resonance (7-8hz). This gets into theories that our DNA and all of life is powered by the small changes in geomagnetic fluctuations. At that level, any metal around our neck would also interfere with those energies. As a whole, the induction cooking is minimal as the RF from just the 60 hz already permeates the environment and is present in most electronics as noise that is filtered out. If you are truly worried about RF issues, look into the energies and frequencies surrounding radio towers. 50,000 watts, vs 1500 watts for an induction top. More power at a higher frequency. The Frequency is what causes the issue. The higher you go, the more damage can be caused by the EM energies. Google :: Frequency Chart x ray \u2013 http://images.tutorvista.com/cms/images/81/Visible-spectrum-chart1.PNG \nWe take the good with the bad in everything we do. With everything we eat we make decisions. Dr. Greger is allowing us to make informed decisions about the radiation surrounding Cell Phones. What he didn\u2019t cover is that most of the studies done for penetration testing were done on adult males in the military and that woman do not have as thick as skull as their male counterpart. We make decisions for our children who have even less protection and because of social pressures spend more time on the phone than most adults and as such are at more risk. Since Cell Phones are a NEW technology we don\u2019t really have any data on the possible side effects. Yes, Cell phones have been around since the 70\u2019s, but the life of the cell phone battery and power reduction is because of the frequency shift of the transmitters. It has gone up, and up \u2013 and the NEW Cell phones use a different frequency and technology. That frequency usage at the distance that it is being used is the problem, which gets back to your question on induction cooktops and 60 hz is not all that dangerous a frequency for disruption of chemical or molecular bonds. Even at close range. If you need more evidence, check out Induction Furnace and research if those in those industries having more exposure in 10 minutes then you have in a year should be showing some kind of alterations to their genes. Or those in the Power Generation facilities. Since neither are showing any \u2018 reported \u2018 impacts, I would conclude that the potential for this being a problem are approaching zero, where the energies of Cell Phones although 1/10000 less are in fact causing heating issues and oxidative stress on the body. Cell Phones are more important in the risk analysis. Just as when you compare eating meat to eating organic vs \u2018conventional\u2019, the risk analysis points to getting rid of meat, because the fat bio-accumulates the toxins in the environment. And the cost analysis that is being done, means that we are creating meat that not only contains toxins, but prions. In an order of importance and weighing the factors, the microwave energies frying our skulls is more important to me than the induction current cooking my meal. I so wanted to say frying my meat, creating Heterocyclic Amines (HCAs) but that would just be a play on words and not addressing your concern. \nAnd by the way \u2013 the induction top produces less EM than resistive heating. But that is a different story. 1 October 6th, 2017 at 3:39 pm \nI have a cerebral menigioma. I have no idea if it is caused by cell phone use but I follow the protocol for Dt Greger. I have been told my tumor is not getting larger and I have no other issues related to the tumor. 2 October 6th, 2017 at 4:14 pm \nHi Ellen Vanderstarre, Thanks for your comment. I am one of the volunteer at the website. Firstly I wish you good health and great job that you follow Dr Greger for sound health advice. I also was curious to find what this cerebral meningioma is ? In the literature it mentions a majority of them are benign which is good to know. I shall include the reference for your information. \nHi. What is the protocol (or where do I find it?) Thanks 0 \nThe WHO gets most, nearly 80% of its funding, from voluntary donations \u2013 ie, financial conditioning from corporate interests. \nHardly an organisation to take seriously. 5 \n@Growing Young They\u2019ve taken a pretty solid stance against processed meats, regular meat, and sugar for an organization supposedly beholden to corporate interests\u2026 Plus labeling cell phones as possibly carcinogenic is hardly business friendly 22 October 6th, 2017 at 1:27 pm \n@Ryan Hallett\u2026 Whatever stance the WHO takes it will be biased by their concern for funding. No organisation that is 80% funded by financial conditioning is going to not consider the consequences of their statements in regards to their future funding. If you worked in an organisation that 4 out of every 5 employees only existed because of financial conditioning then you wouldn\u2019t be doing anything to upset those who are paying the money because you could be one of the 4 made redundant when the money disappears. \nMy point is, when you read the WHO\u2019s statements, bear in mind that there will be a bias within them because there simply has to be due to the funding model. \nThe WHO was supposed to be funded entirely from governments at rates set by each country\u2019s means. This would have meant an unbiased opinion, but the lobbyists soon stopped that and insisted on allowing voluntary contributions to take over 80% of the WHO funding in order to achieve some aim. These corporate interests are not pouring millions of dollars into the WHO for no return on investment. 5 October 6th, 2017 at 8:02 pm \nThe World Health Organizations\u2019s voluntary funding list is a matter of public record . No telecoms corporation is on it, though a few pharmaceutical firms are. The leading non-member state contributors are the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (182 M), GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance (126 M), National Philanthropic Trust (86 M), Rotary International (56 M), UN Development Programme (47 M), European Commission (45 M), UN Central Emergency Response Fund (42 M), UN Population Fund (31 M), UN Fund for International Partnerships (19 M), African Development Bank Group (19 M), Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (18 M), International Drug Purchase Facility (15 M), UN Office for Project Service (10 M), Bloomberg Family Foundation (8 M) before we see the first of a raft of pharmaceutical industry contributions (GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Wellcome Trust) around 7 M. \nPerhaps you think Rotarians have some secret scheme to control all health information. But I would hope you\u2019re smarter than this. 18 October 6th, 2017 at 10:41 pm \nThis is a strange argument for the reasons explained by Darryl. The WHO also usually contracts independent academics to form the committees that produce its scientific reports to avoid the sort of problem you describe. As Darryl has noted, the WHO has a history of publishing reports which are inimical to industry interests. As well as those listed by Darryl, the salt and livestock industries and other industies which have not been particularly pleased by WHO reports. Darryl mantioned sugar as one example and Drb G has a video on this very topic https://nutritionfacts.org/video/big-sugar-takes-on-the-world-health-organization/ \nIt is unlikely that mandating that all WHO funding should come from member governments would end criticisms such as these, I have seen a very similar argument employed to dismiss all studies funded wholly or partly by the NIH (and even all studies that are reported on PubMed) because the Government can\u2019t be trusted. In the UK, some people say thre same thing about the excellent studies published by NICE. These same people also dismiss everything done by the WHO because it is an agency of the UN and tgherefore controlled by governments. The ironic thing is it is the people concerned also routinely rely on studies and papers, where they consider evidence at all, that are produced by people associated with the Atkins Diet empire, or the meat, dairy and egg industries. Those are often reported on PubMed too but this contradiction is ignored, It is all very odd \u2013 topsy turvy logic at its most blatant. \nOf course, you are correct that that we should always be vigilant about possible conflicts of interest. However, in this case, the report\u2019s findings seem contrary to the interests of the industry concerned so it is unlikely to be an issue. 13 \nDarryl and TG\u2026 my point still stands. When you are funded by voluntary contributions to the tune of 80% of your funding then you take care what you say about what. \nAnd anything coming out of the WHO should be viewed with this in mind. \nWhen an organisation is looking down the barrel of billions of dollars in funding, 80% of you annual budget, 4/5ths of your facilities and employees, then that organisation will most certainly pay attention to who is on the other end of that barrel. \nAnd as to NICE\u2026. Spending \u00a31.5 billion on statins every year? They have recommended medicating healthy livers so that big pharma and big food can continue to profit out of people eating unhealthy diets. \nNICE, the corporate shills who spend 1/10 of the NHS budget on type 2 diabetes so that big pharma and big food can continue to profit out of people eating unhealthy diet. \nThat ain\u2019t small change from the UK taxpayers that NICE are spending to protect the corporate interests. And that\u2019s just a small tip of the iceberg of their corporate placation. 1 October 7th, 2017 at 5:36 am \nAgain, this is topsy turvy logic. \nThe UK Government spends billions every year subsidising drugs prescribed under the National Health Service. However, it only subsidises approved drugs. To keep costs doen, it is therefore in the UK Government\u2019s financial interests to remove ineffective and dangetous driugs from the list of approved medicines. The drug industry and its stalkming horses regularly rail against decisions not to approve cost-ineffective drugs. Frankly, it is the critiucs of NICE who are much more likely to be shills for the pharmaceutical industy than the members of NICE who are committed to making health expenditure cost-effective. Industry, like the alternative health loons, are not fans of rigorous reviews of the scientific evidence because they remove the profits to be made from supplying unhealthy foods and ineffective, dangerous and/or (cost) inefficient treatments. \nNICE conducted an extensive review of the evidence around cholesterol lowering and statins, including a financial cost effectiveness analysis. IThe review foundd that they reduce adverse events in appropriate target populations. It also found that they are cost-effective when used in accordance with the guidelines \u2013 in other words, there would be more adverse health events and greater health expenditure if statins were not used. The only people who would benefit from disconyinuing statin use would be the private medicine system (receiving fees for an increased number of procedures and hospital stays) and the drug industry which would supply different but less effective and possibly more expensive drugs. \nThe criticismin your posts is therefore illogical. It is tantamount to saying that we should dismis or ignore all WHO scientific reports (almost all of which which run contrary to industry interests) because of the possibility that they might be swayed by industry interests.. The only beneficiaries of such an attitude would be the telecommunications industry (in this case) and the sugar, salt, meat, livestock etc industries in other cases. \nIf there are industry shills operating here, you appear to be looking on the wrong side of the fence. 9 October 7th, 2017 at 5:55 am \nNot topsy turvy at all. \nSo you are saying that doctors and scientists should recommend and promote and prescribe medicating healthy livers in order to allow people to continue to eat an unhealthy diet? \nThat\u2019s what NICE are doing at a huge cost to the UK taxpayer and subsequent shortage of services within the NHS. \nStatins and metformin use are on the rise, complications from statin use and metformin use are crippling the NHS, they are most certainly not solving the problem and saving the NHS any money whatsoever. The more these drugs have been prescribed the higher the cost to the NHS has been \u2013 FACT! \nOver 10% of the NHS budget is handed over to big pharma purely for T2 diabetes, a completely preventable and mostly reversible disease. But NICE aren\u2019t saying anything about it being prevented or reversed, they just approve more money year after year to be handed over without question to big pharma. \nNICE should be refusing to approve these drugs. Any doctor and/or scientist who has any integrity whatsoever would be shouting from the rooftops, like Dr Greger is, that the problem is in the food supply, not just telling everyone to take statins and metformin, etc., and not to worry about what they eat \u2013 which is what NICE are actually doing. 1 \nhttp://www.nature.com/news/personalized-medicine-time-for-one-person-trials-1.17411 \nI made a print optimized version of the rather astounding NNT (Number Needed to Treat for one person to get a beneficial effect) Chart as a jpeg file, so I can easily share a copy with others. \nIn the case of many of these drugs, they have proven records of shortening life while at the same time doing a very poor job of suppressing symptoms, and no evidence at all of them actually curing a disease, something quite different than suppressing symptoms. \nThe chart does seem a bit of an eye-opener. I wish every patient received a copy of this, as well as of the NNT\u2019s and NNH\u2019s of the drugs a doctor prescribes for them so they could make better informed decisions about whether to take them or not. (And if doctor\u2019s had NNT\u2019s and NNH\u2019s, easily to hand, ethical doctors could make more informed choices about whether to prescribe them or not . . . ) And as far as ruining the placebo effect goes, even placebos work poorly or not at all for drugs that seem intrinsically harmful. \nAnd as far as informed consent goes, it seems fair that doctors who actually care about the well-being of their patients in fact should to tell their patients of the likelihood of a particular drug helping them, by giving them the NNT, while also giving them information on the likelihood of a drug harming them, the NNH \u2013 and in what ways \u2013 so they can make an informed choice. For an older woman who seems a potential candidate for statins, letting them know research indicates it has a 1/50 chance of it helping her, and a 1/3 chance of it giving her diabetes ( http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/877626?src=wnl_mdplsnews_170324_mscpedit_wir&uac=66042FN&impID=1315045&faf=1 ), as well as significant odds of causing cognitive impairment, memory loss, and cataracts. \nWhat a world. October 7th, 2017 at 11:03 pm \nYour latest post also has it exactly the wrong way round which is why I say it too is topsy tirvy logic, \nThe guidelines usually state that life style modifications are the first line of treatment and drugs are to be used where lifestyle modifications are ineffective or in serious cases to supplement lifestyle modifications. For example, the NICE guidelines on lipids and cardiovascular disease risk make it clear that physicians should provide advice on lifestyle modifications. They are also required to provide advice on absolute risk as well as relative risk (ie the NNT point). https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng49 \nSo, what is the NHS supposed to do in your opinion? Refuse to subsidise pharmaceuticals for all people who decline to make lifestyle modifications or for whom they are ineffective? The fact that many people refuse to stop drinking, stop smoking, stop eating bacon, and refuse to eat more healthy foods (in place of unhealthy ones) and to exercise is not evidence of a drug industry conspiracy or of the actions of \u201cshills\u201d. That approach of refusing to subsidise these drugs might well work in the long run of course, at a cost of millions of extra deaths in the short and medium term, but it would definitely qualify as \u201ctough love\u201d. Any government brave enough to bring in such reforms would be out at the next election so I really can\u2019t see it happening. Nothing to do with drug industry conspiracies or shills. \nSimply shouting that your opinions are a FACT proves nothing. A professional cost benefit analysis needs to be conducted to determine this. NICE has done such analyses. You haven\u2019t. Nor have the internet and YouTube althealth critics. However, since the conclusions are unwelcome to conspiracy nuts and to opinionated people uninterested in actual evidence, NICE is regularly excoriated by conspiracy websites and \u201calternative health\u201d sites that don\u2019t make money if people use evidence-based lifestyle modifications and treatments. \nI would encourage you to actually read the guidelines and offer a critical analysis instead of just making vague, general assertions which don\u2019t accord with the facts. Relying solely on assertions made by people with dubious internet sites and YouTube videos (or sensational books to sell) is unwise. They tend not to present all the evidence and, in my experience, misrepresent much of what they do discuss. 4 \nTG, do you actually think that doctors actually give lifestyle/diet advice? \nThey aren\u2019t qualified to. \nAnd NICE\u2019s dietary guidelines are pathetic\u2026 telling people with atherosclerosis to bring down fat consumption to 30% of energy intake, saturated fats to 7% and cholesterol to 300mg isn\u2019t exactly going to help, is it? \nWhat utter nonsense NICE have put out as dietary and lifestyle advice. Wouldn\u2019t solve anyone\u2019s atherosclerosis problems. \nAnd while NICE are telling doctors to tell people to hit those fat guidelines, big food and big pharma have literally corrupted the food labelling system in the UK through lobbyists and political bribes so that consumers cannot see how much % of calories are coming from those things anyway \u2013 food is not labelled like that in the UK because big food and big pharma do not want it labelled like that. So how are consumers supposed to do this with the current big food and big pharma approved food labelling system according to NICE? \nI know people who just take the prescriptions and do nothing to make any effective change to their lifestyle and diet \u2013 which is most people on statins. \nSo they end up with T2 diabetes. Get them on metformin. \nThen they can\u2019t get an erection because of the ongoing atherosclerosis. So get them on viagra. \nThen they get osteoarthritis because of the ongoing atherosclerosis. So get them on anti-inflamatories and pain killers and give them hip and knee replacements. \nThen they get high blood pressure because no where in the NICE guidelines on diet that you posted does it say anything about going on a salt free diet or cutting out all processed foods \u2013 especially processed meats. So then they require more and more blood pressure medication. \nThen they get dementia. \nThen they get alzheimers. \nThen they get cancer. \nBig pharma make more and more profit the more NICE approve drugs to allow people to continue their unhealthy diet and lifestyle choices. The NHS is in crisis. \nAll the people i know on statins are also on high BP meds, pain killers, anti-inflammatories, memory issues, etc., They make no effort whatsoever to change their lifestyle and diet, they just go back to the their GP\u2019s and hospital specialists again and again for more pills, potions and procedures. That\u2019s the reality if you take your rose tinted lenses off. \nYou asked for a solution. \nYou mentioned smoking. I have no problem with that lot. They all die young and the tax on tobacco and their low level of claiming state pension more than covers their health care costs until they die. It\u2019s probably not far off with alcohol as well. So, while i don\u2019t like smoking any where near me, and i don\u2019t drink, i will support their right to do this to themselves because the tax they pay for their vices more than covers the healthcare costs associated with them before they die young \u2013 thus saving more money on state pensions etc.. \nSo lets apply the same logic to all animal products, and refined food. Why not tax them to pay for the health care crisis they are causing as we do tobacco and alcohol? Why isn\u2019t this being discussed in the national debate on the future of the NHS? Why is the future of the NHS always talked about in terms of how much more funding should the tax payer be handing over without any discussion as to why the NHS is in crisis in the first place? \nIt\u2019s very clear as to why the NHS is in crisis. It\u2019s because people simply do not care about changing their lifestyle and diet \u2013 and NICE know this, as does everyone who cares to look. They don\u2019t care because the NHS is free and they\u2019ll just get more and more prescriptions in order to allow them to maintain their unhealthy diet and lifestyle for as long as possible. That\u2019s the reality. That\u2019s a fact. \nNICE are the cause of the NHS crisis. Prescribing statins does not save the NHS money. You cannot show any cost benefit analyses done properly that shows that. 0 October 8th, 2017 at 7:08 am \nSimply blaming NICE because it does what it was set up to do (and does it well) seems illogical to me. \nFrom what I have seen, NICE studies are rigorous and professional. Whether lifestyle choices like the ones you describe should br penalised in the way you propose is a policy decision that needs to be made by elected governments not NICE or other agencies operating according to a strict charter. Blaming NICE for political and social policies around health funding seems a trifle unfair to me. \nAnd your claims about cost benefit analyses are incorrect. You have done none. Neither have any other of the NICE critics. All you have done is express an opinion. NICE however has done such an analysis \u2013 it is a matter of public record. Sorry but I find the NICE analysis more convincing than your unsubstantiated opinions no matter how strongly you might express them. October 9th, 2017 at 10:08 am \nThe NHS is at least trying to put some push into the lifestyle side. This is causing outrage and backlash, not surprisingly. We cannot have a sustainable system without properly accounting for the costs. Cheap junk food is so expensive. October 7th, 2017 at 12:38 pm \nAlthough important, whether the findings of the IARC \u2013 or of any other advisory organization \u2013 seem directly compromised by a conflict of interest due to their sources of funding, does not seem the main issue to me. Even if one assumes an independent organization, with an advisory board consisting of objective individuals who have no financial ties to corporate interests, who will just look through the scientific literature to come to their conclusions, you still have a major problem. The objectivity of the scientific literature has become heavily compromised, and not just through the inclusion of corporate funded studies designed to produce a specific result, but through a variety of different mechanisms. \nHow compromised? \nDr. John Ioannidis, a professor at Stanford University, summed up the situation as follows: \u201cThere is increasing concern that in modern research, false findings may be the majority or even the vast majority of published research claims. However, this should not be surprising. It can be proven that most claimed research findings are false.\u201d (Ioannidis, J.P.A., (2005) \u201cWhy Most Published Research Findings Are False,\u201d PLoS Medicine, 2(8), pp 0696 \u2013 0701, August. http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124&type=printable ) \nFor a detailed description of how published scientific research has become compromised, read the article. \nDr. Richard Horton, the current editor-in-chief of The Lancet, perhaps the most respected peer-reviewed medical journal in the world, agreed. He wrote: \u201cThe case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness.\u201d (Horton, R. (2015) \u201cOffline: What is medicines\u2019 5 sigma?\u201d, The Lancet 385 (9976) p 1380, April 11 http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60696-1/fulltext?rss%25253Dyes ) \u201c \nEven if one assumes that the IARC have done the best they can with respect to sorting out the evidence for whether microwaves can cause cancer or have other harmful effects, they play with a stacked deck. Published studies, designed to show a particular result, from corporate interests that have money to burn dominate the literature, while independent researchers go begging for money, and should they happen to scrape up enough money to at least fund a small study, find their work discounted or ignored specifically because they did a small studies, and because the majority of well funded studies \u2013 funded or influenced by corporate interests \u2013 present contradictory results. And many mainstream scientists \u2013 not funded by corporate interests \u2013 fall for it, which not only results in publication bias, but in a further lack of funding for studies that go against what a majority of scientists may still believe, that non-thermal levels of microwaves can not have any biological effects, let alone cause cancer. \nAnd although corporate interests would have you believe otherwise, \u201cabsence of evidence,\u201d (no studies funded or published) and \u201cevidence of absence\u201d (published studies demonstrating the absence of an effect) do not seem at all the same thing. \nWith time, enough evidence accumulates. At this point it has become very clear that low levels of microwaves can have biological effects \u2013 including detrimental effects. The industry has begun to shift their position to the second line of defense, from \u201clow level microwaves can not cause any biological effects. Period.\u201d to admitting that yes \u201cMicrowaves can have harmful effects, but these effects seem so small, we can safely ignore them.\u201d \nThis strategy worked well as a delaying tactic for the tobacco industry, but I doubt it will work quite as well for the microwave industry. Not for the lack of money or influence, but because they rapidly and continuously increase everyones level of exposure way beyond the levels that any previous research has ever studied, something the tobacco industry never had to deal with. At worst they had people chain smoking 3 to 4 packs a day, imagine what kind of cover up they would have needed if smokers could have upped their habits to 30 or 40 packs a day \u2013 or to 300 to 400 packs a day? But that seems exactly the situation that takes place with regard to our microwave exposures, with no end in sight 3 October 7th, 2017 at 11:14 pm \nFine but you appear to be making the assumption that these things are actually very harmful (without offering any real evidence). This is not the same thing as keeping an open mind. If you were keeping an open mind, we might expect to see a similar critical analysis of the case made by people who argue these things are in fact harmful. \nPersonally, I minimise use of mobile phones and microwaves and avoid GMO foods. A convincing case has still to be made that these things present significant dangers but why take the risk if it is not necessary to do so? However, let\u2019s at least try to be even-handed when assessing the evidence about these things and not start from a basic assumption that they are either harmful or harmless. 3 October 9th, 2017 at 1:16 pm \nHi TG \u2013 \nYou posted: \u201cyou appear to be making the assumption that these things are actually very harmful (without offering any real evidence).\u201d \nNot really. As far as evidence goes, see my earlier October 6th post below, that includes some references and links. And although it does seem clearly established that microwaves can cause significant harm, the degree to which they can cause harm at present remains unknown. \nThe industry, and our government, have made and successfully imposed the assumption that non-thermal levels of microwaves can not cause any biological effects, let alone cause harm. 40 years of peer reviewed, well controlled research studies, capped by the recent U.S. NTP study, have to my mind established beyond any reasonable doubt that low level microwaves can and do cause harm. \nHow harmful? That seems the point \u2013 nobody really knows because the necessary research studies \u2013 looking not just as whether microwaves can cause cancer, but at a whole multitude of potentially harmful effects \u2013 have never taken place. And as I posted above, \u201cabsence of evidence,\u201d (no studies funded or published) and \u201cevidence of absence\u201d (published studies demonstrating the absence of an effect) do not seem at all the same thing. \nAnd the few independent studies, not funded by corporate interests, including epidemiological studies, that have demonstrated biological effects, even harmful effects, all have become pretty much obsolete, because they looked at microwaves frequencies and exposures far lower that those we currently have today. \nAs far as safety goes, with respect to chemicals we ask \u201cWhat kind of chemical?\u201d and \u201cWhat level of exposure?\u201d before deciding what seems safe and what doesn\u2019t. A new drug has to undergo a rigorous set of safety tests before making it to market, and nothing like this takes place with regard to exposing the public to different and higher microwave frequencies and levels of exposure. All of this based on the now disproved theory promoted by the industry and accepted by the government that athermal levels of microwaves can not cause harm, and therefore we do not need to do any safety tests. \nTo me it does not seem an unreasonable assumption that given the now established fact that low levels of microwave exposures at lower microwave frequencies do have biological effects, and can at least cause some degree of harm, that given how dose response works, that exponentially increasing public exposures \u2013 including higher untested frequencies \u2013 most likely will cause even even greater harm? \nAnd that a certain degree of caution, and the funding of a wide range of safety studies, should take place before exposing the public to this kind of potential risk? \nTo me this seems a potential disaster waiting to happen, and while I hope it won\u2019t, as far a microwave exposure goes, cell phones just seem one part of the problem. Environmental microwave exposures from a multitude of other devices and sources \u2013 such as routers, blu-tooth phones, laptops, smart meters, smart devices, etc. can easily contribute just as much or more as cell phones do. \nAnd it looks like limiting use of these devices as a solution has already become unworkable for any other than a few dedicated individuals. \nCheck out: \n\u201cAmericans devote more than 10 hours a day to screen time, and growing\u201d http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/30/health/americans-screen-time-nielsen/index.html \nand \n\u201cCell-Phone Addiction: A Review\u201d https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5076301/ 0 October 8th, 2017 at 12:50 pm \nI think your argument jumps to an unjustified conclusion. I worked for a government science agency (operated in all 50 states) in which part of our funding came from contracts with advocates. They gave us money with the understanding that we published what we found no matter what it said. Our publication process included colleagues as well as anonymous peers, and publication decisions were based entirely on the reviews. The main criticism we got was that we were slow to publish. I am not defending WHO. I am willing, however, to give them the benefit of the doubt. 4 \nInteresting video. Am wondering if there are any similar studies out there on men who regularly use electric shavers and any harmful effects associated with their regular use. 0 \nMakes sense that this might be of concern. 0 \nA Danish study found no risk for using cell phones. 1 October 6th, 2017 at 8:19 pm \nWe are commonly exposed to radiation from many different sources.

October 7th, 2017 at 2:20 pm \nI highly doubt \u201cthat you have read\u201d that they are worse, your cellphone might be a little carcinogenic because you are holding it directly against your head on one side, and the machine has to send a signal on the other side all the way towards the nearest cell towers which can be several kilometers away. To reach that far the signal has to be relativly intensive, not in itself, that it why at the hands it doesn\u2019t matter but in combination with the proximity towards your brain. \nThat is why the video recommends waiting for a while after you have dialed so that the connection is already set with the cell tower when you start holding it directly towards your head. That is why calling in a car is worse because the phone\u2019s signal has to send a stronger continuous signal because of your changing location of the car. \nWhen you use bluetooth things will be better, the bluetooth signal is being send a couple of meters at the most. Also remember things might be more carcinogenic for one person vs the other person, someone eating a WFPB diet with lots of antioxidants guarding the DNA will have different impact on the system. 1 October 6th, 2017 at 12:53 pm \nRF safety (radio frequency radiation safety) is now a part of the FCC rules and licensing process for Amateur Radio operators-mostly because we use much more power and can experience unhealthy fields of radiation simply from the feedlines and antennae, depending on type and installation. We might use 5, 50, or 1,500 watts of power depending on the frequencies, mode and nature of the contact. \nCell phones operate at a tiny fractions of these levels and are mostly on different frequencies (some hams use those frequencies too-and it\u2019s the higher frequencies that present more risks). Microwave ovens use similar frequencies too. \nProximity is the problem with cell phones. Slapping a transmitter and antenna right up to your head is particular to cell-phones and cordless phones(remember those?). Any time you can get the transmitter away from your face, the less exposure you\u2019ll get. Or space is saturated with broadcast and commercial and fire/safety/ham radios, tv, gps, cell phones, and every \u201cwireless\u201d device extant. The lack of wires is overcome by radio signals transmitted and received. \nKeep your head away the transmitters-as much as you can to reduce cranial penetration of the micro and other waves in the RF spectrum. 11 \nThis video and your comments leave me wondering if this is somehow the way the embassy personnel in Cuba were attacked and suffered illness. 4 October 6th, 2017 at 8:18 pm \nWhatever it was, the locales (off-site hotels in wealthy by local standards residential neighborhoods) and descriptions of symptoms resemble personal problems with the local water more than any directed attack. \nOne can induce GI distress and headaches with subsonic, inaudible frequencies. However, to produce these frequencies requires rather massive drivers, the sounds themselves are omnidirectional and affect any operators or bystanders equally, and are liable to cause structural cracks to masonry. We now have decades of history of certain rave sound system operators with considerable resources attempting to produce the so-called \u201c brown notes \u201d (frequencies so low they could make partiers s**t themselves), and they haven\u2019t. I rather doubt an impoverished island nation could. 3 October 6th, 2017 at 8:50 pm \nI rather doubt an impoverished island nation could. \nYeah, my understanding is they do not think Cuba is the perp, but the U.S. is holding Cuba responsible for not protecting their embassy personnel. \nI remember reading some years ago about a Frenchman back during or just prior to WWI If memory serves, who was experimenting with concentrated sound as a weapon. He quit his quest when he almost killed himself and his assistant from the explosion when they were too close to the target. So yes, one can build something of this nature, probably inexpensively. 0 \nWhat about carrying it in your pocket? Has there been research on reproductive effects? 0 October 6th, 2017 at 1:00 pm \nThe phones are much less emissive in receive mode, as in your pocket. It\u2019s when they\u2019re transmitting voice signals that the most RF is generated. The more you talk, the more exposure. There are all sorts of apps that may require transmissions when you\u2019re not talking, so beware of that as well. \nAlso the Bluetooth type device may decrease the RF exposure because it only has to transmit as far as your phone-letting the phone carry the bulk of the work getting signals to the tower. But it is another transmitter. 5 October 8th, 2017 at 2:25 am \nSorry, I didn\u2019t see your post before. There\u2019s a later post that I made that refers to a review of such studies. Briefly, men shouldn\u2019t carry their phones in their trouser pockets (or anywhere else close to their genitals). 3 \nI think the main concern, based on the odds of getting \u201cC\u201d, should be to focus our attention here on what other harms cell phones are causing humans, such as attention span reduction, blood brain barrier depletion, IQ reduction, brain cell destroying \u2013 it is reported by some that these are all side effects of something going on inside the cell phone phone either due to radiation or some unknown \u2013 unnamed reaction that is harming human brains. Research on this kind of stuff, DR. G? 1 \n>>>other harms cell phones are causing humans, such as attention span reduction, blood brain barrier depletion, IQ reduction, brain cell destroying \u2013 it is reported by some that these are all side effects of something going on inside the cell phone phone \nDo you have any reliable sources for these claims? Blood brain barrier depletion? IQ reduction? Sorry, but I\u2019m a tad skeptical (although I almost never use a cell phone). 1 October 6th, 2017 at 9:56 pm \nHi David \u2013 \nFor once, I feel rather disappointed in this video, as to me it misses the most important point. The fact that low level athermal microwaves can cause DNA breakage and cancer \u2013 as the recent U.S. National Toxicology Program study demonstrated in rats \u2013 seems relatively unimpressive compared to the effect that other factors \u2013 such as eating the Standard American Diet \u2013 has on cancer incidence. \nBut whether microwaves can cause cancer does not seem the main issue \u2013 it simply serves to underscore the fact that microwaves at athermal levels CAN cause potentially harmful biological effects, something the industry has argued for over 40 years that they can not, based on a still widely held but now invalidtated theory, as it has allowed them to go forward full-speed ahead while exponentially increasing public exposure levels without doing any safety studies at all. \nThe industry has argued that any microwave exposure that does not cause cooking seems harmless \u2013 and therefore any exposure below that level seems safe. Many research studies have disproved this, demonstrating effects at microwaves well below the level needed for heating, but the industry has stuck to this position and their lobbyists have made sure that out government policy makers have as well. This despite the recent U.S government National Toxicology Program study demonstrating that microwaves at cell phone frequencies at very low exposure levels CAN cause cancer. See this article: https://www.wsj.com/articles/debate-renews-over-health-risks-from-cellphone-use-1467829289 that came out 7/7/16 in the Wall Street Journal, of all places, and makes exactly the point I made after the NTP study came out \u2013 that I had not seen brought up in any media reports, viz, that the NTP study has confirmed that microwaves can have non-thermal toxicological effects, that this DOES open the proverbial can of worms, with respect to all of the safety studies the microwave industry has NOT done, while exponentially increasing human exposure to microwaves at a wide variety of new and untested frequencies year after year. \nAs far as \u201cthe potential for more subtle, but potentially much more damaging health effects\u201d goes I\u2019d look to Salford\u2019s replicated results, showing leakage in the blood-brain barrier of rats two weeks after only ONE 2 hour exposure to 915 MHz: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19345073 (Incidentally, I calculated that an SAR of 0.12 mW/kg, where Salford began to detect leakage in the blood-brain barrier in rats, corresponds to about 15,000 microwatts/meter squared, well below the range of levels of exposure one would get in close proximity to most cell phones.) Rather than cancer, I would argue that it seems far more likely that microwave exposures may relate to increases cognitive dysfunctions, such as autism or early onset Alzheimers. With respect to Alzheimer\u2019s, an article published online in Radiology using special MRI software demonstrated the presence of leaky BBB and its association with early Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. (Link to full text and images: http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148/radiol.2016152244 ) \nI feel less than confident about the complete and truthful results on the NTP research ever becoming publicly available. Give the long time-delay between the completion of the NTP study, and its projected publication, the priorities of the current administration, and the clout of the cell phone industry, I think an edited and \u201cspun\u201d version seems much more likely. \nAnd also, different frequencies may have different effects, just as different chemicals have different effects. A study showing that one frequency \u2013 say 3.5 Ghz, does not have a particular effect does not say anything about whether another microwave frequency, say 5 GHz, will. Each needs to undergo testing separately. \nDoes light cause sunburn and DNA breakage? Well, while infrared light does not, ultraviolet light does. Whether \u201clight\u201d does depends on the frequency used and the intensity of exposure. The same applies to microwaves. \nA lecture on EMF\u2019s/microwaves by Dr. Martin L. Pall (a Professor Emeritus in Biochemistry and Medical Sciences from Washington State University) in which he summarizes relevant research: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8ATQF8omdI \nThough he goes quite a bit farther than I would, He crossed his t\u2019s and dotted his i\u2019s. I found his EMF/Microwave pathology thesis unfortunately both plausible and well-supported by scientific research. A lecture worth watching. You can also check oout his 2016 review, \u201cMicrowave frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) produce widespread neuropsychiatric effects including depression\u201d, published in the Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy, which has plenty of references that you can check out: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891061815000599 \nSome highlights: \nMicrowave EMFs activate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) concentrated in the brain. \nAnimal studies show such low level MWV EMFs have diverse high impacts in the brain. \nVGCC activity causes widespread neuropsychiatric effects in humans (genetic studies). \n26 studies have EMFs assoc. with neuropsychiatric effects; 5 criteria show causality. \nMWV EMFs cause at least 13 neuropsychiatric effects including depression in humans. 3", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dt greger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darryl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ellen vanderstarre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan hallett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin l. pall", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bill & melinda gates foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "african development bank group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glaxosmithkline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national toxicology program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vaccine alliance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ntp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national health service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national philanthropic trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un central emergency response fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg family foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. national toxicology program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un office for project service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "who", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fcc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wfpb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iarc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nih", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the world health organizations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novartis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "standard american diet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un population fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un programme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vgcc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un development programme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "journal of chemical neuroanatomy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wellcome trust", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cuba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T14:01:16.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "43e2dfdeb059907ff3865076e240ab7cdc6558c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlCQdCRtCfiQDHUL9IIVPM0aJd4qn1wtIETFSX_FjNmsWv6karW0tVlmsInNfaoArjA-", "site_full": "nutritionfacts.org", "site": "nutritionfacts.org", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "health", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "Is it Worth Getting Annual Health Check-Ups? | NutritionFacts.org", "title_full": "Is it Worth Getting Annual Health Check-Ups? | NutritionFacts.org", "published": "2017-10-09T14:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.016, "main_image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2017/10/38-12-Is-It-Worth-Getting-Annual-Health-Check-Ups-1200x675.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23349, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "43e2dfdeb059907ff3865076e240ab7cdc6558c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlCQdCRtCfiQDHUL9IIVPM0aJd4qn1wtIETFSX_FjNmsWv6karW0tVlmsInNfaoArjA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Greger M.D. Faclm", "published": "2017-10-09T14:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is it Worth Getting Annual Health Check-Ups? | NutritionFacts.org", "text": "Republishing \"Is it Worth Getting Annual Health Check-Ups?\" \u00d7 Terms \nYou may republish this material online or in print under our Creative Commons licence .

WjM October 9th, 2017 at 9:02 am \nWhile wanting to create a healthier food environment is all well and good, we know how hard it is to break bad habits. If I were asymptomatic and didn\u2019t get checkup, how would I know my BP, cholesterol, or blood sugar levels? Even if I were eating optimally, what if I had a genetic variant that caused something bad in me, wouldn\u2019t it be picked up or at least triggered in a checkup? 11 \nWE LOVE YOU DR. GREGER!!! 19 October 9th, 2017 at 4:05 pm \nI get what you\u2019re saying and we all want to be able to peek under the hood, don\u2019t we? But here\u2019s my question. If you found that your cholesterol was high, or your fasting blood sugar, or your blood pressure, what would your first choice of action be? Would those \u201chard to break\u201d habits become easier to address? Why not eat optimally now? Most communities offer easy, even free, access to cholesterol and blood sugar testing, and every drug store has a blood pressure check station. But why not do everything you would do to be optimally well and healthy from the get-go? The odds that you have some undetected genetic anomaly as an adult are exceedingly slim; that likelihood certainly won\u2019t increase from one year to the next, so an annual checkup doesn\u2019t factor in at all. In a risk-benefit analysis, the risks of participating in the current medical model far outweigh the benefits outside of trauma or acute, emergent illness. If I break a bone or develop a serious infection, that\u2019s something we deal with pretty well. A yearly exam to look for trouble tends to benefit pharmaceutical companies and compromise patients. 12 October 9th, 2017 at 10:09 pm \nBecause I went in for a yearly physical check up my doctor was able to hear a bruit or a swishing noise with her stethoscope while placed over my carotid artery. This led me to doing a sonogram of the carotids and it showed that I had blockage. If it were not for the detection of this carotid artery disease by my doctor during a yearly check up I would have never known and might have died. Because I was given this diagnosis I was able to do research on the internet and discovered Dr. Esselstyn, Dr. Greger, Dr. McDougal, and many others which led me to the intervention of adopting a whole food plant diet. Thank God for a yearly medical check up. 7 October 9th, 2017 at 4:38 pm \nWjM, I think the point is that if you *were* experiencing a problem, then you *would* go see a doctor. The question is whether, if you are *not* experiencing a problem, the benefit of a periodic battery of standard tests exceeds the potential risks. \nBut I have to admit that I\u2019m not entirely convinced by this video either. It seems possible that if a person *is* taking responsibility for his/her own health \u2014 eating well, getting exercise, etc. \u2014 then some of the downsides are absent. I think too that there is a spectrum of willingness to be treated among patients which runs from total aversion all the way to a strong desire to be treated, and that the extremes make doctor visits problematic. \nI suspect that if you were to consider only people who take care of themselves and have realistic expectations of and misgivings about modern medicine, then periodic standard testing would not appear to be quite so problematic. 1 \nYour body know and is self diagnosis then \u201cgiving\u201d you symptoms~ 2 October 10th, 2017 at 6:55 am \nI agree. And if we are good at following our intuition, we\u2019ll know when we are \u201cnudged\u201d to get a checkup. Our cells, which are very much alive and eager to please, should be thanked for doing a good job at keeping us healthy. :-) 3 \nCould you please post a link to the sources 1 \nMiguel, please click on the \u201cSources Cited\u201d tab directly under the video. 4 \nI did, on 3 different browsers, even with my extensions disabled, it\u2019s not there Found the one I was looking for -> http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0148607116685049 2 \nMiguel is right, the sources seem to be missing on this page. 3 \nSo sorry about that\u2013must be a glitch. Working on it now! 10 \nfixed\u2013thank you so much for bringing it to our attention! 11 \nThere is a link to sources, it is just below the video above. 0 October 9th, 2017 at 9:20 am \nIf this is your first video, or first week of Nutrition Facts exposure, please do read the doctor\u2019s notes and note all the supporting/relevant videos he lists there. Also note that the archive is fully searchable and that all sources are listed for YOU to be able to read the reports yourself and answer many of your other questions. \nThere is no prohibition against discussion of dissenting ideas and positions but please realize that this site is about the nutrition facts as found by the latest research, and OFTEN these things will be somewhat different from mainstream and popular belief and thoughts. Also that facts are subject to change depending upon findings, and that nutritional research is a difficult task for many reasons. \nMost common questions and conflicts on very many subjects have been previously addressed and can be found, along with the supporting studies and discussion if one will simply take a few minutes to look for them. \nWe are glad to have you here with open mind and ready palate. WFPB works for so many of us, and works well! We hope to support your transition and create a tide of change. Thanks for stopping in. 12 \nExcept in an emergency, I avoid doctors. They feel they always have to find SOMEthing wrong. In Dr. Pam Popper\u2019s most recent book, I think she said she hadn\u2019t had a checkup in 19 years. 9 October 9th, 2017 at 1:56 pm \nAnd when they do find something \u201cwrong,\u201d they often prescribe an ineffective and even harmful drug to \u201cfix\u201d it. \nLink to a Nature news article (I\u2019d rate Nature as the most preeminent and most reliable scientific journals in the world.) that has that rather astounding chart on the amazing ineffectiveness of the top ten highest grossing pharmaceutical drugs: \nhttp://www.nature.com/news/personalized-medicine-time-for-one-person-trials-1.17411 \nI made a print optimized version of the rather astounding NNT (Number Needed to Treat for one person to get a beneficial effect) Chart as a jpeg file, so that I can easily share this information with others. \nIn the case of many of these drugs, they have proven records of shortening life while at the same time doing a very poor job of suppressing symptoms, and no evidence at all of them actually curing a disease, something quite different than suppressing symptoms. \nThe chart does seem a bit of an eye-opener. I wish every patient received a copy of this, as well as of the NNT\u2019s and NNH\u2019s of the drugs a doctor prescribes for them so they could make better informed decisions about whether to take them or not. (And if doctor\u2019s had NNT\u2019s and NNH\u2019s, easily to hand, ethical doctors could make more informed choices about whether to prescribe them or not . . . ) And as far as ruining the placebo effect goes, even placebos work poorly or not at all for drugs that seem intrinsically harmful. \nAnd as far as informed consent goes, it seems fair that doctors who actually care about the well-being of their patients in fact should to tell their patients of the likelihood of a particular drug helping them, by giving them the NNT, while also giving them information on the likelihood of a drug harming them, the NNH \u2013 and in what ways \u2013 so they can make an informed choice. For an older woman who seems a potential candidate for statins, letting them know research indicates it has a 1/50 chance of it helping her, and a 1/3 chance of it giving her diabetes ( http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/877626?src=wnl_mdplsnews_170324_mscpedit_wir&uac=66042FN&impID=1315045&faf=1 ), as well as significant odds of causing cognitive impairment, memory loss, and cataracts. \nWhat a world. October 9th, 2017 at 9:32 pm \nI think you have posted this argument before. It is not unreasonable but, on the other hand, it is not an issue that has escaped the medical profession either. \nOn lipid modification and statins for example, in the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines require doctors to advise patients on absolute risk (NNT), adverse effects etc. The guidelines include a whole chapter on communication of risk just as they have a whole chapter on a cardioprotective diet and another chapter on lifestyle modifications. Similarly, NICE has a separate guideline on patient communication in general in cluding discussion or risk. Similarly, guidelines re statin use also consider the side effects of statin use and make recommendations about whether statin use is of net bebenfit or not. The study of older women. statin use and T2D is interesting but did not discuss rates of cardiovascular events in older women who took statins versus women who did not take statins. We do not know if those women taking statins had fewer adverse events than women not taking statins. Without that information, how can one judge whether the invcrteased risk of T\u201dD was ana cceptable risk or not. \nPersonally, I am very sceptical of anti-statin arguments. They usually ignore certain crucial facts. I would encourage people to read the relevant US, UK and European guidelines (anbd Cochrane reviews) before making a decision and not just rely on the glib arguments of anti statin crusaders. I am very grateful to statins. They were prescribed for me 20 years ago but gave me liver damage so I had to discontinue them. It was that event which led me to researching and adopting a WFPB diet. That is by far the best solution. But for people who will not do this, statins may be suitable and helpful. 0 October 9th, 2017 at 10:16 pm \nUseful NNT/NNH website: http://www.thennt.com/home-nnt/ \n\u201cQuick summaries of evidence-based medicine. We are a group of physicians that have developed a framework and rating system to evaluate therapies based on their patient-important benefits and harms as well as a system to evaluate diagnostics by patient sign, symptom, lab test or study. We only use the highest quality, evidence-based studies (frequently, but not always Cochrane Reviews), and we accept no outside funding or advertisements.\u201d \nTwo links to NNTs for statins, for those with no known heart disease, and those with known heart disease: October 10th, 2017 at 6:14 am \nThanks. I have seen this website before. However, I have reservations about it. Itt seems to omit certain relevant data and present some figures for adverse side effects which are apparently not actual figures but estimates by the website owners. \nFor example, when the NNT site looks at adverse events prevented it considers only mortality, heart attacks and strokes. These are very important but the Cochrane reviews and eg UK NICE assessment also took into account the number of revascularisation and angioplasty surgeries prevented. Obviously, this will result in quite different totals for the number of people benefitting from statins. \nAs I noted above, the number of new diabetes cases seems to be an estimate by the author rather than an actual figure. There may also be some doubt about the muscle damage figures presented on this site. The site does not mention, for example, studies that show that people unaware that they are taking statins do not report increased muscle pain \u201cA contested issue is the rate of muscle pain and weakness, with observational studies in general practice finding that up to a fifth of patients report symptoms, with little to no increase identified in randomised trials.\u201d and \u201cWhen patients were unaware they were taking statins there was no reported increase in muscle-related symptoms. But, when patients knew they were taking a statin, they were more likely to report symptoms, a finding consistent with the nocebo effect.\u201d The lead author commented \u201cWe know that statins can prevent a significant number of heart attacks and strokes. We know there is a small increase in the risk of diabetes, and at high doses there is a very small increase in myopathy, but overall the benefits greatly outweigh the harms. Widespread claims of high rates of statin intolerance still prevent too many people from taking an affordable, safe  saving medication.\u201d https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170502204933.htm \nThe third and most glaring omission from this site also concerns side effects. It happily and uncritically discusses adverse side effects. real or not, but makes no mention of beneficial side effects. For example, in your post you quoted the Nature.com article. The first and possibly most important reference from that article notes benefits of statins for dementia risk reduction \u201cThus, normal individuals with the apo \u03f54 allele should be aggressively treated with statins not only to prevent cardiovascular events but also to reduce risk of dementia.\u201d \nhttp://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/060111p32.shtml \nIn short, I do not see the NNT site as a reliable source of information. It omits key information and appears \u2013 well \u2013 biased. I do not want to appear as a defender of statins \u2013 they gave me extremely unpleasant liver damage (imagine being seasick 24 hours a day for months on end, and you will have some idea) \u2013 but let\u2019s assess the information (all the information) honestly. I will continue to rely on clinical guidelines and Cochrane reviews for credible information on statins until new and better information comes along. Unreliable websites purporting to provide unbiased information about statins by individuals who are in fact dedicated anti-statin crusaders may prevent many people taking these drugs who could obtain significant benefit from them. 1 October 10th, 2017 at 11:51 am \nEveryone has the right to make their own judgments, based on the information they have available to them, and the degree of trust that they have with respect to the sources that provide the information, and the degree to which they have the ability to accurately separate \u201cthe wheat from the chaff.\u201d \nAs far as the NNT group goes, they describe themselves as \u201ca group of physicians that have developed a framework and rating system to evaluate therapies based on their patient-important benefits and harms as well as a system to evaluate diagnostics by patient sign, symptom, lab test or study.\u201d who use \u201conly use the highest quality, evidence-based studies (frequently, but not always Cochrane Reviews), and we accept no outside funding or advertisements. with an advisory board consisting of objective individuals who have no financial ties to corporate interests.\u201d Even if one assumes that this seems true, and I have no reason to doubt it, I still find it probable that they significantly overestimate the effectiveness of the drugs that they rate. \nWhy? Because the objectivity of the scientific literature itself has become heavily compromised, and not just through the inclusion of corporate funded studies designed to produce a specific result, but through a variety of different mechanisms. \nDr. John Ioannidis, a professor at Stanford University, summed up the situation as follows: \u201cThere is increasing concern that in modern research, false findings may be the majority or even the vast majority of published research claims. However, this should not be surprising. It can be proven that most claimed research findings are false.\u201d (Ioannidis, J.P.A., (2005) \u201cWhy Most Published Research Findings Are False,\u201d PLoS Medicine, 2(8), pp 0696 \u2013 0701, August. http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124&type=printable ) \nFor a detailed description of how published scientific research has become compromised, read the article. \nDr. Richard Horton, the current editor-in-chief of The Lancet, perhaps the most respected peer-reviewed medical journal in the world, agreed. He wrote: \u201cThe case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness.\u201d (Horton, R. (2015) \u201cOffline: What is medicines\u2019 5 sigma?\u201d, The Lancet 385 (9976) p 1380, April 11 http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60696-1/fulltext?rss%25253Dyes ) \u201c \nEven if one assumes that the NNT group has done the best they can with respect to sorting out the evidence as to what degree different drugs have beneficial as well as harmful effects, they work with a stacked deck. Published studies, designed to show a particular result, from corporate interests that have money to burn dominate the literature, while independent researchers go begging for money, and should they happen to scrape up enough money to at least fund a small study, find their work discounted or ignored specifically because they did small studies, and because the majority of well funded studies \u2013 funded or influenced by corporate interests \u2013 present contradictory results. And many mainstream scientists \u2013 not funded by corporate interests \u2013 fall for it, which not only results in publication bias, but in a further lack of funding for studies that go against what a majority of scientists may believe, with respect to the effectiveness of pharmaceutical drugs. \nWith respect to published medical research, especially medical research in which corporate interests have a strong interest with respect to which kind of information comes to light, caveat emptor has unfortunately become an indispensable principle. \nIn the early days of computing, the phrase \u201c\u201dgarbage in garbage out\u201d (GIGO) became deservedly popular. Feed false information into a computer, no matter how advanced, and false conclusions will come out. Garbage in, garbage out applies not just to computers, but to humans. Intentional frauds routinely perpetrated by the pharmaceutical industry, from which the FDA has failed to protect us ( see for example http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa065779#t=article ), added to numerous other problems in scientific research has undoubtedly and unfortunately filled the heads of today\u2019s medical professionals with a great deal of garbage. \nWe unfortunately now live in a post-truth world. Invalid but compelling misinformation has become increasingly abundant, and trustworthy information has become ever harder to find. Developing effective ways of enhancing our ability to discriminate between the two, through tuning into our own inner guidance, becomes increasingly important. As Dr. Greger has pointed out, research into the effects of diet and lifestyle have made it clear that our bodies have an incredible ability to heal, so long as we give them what they need to heal, and so long as we stop doing what makes them sick. Of course, in practice this can prove rather tricky, as many people don\u2019t have a clue to what their bodies need to heal, and have become sadly out of touch with respect to what they\u2019ve done that made them sick. 3", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "greger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "society for general internal medicine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T03:26:21.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "753a69ead10e5da964d00eb6290b226b4c451353", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2sXsDupUmNE3G2aQabsHpVnddtBQKbRwWdATv30kvE84d3vsN8A.SBGYhBuvfBJhn69XsTOX1oPo-", "site_full": "nutritionfacts.org", "site": "nutritionfacts.org", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "health", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "Chocolate is Finally Put to the Test | NutritionFacts.org", "title_full": "Chocolate is Finally Put to the Test | NutritionFacts.org", "published": "2017-10-10T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.078, "main_image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2017/10/Oct-10-Chocolate-1200x675.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23349, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "753a69ead10e5da964d00eb6290b226b4c451353", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2sXsDupUmNE3G2aQabsHpVnddtBQKbRwWdATv30kvE84d3vsN8A.SBGYhBuvfBJhn69XsTOX1oPo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Written", "published": "2017-10-10T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Chocolate is Finally Put to the Test | NutritionFacts.org", "text": "  Chocolate is Finally Put to the Test Image Credit: Rachael Gorjestani / Unsplash.   Chocolate is Finally Put to the Test   10th, 2017 \nBotanically speaking, seeds are small embryonic plants\u2014the whole plant stuffed into a tiny seed and surrounded by an outer layer packed with vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals to protect the seedling plant\u2019s DNA from free radicals. No wonder they\u2019re so healthy. By seeds, using the formal definition, we\u2019re talking all whole grains; grains are seeds\u2014you plant them and they grow. Nuts are just dry fruits with one or two seeds. Legumes (beans, peas, and lentils) are seeds, too, as are cocoa and coffee beans. So, finding health-promoting effects in something like cocoa or coffee should not be all that surprising. There is substantial evidence that increased consumption of all these little plants is associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease. \nOf course, much of chocolate research is just on how to get consumers to eat more . While it didn\u2019t seem to matter what kind of music people were listening to when it came to the flavor intensity, pleasantness, or texture of a bell pepper, people liked chocolate more when listening to jazz than classical, rock, or hip hop. Why is this important? So food industries can \u201cintegrate specific musical stimuli\u201d in order to maximize their profits. For example, purveyors may play jazz in the background to increase consumers\u2019 acceptance of their chocolates. Along these lines, another study demonstrated that people rated the oyster eaten \u201cmore pleasant in the presence of the \u2018sound of the sea\u2019 than in the presence of \u2018farmyard noises.\u2019\u201d \nYou\u2019d think chocolate would just sell itself, given that it\u2019s considered the most commonly craved food in the world. The same degree of interest doesn\u2019t seem to exist as to whether or not Brussels sprouts might provide similar cardiovascular protection. So, it\u2019s understandable to hope chocolate provides health benefits. Meanwhile, despite their known benefits, Brussels sprouts don\u2019t get the love they deserve. \nOne of the potential downsides of chocolate is weight gain, which is the subject of my Does Chocolate Cause Weight Gain? video. Though cocoa hardly has any calories, chocolate is one of the most calorie-dense foods. For example : A hundred calories of chocolate is less than a quarter of a bar, compared to a hundred calories of strawberries, which is more than two cups.. \nA few years ago, a study funded by the National Confectioners Association\u2014an organization that, among other things, runs the website voteforcandy.com\u2014reported that Americans who eat chocolate weigh, on average, four pounds less than those who don\u2019t. But maybe chocolate-eaters exercise more or eat more fruits and vegetables. The researchers didn\u2019t control for any of that. \nThe findings of a more recent study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine were less easy to dismiss and there were no apparent ties to Big Chocolate. The researchers reported that out of a thousand men and women they studied in San Diego, those who frequently consumed chocolate had a lower BMI\u2014actually weighed less\u2014than those who ate chocolate less often. And, this was even after adjusting for physical activity and diet quality. But, it was a cross-sectional study, meaning a snapshot in time; so, you can\u2019t prove cause and effect. Maybe not eating chocolate leads to being fatter, or maybe being fatter leads to not eating chocolate. Maybe people who are overweight are trying to cut down on sweets. What we need is a study in which people are followed over time. \nThere was no such prospective study, until now. More than 10,000 people were followed for six years, and a chocolate habit was associated with long-term weight gain in a dose-response manner. This means the greatest weight gain over time was seen in those with the highest frequency of chocolate intake. It appears the reason the cross-sectional studies found the opposite is that subjects diagnosed with obesity-related illnesses tended to reduce their intake of things like chocolate in an attempt to improve their prognosis. This explains why heavier people may, on average, eat less chocolate. \nTo bolster this finding came the strongest type of evidence\u2014an interventional trial \u2014in which you split people up into two groups and change half their diets. Indeed, adding four squares of chocolate to peoples\u2019 daily diets does appear to add a few pounds. \nSo, what do we tell our patients? In 2013, researchers wrote in the American Family Physician journal that \u201cbecause many cocoa products are high in sugar and saturated fat, family physicians should refrain from recommending cocoa\u2026.\u201d That\u2019s a little patronizing, though. You can get the benefits of chocolate without any sugar or fat by adding cocoa powder to a smoothie, for example. Too often, doctors think patients can\u2019t handle the truth. Case in point : If your patients inquire, one medical journal editorial suggests, ask them what type of chocolate they prefer. If they respond with milk chocolate, then it is best to answer that it is not good for them. If the answer is dark chocolate, then you can lay out the evidence. \nEven better than dark chocolate would be cocoa powder, which contains the phytonutrients without the saturated fat. I\u2019ve happily (and deliciously) created other videos on cocoa and chocolate; so, check out Update on Chocolate , Healthiest Chocolate Fix , A Treatment for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome , and Dark Chocolate and Artery Function . \nWhether with Big Candy, Big Chocolate, or some other player, you always have to be careful about conflict of interest.

First, we must educate patients about preventive practices of proven [versus] unproven benefit.\u201d For example, \u201c[t]he only [routine] blood test currently recommended by the USPSTF [the official preventive medicine guidelines-setting body] is cholesterol.\u201d \nThe reason \u201cwhy many physicians continue to perform annual examinations of patients\u2019 hearts, lungs, abdomens, and even reflexes, and continue to order some of [those] tests that have been proven ineffectual or even harmful\u201d is because otherwise, the patient might leave unsatisfied with the visit. \u201cEvidence suggests that the more\u2026physical and laboratory examinations they perform, the better patients feel.\u201d So, they\u2019re like \u201cplacebo\u2026manoeuvres.\u201d \n\u201cBut rather than performing unnecessary [or worse] exams\u2026and\u2026tests, perhaps physicians should spend some of the time saved by telling their patients why they are not\u201d going to just go through the motions, like some witch doctor. \n\u201cMost important, we need to educate ourselves about the dangers of overdiagnosis. There will always remain a small possibility that our exam\u2026might detect some silent, potentially deadly cancer or aneurysm [or something]. Unfortunately for our patients, these serendipitous, life-saving events are much less common than the false-positive findings that lead to invasive and potentially life-threatening tests.\u201d \nThis Cleveland Clinic doc shared a story about his own father, who went in for a \u201ccheckup.\u201d Can\u2019t hurt, right? The doctor thought he felt what might have been an \u201caortic aneurism;\u201d so, he \u201cordered an abdominal ultrasound.\u201d Can\u2019t hurt, right? Aorta was fine, but hmm, something looked \u201csuspicious\u201d on his pancreas; so, \u201ca CT scan\u201d was ordered. That can hurt: lots of radiation. But thankfully, his pancreas looked fine. But hey\u2014what\u2019s that on his liver? Oh, for goodness sake. Looked like cancer, which made a certain amount of sense, having worked in the chemical industry. So, realizing how ineffective the treatments were for liver cancer, he realized he was going to die. \nThe daughter was not ready to give up on him, though; \u201cconvinced him to see a specialist.\u201d Maybe, if they could cut it out, he could live at least a few more years. But first, they had to do a biopsy. And, the good news was, no cancer. The bad news, though, it was a benign mass of blood vessels; and so, when they stuck a needle in it, \u201che almost bled to death.\u201d Ten units of blood is like all you have. Pain, and so morphine, and so urinary retention, and so catheter; yet, thankfully, no infection. Just a bill for $50,000. \n\u201cThe frustrating thing\u201d is that the whole horrible sequence wasn\u2019t like malpractice or anything; every step logically led to the next. \u201cThe only way to have prevented this [life-threatening] outcome would have been to dispense with [that] initial physical exam\u201d\u2014the one that couldn\u2019t hurt, right? \n\u201cWhy, then, do we continue to examine healthy patients?\u201d Well, first of all, it\u2019s because \u201cwe get paid to do it.\u201d His dad\u2019s initial doc only got a hundred bucks or so, but just think of all that \u201cdownstream revenue\u201d for the hospital and all the specialists.

Weinberg / Flickr.   What a Single Fatty Meal Can Do to Our Arteries   12th, 2017 \nThe phenomenon of postprandial angina was described more than 200 years ago: chest pain that occurs after a meal, even if you\u2019re just sitting down and resting. This could be intuitively attributed to redistribution of blood flow away from the heart to the gut during digestion. However, such a mechanism could not be demonstrated experimentally. \nThe problem appears to be within the coronary arteries themselves. The clue came in 1955 when researchers found they could induce angina in people with heart disease just by having them drink fat. My video Fatty Meals May Impair Artery Function includes a fascinating graph of so-called lactescence, or milkiness, over time. It shows how their blood became increasingly milky with fat over the next five hours, and each of the ten attacks of angina was found to occur about four-and-a-half to five hours after the fatty meal, right when blood milkiness was at or near its peak. After a nonfat meal with the same bulk and calories, but made out of starch, sugar, and protein, no anginal pain was elicited in any of the patients. \nTo understand how the mere presence of fat in the blood can affect blood flow to the heart, we need to understand the endothelium, the inner lining of all of our blood vessels. Our arteries are not just rigid pipes; they are living, breathing organs that actively dilate or constrict, thinning or thickening the blood and releasing hormones, depending on what\u2019s needed. This is all controlled by the single inner layer, the endothelium, which makes it the body\u2019s largest endocrine (hormone-secreting) organ. When it\u2019s all gathered up, the endothelium weighs a total of three pounds and has a combined surface area of 700 square yards. \nWe used to think the endothelium was just an inert layer lining our vascular tree, but now we know better : Researchers found that low-fat meals tend to improve endothelial function, whereas high-fat meals tend to worsen it. This goes for animal fat, as well as isolated plant fats, such as sunflower oil. But, maybe it\u2019s just the digestion of fat rather than the fat itself? Our body can detect the presence of fat in the digestive tract and release a special group of hormones and enzymes. Researchers tried feeding people fake fat and found that the real fat deprived the heart of blood while the fake fat didn\u2019t. Is our body really smart enough to tell the difference? \nA follow-up study settled the issue.

Maybe one in ten kids have it, and about 3% of adults, where you get patches of red, itchy skin. Topical steroids, like cortisone cream, is \u201cthe mainstay of treatment\u201d since its Nobel Prize winning discovery in 1950. \nPeople are scared of steroids, though. It\u2019s \u201cnot uncommon for patients to express irrational fear and anxiety about using\u201d steroid creams and ointments\u2014a \u201cphobia\u201d that may arise from confusing topical steroids with oral or injected steroids, which have different effects. Really potent topical steroids can thin your skin, but skin thickness should return to normal a month after stopping. So yes, it can cause side effects, but the concern people have \u201cseems out of proportion\u201d to the small risk they pose. Still, okay, if there\u2019s a way you can resolve a problem without drugs, that\u2019s generally preferable. What did they do for eczema before the 1950s? \nWell, in the 30s, some researchers tried using vitamin D dissolved in corn oil, and to their surprise, it worked\u2014but so did the corn oil alone, without the vitamin D that they were using as a control. Others reported cases improving after feeding flaxseed oil\u2014or even lard! The \u201cNational Live Stock and Meat Board\u201d did not want to be left out of the action. The problem is that none of these studies had a control group. So yeah, feeding someone corn oil for 12 to 18 months, and they get better; but, maybe they   anyway. You don\u2019t know until you put it to the test. \nAll these researchers that claimed benefit from the use of various fats apparently lacked \u201cany great interest\u201d in doing controlled studies. But, not this researcher, who tried out some oils, and found no evidence of benefit over routine treatment. Most got better either way, which suggests that the previous \u201cbenefits claimed may [have just been] due to the usual treatment, with perhaps a dash of enthusiasm.\u201d \nBy then, hydrocortisone was out, and so, the medical community gave up on dietary approaches, until this letter was published in 1981 about the treatment of eczema with supplements of evening primrose oil, which contains gamma linolenic acid, an anti-inflammatory omega-6. And indeed, when it was put to the test, it seemed to help. But then, a subsequent larger study found no effect. \nWhenever there are conflicting findings, it helps to do a meta-analysis, where you put all the studies together. There was the study that showed benefit, the one that didn\u2019t, and then seven other studies, and seven out of the seven showed benefit. And so: \u201cThe results show that the effects of [some brand of primrose oil supplement was] almost always significantly better than\u2026placebo.\u201d Case closed, right? \nWell, the analysis was funded by the supplement company itself, which can be a red flag. Where exactly were these other seven studies published? They weren\u2019t. The company just said they did these studies, but never released them. And, when they were asked to hand them over, they said they would, but never did\u2014even threatening a lawsuit against researchers who dared question their supplements\u2019 efficacy. \nAn independent review failed to find evidence that evening primrose oil or borage oil worked better than placebo. And so: \u201cAs we bid goodnight to the evening primrose oil story, perhaps we [will] awaken to a world where all clinical trial data\u2026reach the light of day.\u201d \nBorage oil actually has twice the gamma linolenic acid as evening primrose oil, and still didn\u2019t work. But, that didn\u2019t stop researchers from trying hempseed oil, which has evidently been used as a food and medicine for thousands of years. They tried giving about a quarter-cup of hemp seeds\u2019 worth of oil to people every day for a few months and found significant improvements in skin dryness, itchiness, and the need for medications\u2014but not compared to placebo. \nIn fact, dietary supplements across the board, whether \u201cfish oil, zinc, selenium, vitamin D, \u2026E, [or] \u2026B6, sea buckthorn oil, hempseed, [or] sunflower oil,\u2026overall, no convincing evidence that taking supplements improved\u2026eczema.\u201d \nThat\u2019s disappointing, but wait a second\u2014that\u2019s just for oral supplements. What about natural remedies applied topically?

One was licorice root. Smearing on a placebo gel didn\u2019t appear to help much with clearing redness or itchiness after one week or two weeks, but a 1% licorice gel, and especially a 2% gel, did seem to clear the symptoms in most patients. They conclude that \u201clicorice extract could be considered\u2026an effective [eczema treatment] agent.\u201d \nThe other successful trial was with St. John\u2019s wort cream, showing a reduction in eczema severity scores week by week superior to that of placebo. So, it works better than nothing, but the question is: Does it work better than drugs, better than topical steroids? That we don\u2019t know. Sometimes, the drugs don\u2019t work, though: so-called \u201crecalcitrant\u201d atopic dermatitis. So, these researchers in Japan asked patients to try drinking four cups of oolong tea every day for a month, and most patients \u201cshowed marked [or at least] moderate improvement,\u201d starting after one or two weeks, and then, most remained better even five months after they stopped. The problem is that there was no control group. So, we don\u2019t know how many would have gotten better on their own. But, since drinking tea is healthy anyway, why not give it a try? \nBack to topical treatments: a vitamin B12 cream beat out the same cream, without the B12. Most of the patients and doctors rated the results of the B12 cream as good; better than they rated the placebo cream. \nRegardless of what topical agent you use, steroid or otherwise, \u201c[f]irst and foremost, though, it is essential that the skin barrier [be] protected and maintained with the use of emollients,\u201d meaning moisturizers, \u201cideally\u2026once or twice\u201d a day, especially right after showering, to lock in the moisture. Petroleum jelly, like Vaseline, is highly effective, but it\u2019s kind of greasy and messy. What about something like coconut oil, which is less greasy? It was found to improve skin dryness, though no better than mineral oil, which is cheaper. Is mineral oil safe, though? \nExposure to mineral oil was found to be associated with rheumatoid arthritis, but that was occupational exposure to industrial mineral oils, like hydraulic fluid. The same group of researchers subsequently found that cosmetic-grade mineral oil did not seem to carry the same risk. In general, topically applied mineral oil shouldn\u2019t present any health risk. \nThat doesn\u2019t mean you can safely inject it into your penis, as that \u201cmay have devastating cosmetic and sexual function consequences.\u201d There is, however, one good use for mineral oil on the penis, and that\u2019s for \u201cpenile zipper entrapment.\u201d\u201cThe skin of the [penis] is susceptible to entrapment in the zipper of careless young boys, particularly those who fail to wear undergarments. Understandably, this mishap provokes distress in the unfortunate victim, in his parents, and ultimately in the healthcare provider charged with the task of liberating the organ.\u201d A recommended textbook approach is surgery, believe it or not, but just liberally dose with some mineral oil and you can just slip the zipper off, minimizing trauma for all involved parties. \nBut, just because it works as well as coconut oil for dry skin, doesn\u2019t mean it works as well for eczema. Head-to-head, topical virgin coconut oil works better than topical mineral oil at decreasing eczema severity, with twice as many children experiencing an excellent response after two months\u2019 treatment. \u201cThus, among pediatric patients with mild to moderate [eczema], topical application of [virgin coconut oil] was superior to that of mineral oil.\u201d \nBut, what about compared to virgin olive oil? Olive oil worked, dropping eczema severity, but coconut oil worked better. What do these numbers mean? Like, what does it mean going from a severity score of 35 down to 20 look like? From this to that: before and after four weeks of topical coconut oil. \nNow, we know coconut oil has a lot of saturated fat; so, we don\u2019t want to eat it. But, the saturated fat isn\u2019t absorbed into your skin unless you\u2019re a baby, where your skin is so thin you can actually absorb saturated coconut fat into your bloodstream. But, in older children and adults, using coconut oil on your skin or hair is considered safe. Now, that still doesn\u2019t mean you can inject it into your penis. \u201cHe\u2026certainly achieved enlargement,\u201d the medical student noted, \u201clooking at the swollen, red, oozing mass before [her].\u201d \n  treating eczema with just plain Vaseline? Eczema can already be expensive to deal with. The average out-of-pocket cost can be $274 a month; that\u2019s more than a third of a typical family\u2019s disposable income. And, you can rub a kid head to toe with petroleum jelly for like four cents, whereas coconut oil or some of the fancier over-the-counter moisturizers can be many times more expensive\u2014though not as bad as some prescription moisturizers that can cost over a hundred dollars per tube, and work no better than the over-the-counter stuff. Wait; I only see one line\u2014exactly, they\u2019re right on top of one another. No evidence of superiority over the traditional petroleum jelly-based over-the counter-products that can be 65 times cheaper. \nYeah, but doesn\u2019t virgin coconut oil have like active ingredients, whereas petroleum jelly is just \u201cinert\u201d? Vaseline has been around since 1872, but it took the scientific community 144 years to put it to the test. And, it\u2019s not inert at all, significantly upregulating genes that fight infection, and inducing the expression of genes that help with barrier function, increasing the thickness of the protective outer layer of skin, and actively reducing inflammation. Yeah, but is it safe? Not, if you inject it into your\u2014. What is it with men injecting stuff into their penis? \u201cIn\u2026less severe cases, the problem [can] be solved [with] basic surgery.\u201d Otherwise, it may require major reconstruction. Evidently, done a lot by prisoners, giving a whole new meaning to the term Jailhouse Rock. An unbelievable one in six inmates at the largest prison in Hungary \u201cadmitted [to] Vaseline self-injection.\u201d Or, how about actual rocks, the surgical implantation of stones in the penis? \nOr injecting \u201cindustrial silicone.\u201d I will never look at the term \u201csilicone caulk\u201d the same way, ever again. When men were asked why they were injecting fishy substances into their penises, most explained that it was because they felt under-endowed, but one guy said he just wanted to give it a try. But, why inject cod-liver oil into your penis when you can just inject the mercury directly, and cut out the middlefish. \nAnyways, based on 77 studies of moisturizers for eczema, no reliable evidence that one moisturizer is any better than the other, though a consensus of experts concluded that petroleum jelly may be best for skin barrier function protection. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coconut oil", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vaseline   coconut oil", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": [{"name": "wort", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hungary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T12:35:01.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68fb34879284f89c45cc65f965360702199190f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2sXsDupUmNE1KsPkDtic4A4NPnaGuaIqzxkQ3edrGRu.SBsthR5SOoNMCqlCo8URvYx_TTUuuWiM-", "site_full": "nutritionfacts.org", "site": "nutritionfacts.org", "site_section": "http://nutritionfacts.org/feed", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "health", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "NutritionFacts.org", "title": "What About Extra Virgin Olive Oil?", "title_full": "What About Extra Virgin Olive Oil?", "published": "2017-10-17T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2017/10/Oct-17-Olive-Oil-1200x675.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23349, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "68fb34879284f89c45cc65f965360702199190f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2sXsDupUmNE1KsPkDtic4A4NPnaGuaIqzxkQ3edrGRu.SBsthR5SOoNMCqlCo8URvYx_TTUuuWiM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM", "published": "2017-10-17T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "What About Extra Virgin Olive Oil?", "text": "Home > Dr. Greger\u2019s Medical Nutrition Blog > What About Extra Virgin Olive Oil? Image Credit: Chrystian Guy   What About Extra Virgin Olive Oil?   17th, 2017 \nThe relative paralysis of our arteries for hours after eating fast food and cheesecake may also occur after consuming olive oil. Olive oil was found to have the same impairment to endothelial function as high-fat foods like sausage and egg breakfast sandwiches. (See my Olive Oil and Artery Function video for an illustrative chart with different foods.) \nStudies that have suggested endothelial benefits after olive oil consumption have measured something different: ischemia-induced dilation as opposed to flow-mediated dilation. There\u2019s just not good evidence that\u2019s actually an accurate index of endothelial function, which is what predicts heart disease. Hundreds of studies have shown that the ischemia-induced dilation test can give a false negative result. \nOther oils have also been shown to have deleterious results on endothelial function. A significant and constant decrease in endothelial function appears within three hours after each meal, independent of the type of oil and whether the oil was fresh or deep fried. Olive oil may be better than omega-6-rich oils or saturated fats, but it still showed adverse effects. This was the case with regular, refined olive oil. But what about extra-virgin olive oil? \nExtra-virgin olive oil retains a fraction of the anti-inflammatory phytonutrients found in the olive fruit, and so doesn\u2019t appear to induce the spike in inflammatory markers caused by regular olive oil. What does that mean for our arteries? Extra-virgin olive oil may have more of a neutral effect compared to butter, which exerted a noxious effect that lasted for up to six hours\u2014basically right up until our next meal. In the largest prospective study ever to assess the relationship between olive oil consumption and cardiac events like heart attacks, there was a suggestion that virgin olive oil may be better than regular olive oil, but neither was found to significantly reduce heart attack rates after controlling for healthy dietary behaviors like vegetable intake, which tends to go hand-in-hand with olive oil intake. \nThere have also been studies showing that even extra-virgin olive oil, contrary to expectations, may significantly impair endothelial function. Why then do some studies suggest endothelial function improves on a Mediterranean diet, which is rich in olive oil? It may be because the Mediterranean diet is also rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, and walnuts. Fruits and vegetables appear to provide some protection against the direct impairment of endothelial function produced by high-fat foods, including olive oil; therefore, improvements in health may be in spite of, rather than because of, the oil. In terms of their effects on post-meal endothelial function, the beneficial components of the Mediterranean diet may primarily be the antioxidant-rich foods, the vegetables, fruits, and their derivatives, such as balsamic vinegar. Adding some vegetables to a fatty meal may partially restore arterial functioning and blood flow. \nIf olive oil can impair our arterial function, Why Was Heart Disease Rare in the Mediterranean? I\u2019ve got a whole series of videos on the Mediterranean diet that I invite you to check out. \nI\u2019ve also examined artery function with several other foods: eggs , dark chocolate , coffee , vinegar , tea , and plant-based diets . \nIn health, \nMichael Greger, M.D. \nPS: If you haven\u2019t yet, you can subscribe to my free videos here and watch my live, year-in-review presentations: Michael Greger M.D. FACLM \nMichael Greger, M.D. FACLM, is a physician, New York Times bestselling author, and internationally recognized professional speaker on a number of important public health issues.

Nuts are whole foods, oils are processed food. 17 October 18th, 2017 at 3:29 am \nvery very suspicous to use a kind of in- vitro studies to support your opinion on olive- oil Mr Greger! Show me please ONE clinical interventional Study that shows a a bad outcome on hard endpoints with olive oil versus nuts for example. This would be convincing but not the arguing with (preclinical) physiological parameters. 2 \nthe same study: \n\u201cIn keeping with our hypothesis, the omega-3-rich canola oil and salmon meals did not reduce FMD significantly.\u201d 0 \nand one study that show even the benefit of EVOO on endothelial function: \nCONCLUSIONS:\u201cWe concluded that the consumption of a diet containing polyphenol-rich olive oil can decrease BP and improve endothelial function in young women with high-normal BP or stage 1 essential hypertension.\u201d \nThe key part is that in this study potyphenol olive oil reduced BP etc only RELATIVE to polyphenol-free olive oil. \nit did not show that EVOO benefits endothelial function compared to no oil at all. 2 October 18th, 2017 at 2:59 pm \nOur family is on a whole food plant based diet. The only oil we use is California grown extra virgin olive oil. We use it almost exclusively for sauteing vegetables for use in our dishes usually no more than 2 or 3 tablespoons of oil. Is this a concern for us? Should we eliminate oil from our diet completely? 0 \nWhy not saute in a little, (very small amt,) vegetable broth instead? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned to do\u2026. 1 October 17th, 2017 at 10:20 am \nIf I get a hankerin\u2019 for olive oil, I make sure to mix in the olive fruit also. Every so often I\u2019ll whip up an olive tamponade and smear it on some fresh tomatoes and a bit of chopped basil.. delish!! Adding olives with a bit of oil to my miroux pois gives it a nice flavor also.. Great with beans or over quinoa.. YMMV. mitch October 17th, 2017 at 10:24 am \nThe study showing that olive oil impaired endothelial function fed subjects 50 grams, almost 1/4 cup of olive oil! Also there were 3 different olive oil meals and the ones that contained antioxidant vitamins C & E or vegetables & balsamic vinegar did not affect endothelial function. So to keep things in perspective, I wouldn\u2019t worry about adding a small teaspoon of olive oil to a meal loaded with vegetables. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11079642 24 \nJulie, did you see in the \u2018 conclusions\u2019 of that study, canola oil is listed as one of the beneficial components of the Mediterranean and Lyon diet Heart Study diets in terms of its effect on the endothelium? 4 October 17th, 2017 at 11:52 am \nThank you for pointing this out, Julie. As often happens, the dose may very well make the poison. \nI\u2019d love to see a study where endothelial function is measured after a teaspoon or tablespoon of olive oil is consumed in a meal that includes plenty of vegetables. 6 October 17th, 2017 at 4:37 pm \nMe too. That would provide some guide for practical implementation. I eat a low sodium, organic spaghetti sauce almost every day in a large salad to get sufficient tomato in my diet in a form in which lycopene is readily absorbed. It has about a teaspoon (40 cals) of EVOO. I assume that\u2019s not a problem but it would be nice to know for sure. 0 October 19th, 2017 at 6:51 am \nThanks for your question David, \nOil intake should be kept to a minimum for health purposes, if you can avoid using it, it\u2019s best practice to avoid unnecessary calories and impairment of endothelial function. \nI cook my food using boiled water, other alternatives can also be found in recipe books (see here ). \nHope this answer helps. October 17th, 2017 at 4:02 pm \nI do a mixture in the morning as a lymphatic system cleanse of 4 cups purified water, 2 tbsp EVOO, a whole organic lemon and a dash of ginger blended in a Bullet. I strain the grated peels and drink the mixture (split between my husband and I). With regards to mixing EVOO with vitamin C, as you mentioned, is this mixture a \u201csafe\u201d use for olive oil and endothelial function? 0 \nAs Dr Greger says taking supplements cannot overcome a bad diet. Using olive oil to saute meat or fish cannot switch the meat to the healthy column. 3 \nTeaspoon is not what most people are using, you only have to watch a cooking show and see how they pour it on all the meals. 2 October 18th, 2017 at 6:58 am \nI agree. I can eat a raw salad without EVOO, and always cook onions, tomatoes and mushrooms with a little water (I steam greens and other veggies), but I like a few drops of olive oil on my toasted Ezechiel bread in the morning. Are those few drops really so harmful? I don\u2019t think so. 2 \nNeedless to say, only one piece of toast. I have a little thingie that lets us squeeze out the amount drop by drop. Probably measures to 1/4 of a teaspoon or so. 0 \nOn second thought, as healthy as Ezechiel bread IS, it does contain gluten. The gluten might be the reason I have stiff joints here and there. So, darn it, will give it up. And thereby, also, the oil. :-( 0 \nSo if you had to choose between using olive oil or canola oil in cooking, which is best overall? 1 October 17th, 2017 at 11:32 am \nHow about no oil in your diet apart from natural oils derived from nuts and so forth? This is what I\u2019ve been doing and I feel brand spanking new! \nIt seems like once man has had his hand in something, it is almost always guaranteed to be bad for us. \nKeep it natural. \nThank you. But my question stands. If you are going to use oil for cooking, should it be olive or canola? 6 \nWhy not use a little vegetable broth? 4 \nhi John, I remember hearing/reading Dr Greger say that if you really had to use an oil, then use organic canola oil (the least amount possible). If I come across the video, I will post it here. 4 October 17th, 2017 at 11:33 am \nOlive oil of course, if it is real and not old and rancid. Canola oil needs to be avoided along with vegetable oils. Coconut oil is the best of course, but due to the 50 year old fake theory about \u201csaturated\u201d fat, it is considered bad. Sigh! \nThanks for the info, but on that note, I\u2019m out. \nI did a graduate thesis on coconut oil. No thank you. I\u2019ll seek advice elsewhere. 14 \nJohn, please tell us more about your coconut oil thesis. I think we\u2019d all be interested in learning from you. 6 October 17th, 2017 at 12:41 pm \nJohn \u2013 I appreciate your question. Although I, also, generally go oil free, there are a few times that I do use just a tiny skoshe of oil. I had the same question \u2013 olive or canola oil? I\u2019ll share with you what I found. Both had the same amount of overall fat per unit. However, the canola oil has less saturated fat than olive oil and more Omega 3 fatty acids. The canola oil was 2 to 1 Omega 6 to Omega 3 while the olive oil was 12 to 1 Omega 6 to Omega 3 (in the information I found). So I decided to go with the organic, cold pressed canola for those times that I use a very tiny amount. \nI grew up on extra virgin olive oil mixed with fresh garlic and lemon for salad dressing (Thank you Dad!) and I sometimes miss that flavor. I have discovered that one can use the bean liquid from a can of beans as the olive oil substitution in a home made salad dressing. I use white bean liquid for the color. I then blend it in a small bullet blender with a few olives to get the olive flavor along with the whole food of the olives and balsamic vinegar and whatever else I feel like putting in the salad dressing \u2013 some dijon, some Italian spices, etc. If I use a can of beans that is salted, then I don\u2019t add salt. Makes a very decent salad dressing. \nFun fact \u2013 it takes about 44 olives to make 1 tablespoon of olive oil. I have a friend \u2013 very Italian! \u2013 who, once he learned how much fat was in olives, stopped eating them (or reduced severely). Yet, he pours olive oil all over his food. I love this example of how thoroughly the food industry has confused the public. \nHere are links to both the olive oil and canola oil for the information I shared in this post: http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fats-and-oils/509/2 Scroll down to the bottom to see the Omega 6 \u2013 Omega 3 information. \nFor me, personally, eating a whole food plant-based diet means eating a whole food \u2013 whether its an olive or a coconut. Mother Nature put the whole food together for a reason and extracting its oil because it has one tiny component that is healthful just makes no sense to me. The fiber in an olive \u2013 or a coconut \u2013 is also known to be healthful to our physiology. But for some reason the food industry hasn\u2019t figured out how to market that component to the public yet. 13 October 17th, 2017 at 12:46 pm \nGuest: Brilliant idea about using the aquafaba (bean water) and blend a few olives. I haven\u2019t seen that idea. Thanks for sharing! \nGreat overall post. So many people try to put-down canola oil, but when you look at it objectively, it\u2019s better than olive oil if you have to have some oil. You did a great job of explaining about the nutrients. 7 October 17th, 2017 at 2:09 pm \nThanks for posting \u2013 interesting info! \nMy question \u2014 does eating 44 olives cause the same endothelial damage as eating a tablespoon of olive oil? I am guessing not but would be interested if this was ever proven\u2026 0 \nWJB \u2013 why don\u2019t you just go ahead and eat 44 olives and report back to all of us how that felt for you? Why wait for OTHERS to do some research. Do your own. 1 October 17th, 2017 at 2:30 pm \nYou need to know that virgin coconut oil comes from pressing coconut meat to get the oil and with very little processing. Of course eating the coconut fruit is even better but how often can you eat real coconut in the U.S.? The same thing goes with extra virgin olive oil which is as good as the olive except that olive oil is prone to counterfeit, by the Mafia mind you. And olive oil is prone to go rancid and becomes harmful while coconut oil is stable and have a high burning temperature. You just need to buy extra virgin coconut oil from a reputable manufacturer. 0 October 17th, 2017 at 1:13 pm \nGreg \u2013 I read the article you linked to. Unfortunately, the author provided no scientific references to his statement. So its impossible to read the research he is referencing. Here is an example of what I mean: \n\u201cCholesterol is not the cause of heart disease, it is the band-aid that tries to repair the arteries when damage occurs from a low-fat, high-starch, high sugar diet. This causes pre-diabetes and inflammation from a processed food diet, environmental toxins, a bad gut from a low fiber, processed diet or anything that causes inflammation.\u201d \nI can\u2019t see which study he is referring to. In the statement above he is making the point that damage happens from a \u201clow fat, high starch, high sugar diet.\u201d The devil is in the details here. I can design a diet that meets the above criteria made from processed, packaged foods as well as one made from whole, as-grown-in-nature foods. Which is it? \u2013 Dr. Hyman won\u2019t let us see. \nAlso, Hyman makes the point that the AHA has advised people to consume more vegetable fats \u2013 PUFA\u2019s \u2013 and that this is unhealthy. Again, the devil is in the details. The AHA does not advise that people consume more vegetable fats in addition to their dietary components. It advises that people REPLACE the heavy saturated fats with vegetable fats. Their point (the AHA) is to consume fewer hard saturated fats replaced by liquid fats \u2013 not add more fat to the diet overall which is how Hyman has presented it. \nHyman also claims that there are no studies that show that discarding saturated fat and replacing with no fat diets is a good thing. He is wrong. Caldwell Esselstyne, M.D. shows reversal of heart disease in people sent home to die because their disease was so bad. They were given about a year \u2013 or sometimes less \u2013 to live. Twenty five years later they were still alive and doing well. Read the science and see the pictures in his book Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease. Dean Ornish, M.D., has also provided the hard science that shows heart disease reversal through dietary measures advocated here on this site. His heart disease reversal through diet program is so successful that Medicare now pays for his program as do numerous other Insurance Programs. And we all know that insurance won\u2019t pay for anything that cannot show factual data. \nBut let us all know how eating gobs of solid fat work out for you in 25 years. 19 \nJerry, you chased John away with your usual coconut oil nonsense. SMH \nI sure wish you were that easy to chase away. 12 \nI will be the first one to leave if you guys and gals stop posting biases and twisting the facts and cherry picking. 1 \nWhat is it to you? 2 October 17th, 2017 at 5:59 pm \nJL, you\u2019ve made it pretty obvious for months now that you\u2019re incapable to telling the difference between who is biased, twisting facts & cherry picking & who is not. \nYou believe in internet junk science. You\u2019ll believe anything as long as it fits your already established beliefs. We do not. You\u2019ve been shown the evidence over & over & over again by Darwin, TG, Thea, & many others. But you refuse to even listen to anyone because you came here thinking you already knew it all to begin with. You didn\u2019t come here to learn anything. You came here with an agenda. 8 October 17th, 2017 at 3:43 pm \nJerry Lewis, Did you even read the article you referenced on coconut oil? The article is from the Ghana Medical Journal. It starts out extolling the virtues of palm oil, but then changes the emphasis to enhancing the economy of Ghana because palm and coconut oil is produced there. The idea of the whole paper seems to be to convince people to buy and use palm and coconut oil to help the economy of Ghana! It\u2019s hard to believe you can\u2019t see the conflict of interest here! If this is where you\u2019re getting your love of coconut oil, if I were you, I would think twice about gobbling down that coconut oil and clogging up your arteries. \nHere\u2019s a direct quote from the paper: \n\u201cRole of Palm Oil and Coconut Oil in National Development \nAgriculture employs 65 percent of the workforce in Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the continued expansion of productive and high yield agriculture is essential for the reduction of poverty in Africa31 and consequently the acceleration of national development. The production of palm and coconut oils hold promise and represent one of the most effective methods of hoisting developing nations like countries in Sub-Saharan Africa out of poverty, and ensuring food security. \nWhen prioritized and supported, the coconut and palm oil industries will not only provide foods, income and raw materials, but will also provide employment for the development of the nation. Some research has provided the groundwork for the production and use of these oils in Africa. However, more country-specific work remains to be done to find innovative solutions to make the coconut and palm oil industries profitable in the long term, as well as assess their benefits and impacts on human health, industry and the environment.\u201d 17 \nAnd also: \n\u201cGovernments of developing economies in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Ghana, will benefit immensely from emulating the Malaysian example\u2026\u201d \nwhich is \u2026 \n\u201cThe Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) of Malaysia, one of the largest producers of palm oil globally, have outlined some research and development goals intended to support the well-being of its oil palm industry\u2026\u201d \nIf anyone is interested in seeing an example of industry bias cranking out propaganda, please have a look at the article JL posted. 8 October 17th, 2017 at 4:47 pm \nGeez, what a selective reading, just like your doctor. Nobody ever people to eat certain foods even if it is good for the economy. If so then South America should be encouraged to smoke because they grow tobacco, the U.S. should be encouraged to eat GMO corn and corn oil and sugar because the U.S. is a big producer of corn, etc. etc. \nThe fact that the article encourages Africa to consume coconut oil instead of vegetables oil because coconut oil not only it is harmless but it is also beneficial. \nGeez, why do you guys keep twisting the truth to fot your agenda? Do ypi have any conscience? \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5044790/ \n\u201cFurthermore, in the developing world, this adverse publicity is characterized by pressure from all fronts including governmental agencies and health professionals (including nutritionists) to reduce consumption of oils such as palm and coconut oils. It is true that the phenomenon of the \u2018double burden of disease\u2019 is assuming unprecedented proportions in the developing world and the incidence of chronic disease is increasing steadily and even catching up with figures from the developed world. However, this increase in chronic disease has been attributed more to the \u2018westernization\u2019 of diets rather than the consumption of tropical oils, since these fats have been the mainstay (of edible oils) in many developing countries (especially in West Africa) for centuries. This, dating back even to the period when chronic disease prevalence was extremely low. Rather, the vilification of coconut and palm oils may be contributing to a situation where there is increased food insecurity (because individuals feel pressured to switch to less affordable and so called \u2018healthier\u2019 oils) and decreased quality of the food supply. This has resulted subsequently in hunger in areas of the developing world where there is shortage of energy and nutrients.\u201d \n\u201cSaturated fatty acids, or saturated fats, consist of fatty acids whose carbon chain is \u201csaturated\u201d with hydrogen.\u201d 1 October 17th, 2017 at 6:00 pm \nJerry Lewis, You\u2019re missing the whole point of my comment about the article you posted supporting your claim that coconut oil is great. The article does not show any new supporting evidence that coconut oil is good. It collects other articles (cherry picks, to use your phrase) that support their claim that coconut oil is good. Then they say, if all you consumers out there eat this good stuff, you will help our national economy grow because our country has a big coconut oil industry! \nIf they had done some original research, published it, and stopped there, then they would be more believable. But by adding in the national economy pitch, it only serves to confirm their conflict of interest. That is why Dr Greger ignores these kinds of papers. \nAnd that is why most of the readers of this website believe Dr Greger instead of you! 13 \nDarwin, I just give up. It\u2019s not worth for me to waste my time conversing with you. Continue to keep your head in the sand. 0 October 17th, 2017 at 5:49 pm \nIt was often said that we export our SAD diet and processed foods to the world and causing people to get sick. But we also export our fake saturated fat and cholesterol theories to the world and making them eating \u201clow fat\u201d vegetable oil and then have to take our statin drug. Our lies and crimes against humanity have no bound. \n\u201cFrom the above, it is clear, that the saturated fat content of both coconut oil and palm oil have been the basis of the vilification campaigns against their use. Enig11 traces the origins of the anti-saturated fat campaign to the late 1950s, when a researcher in Minnesota announced that the heart disease epidemic was being caused by hydrogenated vegetable fats. The edible oil industry\u2019s response at that time was to claim that it was only the saturated fat in the hydrogenated oils that was causing the problem. This was followed by various forms of anti-saturated fat/anti-tropical oils campaigns (from the 1960s through to the mid-1980s) by individual researchers, some multinational companies and even governmental agencies   Chong and Ng12 however, noted that, the anti-palm oil (anti-tropical oil) campaigns in the United States were conducted more for economic gains than for genuine concerns of the health of the Americans. Sadly, this adverse publicity of tropical oil in the United States, has spread worldwide, even to countries in the developing world, with heart disease prevalence far lower than that of the United States. \nCoconut oil has been shown to have the potential to protect against not only heart disease but a wide variety of chronic health problems including diabetes and cancer as well as a means to prevent and even treat infectious diseases, however, knowledge about coconut oil has been kept buried in medical journals because of a general prejudice against saturated fats.24 \nDebMandal and Mandal10 further report, that coconut oil is very effective against a variety of lipid-coated viruses such as visna virus, CMV, Epstein-Barr virus, influenza, virus, leukemia virus, pneumo virus and hepatitis C virus. The MCFA in coconut oil primarily destroys these organisms by disrupting their membranes, thus interfering with virus assembly and maturation. Control of infections is crucial on the health agenda of many developing countries in West Africa, and the use of coconut oil could serve as a cheaper alternative means of controlling infections. \nA general rule is that, fats with a higher smoke point are better suited for deep frying, whilst fats with a smoke point below 200 \u00b0C are not.27 The smoke point of unrefined palm oil is 235 \u00b0C whilst that of unrefined coconut oil is 177 \u00b0C.29 In this light coconut oil is better suited for shallow frying, which is done at much lower temperatures,28 whilst palm oil on the other hand is suitable for both deep and shallow frying.30 \nThe smoke point is related to the free fatty acid content of oils, thus reheating (re-use) of oils is not recommended as used oils will contain a higher free-fatty acid content, with a consequent decrease in its original smoke point, which will result in higher emissions of volatile compounds at lower temperatures.27 0 October 17th, 2017 at 6:09 pm \nJerry Lewis, You\u2019re confusing the Global Food Industry with this website. I have never seen this website promote the use of refined oils, neither vegetable nor animal.This website is about Whole Plant Foods. \nYou\u2019re arguing in circles again. Maybe you should step back and collect your thoughts. Take a break. Relax. 9 October 17th, 2017 at 9:07 pm \nOh, Jerry Lewis . . .you are such a bore. What we all realize here is that what you REALLY want is to have your own website so that you can be your own \u201cDr. Greger\u201d. You want to be able to dispense your nutritional opinions with your own research links . . . .just like Dr. Greger does. But the big problem with your, JL, is that you have never taken on the task of developing your own website with your own research team. You want to be Dr. G., or Mercola, or . . .whomever else. Problem is, . . . .your\u2019re just a nobody. Posting your little opinions on a site that thinks differently than you do. You are a little nobody rowing upstream trying to convince everyone that you actually have some sort of great scientific background \u2013 well earned at a bonafide University \u2013 which you don\u2019t. You\u2019re really just a pathetic big mouth with no REAL scientific background. Poor little jerry l. October 17th, 2017 at 10:10 pm \nJerry You keep spamming this site with your ridiculous claims about saturated fat. May I remind you that this site is called \u201cnutrtionfacts\u201d not \u201cnutritioncranks\u201d? There is no scientific basis for thinking high saturated fat and coconut oil consumption do anything but damage health \n\u201cThis Presidential Advisory from the American Heart Association reviewed the scientific evidence of multiple studies regarding the impact of dietary saturated fat on  . It strongly concludes that reducing dietary intake of saturated fat and replacing it with unsaturated fat, especially polyunsaturated fat, will reduce the rate of  . The following are key points to remember: \n1. Multiple randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, prospective observational studies, and animal studies all support the concept of replacement of dietary saturated fats with unsaturated fats to reduce  . Reducing dietary saturated fat and replacing it with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduced   by around 30%, similar to results from statin therapy. Prospective observational studies showed that reducing saturated fat and replacing it with polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat caused 25% and 15% reductions in coronary heart disease (CHD), respectively. Mortality overall and from other causes was also reduced. 2. Replacing dietary saturated fats with carbohydrates, especially refined carbohydrates, does not reduce  . Substitution with refined carbohydrates caused a 1% increase in CHD; substitution with whole grain carbohydrates caused a 9% reduction. 3 Both polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats are effective in reducing  . The effect is greatest for polyunsaturated fats. 4 Studies in which saturated fats were replaced by carbohydrates resulting in a low-fat diet did not reduce  . 5 Animal studies have shown that a diet high in saturated fats raises low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increases coronary atherosclerosis, and a diet low in saturated fat but high in polyunsaturated fat has the reverse effect. 6 Replacement of saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, or carbohydrates results in a reduction in LDL cholesterol; the reduction is greatest for polyunsaturated fats and least for carbohydrates. 7 Coconut oil increases LDL without known beneficial effects. Dairy fat increases LDL; substitution by polyunsaturated fats causes a 24-25% lower risk of   and stroke. Trans-unsaturated fats increase  . Omega-3 vegetable oil is associated with a lower risk of fatal but not overall CHD, possibly due to antiarrhythmic properties. 8 Randomized clinical trials of a Mediterranean diet in conjunction with substitution of polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats for saturated fats resulted in significantly reduced   in the intervention arms but not in control groups assigned to a low-fat diet.\u201d \nThanks, TG. I always learn so much from your posts. 2 \nWell then, how about unrefined Walnut oil? Any studies out there? 3 October 17th, 2017 at 12:07 pm \nFor those of us living in a toxic environment where any minute a natural disaster, or one man made by sheer greed and ignorance may occur. I feel the pleasures that come from eating something as neutral as Olive oil isn\u2019t something that we should be concerned with, rather focus on the facts that few of us can adhere to a regime so restrictive that we isolate ourselves from the real World, As I like to say \u201cthere may not be Pork chops in Heaven\u201d. Everything in moderation except moderation. 5 October 17th, 2017 at 4:05 pm \nEverything in moderation is one of those logic holes that come at us looking so reasonable but are toxic to our health! Arsenic or other poisons should not be taken in moderation ever. You can clearly see that neglecting our children in moderation would not be an acceptable position. \nThe truth is that we live in the Garden of Earthly Delights, and temptations are all around us all the time. The more restrictive we are, the better our quality of life! We love high calorie foods of all kinds, usually also low in fiber. So a whole food plant based diet is the healthiest, and best for the planetary environment! If you want to indulge in something outside of the best from time to time, then do it knowing it will trigger your desire for more! \nThere is much pleasure in standing apart from doing the easy/unhealthy thing! Here is a trick that works: If I am in the grocery store and I get the inkling that corn chips would be a really nice treat, since I have been good for so long, I just tell myself that I have already had them and am satisfied. I then try to recall eating those chips and the feeling afterwards. It really works for me! 10 \nI\u2019m going to try that trick. Tomorrow! 3 \nThe link in the word \u201cshowing\u201d in this sentence of today\u2019s blog goes to a study that used olive oil, not extra virgin olive oil.\u201c \nThere have also been studies showing that even extra-virgin olive oil, contrary to expectations, may significantly impair endothelial function.\u201d \nAn incorrect citation, perhaps? \nAccording to all your research, meaning the Dr. Greger team, is there a safe oil? Thanks \nWhat about sesame seed oil? On t\u014df\u016b with green onions? 0 \nJust for the sake of argument, why would people argue that olive oil is not \u201cwhole food\u201d but then don\u2019t apply the same logic to other items like soy milk? Lets check some: \nCoffee: not whole food Soy milk: not whole food Soaked beans with water discarded during prep (missing whole lectins): not whole food White pasta: not whole food Selected cuts of fruits and vegetables and tossing the rest: not whole food 1 October 17th, 2017 at 2:26 pm \nPanchito \u2013 the concept of \u201cWhole Food\u201d is the food as it is grown as a whole unit in Nature. When one eats a chunk of broccoli and discards the root, one is eating the whole food as it is grown in Nature. One is not necessarily eating the entire plant although I am sure that one could if one wished to do so. I know people that consume the rinds of oranges, lemons, limes as well as the pulp and juice. But do they eat the entire tree? . . .nope! I don\u2019t think anyone claims that white pasta is a whole food. Whole grain pasta is considered a whole food because it uses the whole grain as grown in Nature. And many people eat wheat berries as a rice replacement. Wheat berries are a whole food as grown in Nature. \nIf one didn\u2019t want to consume coffee or soy milk because it is a part of the whole food then this is of course their prerogative. \nYour beans argument holds no water (tee hee) with me because beans do not grow, whole, in a pot of water. Beans grow in a pod. And if one wished to they could eat the whole bean in the pod and many do \u2013 green beans, sweet peas, and garden-grown legumes. People cook beans that have dried to make them chewable once they have dehydrated. But if you picked them from your garden you could eat a fresh, raw legume. I have done so many times while playing hide-n-seed in in the soy bean rows on my family\u2019s farm (and, no, not gmo). We would lay in the rows and pick the soybeans straight from the plant and munch away. I grew up eating raw soy beans \u2013 a childhood treat!! \u2013 lectins and all. So far, 65 years later, no negative sequelae from doing so. Eating a whole food is a different concept from eating the entire plant \u2013 who can chew an olive tree? not me. But it makes intuitive sense to me to eat a whole olive, not drink the oil. Eat a whole orange, not guzzle juice. Munch on some edamame. Lectins and all. 14 \nThanks for the reply. I\u2019ll try make it simpler to avoid confusion: \n1 olive oil is not \u201cwhole food\u201d because you through away the non edible part \n2 but an orange is \u201cwhole food\u201d because you through away the peel \nPS: Whole olives are not edible. They would need to be chemically processed first. The oil is the only edible part of the olive in its natural form. \nAnd now the question: \nIs there a hidden purpose behind by saying that olive oil is not whole food? By comparison, why not apply the same criteria to oranges (example)? 0 October 19th, 2017 at 12:25 am \nSome people peel apples and potatoes. We also peel bananas and shell nuts. \nMy understanding is that we can make raw olives edible by soaking them in brine. And many foods require some basic processing (like heating or soaking) to make them edible. The question really is what level of processing represents turning whole food into a processed food. \nMost people here I think would agree with the Wikipedia definition\u201cWhole foods are plant foods that are unprocessed and unrefined, or processed and refined as little as possible, before being consumed.\u201d https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_food \nSo olives would count as whole foods but olive oil does not, under this definition. You could go a step further and say shelled nuts and peeled oranges are whole foods but peeled apples are not, using the \u201cas little as possible\u201d test. However, I agree that some of our descriptions of what is a whole food and what is not are subjective. 1 \nWhat oil would you recommend? How does avocado oil or coconut oil compare? 0 October 17th, 2017 at 1:53 pm \nJudging from this discussion, dietary oils remain a contentious issue that appears to be subject to a lot of opinions, as well as research. I just watched Dr. Greger\u2019s video (here\u2019s the link: https://nutritionfacts.org/video/olive-oil-and-artery-function/ ) for the third time. \nWhen I first watched Forks Over Knives, I had a variety of reactions. Anger that no one had ever shared the information, then a bit of grief over giving up a couple of my favorites: olive oil and home-made yogurt. I had to watch it twice to get the message. \nHere\u2019s the thing, blood panel studies don\u2019t lie. And neither does angina. I was willing to give the WFPB lifestyle a six month trial. That was over two years ago. Angina pain disappeared in three weeks. Blood panels began to improve. The only setback I\u2019ve had was deciding that a \u201clittle bit\u201d of olive oil wouldn\u2019t hurt. Two hours later my jaws began to hurt, the pain spread through my chest and torso. I haven\u2019t been tempted since then. \nI\u2019m now 77, work out five days a week, cook 95% of our meals, feel great and look 15 years younger. I wish I had had this information when I was in my 30s, but I can testify that it\u2019s never too late to start. \nI encourage the doubters to put aside their quibbling and try this out. The western world is in a health crisis, after all. Maybe a lot of what we\u2019ve been told is \u201chealthy\u201d is marketing\u2026especially \u201cresearch\u201d hiding behind special interests. \nRead \u201cHow Not to Die,\u201d\u201cThe China Study,\u201d\u201cHow to Reverse and Prevent Heart Disease,\u201d\u201cThe McDougall Program for Women\u201d\u2026.for starters. \nTo robust health and happy hearts. 26 \nThanks so much for sharing your healing journey with us, Linda Caswell! 9 \nGreat comment that spoke directly to me! Thank you!!! To robust health and happy hearts indeed!!! 9 October 17th, 2017 at 2:07 pm \nI have a question. Does anyone know if eating lentil and/or bean pasta is equal to eating the legume itself? Legume pastas are far more nutrient dense, gluten free (I have Celiac) and are delicious. I have been adding lentils to the sauce (as a burger substitute) but wondered if that is always necessary. I have searched and searched but can\u2019t find an answer. Thank you in advance for sharing whatever study you may have. 0 October 17th, 2017 at 2:33 pm \nBebe \u2013 YOu have to do your own homework here \u2013 read the ingredients on the box. Pasta is a manufactured food and the maker of that product can put anything in the product it wants to and leave out anything it wants to \u2013 as long as it tells you on the Ingredients panel. So look for the words \u201cWhole\u201d or \u201c100% whole\u201d beans or corn or whatever. Or, if it is still not clear, call the company and ask. I\u2019ve never found a product that did not have a contact number on the box. Call them and find out as there is no standard. 5 October 17th, 2017 at 2:50 pm \nSo now I am confused. SO much conflicting information amongst different health care providers, most of which are focused on integrative/functional/natural health. I listen to many of these Dr\u2019s and trust they have also done their research before confidently spreading their knowledge. Most of these physicians advocate for the anti-inflammatory and healing effects of coconut oil & EVOO (and by the way what is the difference b/w olive oil and EVOO?!). Documentaries such as The Truth About Cancer, Awakening from Alzheimers, etc.. all promote and cite many studies showing immense benefits of ingesting these fats as our bodies and brains depend on them for normal functioning. You think you are doing everything right and it ends up being completely wrong. So discouraging and confusing. Which way is the right way? Sigh\u2026 1 October 17th, 2017 at 3:27 pm \nCari, I like to keep it simple & prefer to learn about healthy food from a source that isn\u2019t trying to sell me anything, such as powders, supplements, or extracts. I never trust any of their claims unless it\u2019s backed up by scientific studies. Also the sources of funding for the studies is important to check out. A source may look good on the surface, but may be funded by an industry or a government agency in order to promote a particular economic agenda. \nAll sources referred to here are cited below the videos for your perusal. If a study has questionable funding, it\u2019s been my experience that NF.org not only tells us so, but gives usually gives us the details about it so we can check it out ourselves. An added plus is that Dr. Greger\u2019s delivery is usually very entertaining. He has a great sense of humor. \nIf you haven\u2019t already read The China Study by T. Colin Campbell, I recommend it highly. \nHope this helps. Best of luck on your journey to good health. 6 October 17th, 2017 at 5:50 pm \nHi, WFPB Nancy\u2026 \nThank you for recommending The China Study. I just this minute ordered it from Amazon and am looking forward to reading it. \nI\u2019m new to this site, but I\u2019m thankful for the high standard regarding citing sources. It makes it so much easier to figure out better ways of going forward. \nwarmest regards\u2026 \nI read that book when my daughter brought it home with a friend from college. It changed my life! 3 \nYou\u2019re welcome, Elizabeth. Happy reading! :-) 0 October 17th, 2017 at 3:37 pm \nIt appears to me that most of the WFPB docs advocate no oil or very minimal amounts. On the olive oil question, I have recently heard both Drs. Brenda and Garth Davis (not related) say in podcasts that \u201cnewer\u201d research show that olive oil does not hurt endothelium function, that the initial Vogel study was not held up; yet they didn\u2019t discuss that research. I wonder if they are talking about the ischemia-induced dilation Dr. Greger mentions? \nWhat would be most helpful to those of us sharing knowledge with others on eating WFPB, is if our plant-based doctor advocates could write some articles directly replying to claims from docs like Hyman, Mercola, etc.. We need to better understand why Dr. Greger and others dismiss the arguments of these doctors and the studies they use to argue their perspectives. We need to better understand the nuances of these arguments from a lay person perspective so we can share them. We need more than general comments; we need the specifics of why these other doctor opinions are or are not based on the best research available. Hoping someone will take the time to do this in the near future. 2 October 17th, 2017 at 4:10 pm \nYes exactly Denise, thank you for your reply! The conflicting information from highly respected docs like Mercola, Drs. Roby Mitchell, Jockers, Hyman, Erin Leigh Connelly, Wolfson (who is a holistic cardiovascular MD) all advocate for ingesting fats such as oils, ghee, butter (organic of course) as well as grass fed meat consumption. They all see a different side of the coin and have a different perspective on what Dr. Greger advocates. I would definitely like to have these arguments clarified as well. 3 \nhttps://nutritionfacts.org/video/dr-gundrys-the-plant-paradox-is-wrong/ \nIt\u2019s my understanding that Dr. Greger & the NF staff prefer to focus their time & energy looking at scientific evidence rather than debunking every diet that comes down the pike. They only focused on the one above because so many people requested it. \nDenise, the statement you made \u201d yet they didn\u2019t discuss that research\u201d is a red flag imo. There\u2019s a reason why they\u2019re not discussing it. You won\u2019t find that kind of obfuscation here. The science speaks for itself. \nCari, among the \u201chighly respected docs\u201d you mentioned, 1 lost his license to practice medicine 10 years ago, so he can\u2019t be called a doctor anymore; at least 2 are on the website quackwatch, & all of them sell products \u2013 protein & other powders & supplements galore. \nIf you are under the impression that the title MD makes them all-knowing about nutrition, then please watch this: \nhttps://nutritionfacts.org/video/doctors-nutritional-ignorance/ \nAnd while you\u2019re at it, please check out the sources cited at the bottom of the video. Nobody\u2019s hiding anything here. If you want clarification on saturated fats, just do a search above. I found 6 videos on the subject, all with sources cited. 9 October 17th, 2017 at 6:25 pm \nYes, Nancy I was pleased when the doc did the Gundry video as he was getting so much press. I understand Nutritionfacts.org is looking at the science. But Hyman, Mercola, etc. say they are doing the same thing. These guys get on the talk shows and make \u201cplausible\u201d sounding claims based on their interpretation of the science. We can not dismiss them so easily as they get so much press and many many people follow them. For those of us in the WFPB community to do our work most effectively, we need to better understand how these doctors are interpreting the science so differently from the plant-based docs. With this knowledge, still based on science, we can understand the analysis of why Hyman can think coconut oil is so great and Greger and most plant-based docs do not. \nRegarding the statement that you said was a red flag, I wouldn\u2019t call it that in reference to Brenda Davis or Garth Davis. They are 2 people promoting WFPB (mostly) and I think we need to understand their arguments, whether we agree or not. As I said these comments were both made on a podcast. I fault the interviewer for not asking follow-up questions on this very point, when they suggested the olive oil issue is being overblown somewhat. \nI generally agree that all these docs selling products and supplements lose credibility to some degree. But we have plant-based docs, Fuhrman for example, doing the same. And I have a personal physician selling supplements as well. It appears many docs use these products to make extra income, frustrating but it happens. 2 October 17th, 2017 at 6:50 pm \n\u201cThese guys get on the talk shows and make \u201cplausible\u201d sounding claims based on their interpretation of the science.\u201d \nDenise B Rose, I can easily dismiss them until they show me the science. I\u2019m not one to follow something just because it\u2019s popular. The TV appearances are merely marketing tactics. It doesn\u2019t interest me. \nAs for interpreting the science differently, data is data. It doesn\u2019t lie. Dr. Greger isn\u2019t giving you his interpretation of the science, he\u2019s showing you the data. He\u2019s also let\u2019s you know when a study is or might be biased & shows you why & how. Until the others do the same, I see no reason to listen to them. It\u2019s just a waste of my time. 6 October 17th, 2017 at 9:58 pm \nNancy, Perhaps you find it easy to dismiss the doctors you don\u2019t follow, but thousands do follow them. Perhaps it is not an interest of yours to understand how they interpret the scientific studies so different from WFPB advocate doctors. But I have that interest. When I teach, I want to be the most prepared in helping people understand why the perspective those doctors bring are misguided. It\u2019s not enough to say \u201cthey make money, they are pawns of the industry and lobbyists.\u201d While that is likely the case, they still cite nutrition studies just like our docs do. We need to better understand why there can be such different perspectives in the analysis. I disagree with you about the interpretation of science. As a Ph.D, I know that at any scientific meetings, you will have people arguing over the meaning of the same data. It might be the methodology that people argue about: done well or not done well; it might be how the analysis was done, there are many factors people can argue about. So we need to understand where these different perspectives come from when our doctors cite studies that support their claims. \nI want to know more so I can be a more effective teacher. That is the gist of my comments. I\u2019m not sure what there is to disagree with on this point. Best to you. 2 October 18th, 2017 at 12:33 am \nDenise, I can only tell you what my criteria is for listening to one source & not another. People get suckered everyday by false claims about products. Some of those false claims are made by doctors. It\u2019s an unfortunate part of our culture. \nYou said that \u2018It\u2019s not enough to say \u201cthey make money, they are pawns of the industry and lobbyists.\u201d\u2019 Why is it not enough? After seeing what the tobacco & lead industries did for decades, it\u2019s definitely enough for me. \nIf you have a scientific background, then shouldn\u2019t you be able to figure out for yourself where these other doctors are coming from without asking NF to do it for you? They usually don\u2019t do reactive-type videos but who knows, maybe they will. In the Doctor\u2019s Note of the Plant Paradox video, Dr. Greger asked people if they wanted to see more reactive-type videos like that one. They may decide to do more of them after all. \nBest to you, too. October 18th, 2017 at 12:58 am \nNancy, I wish I could figure it out for myself, but I did not study hard sciences. My field is Sociology. And yes, I do agree with you, that the comparison to the tobacco companies is a strong argument. And as a sociologist, I feel that even stronger. But I am talking about \u201ctalking\u201d to the average person who does not follow any of this, who is part of the SAD culture\u2026 \nI am not sure why this thread between you and me is happening. It kind of feels like a passive aggressive way of addressing me, especially in your last post: why don\u2019t you figure it out and not bother nutritionfacts\u2026. I use the word bother; you did not, but that was the perceived implication. \nIt sounds like you are just fed up with people trying to understand where the other side comes from. I get it. And maybe you don\u2019t need to know more than you already do. But just because I do, I don\u2019t understand why there even was a reason to question my intentions as you did in the initial post. Can we just let this rest? I answered you because your responded to my public comment. Let\u2019s end it; there really is no substance here for the world to witness. Can we agree with that? 2 October 18th, 2017 at 1:08 am \nNancy, I apologize for using the term \u201cpassive aggressive\u201d That is not an appropriate way to express what I\u2019m feeling. Let\u2019s just say, I think that sentence of yours I was referring to could have been stated more kindly. As I read it, it felt very off-putting. 1 October 18th, 2017 at 8:58 am \nSorry you felt that way, Denise. It was not my intention. But you\u2019re right, I do sound cranky. That\u2019s what happens sometimes when I post comments late at night, so I apologize for that. \nAfter a good night\u2019s sleep, I think I now better understand your dilemma in trying to get people you may deal with off the SAD. It\u2019s been my experience that it\u2019s a slow very slow process. All you can do give them the information, & hope they get it. People have to decide for themselves what their criteria is. And unfortunately, as Dr. McDougall has said many times, people love to hear good things about their bad habits. \nIf you\u2019re interested in hearing more about industry bias, I\u2019d recommend watching Dr. G\u2019s series on lead (if you haven\u2019t already). \nThis series is comprised of about a dozen videos, but it\u2019s definitely worth taking the time. \nHappy watching, and I hope you have a peaceful day! 0 \nThank you Nancy for your last reply. There was no reply button for some reason, so I place it here. Peace to you as well. 1 October 19th, 2017 at 1:22 am \nI think the problem is that there is a huge and profitable market of people who want to be told that their high cholesterol is not a problem and that meat, cheese, butter and other food high in saturated fat are healthy. There are many people who are happy to pander to this market. How else can one explain why people like Atkins, Hyman etc top the best seller lists or Mercola\u2019s website is so popular? \nThe scientific information on nutrition and health is extensive and freely available. However, people don\u2019t want to be told to eat their vegetables or stop eating bacon. If they can find a doctor who can tell them they are perfectly safe eating butter and bacon, then why not believe them. However, if you take the time fact-check the claims made by these people, you will find that so many of them are simply false. \nFor example, Hyman claims that dietary saturated fat isn\u2019t a risk factor for heart disease and cherry picks some studies to support his claims. In fact the evidence identifying saturated fat as a risk factor is huge eg\u201cIn summary, randomized controlled trials that lowered intake of dietary saturated fat and replaced it with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduced CVD by \u224830%, similar to the reduction achieved by statin treatment. Prospective observational studies in many populations showed that lower intake of saturated fat coupled with higher intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat is associated with lower rates of CVD and of other major causes of death and all-cause mortality. In contrast, replacement of saturated fat with mostly refined carbohydrates and sugars is not associated with lower rates of CVD and did not reduce CVD in clinical trials. Replacement of saturatestates d with unsaturated fats lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a cause of atherosclerosis, linking biological evidence with incidence of CVD in populations and in clinical trials. Taking into consideration the totality of the scientific evidence, satisfying rigorous criteria for causality, we conclude strongly that lowering intake of saturated fat and replacing it with unsaturated fats, especially polyunsaturated fats, will lower the incidence of CVD.\u201d http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2017/06/15/CIR. 510 \nIn implying that high cholesterol isn\u2019t a problem he also states \u201cInterestingly, all of these patients who had heart attacks did not have high LDL or elevated total cholesterol. In fact, 75 percent of those people had \u201cnormal\u201d LDL cholesterol, with 50 percent having optimal LDL levels. So much for the high LDL contributing to heart attacks.\u201d http://drhyman.com/blog/2016/01/14/7-ways-to-optimize-cholesterol/ \nYes but what he doesn\u2019t tell us is that heart attacks lower cholesterol. Those people had l\u201dnormal\u201d or low cholesterol precisely because they had had a heart attack. Whether he is being deliberately misleading in order to cobble together an argument to justify eating saturated fat or whether he is just a very ignorant physician, is neither here nor there. They both mean that he is an unreliable source of information on nutrition and health. And lipids. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26233997 \nI\u2019d strongly suggest you start your research with major reports on nutrition and chronic disease from expert scientific panels established by eg the World Organization, the World Cancer Research Fund and the scientific advisory committee which produced a detailed report for the US dietary guidelines process. These reports are free to download and set out what the science shows. I consider the information on this site consistent with the findings of those reports. Claims by internet marketers and authors of popular books usually are not \u2013 they present views that are popular but contrary to the science. The arguments they offer are dangerous to one\u2019s health (but extremely lucrative). 1 \nTG, thank you for helping to keep the discussions on these posts from flying away from the science! Thank you! 0 October 17th, 2017 at 6:57 pm \nCarl, to clarify, there are not much conflicting info from the other non vegan doctors. All advocate a WFPB diet and in fact they talked about it more often than Dr G. The main differences are: \n\u2013 they debunk the false saturated fat and cholesterol theory, but none of them advocates gorging on fat but only eat a certain amount of fat. \n\u2013 They advocate eating a small amount of animal meat for optimal health, and they stress about what to eat and how to cook. This is very important or otherwise it may make eating animal foods harmful rather than beneficial. \n\u2013 They advocate eating real foods when possible but supplementing when necessary. \nThese are the main differences but from the standpoint of eating WFPB, there is no difference otherwise. 1 October 17th, 2017 at 10:48 pm \nI have never been much impressed by gurus even if they have a doctorate of some kind or other. \nPeople like Hyman and Mercola make a bundle from peddling their wares. Fact-checking their claims reveals some are false.. Other health gurus paint themselves into a corner by staking their reputation on a particular hypothesis and continue defending it even when the evidence disproves it \nYou are honestly better off reading reports on health and nutrition by expert panels of respected scientists convened by the likes of the World Health Organization and World Cancer Research Fund, and the scientific report of the US dietary guidelines advisory committee. \nhttps://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/ \nThe recommendations in those reports are not identical to those on the Nutritionfacts site (they don\u2019t consider supplement use for example) but they all agree that we should be eating more vegetables, fruits and whole grains and less red and processed meats and fewer refined carbohydrates. None of them recommend eating significant quantities of red meat or saturated fat. Unlike Hyman and Mercola. 7 October 18th, 2017 at 2:16 am \nOf course when TG wants to trash someone then he does not use scientific arguments but he resorts to profiling and stereotyping but of course it is selective trashing. \nDoes anyone want to book for this cruise? It\u2019s only around $4000 per person and you got a week to listen to cherry picked and biased lectures. October 18th, 2017 at 7:31 am \nJerry it is not that much , i got a room with balcony and including taxes and mandatory tip of 250 it came to under 4600 for two people . i could have saved about 400 if i had taken a cheaper room. 2 \nYes, Jerry, citing the evidence and referencing scientific reports and studies instead of internet marketers is \u201ctrashing@ people. \nYour beliefs about saturated fat are pseudoscientific hogwash as all the evidence shows. \nIt wouldn\u2019t be so bad if you merely presented them as your opinions instead of as absolute incontrovertible facts. It also wouldn\u2019t be so bad if you didn\u2019t spam almost every video and blog post with this nonsense. That just makes you look like an obsessive crank instead of a rational person with a different take on things. 1 \ncould you give a link to the podcasts please? 0 October 17th, 2017 at 5:41 pm \nRecently, researchers found that consuming a Mediterranean diet heavy in olive oil can help lower some heart risks. Consuming more than four tablespoons a day can significantly lower your risk of having a heart attack, suffering from a stroke or dying of heart disease, according to the recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. \nThis is what I found when I asked about the benefits/disadvantages of consuming olive oil. Confusing or what!!! 1 \nIt\u2019s not the olive oil\u2013it\u2019s the vegetables. 4 \nSoosie, can you cite the specific study you mentioned or post a link to it? Thanks! 2 \nYup that\u2019s what I mean?! Who do you believe? So conflicting. 0 \nIf so, the Med diet with OO or with OO and nuts cut risk compared to an unspecified diet. To quote: \nIn a multicenter trial in Spain, we randomly assigned participants who were at high cardiovascular risk, but with no   at enrollment, to one of three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a control diet (advice to reduce dietary fat). \nThat\u2019s hardly a surprise but since we have no idea what the control dieters ate, the results strike me as unhelpful for anyone on a whole food plant-based diet. 1 \nI have to amend what I said a bit. They did provide some dietary advice in both the med and control diets. From Table 1: \nFood Goal Tree nuts and peanuts\u2020 \u22653 servings/wk Fresh fruits \u22653 servings/day Fish (especially fatty fish), seafood \u22653 servings/wk Legumes \u22653 servings/wk White meat Instead of red meat Wine with meals (optionally, only for habitual drinkers) Commercial bakery goods, sweets, and pastries\u00a7 <3 servings/wk Spread fats <1 serving/day Red and processed meats <1 serving/day Low-fat diet (control) Low-fat dairy products \u22653 servings/day Bread, potatoes, pasta, rice \u22653 servings/day Fresh fruits \u22653 servings/day Lean fish and seafood \u22653 servings/wk Discouraged Vegetable oils (including olive oil) \u22642 tbsp/day Commercial bakery goods, sweets, and pastries\u00a7 \u22641 serving/wk Nuts and fried snacks \u22641 serving /wk Red and processed fatty meats \u22641 serving/wk Visible fat in meats and soups\u00b6 Always remove Fatty fish, seafood canned in oil \u22641 serving/wk Spread fats \u22641 serving/wk Low-fat dairy products \u22653 servings/day Bread, potatoes, pasta, rice \u22653 servings/day Fresh fruits \u22653 servings/day Lean fish and seafood \u22653 servings/wk \nDiscouraged Vegetable oils (including olive oil) \u22642 tbsp/day Commercial bakery goods, sweets, and pastries\u00a7 \u22641 serving/wk Nuts and fried snacks \u22641 serving /wk Red and processed fatty meats \u22641 serving/wk Visible fat in meats and soups\u00b6 Always remove Fatty fish, seafood canned in oil \u22641 serving/wk Spread fats \u22641 serving/wk October 17th, 2017 at 6:43 pm \nHi Dr Greger, Thanks for your excellent videos and articles.They are very encouraging for our plant-based family :-) \nI wanted to ask about skin health. For 5 years my husband and I ate only whole food sources of fats and my skin suffered terribly. Perhaps we were missing something? However now that we add rice bran, extra virgin olive, sesame or peanut oil to our meals (about 2 tbsp total for 4-6 serves) my skin has regained its subtleness. I appreciate the studies you share and would like to hear your suggestions for limiting or completely eliminating our oil intake without affecting my skin. \nThank you once again! \nInteresting. When I stopped using oil, my skin cleared up! 2 \nGood for u! I think I\u2019m just an anomaly haha 0 \nGreat idea, Tom. We do both (and did do this throughout our 5 year break from refined oil too). And yes, we take DHA daily. I was fascinated to learn how important it is for brain health. 2 October 17th, 2017 at 8:22 pm \nIt\u2019s fairly obvious when people eat processed foods or a SAD diet and get sick. However it is not so obvious when people care a lot about their health and do the best by eating a whole food plant based, but consume vegetable oil for the sake of \u201clow fat\u201d or spend a lot of money on expensive olive oil that went rancid because of time or heat. They also have low energy, low metabolism and low libido due to the \u201clow fat\u201d diet. These people get inflamed all over their body and have low energy and then get a heart attack despite having \u201cgood cholesterol\u201d. I feel so sorry for these people. 2 \nWhat is this obsession with drinking olive oil or using for cooking or in other ways that nature didn\u2019t intend us to do???? \nWhat is wrong with eating the whole olives? I do eat the olives themselves. \nOf course I don\u2019t cook anything except the red large beans and only for five minutes but otherwise I eat everything mostly raw including lots of olives the only thing done to them is to take the pit out. I eat about 40 olives a day usually blending them with other raw vegetables. 1 \nRichard \u2013 sorry, . . but I don\u2019t see anyone saying not to eat olives \u2026\u2026\u2026..where do you see this edict? Nowhere in Dr. G\u2019s video did he advocate not to eat whole olives. Where do you get this information? 0 \nI believe he\u2019s saying to eat the olives instead of the oil\u2013and I agree. 2 October 17th, 2017 at 10:09 pm \nLook, if saut\u00e9ing in a bit of oil helps you eat your veggies, use it! I have personally tried a very low fat, no oil diet and it is extremely difficult for me to sustain over a long period of time. \nPlus, there\u2019s really no reason to avoid oils for people who are healthy. I suppose if you are in poor cardiovascular health, you may need to restrict your oil consumption, but perhaps suggesting healthy people restrict their oils too will dissuade people from trying an otherwise healthy vegan diet. 4 \nWhat about hemp seed oil? 0 October 19th, 2017 at 6:22 am \nThanks for your question Trevor, \nI have tried looking for relevant research but could not find adverse effects reported but it definitely is not a necessary in our diet. 0 October 18th, 2017 at 12:09 pm \nHello Leah, Thank you for your question. I am a family doctor with a private practice in lifestyle medicine, and also a volunteer moderator for this website. It\u2019s a great question. There is some difference of opinion within the community of whole food plant-based practitioners about plant-based oils which are considered healthier \u2014 e.g. flaxseed oil, olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil. \nSome people, who I respect a lot, such as Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, who deal a lot with people with high cholesterol and coronary artery disease, encourage their patients to eat virtually zero refined oil of any kind, and even to eat only small amounts of nuts and seeds. Dr. G has done a video about how even extra virgin olive oil can impair artery function: https://nutritionfacts.org/video/olive-oil-and-artery-function/ . You\u2019ve probably seen this. \nHowever, there are some fats which are healthy and indeed essential: \u201cessential fatty acids\u201d. Without these, humans develop various deficiency symptoms. Dr. G. has done various videos over the years looking at this issue: 1) https://nutritionfacts.org/video/extra-virgin-olive-oil/ \u2014 old (2007), but discusses good vs. bad fat 2) https://nutritionfacts.org/video/forego-fat-free-dressings/ \u2014 about role of fat in absorbing nutrients 3) https://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-take-dha-supplements-to-boost-brain-function/ \u2014 nice summary about essential fats 4) https://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vegans-take-dha-to-preserve-brain-function/ \u2014 shows how DHA and EPA are essential for long-term preservation of brain function. \nMy wife has very low cholesterol, and she has found that her skin definitely is healthier (not so dry) if she eats some plant oils. \nSo, unless you have very high cholesterol and/or known coronary artery disease, I think that you should feel fine about consuming a small amount of \u201chealthy\u201d oils. This is what I tell most of my patients, and it\u2019s what we do in my family. \nOf course, you probably could get the same benefit by eating an equivalent quantity of nuts and seeds: peanuts, walnuts, flax-seed, and just avoid the refined oils altogether. \nI hope this helps. October 18th, 2017 at 10:43 pm \nHi, Dr. Jon\u2026 \nNathan Pritikin said something in one of his books that stuck in my mind. He characterized butters and oils as \u201cfree fats\u201d and gave me the idea that it was probably better to get my fats from food than from food processors. \nWorking backwards from there, I ran into some roadblocks\u2026\u201csalad,\u201d for example, and what to do about \u201cdressing.\u201d I decided to change the name to \u201cfingerfood\u201d and serve it in an oblong, shallow glass dish (Pyrex makes a nice one that comes with a rubber lid which makes it easy to make ahead and pop in the fridge) instead of a round bowl. I replaced olive oil with whole olives (the kind that don\u2019t have bad stuff added to them to make them look blacker) and a few walnut halves, added some sliced fresh mushrooms, carrots, celery, cucumbers and tomatoes to some bite-sized pieces of lettuce and kale and called it done. \nThe result? \nEverybody ate their \u201cfingerfood\u201d right down to the very last tidbit while they waited for dinner to be ready. \nAnd I didn\u2019t have a stack of greasy bowls to wash afterward! \n:) \nThe second roadblock was popcorn. \nThe challenge there was how to make my family\u2019s favorite snack without melted butter and salt. \nI decided to take a \u201cgradual\u201d approach. Spectrum makes a lovely spray coconut oil\u2013almost the same as butter, right?\u2013so I sprayed and sprinkled and tossed and before you know it, I had a big bowl of \u201cbuttered\u201d popcorn with Himalayan pink salt\u2026 which somebody told me has lots of trace minerals in it, although I\u2019m obliged to say I never got around to verifying that claim. \nThe result? \nNobody noticed. It disappeared just the same as always. \nSo I decided to gradually use less and less of both spray coconut oil and Himalayan pink salt until I wasn\u2019t using any at all. \nThe result? \nNobody noticed! It disappears just the same as always! \n:) \nThe third roadblock was toast. \nWith butter and jam. \nI got some Pomona Pectin\u2026 the kind that uses something other than sugar to \u201cgel\u201d\u2026 calcium water, I think, but don\u2019t quote me on that. \nThen I got a lemon, a 5-lb sack of frozen blueberries, a small bunch of grapes for a whisper of sweetening and made a big pot of blueberry jam. \nIt disappeared overnight! \nNobody bothered to make toast to put it on. They just ate the jam right out of the attractive little glass jars I got to put it in, along with some of those nifty white plastic lids that are easy for fumbling fingers to remove. They even pile it on their oatmeal in the morning! \n:) \nAs I look back over what I\u2019ve done to get as far as I\u2019ve gotten, I see places where I might have made better choices. I didn\u2019t have this website to assist me in sorting fact from fiction and truth from belief, but I have discovered something on my own about belief: \n1) A belief is something we make; \n2) We believe it *because* we made it; and \n3) That\u2019s why we can believe something no one else thinks is true. \nMyself, I didn\u2019t want to \u201cbelieve\u201d anything, whether it\u2019s about the benefits of extra virgin olive oil or whether the moon is made of cheese. \nI want to *know*\u2026 to understand *why* I was feeling so miserable so much of the time. \nBut just try to get a *reliable* answer to that question! \nFor every so-called \u201cauthority\u201d who says one thing, there\u2019s a dozen others who say just the opposite. \nHow is a person deficient in understanding such as myself to make sense of it all?!! \n:-) \nHelp with this actually came from an unexpected source\u2026 a retired veterinarian. She said that a sick animal can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s wrong. It can only look at you with big, sad eyes. \nWe, on the other hand, can tell a lot about its condition simply by focusing on the *direction* in which it seems to be going. \nThat is, does it seem to be getting better, or getting worse? \nYou try something\u2026 you observe\u2026 you try again\u2026 or you try something else\u2026 but always with that question in mind: \nIs it better? \nIs it worse? \nWhat you do next depends on the results of what you did last\u2026 on the *direction* the creature\u2019s health seems to be taking. \nWell, I\u2019m a creature, too, right? \nSo I started trying things and noticing the direction my health seemed to be taking as a result. \nFor example, I discovered that, if I had pizza for dinner, I felt *terrible* afterwards. \nDid it taste good? \nSure. \nBut it threw me into what I can only describe as a food coma afterward, so what \u201cdirection\u201d is that? \nGoing Wrong Way on Freeway! \n:-) \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you\u2026 I learned something from that popcorn experience. I feel so much better after I eat popcorn *without* added fat and salt that I\u2019ve taken to nibbling on a small bowl of it right along with my soothing soup of beans and rice and finely chopped onions. After all, it\u2019s corn, right? And corn and beans have been a winning combination since time immemorial, right? And it\u2019s my understanding that popcorn hasn\u2019t gone all GMO like the other kinds of corn\u2013not yet, anyway\u2013so why not serve it with beans? It\u2019s a lot less fuss, muss and bother than making corn tortillas! \n:) \nWith respect to the health of her skin, your wife seems to have done something similar to what I\u2019ve been doing. That is, she removed \u201cfree fats\u201d from her diet and then, after some time had passed, began to notice that the condition of her skin was going in the wrong direction\u2026 getting worse instead of better, in other words. So she tried putting some plant oils back in\u2026 et voil\u00e0! \nDirection corrected! \nSimple! \n:-) \nMyself, I stick as closely as I can to things that only have to be peeled or cooked before I can eat them. For example, since replacing olive oil with whole olives in salads, I\u2019ve switched to simply peeling an avocado and putting chunks of that on my \u201cfingerfood\u201d instead of olives because I have to open a can to eat olives and opening cans isn\u2019t on my list of the two things I do these days before I eat! \nSimple! \n:-) \nThank you for weighing in on this, Dr. Jon. I really appreciate it, and I\u2019m sure others do, too. \nwarmest regards\u2026", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "greger", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chryst", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "michael greger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "mediterranean", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T16:56:48.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5b56c3902c10aad2b3d522bb1f7da0717d8706ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2sXsDupUmNE1cC9csbR9wCugj5Q9ODlxIePwpsCObKkKf0iTIfs3n3w--", "site_full": "nutritionfacts.org", "site": "nutritionfacts.org", "site_section": "http://nutritionfacts.org/feed", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "health", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "NutritionFacts.org", "title": "Who Should Avoid Coffee?", "title_full": "Who Should Avoid Coffee?", "published": "2017-10-19T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2017/10/Oct-19-Coffee-1200x675.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23349, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5b56c3902c10aad2b3d522bb1f7da0717d8706ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2sXsDupUmNE1cC9csbR9wCugj5Q9ODlxIePwpsCObKkKf0iTIfs3n3w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM", "published": "2017-10-19T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Who Should Avoid Coffee?", "text": "Image Credit: Giuliano Griffante   Who Should Avoid Coffee?   19th, 2017 \nDo coffee drinkers live longer than non-coffee drinkers? Is it \u201cwake up and smell the coffee\u201d or don\u2019t wake up at all? I discuss these questions in my video , Coffee and Mortality . \nThe largest study ever conducted on diet and health put that question to the test, examining the association between coffee drinking and subsequent mortality among hundreds of thousands of older men and women in the United States. Coffee drinkers won, though the effect was modest, a 10-15% lower risk of death for those drinking six or more cups a day. This was due specifically to lower risk of dying from heart disease, respiratory disease, stroke, injuries and accidents, diabetes, and infections. \nHowever, in another study that amount of coffee was found to increase the death rate of younger people under age 55. It may be appropriate, then, to recommend that you avoid drinking more than four cups a day. But if you review all the studies, the bottom line is that coffee consumption is associated with no change or a small reduction in mortality starting around one or two cups a day, for both men and women. The risk of dying was 3% lower for each cup of coffee consumed daily, which provides reassurance for the concern that coffee drinking might adversely affect health, or at least longevity. \nA recent population study found no link between coffee consumption and symptoms of GERD, reflux diseases such as heartburn and regurgitation. If you actually stick a tube down people\u2019s throats and measure pH, though, coffee induces significant acid reflux, whereas tea does not. Is this just because tea has less caffeine? No. If you reduce the caffeine content of the coffee down to that of tea, coffee still causes significantly more acid reflux. Decaf causes even less, so GERD patients might want to choose decaffeinated coffee or, even better, opt for tea. \nCoffee intake is also associated with urinary incontinence , so a decrease in caffeine intake should be discussed with patients who have the condition. About two cups of coffee a day worth of caffeine may worsen urinary leakage . \nA 2014 meta-analysis suggested that daily coffee consumption was associated with a slightly increased risk of bone fractures in women, but a decreased risk of fractures in men. However, no significant association was found between coffee consumption and the risk of hip fracture specifically. Tea consumption may actually protect against hip fracture, though it appears to have no apparent relationship with fracture risk in general. \nCertain populations, in particular, may want to stay away from caffeine, including those with glaucoma or a family history of glaucoma, individuals with epilepsy , and, not surprisingly, people who have trouble sleeping . Even a single cup at night can cause a significant deterioration in sleep quality. \nWe used to think caffeine might increase the risk of an irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, but that was based on anecdotal case reports like one of a young woman who suffered atrial fibrillation after \u201cchocolate intake abuse.\u201d These cases invariably involved the acute ingestion of very large quantities of caffeine. As a result, the notion that caffeine ingestion may trigger abnormal heart rhythms had become \u201ccommon knowledge,\u201d and this assumption led to changes in medical practice. \nWe now have evidence that caffeine does not increase the risk of atrial fibrillation. Low-dose caffeine\u2014defined as less than about five cups of coffee a day\u2014may even have a protective effect. Tea consumption also appears to lower cardiovascular disease risk, especially when it comes to stroke. But given the proliferation of energy drinks that contain massive quantities of caffeine, one might temper any message that suggests that caffeine is beneficial. Indeed, 12 highly caffeinated energy drinks within a few hours could be lethal.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "giuliano griffante", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T16:06:58.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cdddd41b207f9d634bb1bea035ed424cbf863eea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlDLBzXYialrD0.ZgAWK4VNbxQR561JpZhGFjerfAng..Q--", "site_full": "nutritionfacts.org", "site": "nutritionfacts.org", "site_section": "http://nutritionfacts.org/feed?post_type=video", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "health", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Videos \u2013 NutritionFacts.org", "title": "The Best Diet for Fibroids", "title_full": "The Best Diet for Fibroids", "published": "2017-10-18T14:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2017/10/38-16-The-Best-Diet-for-Fibroids-1200x675.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23349, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cdddd41b207f9d634bb1bea035ed424cbf863eea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlDLBzXYialrD0.ZgAWK4VNbxQR561JpZhGFjerfAng..Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM", "published": "2017-10-18T14:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Best Diet for Fibroids", "text": "The Best Diet for Fibroids 4.89 (97.89%) 38 votes \nThe same diet that helps regulate hormones in women may also reduce exposure to endocrine-disrupting pollutants.   \n\u201c\u2026[F]ibroids\u2026are the most common benign tumours in women.\u201d They can get up to a foot in diameter, and affect the majority of women before they hit menopause. They \u201ctend to be asymptomatic,\u201d though, but when symptoms do occur, they tend to manifest as \u201cheavy menstrual bleeding\u201d\u2014so much so, women may get anemic, and lots of pain. \nSo, what can women do? Up to half go for surgery, and get their entire uterus removed. Although it\u2019s \u201cgenerally considered a safe operation,\u201d obviously, you can\u2019t have kids any more, and complications occur in a significant proportion of patients. The alternative is a variety of hormone-modulating drugs, which can shrink the fibroids and provide relief, but many of these drugs have significant side effects, like bone loss. So, you really don\u2019t want to be taking them for more than a few months. And so, bottom line: \u201cThere is currently no evidence to support the routine use of [drug] treatment in women [for] fibroids.\u201d No wonder many women turn to \u201ccomplementary and alternative treatments,\u201d such as exercise, diet, herbs, and acupuncture. \nWomen who exercise seven or more hours a week do seem to have lower risk of having fibroids than women who exercise less than like 20 minutes a day. But, it\u2019s never been put to the test for treating fibroids. And likewise, there\u2019s not a single randomized controlled trial of acupuncture for the treatment of fibroids, to date, to help guide us. \nIn terms of herbs, there are two Asian herbal preparations that show promise: a five-herb combo called Guizhi Fuling, and a Malaysian ten-herb formula, which contains \u201csecret\u201d ingredients\u2014 so secret, they just list them. But, seemed to work as well as the leading drug. The problem is that traditional Asian herbal remedies may contain a few extra bonus secret ingredients\u2014like \u201carsenic, mercury, and lead\u2026in most of the samples\u201d tested off Asian market and health food store shelves. And not just a little; some, apparently, had really toxic amounts. So, yeah, these two Asian herbal preparations \u201cmay reduce fibroid size, but there [remains] insufficient evidence [as to their] safety.\u201d And, certainly, don\u2019t try to apply caustic herbs internally, as this can lead to \u201cscarring,\u2026stenosis, [and] ulceration.\u201d \nOkay, but what about diet? In one of the largest studies of diet and fibroids, fibroid tumors were \u201cassociated with beef and ham consumption, whereas high intake of green vegetables seem[ed] to have a protective effect.\u201d They figured that the \u201cassociation between\u2026estrogen, diet, and breast and [uterine-lining] cancers [might] help us understand [why]. For breast and endometrial cancers, [there\u2019s] a [similar] direct association with the frequency of [meat] consumption,\u201d with a similar \u201cprotection\u2026conferred by\u2026vegetables and fruits.\u201d Thus, there may be these shared risk factors between estrogen-responsive malignant tumors, like breast cancer, and estrogen-responsive benign tumors, like fibroids. \nSee, we know the presence of fibroids seems to correlate with an increase in the amount of estrogens, for example, flowing through your body, and women eating vegetarian have significantly lower levels of excess estrogen. Now, they\u2019re using this to try to explain why there are \u201clower rates of endometrial cancer [meaning lining-of-the-uterus cancer] and possibly breast cancer\u201d among those eating vegetarian. \nBut, it could also help explain the fibroid findings. \u201cThe incidence of breast cancer among vegetarian\u2026Adventists is [only] 60 to 80 per cent [that of] American women in general,\u201d and the incidence among women in Africa and Asia is even lower.\u201d Why might women eating vegetarian have lower estrogen levels? This famous study in the New England Journal concluded that it was their \u201cincreased fecal output [that] leads to increased\u2026excretion of estrogen,\u201d resulting in lower blood levels. Double the output, in fact. You can see all the heavyweight Vs compared to the welterweight omnivores. \nAnd, you can put it to the test. Maybe the same reason African-American women have more fibroids is the same reason they have worse breast cancer survival: too much estrogen in their bloodstream, due to a less-than-optimal diet. So, researchers designed this study to see what would happen if they were switched to a more plant-based, higher-fiber diet. The women started out with much higher estrogen levels, again helping to explain their \u201cincreased mortality from breast cancer.\u201d But, put people on a healthier diet, and all their levels come down, suggesting \u201ca substantial reduction in breast cancer risk can be achieved\u201d by adopting a diet centered around more whole plant foods. And, the same appears to be true for fibroids, especially eating lots of cruciferous vegetables\u2014broccoli, cabbage, and Chinese cabbage, as well as tomatoes and apples. \nWomen who underwent premature puberty\u2014starting their periods \u201cbefore age 11\u2033\u2014may also be at increased risk of fibroids later in life, and we know higher childhood red meat intake is associated with earlier age of starting one\u2019s period, though \u201ctotal and animal protein\u201d in general may contribute. For example, girls who eat meat tend to start their periods about six months earlier than girls who eat vegetarian. Those that eat \u201cmeat analogues\u201d\u2014meaning like veggie burgers, veggie dogs\u2014started their periods \u201c9 months later\u201d on average, and a similar puberty-normalizing influence was found with consumption of whole plant foods, such as beans. \nIt could also be the endocrine-disrupting pollutants that build up the food chain. Researchers took samples of internal abdominal fat from women, and there appeared to be a correlation between the presence of fibroids with the levels of a number of PCBs in their fat. \nSo, does that mean fish-eaters have higher risk of fibroids? Researchers did find a \u201csmall increase\u2026[of] risk associated with [the] intake\u2026of long-chain omega-3 fat[s],\u201d mostly from \u201cdark-meat fish consumption,\u201d by which they meant like sardines and salmon. This could be because of \u201cthe endocrine-disrupting chemicals commonly [found] in fish,\u201d or it could just be a statistical fluke. It would be consistent, though, with the \u201cincreased risk [among] sport-fish consumers.\u201d They\u2019re talking about this study. \nRecognizing that \u201c[d]iet and endocrine-disrupting persistent organic pollutants have been associated with [a variety of] gynecologic conditions including [fibroids],\u201d they\u2019ve looked at consumers of fish fished out of the Great Lakes, and found a 20% increased risk for every ten years they had been eating the fish. This is the most comprehensive study to date. They compared pollutant levels in fat samples of women with fibroids, compared to fat liposuctioned out of women without fibroids\u2014and didn\u2019t just find higher levels of PCBs in fibroid sufferers, but also long-banned pesticides, like DDT and hexachlorocyclohexane, PAHs\u2014polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons formed when coal is burned, tobacco is smoked, and meat is grilled, as well as heavy metals, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury, levels which correlated not only to fibroids but to seafood consumption or excess body fat. So, \u201cshedding excess weight and limiting seafood consumption [might] confer a protective effect on [fibroid tumor] development\u201d by minimizing \u201cexposure to environmental pollutants as much as possible.\u201d \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "new england journal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "great lakes", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T20:42:15.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae829b218f2aeb71122044a8ec277c816a3e94a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlDLBzXYialrD_TkU_61ZOsmxBT4SbE_w5qPpuPwOrajyw--", "site_full": "nutritionfacts.org", "site": "nutritionfacts.org", "site_section": "http://nutritionfacts.org/feed?post_type=video", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "health", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Videos \u2013 NutritionFacts.org", "title": "The Best Food for Fibroids", "title_full": "The Best Food for Fibroids", "published": "2017-10-20T14:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2017/10/38-17-The-Best-Food-for-Fibroids-1200x675.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23349, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae829b218f2aeb71122044a8ec277c816a3e94a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlDLBzXYialrD_TkU_61ZOsmxBT4SbE_w5qPpuPwOrajyw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM", "published": "2017-10-20T14:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Best Food for Fibroids", "text": "The Best Food for Fibroids 4.74 (94.86%) 35 votes \nWomen with uterine fibroids should consider adding green tea to their daily diet, as a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled interventional trial suggests it may help as well as surgery. Subscribe to Videos   \nWhat about dietary phytochemicals as a possible preventive and therapeutic option for uterine fibroids, plant based compounds with disease-preventive properties, found in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, bean, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils, herbs, spices, nuts, and certain beverages. The thought is, look, we know they can help regulate the initiation, promotion, and spread of cancerous tumors; so, what about benign tumors like fibroids? Most anti-cancer drugs on the market now, for example, were originally derived from plants or plant products; so, why not try to use plants to target the inflammation or blood supply of fibroids? Might fibroids be a consequence of chronic inflammation within the body? Well, we know that women with fibroids are more likely to eat more beef and ham, and fewer fruits and green vegetables, but whole plant foods don\u2019t just have anti-  but antioxidant effects as well. When the amount of free radicals exceeds the protective effects of antioxidants, oxidative damage will occur, which has been implicated in a variety of disease states, including gynecological conditions, such as fibroids. \nIf you collect fresh fibroids, as well as normal uterine tissue from hysterectomy surgeries, the fibroid cells have significantly fewer antioxidant enzymes; so, might antioxidant rich foods help? Well, if you drip some strawberries in a petri dish, you can apparently kill of some fibroid tumor cells, while leaving normal uterus cells alone. But, what good does that do us. That\u2019s only relevant if we can show those strawberry compounds   gut and achieve high enough concentrations in uterine tissue. The same with curcumin, the component of the spice turmeric. One of its so-called \u201cmiraculous\u201d properties is suppressing the growth of uterine fibroid cells, but again that was just in vitro. Yes, an inhibitory effect was found, and at concentrations that don\u2019t compromise the growth of regular uterine tissue. But, my patients are people, not petri dishes. \nI mean, it\u2019s neat to see what happens to human fibroid cells as you drip higher and higher concentrations of green tea compounds on them in a test tube, but I care less about what happens in vitro, or in mice, whether or not they have any clothes on. But there were no randomized, controlled clinical studies until, now, or at least 2013. \nSubjects were randomized to green tea extract or placebo for 4 months. In the placebo group, fibroid volume increased 24%. That\u2019s what fibroids do, they continue to grow; however, those randomized to the green tea group showed a reduction in total fibroid volume, and not just by a little, a dramatic decrease\u2014shrunk almost a third\u2013a highly significant difference. OK. But, did the women feel any better? Yes, a dramatic decrease in symptom severity, as well. In the placebo group, nothing much happened month after month, but in those taking the same-looking pill that happened to contain green tea compounds inside, consistent improvement, with women feeling lessening symptoms, each month better than the last. And, with that, an improved health-related quality of life month after month, significantly better than control. And, their blood counts got better too. The blood levels kept decreasing in the placebo group with all that continued excess blood loss every month. But, blood counts reversed in the green tea group. So, anemia significantly improved, because average blood flow significantly diminished. And, all this\u2014the fibroid shrinkage, less pain, better periods\u2014 with no adverse effects. \nSo, not only results comparable to those for the drugs that are commonly used\u2014without the side effects, but comparable results to uterine artery embolization, where they try to cut the blood supply to the fibroid, which is great\u2014unless you accidently cut the blood supply to the rest of the uterus and cause uterine necrosis, one of many reported major complications, which also include death, not only of the fibroid but of the patient and other potential complications that may arise from accidently clogging off non-target arteries. So, a side effect free solution as good as a more invasive procedure is potentially better than in my book. They conclude that green tea compounds show promise as a safe and effective therapeutic agent for women with symptomatic fibroids. Such a simple, inexpensive, and relatively safe therapy could improve women\u2019s health globally. \nNow, relatively safe doesn\u2019t mean risk-free. Although there were no liver function abnormalities detected, this was a small study. If you give green tea extract pills to a thousand women for a year, like they did in this breast cancer trial, in about 1 in 17 women, their liver started to get inflamed, a few of which became serious. Now, the dose they used in this study was twice that of the fibroid study; and, it\u2019s not completely clear if the pills were the only cause. But, in general, we should try to avoid extracts and get nutrition in foods as grown, or at least foods as grown dunked in hot water, like green tea. Now, they had to use pills in this study, because they wanted it to be a double-blind study, and it\u2019s hard to create a fake placebo tea that looks, smells, and tastes like the real thing. So, I don\u2019t think we should take green tea extract pills; we should drink green tea. The problem is that the dose they used was like 11 cups a day worth, which would be a lot of caffeine. But, you could choose decaf, and it\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility to drink a couple quarts of tea a day, especially if it\u2019s going to shrink your fibroids so much you can keep your uterus or something. Though, for all we know, five cups of tea would work or three cups or one cup a day\u2014no other dose has been tested. But, you can test it in your own life. If you have fibroids, it couldn\u2019t hurt to add a few cups of green tea to your daily diet and see if you start feeling better. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-20T18:12:28.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bbf4d00856e93df3701880637e8a84b4b0e61fe8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlDP0T2barLo1ASVWYM2xiBL7Ap30JJMXEw-", "site_full": "nutritionfacts.org", "site": "nutritionfacts.org", "site_section": "http://nutritionfacts.org/feed?post_type=video", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "health", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Videos \u2013 NutritionFacts.org", "title": "Are Avocados Healthy?", "title_full": "Are Avocados Healthy?", "published": "2017-10-23T14:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2017/10/38-18-Are-Avocados-Healthy-1200x675.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23349, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bbf4d00856e93df3701880637e8a84b4b0e61fe8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlDP0T2barLo1ASVWYM2xiBL7Ap30JJMXEw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM", "published": "2017-10-23T14:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Are Avocados Healthy?", "text": "  \nIn my last video about avocados, I described the anti-  and cholesterol- and triglyceride-lowering effects. But what about that video I did years ago about the chromosome-damaging effects in a petri dish? That all goes back to 1975, when a pesticide naturally produced by the avocado tree was discovered\u2014thought to explain why lactating livestock suffered mammary gland damage nibbling on the leaves. The toxin was named persin, also found to be damaging to the heart, which is why you should never feed avocado to your pet birds. \nBut hey, if it attacks mammary cells in animals, might it attack breast cancer cells in humans? It did seem to have the same kind of cell cytoskeleton-clumping effect in vitro that chemotherapy can have, demonstrating potent cell growth-stopping and -killing effects of the \u201cnovel plant toxin\u201d among various lines of human breast cancer cells. So, they\u2019re thinking about how it might one day be used as chemo itself. But, here I am thinking \u201cHoly guacamole, Batman; please tell me it doesn\u2019t have toxic effects on normal cells, too.\u201d \nIn 2010, we got an answer: an \u201cEvaluation of [the] Genotoxicity,\u201d the toxicity to our chromosomes, of avocado extracts on human white blood cells in a petri dish. Normally, less than 10% of our dividing cells have any chromosome abnormalities, but drip some avocado fruit extracts on them, and up to half come out defective in some way. They conclude that there\u2019s something in avocado fruit that \u201ccan potentially induce significant genomic instability and some genetic damage\u201d in human white blood cells in a petri dish. If the same effect occurs in actual people, it could, for example, result in transforming cells into cancer. That\u2019s a big if, though. \nThese were blood cells. You don\u2019t inject guac into the vein. For anything to get into our bloodstream, it first has to survive our stomach acid,   intestines, and sneak past our liver\u2019s detoxification enzymes. And indeed, persin may be affected, changed, by acidic conditions. So, given all the differences between what happens in a petri dish and a person, \u201cit is essential to carry out [further] studies\u2026before making a final remark\u201d about its toxicity. Okay, but what do you do before these studies come out? I was concerned enough that I provisionally moved it from a stuff-your-face green-light food, to a moderate-your-intake yellow-light food, until we knew more, to err on the side of caution. \nEven if persin was utterly destroyed by stomach acid, what about oral cancer? At high-enough concentrations, avocado extracts can harm the growth of the kinds of cells that line our mouths. Yeah, but this is in a petri dish, where the avocado is coming in direct contact with the cells. But that\u2019s kinda what happens in your mouth when you eat it. But, it harms oral cancer cells even more. Here\u2019s a bunch of oral cancer cells. Those red dots are the mitochondria\u2014the power plants of the cells fueling cancer growth, extinguished by the avocado extract. But, since it does this more to cancerous than normal cells, they end up concluding avocados may end up preventing cancer. \nWhat about the esophagus, which lies between the mouth and the stomach? They similarly found that an \u201cavocado fruit extract [appeared to inhibit] cancer cell growth\u201d more than normal cell growth, when it came to colon cancer cells, or esophageal cancer cells. But, rather than comparing the effects to normal colon and esophagus cells, they compared to a type of blood cell, which again is of limited relevance in a petri dish study of something you eat. \nThis study was pretty exciting, though. It looked at p -cresol, which is a \u201curemic toxin,\u201d may also be toxic to the liver, has been found associated with autism, and it comes from eating high-protein diets, whereas if you eat a more plant-based diet, the only source of prebiotics, like fiber and resistant starch, your levels go down. \nSee, \u201cfermentation of carbohydrates [in the colon, like fiber] is considered beneficial, whereas fermentation of [protein] [which is called] (putrefaction) is considered\u2026detrimental.\u201d So, you switch people to a high-protein diet, and within days, the excess protein putrefying in their gut leads to an increase in ammonia, as well as p-cresol\u2014in fact, a doubling of levels within a week. But, might phytonutrient-rich plant foods, like \u201capples, cranberries, grapes, [or] avocados,\u2026protect [the cells lining our colon] from the deleterious effects of p -cresol\u2026in terms of cell viability, mitochondrial function, and epithelial integrity,\u201d meaning like protection against gut leakiness? \nHere\u2019s that data on barrier function integrity, damaged by p -cresol, but rescued by all the cranberry, avocado, grape, and apple extracts, though mitochondrial function was only improved by the cranberries and avocados, and they were also the only ones that appeared to prevent the \u201cdeleterious effect of p -cresol\u201d on colon cell viability. But, bottom line, avocados appear to have beneficial effects on colon-lining cells; so, that\u2019s a good sign. \nOkay, but enough of these in vitro studies, already. Yes, an avocado extract can inhibit cancer cell growth in a petri dish, but unless you\u2019re doing some unspeakable things to that avocado\u2014like guacamole with benefits, there\u2019s no way that the avocado is going to come in direct contact with your prostate cells. So, what does this study mean? \nThat\u2019s why I was so excited to see this study: \u201cthe first\u201d to actually look for a link between \u201cavocado consumption [actual human beings eating avocados] and prostate cancer.\u201d So, do avocado eaters have more cancer risk, or less cancer risk? We\u2019ll find out\u2014right now! \nMen who ate the most avocado, more than about a third of an avocado a day, \u201creduced [their] risk of prostate cancer.\u201d In fact, less than half the odds. So, with the data on improved artery function, lower cholesterol, and, if anything, an association with decreased cancer risk, I\u2019d suggest moving it back into the green zone. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "batman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "green zone", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-24T08:02:10.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7cc1eb3dd71919fc658fb6a1fbd7412774181729", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2sXsDupUmNE11Hj9STVDAcHOtfUt0cOKDVpqkEAEq5nBnugI_K6bG7nJmQu8UaOzIvkdiKu7rNvI-", "site_full": "nutritionfacts.org", "site": "nutritionfacts.org", "site_section": "http://nutritionfacts.org/feed", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "health", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "NutritionFacts.org", "title": "Foods to Avoid to Help Prevent Diabetes", "title_full": "Foods to Avoid to Help Prevent Diabetes", "published": "2017-10-24T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2017/10/Oct-24-Foods-to-Avoid-1200x675.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23349, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7cc1eb3dd71919fc658fb6a1fbd7412774181729", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2sXsDupUmNE11Hj9STVDAcHOtfUt0cOKDVpqkEAEq5nBnugI_K6bG7nJmQu8UaOzIvkdiKu7rNvI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM", "published": "2017-10-24T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Foods to Avoid to Help Prevent Diabetes", "text": "Home > Dr. Greger\u2019s Medical Nutrition Blog > Foods to Avoid to Help Prevent Diabetes Image Credit: TV Brasil EBC   Foods to Avoid to Help Prevent Diabetes   24th, 2017 \nWe\u2019ve known that being overweight and obese are important risk factors for type 2 diabetes, but, until recently, not much attention has been paid to the role of specific foods. I discuss this issue in my video, Why Is Meat a Risk Factor for Diabetes? \nA 2013 meta-analysis of all the cohorts looking at the connection between meat and diabetes found a significantly higher risk associated with total meat consumption\u2013\u2013especially consumption of processed meat, particularly poultry. But why? There\u2019s a whole list of potential culprits in meat: saturated fat, animal fat, trans fats naturally found in meat, cholesterol, or animal protein. It could be the heme iron found in meat, which can lead to free radicals and iron-induced oxidative stress that may lead to chronic inflammation and type 2 diabetes, or advanced glycation end (AGE) products, which promote oxidative stress and inflammation. Food analyses show that the highest levels of these so-called glycotoxins are found in meat\u2014particularly roasted, fried, or broiled meat, though any foods from animal sources (and even high fat and protein plant foods such as nuts) exposed to high dry temperatures can be potent sources of these pro-oxidant chemicals. \nIn another study , researchers fed diabetics glycotoxin-packed foods, like chicken, fish, and eggs, and their inflammatory markers\u2013\u2013tumor necrosis factor, C-reactive protein, and vascular adhesion molecules\u2013\u2013shot up. \u201cThus, in diabetes, environmental (dietary) AGEs promote inflammatory mediators, leading to tissue injury.\u201d The good news is that restriction of these kinds of foods may suppress these inflammatory effects. Appropriate measures to limit AGE intake, such as eliminating meat or using only steaming and boiling as methods for cooking it, \u201cmay greatly reduce the already heavy burden of these toxins in the diabetic patient.\u201d These glycotoxins may be the missing link between the increased consumption of animal fat and meats and the development of type 2 diabetes. \nSince the 2013 meta-analysis was published, another study came out in which approximately 17,000 people were followed for about a dozen years. Researchers found an 8% increased risk for every 50 grams of daily meat consumption. Just one quarter of a chicken breast\u2019s worth of meat for the entire day may significantly increase the risk of diabetes. Yes, we know there are many possible culprits: the glycotoxins or trans fat in meat, saturated fat, or the heme iron (which could actually promote the formation of carcinogens called nitrosamines, though they could also just be produced in the cooking process itself). However, we did learn something new: There also appears to be a greater incidence of diabetes among those who handle meat for a living. Maybe there are some diabetes-causing zoonotic infectious agents\u2013\u2013such as viruses\u2013\u2013present in fresh cuts of meat, including poultry. \nA \u201ccrucial factor underlying the diabetes epidemic\u201d may be the overstimulation of the aging enzyme TOR pathway by excess food consumption\u2013\u2013but not by the consumption of just any food: Animal proteins not only stimulate the cancer-promoting hormone insulin growth factor-1 but also provide high amounts of leucine, which stimulates TOR activation and appears to contribute to the burning out of the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, contributing to type 2 diabetes. So, it\u2019s not just the high fat and added sugars that are implicated; critical attention must be paid to the daily intake of animal proteins as well. \nAccording to a study, \u201c[i]n general, lower leucine levels are only reached by restriction of animal proteins.\u201d To reach the leucine intake provided by dairy or meat, we\u2019d have to eat 9 pounds of cabbage or 100 apples to take an extreme example. That just exemplifies the extreme differences in leucine amounts provided by a more standard diet in comparison with a more plant-based diet. \nI reviewed the role endocrine-disrupting industrial pollutants in the food supply may play in a three-part video series: Fish and Diabetes , Diabetes and Dioxins , and Pollutants in Salmon and Our Own Fat . Clearly, the standard America diet and lifestyle contribute to the epidemic of diabetes and obesity, but the contribution of these industrial pollutants can no longer be ignored. We now have experimental evidence that exposure to industrial toxins alone induces weight gain and insulin resistance, and, therefore, may be an underappreciated cause of obesity and diabetes. Consider what\u2019s happening to our infants: Obesity in a six-month-old is obviously not related to diet or lack of exercise. They\u2019re now exposed to hundreds of chemicals from their moms, straight through the umbilical cord, some of which may be obesogenic (that is, obesity-generating). \nThe millions of pounds of chemicals and heavy metals released every year into our environment should make us all stop and think about how we live and the choices we make every day in the foods we eat. A 2014 review of the evidence on pollutants and diabetes noted that we can be exposed through toxic spills, but \u201cmost of the human exposure nowadays is from the ingestion of contaminated food as a result of bioaccumulation up the food chain. The main source (around 95%) of [persistent pollutant] intake is through dietary intake of animal fats.\u201d \nFor more on the information mentioned here, see the following videos that take a closer look at these major topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "greger", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "brasil ebc   foods", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-24T16:54:25.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "55cc7b2b6fc44ce9556376aa3463262d451cfd26", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlD_b87wIH4T9hEBdoZWPURfCEqc8kG2Zeh1IyHjejjAG_f3bEi8Ri5Sj.MM7AQZkhrbXCj8d3z5IhcYCd8vfvCwfNjMs_z2tcA-", "site_full": "nutritionfacts.org", "site": "nutritionfacts.org", "site_section": "http://nutritionfacts.org/feed?post_type=video", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "health", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Videos \u2013 NutritionFacts.org", "title": "Culture Shock \u2013 Questioning the Efficacy and Safety of Probiotics", "title_full": "Culture Shock \u2013 Questioning the Efficacy and Safety of Probiotics", "published": "2017-10-25T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2017/10/38-19-Culture-Shock-Questioning-the-Efficacy-and-Safety-of-Probiotics-1200x675.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23349, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "55cc7b2b6fc44ce9556376aa3463262d451cfd26", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlD_b87wIH4T9hEBdoZWPURfCEqc8kG2Zeh1IyHjejjAG_f3bEi8Ri5Sj.MM7AQZkhrbXCj8d3z5IhcYCd8vfvCwfNjMs_z2tcA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM", "published": "2017-10-25T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Culture Shock \u2013 Questioning the Efficacy and Safety of Probiotics", "text": "October 26th, 2017 at 12:47 pm \nGreat, untainted material as always. You are a treasure Doc! (first time commenter, long time \u201clistener\u201d) \nAs for the subject here, I feel is a window into a new view of health and so I feel compelled to add some generalities, and specifics to the discussion from peanut gallery (i.e. non-professional). It would be a pity if those already inclined to an excessively sanitized view of health, misread this to suggest that bacteria aren\u2019t a crucial partner in keeping us healthy that we have drastically misunderstood in the past. \nIn terms of generalities, this is pertinent to the rapidly evolving knowledge of the microbiome, and the vast antimicrobial resistance topic (on pace to kill more people than cancer by 2050 as per http://www.fairr.org ) among others. The studies on fecal transplant therapy for C. dificile are astounding examples of how much we can achieve letting nature take us back to school on a subject of our complex relationships with microorganisms that hasn\u2019t been settled science since the Bechamp/Pasteur rift 150 years ago. \nOn specifics, I would hazard a guess that a huge % of what is peddled out there in the probiotic market contain low and/or variable levels of live cultures which could create all manner of unpredictable outcomes. Which strains makes sense is also poorly understood thus far too, and with so many theoretically available, \u201cprobiotics\u201d as an umbrella term might be argued to have already \u201cjumped the shark\u201d. \nThe business end of this hot topic is likely to produce as much garbage as the supplement and pharma industries and biased research clouding matters all the while. Microbiome venture capital funds sprung up years ago in a greedy scramble that is uninterested or blind to the fact that our knowledge here is clearly in its infancy, and nature, not human ingenuity, should be the chief source of rebuilding our understanding here from the ground up (pun very much intended). The irony of the astounding harm shortsightedness and ignorance have caused in the modern medical paradigm (monstrosity?), and this familiar gold rush mentality to profit before understanding certainly has Hippocrates rolling over in his grave (yet again). \nThat said, the foundational shift towards a deeper understanding of our symbiotic nature and the reality of some amount of coevolution are critical, fascinating and exciting. We are still deeply invested in the dominant efforts to denude our world and our bodies, but it seems impossible it will continue given the apocalyptic trajectory of AMR (again, I recommend the resources at http://www.fairr.org ). The folly of antibacterial everything (topically), and the insanity of drowning our bodies and our food (via animal feed) in the profit driven madness of oceans of antibiotics will reverberate for decades to come even if we let brilliant, honest doctors like yourself and many others take the lead starting tomorrow. \nSo however we manage to reignite the right complex dance of bacteria, fungi, and parasites to play their respective roles in our lives, it seems clear we need to do so somehow and somehow spread the understanding that we should never disturb this balance without a compelling reason to do so. \nI\u2019m sure you have and will continue to be on the case distilling the research that aims to decipher the formula. But in the meanwhile, felt it was important from the relative freedom of a layman\u2019s perspective to cut through what might be years of groping for answers in the highly compromised arena of medical research, and snake oil peddlers to defend the foundational point underneath the probiotics craze: that we have been fumbling in the dark on some of the biggest concepts in medical science and health all along. And nature, in all her dirty, bacteria laden splendor, is patiently waiting for us to shut up and listen. \n(FWIW I have occasionally supplemented probiotics from a few carefully selected sources, but mainly eat lots of foods that contain high amounts of little goodies. I also have not had an antibiotic since childhood (I\u2019m 46), can\u2019t remember the last time I had a cold (maybe 3-4 years?), and have eaten plant focused, mostly organic diet for 25 years.

This image has been modified. Foods to Eat to Help Prevent Diabetes Written By Michael Greger M.D. FACLM on October 26th, 2017 \nWhy is meat consumption a risk factor for diabetes? Why does there appear to be a stepwise reduction in diabetes rates as meat consumption drops? Instead of avoiding something in meat, it may be that people are getting something protective from plants. Free radicals may be an important trigger for insulin resistance, and antioxidants in plant foods may help. Put people on a plant-based diet, and their antioxidant enzymes shoot up . So not only do plants provide antioxidants, but may boost our own anti-endogenous antioxidant defenses, whereas, on the conventional diabetic diet, they get worse. \nIn my video, How May Plants Protect Against Diabetes , I discuss how there are phytonutrients in plant foods that may help lower chronic disease prevalence by acting as antioxidants and anti-cancer agents, and by lowering cholesterol and blood sugar. Some, we\u2019re now theorizing, may even be lipotropes, which have the capacity to hasten the removal of fat from our liver and other organs, counteracting the inflammatory cascade believed to be directly initiated by saturated-fat-containing foods. Fat in the bloodstream\u2014from the fat on our bodies or the fat we eat\u2014not only causes insulin resistance, but also produces a low-grade inflammation that can contribute to heart disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. \nFiber may also decrease insulin resistance. One of the ways it may do so is by helping to rid the body of excess estrogen. There is strong evidence for a direct role of estrogens in the cause of diabetes, and it\u2019s been demonstrated that certain gut bacteria can produce estrogens in our colon. High-fat, low-fiber diets appear to stimulate the metabolic activity of these estrogen-producing intestinal bacteria. This is a problem for men, too. Obesity is associated with low testosterone levels and marked elevations of estrogens produced not only by fat cells but also by some of the bacteria in our gut. Our intestinal bacteria may produce these so-called diabetogens (diabetes-causing compounds) from the fats we eat. By eating lots of fiber, though, we can flush this excess estrogen out of our bodies. \nVegetarian women, for example, excrete two to three times more estrogens in their stools than omnivorous women, which may be why omnivorous women have 50% higher estrogen blood levels. These differences in estrogen metabolism may help explain the lower incidence of diabetes in those eating more plant-based diets, as well as the lower incidence of breast cancer in vegetarian women, who get rid of twice as much estrogen because they get rid of twice as much daily waste in general. \nEither way, \u201c[m]eat consumption is consistently associated with diabetes risk. Dietary habits are readily modifiable, but individuals and clinicians will consider dietary changes only if they are aware of the potential benefits of doing so.\u201d The identification of meat consumption as a risk factor for diabetes provides helpful guidance that sets the stage for beneficial behavioral changes. Meat consumption is something doctors can easily ask about, and, once identified, at-risk individuals can then be encouraged to familiarize themselves with meatless options. \nUnfortunately, cinnamon has fallen out of favor. See my Update on Cinnamon for Blood Sugar Control . \nI also have an ever-growing series on the science behind type 2 diabetes: \nFor more on the estrogen connection, see Relieving Yourself of Excess Estrogen and Breast Cancer and Constipation . \nIn health, \nMichael Greger, M.D. \nPS: If you haven\u2019t yet, you can subscribe to my free videos here and watch my live, year-in-review presentations: Michael Greger M.D. FACLM \nMichael Greger, M.D. FACLM, is a physician, New York Times bestselling author, and internationally recognized professional speaker on a number of important public health issues.

Thanks Dr. Greger. \nA proud monthly supporter of Nutritionfacts.org 18 October 26th, 2017 at 12:12 pm \nTom, I really respect your knowledge and research in the area of nutrition. I have a question for you. I have been researching the consumption of distilled water for health. This is controversial. Dr. Mercola says that drinking distilled water is bad for you because it removes the minerals from your bones. People who drink distilled water say that Dr. Mercola is only telling a half truth. These people say that drinking distilled water only removes the INORGANIC minerals that clog up your arteries such as calcium, and it removes other mineral build ups in your system such as kidney stones and the such. The people that drink distilled water say that the water has a negative charge and that the INORGANIC minerals have a positive charge and therefore the two are able to bind and the body is then able to rid itself of calcium deposists in the arteries and else where. On the other hand, ORGANIC minerals in your body such as the calcium in your bones has a negative charge just like the distilled water and these ORGANIC mineral molecules are not removed from your body like Dr. Mercola suggests. People who drink distilled water say that they can get all of the minerals they need from eating a whole plant food diet and these ORGANIC minerals are not washed out. People who drink only distilled water, and many of them have been drinking distilled water only for years and years, claim that it has greatly benefited their health. I can\u2019t find any scientific research on this topic and Dr. Greger has no articles on distilled water. So, Tom, what do you think? 8 \nThis is nonsense. Mercola is a known quack. 1 October 27th, 2017 at 6:20 am \nThanks John. \nI can\u2019t say I know too much about this and there isn\u2019t a lot of high quality modern research on this topic. \nThe article on the Mercola site is not by the man himself but it doesn\u2019t seem to be particularly well grounded on hard facts. For example, the claim that the adverse health effects of soft drinks are due the fact that they are made using distilled is not true \u2013 I understand that Pepsi ans Coca Cola use reverse osmosis. Distillation is just too expensive and makes no commercial sense anyway. Also, the author just references his own books and some other popular health books \u2013 all from 20+ years ago \u2013 which doesn\u2019t lend any credibiilty to his analysis \nThe most credible summary still remains this old World Health Organization paper. It does provide grounds for some legitimate concern if people exclusively use distilled water. I am not sure that all the studies that are discussed there would meet modern standards for rigorous methodology but it is still concerning. Anyway read it and see what you think http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientschap12.pdf \nThanks for raising the question. Back home in Oz I usually use the tap water for cooking, making tea etc but use a carbon filter for drinking water. I am currently living in the Philippines and everybody who can afford it drinks bottled water because the tap water is considered unsafe. I usually drink my water as *herbal\u201d tea rather than plain water which may go some way to addressing the problems. But I don\u2019t know for sure since there\u2019s no good research on this point either that I am aware. \nI\u2019ll have to think about this and perhaps consider alternating between boiled tap water and bottled water. Of course, even boiling the water wouldn\u2019t have helped much if you lived in Flint so you have to reaerch local water quality. Distilled water is usually the most expensive option though so perhaps the WHO paper provides a sufficient reason to go with a cheaper but good quality filter water. 0 \nHI guys, I am a little bit confused with the enormous amount of books. Can you help me which books are obligatory to buy ? I have already Dr Greger books. Which other books Dr Greger recommend ? Kind regards J \nHey, Juld! I agree with WFPBRunner and also suggest \u201cThe China Study\u201d which was really the first book that turned my life around! 0 October 29th, 2017 at 4:41 am \nThank you for your question. I assume it is related to diabetes. I would recommend any of Neal Barnard\u2019s books, including Dr Neal Barnard\u2019s program for reversing diabetes. Have a look at his website pcrm.org. Joel Fuhrman\u2019s books are all excellent. For me \u2018eat to live\u2019 was very influential but he also has written a book called The end of diabetes. T Colin Campbell is a world authority on plant nutrition. Of course read the China Study and I really enjoyed his book Whole, rethinking the science of nutrition. His website, nutritionstudies.org is excellent too 1 October 26th, 2017 at 1:21 pm \nIn this kind of fake study, they merely compared unhealthy meat eaters who eat processed foods or SAD diet with Healthy vegetarians or vegans such as the Seventh Day Adventists and of course the vegans are healthier. Why don\u2019t they compare lousy meat eaters with \u201cvegans\u201d who eat potato chip and vegan burger? Such a fake \u201cstudy\u201d is typical to convince people of a fake theory that went on for half a century and cause so much havoc to the health of the Entire World. This is a crime against humanity. \nThe idea of meat eaters who eat no plant foods are so old that it should be put to rest because nobody do it these days except for people who do not care about health. \nJust watch the following video by Dr Fat Hyman to see him talking about eating mostly plant foods, and only a small amount of healthy fats and animal foods. October 26th, 2017 at 11:21 pm \nJerry These aren\u2019t fake studies that compare healthy vegetarians or 7th Day Adventists to unhealthy junk food omnivores. Anybody who bothers reading them \u2013 not you obviously \u2013 can see this. You just make these false accusations up from thin air because you need an excuse to ignore the evidence. You are just peddling your own brand of Whoppers. \nYou should also know that eating mostly plants and a few animal foods is actually a plant-based diet\u201cA plant-based diet is a diet based on foods derived from plants, including vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes and fruits, but with few or no animal products.\u201d https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant-based_diet \nThe traditional Okinawan Diet for example was only 6% naimal food (by calories content). \nIn the video all Hyman does is give us his opinions \u2013 no evidence \u2013 just his opinions. Some things he says are sensible \u2013 no refined carbs, no processed foods, and lots of plants but other stuff he says is not based on the latest science. For example, on his website he notes \u201cInterestingly, all of these patients who had heart attacks did not have high LDL or elevated total cholesterol. In fact, 75 percent of those people had \u201cnormal\u201d LDL cholesterol, with 50 percent having optimal LDL levels. So much for the high LDL contributing to heart attacks. \nHere\u2019s where it gets interesting. Only 10 percent of the participants had levels of HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol over 60. This means that 90 percent of these patients who suffered a heart attack had HDL levels under 60. Low HDL is a big red flag for pre-diabetes, or what I call diabesity. And we now know that low HDL is the real driver of most heart attacks and heart disease.\u201d \nhttp://www.criticalcare.theclinics.com/article/S0749-0704(05)00097-7/abstract \nHis claim that HDL is the real driver of heart disease is also contrary to the science but very convenient for saturated fat apologists because saturated fat drives up HDL as well as LDL cholesterol. I am not aware that any credible health authority agrees that low HDL \u201cis the real driver of most heart attacks and heart disease.\u201d In fact, people often have low HDL because they are sick or on drugs rather than the other way around: \n\u201cHDL-C levels are decreased in association with recent illness; starvation and stress; smoking; obesity and lack of exercise; medications such as thiazide diuretics, steroids, and beta-blockers; hypertriglyceridemia; and in elevated immunoglobin levels. HDL-C levels are increased in association with moderate ethanol consumption, insulin, and estrogen. [1] Additionally, regular aerobic exercise, smoking cessation, decrease in body mass index, and statin therapy (mild) increase HDL-C levels. Statins or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors modestly increase HDL-C levels. The mild rise in HDL-C levels from these drugs may be related to inhibition of rho-signaling pathways with activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\u2013alpha. Increases in HDL-C levels may also be attributable to decreasing plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity by statins. [6]\u201d https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2087757-overview#a4 hus Trials increasing HDL cholesterol have uniformly found no benefit, and thus refute Hyman\u2019s claim. As Darryl has commented elsewher \u201cThe \u201cHDL is causally protective\u201d hypothesis is untenable after the past decade: \nMeta-analysis of 108 randomized controlled trials effecting HDL levels (statins, fibrates, resins, niacin, n-3 fats, ACAT inhibitors, ABCA1 inhibitors, CETP inhibitors, PPAR activators, diets, bariatric surgery): No effect. Subsequent AIM-HIGH niacin trial No effect. ABCA1 gene loss of function No effect, LCAT gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) lowering HDL: No effect, composite HDL effect from 20 SNPs No effect, 19 SNPs affecting HDL from a genome wide association study (which don\u2019t simultaneously affect LDL) No effect.\u201d \nI don\u2019t know whether Hyman is just an ignorant physician or he is deliberately failing to mention these facts in order to sell books. After all, it is very difficult to grab headlines and achieve No1 bestseller status by telling people to eat their vegetables and control their cholesterol levels. Either way his advice is often faulty and not to be trusted. Like yours. 10 \nLOL, \u201d peddling your own brand of Whoppers\u201d. I always enjoy reading your posts TG! Thank you. 8 \nExcellent rebutted. I really like your answers. 4 October 27th, 2017 at 1:31 am \nDr. Joel Khan has solved the riddle. Trimethylamine (TMA) is produced in the small intestine of meat, dairy and egg omnivores. Our liver oxidizes TMA to TMAO. It is the compound directly deposited in our arteries. High colesteral is a \u201cmarker\u201d for possible heart disease. High TMAO confirms you have heart disease. Stress raises cortisol levels, thus initiating a heart attack or stroke. Vegans \u201cDo Not Produce TMA\u201d in their guts. When vegans are switched to an omnivor\u2019s diet (meat, dairy & eggs) they begin to produce TMA. The reverse is true. Omnivores put on a vegan diet (plant based whole food) soon see TMA levels drop. 4 October 27th, 2017 at 12:00 am \nDr. Greger does not post one single item about self-styled \u201cvegans\u201d who eat processed junk. I don\u2019t know where you get that erroneous notion. His focus, like that of all the ACLM members, is on research involving a whole-food, plant-based diet. Try re-reading and re-watching the content here. 4 October 28th, 2017 at 1:47 am \n\u201cSuch a fake \u201cstudy\u201d is typical to convince people of a fake theory that went on for half a century and cause so much havoc to the health of the Entire World. This is a crime against humanity. \nWell, Jerry, why don\u2019t you tell us why scientists and researchers around the world have been doing fake studies for 50 years to convince people of a fake theory and damage their hesalth? \nThat\u2019s pretty amazing if true. Who and why (and how for that matter)? 1 \nIs it possible this Jerry Lewis guy is being paid by \nthe meat industry, or the coconut oil industry, or \nthe milk, and egg industry to sabotage Dr. Greger\u2019s \nwork. I know for a fact that during political elections \nin America political parties will pay people around $20 \nper hour to debate, sabotage, and cause problems with \nonline forums, webpages, youtube comments, ect in order \nto win elections. If politicians do it, then I am sure that \nthe billion dollar meat industry would hire people to do the \nexact same thing. \nYou are doing a good work defending Dr. Greger. I don\u2019t \nknow how you do it. But, thanks for all you do. 1 October 28th, 2017 at 7:31 am \nThanks John. But I doubt that the food industries would bother doing this sort of thing. It\u2019s expensive and could be damaging if the news ever got out (and it inevitably would). I \nBesides which, there are way too many cranks who are willing to do this sort of thing for free. YouTube is full of them and just imagine how many people have bought the Hyman book or the Perlmutter book, then there are all the Atkins books, Taubes etc. No there are hordes of people who believe this stuff. Justb like there are creationists and young earth believers who jump in and make equally bizarre claims whenever there;s a video or blog that mentions evolution or our species history. \nI think Jerry is totally sincere but addicted to pseudoscinece, poor soul. 1 October 28th, 2017 at 1:00 pm \nHi John, this is an interesting idea. I wish that Big Foods will pay me, so that I can stay home and have time to prepare foods and eat properly \u2013 you know what I eat takes a lot of time to prepare. Unfortunately they prefer you guys, especially TG, who write posts after posts that are page long with links of \u201cresearches\u201d that are half a century old. Nobody has any idea about what he is saying but it looks like it comes out from some kind of \u201cscientists\u201d and that\u2019s what matters. \nSo why does Big Foods like you guys? It\u2019s because of you guys push for low fat, or no fat at all. No big deal, Big Foods simply get rid of saturated fat and substitute it with transfat and carb and corn syrup. Most people are naive and they only look at the label to see if there is any saturated fat and they don\u2019t care about the rest. And then when they get hungry and have low energy, they will eat more carb and more sugar, and that will increase consumption. All those weight loss programs will eventually fail because people cannot stand being hungry for too long and they will go back to eating binge of so-called \u201clow fat\u201d or \u201cno fat\u201d foods but full of carb and sugar. Then when they get sick then here we go, Big Pharma will come to the rescue with statin drug. And there are doctors who make a living on low fat. This is a Huge industry. \nYou know that I just read that low cholesterol will cause colon cancer. This is on top of Alzheimer\u2019s that I already knew a while ago. This low fat fake theory will make people sicker and that\u2019s what Big Pharma loves about. \nFor guys like you who are vegans, it\u2019s no big deal because you guys count less than 5% of the population anyway, plus you guys still eat carb and sugar as long as it is not animal foods. The 95% remaining of people will still eat animal foods no matter what, either for pleasure but mostly for necessity, because most people don\u2019t have time to sit and eat sufficient plant foods all day but they have to grab a hamburger quickly and go to work. \nThe biggest fear for Big Foods and Big Pharma is guys like me who are very informed, seriously. Why? Because we only eat a small amount of animal foods just enough for the nutrition and when we do, we want organic, grass fed and free range. Or we want non pasteurized and raw milk with zero preservative and that makes it hard for Big Foods to keep food very long before it spoils. We don\u2019t get fooled with the low fat label but we look to see how much transfat, carb and sugar there are in a food. We don\u2019t fall into the trap of Big Pharma because we don\u2019t buy into the obsolete cholesterol level and we look at CRP and refuse to take statin drug unless it is absolutely necessary due to gene mutation and cholesterol shoots up out of control. And when we do eat fats, we demand healthy fats and none of the junk fat such as those in vegetable oil. Oh I forgot about vegetable oil because this is a Huge Industry worldwide from America to Europe, Asia and Africa. \nAll of the above requirements from people like me are very costly for Big Foods. If I am them, I prefer the low fat crowd because that\u2019s where Big Money comes from. I wonder how this economy will be when the low fat theory is finally debunked? On one end, we will save billions of dollars in healthcare but on the other hand, we will lose trillions of dollars worldwide because Big Foods and Big Pharma will lose money, and countless of Weight Watchers and low fat \u201cexperts\u201d will lose their jobs. \nP.S. CNN is talking right now about the opioid epidemic. Part of the problems also comes from this low fat theory because when people eat (healthy) fat, they don\u2019t have that much issue with depression and other mental issues. 0 \nYep\u2026.your long diatribe proves beyond a shadow of a \ndoubt that you are a paid troll for the FAT industry. 1 October 28th, 2017 at 2:52 pm \nJohn, this is very helpful info. Do you know where is the FAT industry so that I can apply for a job? The other day, I applied for a job with Big Vegetable Oil but they turned me down because of my postings against it. 0 October 28th, 2017 at 5:35 pm \nHi JL I want to know which books you have in your library ? I am confused because there is so many books about diet I dont know which books to trust ? One say meals is good for you ,another books say opposite so its big confusion. Please help me to find the right books ? Kind regards October 28th, 2017 at 5:57 pm \nJuld, interestingly my only book on nutrition that I have is Dr Greger book \u201cHow not to die\u201d. Since then, I have advanced much more from the content of that book and I find that book kind of \u201cboring\u201d because it talks about the same WFPB diet for all diseases. And since I have read so much on the Internet already, I don\u2019t think I want to buy more books plus I come up with my own diet now which is pretty much all of the best diets combined. \nBut if I have to recommend a book to you then I would say that you read \u201cHow not to die\u201d book by Dr Greger first to have a good grasp on eating WFPB to have the necessary basics, and then advance to \u201ceat fat get thin\u201d book by Dr Hyman to get a good balance. And also read web sites of Dr Mercola and DrAxe on top of NutritionFacts daily to get a balanced view and eventually you will come up with your own diet that suits you best. 0 \n\u201cIn summary, we found that total protein and animal protein consumption were the risk factors for T2DM, and plant protein was the protective factor for T2DM in women, but not in men.\u201d 3 October 26th, 2017 at 11:11 am \nHi, Since production of estrogen slows after 30 years, and as a 65 yr old women with chronically low estrogen-resulting in hot flashes, mood swings and other related conditions would you say this article is directed to men and young women? with thanks, Sharon \nI also wondered about the applicability of these findings to women of different ages. I am suffering negative effects of low estrogen due to menopause. Do I want to excrete more of it? 4 October 26th, 2017 at 4:40 pm \nAlmita, fortunately plants are loaded with phytoestrogens. Phytoestrogens bind to the estrogen receptors that help maintain bone mass and reduce hot flashes, and they do not bind to the estrogen receptors that promote cancer. So, basically the best of both worlds. We want to flush out animal/human estrogen (fiber) and have lots of healthy plant estrogens on board. https://nutritionfacts.org/video/who-shouldnt-eat-soy/ 7 October 26th, 2017 at 11:30 am \nI have been eating a plant-based diet for more than 30 years. My blood sugar has always been acceptably normal, thank God, but too high for my standards \u2013 it was 94. 100 is the starting point for prediabetes. Recently, I increased my intake of virgin coconut oil, which, according to Dr. Greger, would theoretically increase my blood sugar and put me at increased risk for diabetes because it is saturated fat. After 3 months, my blood sugar went down from 94 (which I was not at all happy with) to 73. My A1c, which is an even more reliable indicator of glucose levels because it is a 3-month average, went down from 5.1 to 4.6. (A1c is a measure of the amount of glucose that gets stuck to your red blood cells, so it is a measure over time. 5.0 is considered normal, 6.0 is a red flag.) \nIn fact, when I read some coconut oil lists and blogs, I learn that instead of taking insulin when people\u2019s blood sugar goes too high, they take two or 3 teaspoons of coconut oil. Their blood sugar plummets to normal within a half an hour. \nFWIW. \nYou are exactly correct! Congratulations for making a wise decision and not following the mainstream and a half a century old false theory. \nThis saturated fat fake theory has caused so much damage to the health of the entire World. \nAs a bonus to your consumption of coconut oil, you will find that your brain will be more calm and clear and you will sleep better. And if you check your cholesterol which is simply a lousy indicator, you will see that it is the same as before or slightly higher in TC, but higher HDL and lower triglycerides. \nAnd you should notice that you don\u2019t gain one ounce of weight but instead lose weight, after consuming healthy fats. 7 October 26th, 2017 at 1:22 pm \nJerry, well, now that you asked \u2013 on last check, my triglycerides were 40 and my HDL was 118. LDL was 80. LDL has come down since I added flax seed and more avocado to my diet. I am very happy with those changes. Regarding coconut oil, I have to stop consuming it by midafternoon, because if I don\u2019t, it will keep me up all night. That includes putting it onto my skin. Dr. Bruce Fife, author of many books on the subject, has found the same thing about coconut oil \u2013 he has to be very careful of it in the evening. \nI am not new to coconut oil. I started eating it in 2004. 5 October 26th, 2017 at 3:06 pm \nNina, you are correct. Everybody is different and you should do what your body tells you. \nIn my case, I can eat coconut fat all times of the day but I mainly do in the morning to have energy and metabolism for the entire day. \nI mainly consume MCT oil, 2 tablespoons of it. As for coconut oil, I eat it only by default when I use coconut oil for frying and coconut flake for baking, and coconut milk to soak my chia seed for one day and chia seed is my source of Omega 3 along with flax seed. 3 October 27th, 2017 at 12:36 am \nDr Bruce Fife, or Dr Dropo as he used to be known, previously sold books on creative clowning and how to make balloon animals. You can still find those books on Amazon and Google books. \nAt some stage though he decided to start selling books on coconut oil instead and acquired a \u201cdoctorate\u201d in naturopathy and a certificate in nutrition. I have no idea how he obtained them or where these \u201cqualifications\u201d come from. It is not discussed on his website. I did however note that his website claims \n\u201d up until a few years ago the people of Sri Lanka used coconut oil in all their cooking. Each person consumed about 120 coconuts a year. Despite this high rate of consumption they had the lowest heart disease death rate in the world\u20141 out of every 100,000. Compare that to Americans who eat essentially no coconut oil yet nearly 1 out of every 2 deaths is heart related.\u201d http://www.coconutresearchcenter.org/savethechildren.htm# \nYet the real facts are apparently somewhat different. Let;s go back a few years and we find\u201cThe recent estimates for mortality from CVD (cardiovascular diseases) for Sri Lanka was 524 deaths per 100,000 which is higher than that observed in many high-income countries.1 Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in Sri Lanka while stroke is the third cause of death.2, 3 CAD accounted for 34% of deaths in an autopsy study.4 For comparison, CAD accounts for only 17% of deaths in the US and UK.5\u201d http://www.cadiresearch.org/topic/asian-indian-heart-disease/cadi-sri-lanka \nIf you really want to take advice on nutrition and health from a clown, I would do a lot of due diligence fact-checking of his claims before believing everything he writes. \nIt takes an iron will not to mention you-know-who when talking about not taking health and nutrition advice from a clown. Clearly I do not possess an iron will. 6 \nTom, this is an excellent article you wrote. Keep up the good work. 4 \nAnd that is also the clinical picture that my husband, a cardiologist sees in his south asian patients. He tells them, \u201cNo coconut oil\u201d. 3 \nHow do you eat the Coconut oil? Do you cook with it? Dr. Hyman said he eats a tablespoon a day. I would love to do what you are doing. Thanks. \nI add a tablespoon to my morning smoothie 1 \nDr Hyman consumes MCT oil, just like I do, 2 tablespoons per day. 2 \nAll you coconut believers out there, make sure to watch this video before guzzling coconut products. https://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-about-coconuts-coconut-milk-and-coconut-oil-mcts/ 6 \nGood for you! I believe in healthy fats. 2 October 26th, 2017 at 12:56 pm \nEverything in the blog is correct except for the meat consumption and of course saturated fat portions. This is like a broken violin. \nIf meat causes diabetes then 95% of the population will be diabetic but in reality only the population who eats processed meat and sugar are. So the population that eat processed foods and SAD diet should not be lumped together with meat eaters, in particular Healthy meat eaters who eat a diverse diet composed of both Whole plant and animal foods. By the same token, we should not lump people who eat potato chip and vegan burger with real vegans who eat WFPB. \nFrom a scientific point of view, the ALA, DHEA, DHA/EPA, essential and conditional amino acids, certain minerals, that are found mostly and in some case ONLY in animal foods, are all anti diseases including diabetes and anti oxidant and anti inflammation. \nAnd last but not least, Real Fats will help the metabolism of people who no longer find the needs to consume sugar and too much carb, all contributors to inflammation and diabetes. 6 \nI appreciate your point of view. Thank you. 1 October 27th, 2017 at 12:49 am \n<So, Jerry, that doesn't explain why in the 7th Day Adventist mortality study, meat eaters had the highest mortality and male \"vegans\" had the lowest relative mortality risk of any group. \nJust another fake study I suppose. We can always tell fake studies, They show that dietary saturated fat is a risk factor for CVD, some cancers, dementia and various cognitive impairments. Oh, and all those studies that show high LDL cholesterol is a significant risk factor are fake also. https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-do-we-know-that-cholesterol-causes-heart-disease/ \nThe only good studies that aren't bogus are studies that appear to show dietary saturated fat is harmless or healthful and ditto for studies that present high LDL cholesterol as harmless or \"protectve\". \nSimple really. Thanks for clearing that up,Jerry. Somebody had better tell all those scientists and doctors to go home and put their feet up though \u2013 they obviously don't have a clue. 8 \nTom. I almost spit out my coffee! 6 October 28th, 2017 at 8:12 pm \nTJ, you are simply comparing apple and oranges. The study simply compared 7th Day Adventist versus meat eaters who don\u2019t eat plant foods along and we don\u2019t even know if those meat eaters eat healthy animal foods or processed foods. This is very old and nowadays we already know that plant foods contain more anti diseases compounds than animal foods. Nevertheless, although animal foods contain less anti diseases compounds than plant foods, they contain some nutrients that are very hard to find or non existent in plant foods such as collagen, essential and conditional amino acids, minerals, some vitamins such as Vit A and B12. So any meat eaters with an ounce of brain already know that they need to eat more plant foods than animal foods but eat along some animal foods and fats for complete nutrition. \nWhy do you keep dragging these unhealthy meat eaters in the conversation? It\u2019s like comparing yourself to a 5 year old kid and say that you are stronger. What is your point? Are you weaker than a 5 year old kid? \nI never compared meat eaters with vegans who eat potato chip and so why you keep comparing the other way? \nYour one page long posts with half a century old links prove nothing. Zero. 0 October 29th, 2017 at 6:57 am \nYou can\u2019t help yourself can you Jerry? In the 7th Day Adventist study, they looked only at 7th Day Adventists.. The vegetarians were 7th Day Adventists, the meat eaters were 7th Day Adventists. That is why it is called the 7th Day Adventist study. Yet here you are claiming it is a study of 7th Day Adventist vegans compared to some random unhealthy meat eaters. You simply don\u2019t care about the facts \u2013 you just make up your own because then you can be sure to hear what you want to. \nAs for eating junk food, there are plenty of \u201cvegan\u201d junk food eaters out there, a fact you also conveniently forget. \nSomething else you routinely misrepresent is the quality of the evidence you choose to ignore:\u201d half a century old links prove nothing. Zero.\u201d \nLet me see, the 7th Day Adventist health study article I linked to was published in 2013, and the scientific statements I link to because they show your assertions about dietary saturated fat and blood cholesterol are blatant untruths were published earlier this year. But that doesn\u2019t fit with your repeated assertions so here you are describing them as \u201chalf a century old links\u201d. Not only is the evidence offensive to you, so too evidently are simple facts. \nYour claims then are just two more Whoppers from Jerry. \nFrankly, how you can write these things when anybody can check the links and the 7th Day Adventist study and discover that you have been fibbing big time, beats me. But, still as I suggested earlier, perhaps you are just using the tried and tested techniques developed by Joseph Goebbels. Here is another apparent quote of his which your posts make me bring to mind \n\u201cA lie told once, remains a lie but a lie told a thousand times becomes the truth\u201d \nThis is perhaps why you keep making your false claims over and over again despite repeatedly being proved wrong. It certainly feels like you have said the same thing a thousand times, here. And of course with absolutely no evidence. \nLooking at those quotes attributed to Goebbels, I came across this apparently from Hiter\u2019s \u201cMein Kampf\u201d \n\u201cThe most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly and with unflagging attention. It must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over. Here, as so often in this world, persistence is the first and most important requirement for success.\u201d \nIt does seem to describe pretty well what you have been doing here. 0 \n@Jerry Lewis: what is your end game here? \nSeriously. \nWhat is it that you hope to achieve with your constant chatter about saturated fats and animal flesh and their bodily secretions being healthy for human consumption? \nIn the face of a multitude of credible studies being presented to you by this website, Dr Greger and his team, as well as other commenters, your ignorance, arrogance and cognitive dissonance is so strong that you have made yourself look foolish and stupid. 19 October 26th, 2017 at 2:09 pm \nWhen Trolls write, all I hear is the teacher\u2019s voice in the old Charlie Brown cartoons \u2013 wa, wa wo etc. And I chuckle and can\u2019t go on reading \u2013 now I just don\u2019t bother and skip on to the next intelligent line of conversation. \nThis is a great site, I recommend the best solution to be ignoring obtuse information and focusing on the great facts we get here. Besides, I doubt very much that Dr. Greger cares one iota what a Troll writes. \nIn fact, he unwittingly helps to focus us all on the scientific information Dr. Greger shares with us. \nA proud monthly supporter of Nutritionfacts.org 14 \nMore than one troll today\u2026. The problem is that well-meaning people are asking for information and then thanking the trolls\u2026. 15 October 26th, 2017 at 4:34 pm \nI really don\u2019t understand why Jerry can\u2019t be blocked. I personally don\u2019t have time to correct him each time and to be honest with you I am losing interest. What is his MO. Can\u2019t be that he is just lonely. 11 October 26th, 2017 at 8:12 pm \nAnd so it is what it is. We can\u2019t control everything. Ultimately, people are responsible for their own health. All that they need is in the website when it comes to evidence based nutritional information. And of course, there is the book and now a cookbook! Yay! \nSo frankly, if someone does not take the time to read and listen to the evidence based information that Dr. Greger puts on this site and that he writes about, then they are making that choice and that too is really none of my business. They are making a choice with the best level of critical thinking that they have. \nTruly, most people who are very motivated to engage a WFPBD instinctively know the difference because that is what brought them here in the first place. \nLet\u2019s celebrate each other and wade through the crowd and enjoy this site focusing on our own health and sharing with others who seem on the same page. So much less stress and it makes this site the miracle of wellness that it is, again and again. \nJust saying. \nA proud monthly supporter of Nutritionfacts.org 8 \nPining for the good old days. 4 October 27th, 2017 at 1:30 am \nYes. Even then, though, the crackpots and trolls still parachuted in on a regular basis, \nMost of them were booted out once they became too abusive or repeated unscientific claims over and over again despite being shown the evidence, I seem to recall people who were more reasonable and much less repetitive than Jerry being ejected. I even thought that the three strikes and you are out policy was a little harsh in some of those cases. \nI also find the new system a huge step backward. Disqus never used to lose my posts because it did not like some of the links. The present system does so on a regular basis. I also knew when people had replied to my posts. The current system stopped advising me of replies a month ago. Tech support hasn\u2019t been able to help. \nFor that matter, under the old system, I didn\u2019t have to go out to YouTube to watch the video (because the NF version is too big for the screen), and then come back in again to read the comments. \nYes, I know, we are supposed to embrace change but I don\u2019t think degraded performance is what was intended when people talked about embracing change. 5 October 27th, 2017 at 7:58 am \nAgreed. As I understand it wasn\u2019t it a financial decision to switch? I too preferred Disque. Seeing that this is a people powered website I am feeling a bit disrespected. Yes agreed we did have the occasional drop in but those conversations were at least interesting. \nAre you still in Australia? 3 \nI am in Cebu (Philippines) at the moment but will be flying back to Oz on 15 November. Have to complete my tax return and check on my unit (Australiann for flat or condo)! 1 October 27th, 2017 at 9:45 am \nTom are you loving that Jackfruit? In Southern California I have a hard time finding them but when I do I am in heaven. A cross between a pineapple, strawberry and cantaloupe? The flavor is amazing. A bit labor intense to clean but so worth it. \nAnd thanks for all the work you are doing on this site. You keep the candle burning. And you keep me laughing. 2 \nOUCH!! Your comments to Jerry seem disrespectful. \nScott, \nWe are not all created the same way. I follow this website because I enjoy the research Dr. Greger presents. I completely support a diet of whole plant foods and no food-like substances. However, I don\u2019t kid myself that this is all I need to know. I\u2019ve been observing this forum for quite some time without posting, but I would like to say something here. \nFirst, as much as I love WFPB and eat many servings of plants and fruits every day, I cannot eat grains, even whole grains, or carbohydrates because they raise my LDL and total cholesterol. They also raise my triglycerides, which is a risk factor for me. Obviously, sugars and processed grains are bad for us all, but I cannot eat the whole grains or even some of the carbs either. I am not alone in this, according to my cardiologist. \nI can, however, eat saturated fats, whether from plants or fish, and lower my LDL. I have a genetic predisposition to high LDL due to elevated Lp(a), which puts me at risk for strokes and congestive heart disease. Some 20-30% of the population have this genetic factor; it\u2019s the most common of these genetic variations. My Total Cholesterol soars to 300 when I do not eat fish or coconut oil or some other MCT oil. I spent 12 years working with the Philadelphia Heart Institute testing my diet every 6 months looking for the foods that would lower my risks for stroke and congestive heart disease. The tests we used were NMRs that looked at the molecular levels for lipids. These tests also tested for Insulin Resistance and, of course, HbA1c. \nI\u2019ve had two EBCT scans to look at the calcification of my arteries (the first one was 15 years ago; the last one was one year ago) as this is usually a result of elevated Lp(a). My arteries remain clear of calcification \u2014 and I\u2019m 71 years old. My cardiologist who is a lipid researcher at the Medical University of South Carolina agrees with me that my health status is the result of my diet and exercise and very likely some of the supplements I have taken over the years. \nAnd, by the way, I have been a life-long runner, walker, exerciser, practice T\u2019ai Chi and Qi Gong, and keep mobile on a daily basis. No sedentary lifestyle here. \nI\u2019ve looked for research on how a completely plant-based diet would affect the levels of Lp(a) and have not found this research. However, I do find research that supports my eating fish (or taking high doses of Omega-3) and getting goodly amounts of saturated fats and avoiding whole grains and even beans, which I eat only after soaking and sprouting them and then cooking them. \nI know that I am an N=1, but aren\u2019t we all at some level? Perhaps one of the things that this website can do for us is to help us all understand how we can all do our own research as N=1. How do we set up our own research, understand and evaluate our blood labs, and then share our personal health histories? How can we learn from one another here? \nBest, Cindy October 26th, 2017 at 4:27 pm \nWell a couple of questions come to mind. Have you ever completely given up animal intake of all kinds and at the same time stopped all processed oils. (Coconut, Olive etc.) without that bit of information you are limiting your data of your case study. (N=1) Whole vegetables and fruits are carbohydrates. Are you saying you have to limit them or do you mean simple processed carbohydrates? \nAnyhow bravo on the exercise. 9 October 26th, 2017 at 5:35 pm \nWFPBRunner \u2014 do you have a name? I would like to personalize this. And thanks for taking the time and interest to reply to me. \nNo, I have not given up all animal intake (other than fish), but do limit my non-fish intake. On occasion I have a bite or two of some organic pastured meats. That\u2019s mostly in my role as chief cook and taster here in my family. But I eat only organic meat when I eat it, local farm meat. But meat in general is not part of my general diet. \nI don\u2019t eat processed oils in general and have not eaten those knowingly most of my adult life. I really did not move from a so-called normal \u201cSAD\u201d diet to a healthy one. I\u2019ve been on this journey since my 20s. \nSince my family members die early from heart disease, I decided in my 20s that diet must be a factor. I got into organic foods and pretty much stayed tuned in to diet research. I followed Adele Davis in the early years and saw the benefits of her dietary recommendations. I also took up running in my 20s. Exercise was critical to my well-being. \nI avoid processed foods in general, always have. They just are not healthy under any circumstances. My inclination has always been to eat whole foods, foods that I have prepared myself. I think this is key to basic good health. \nWhen I was testing with the Philadelphia Heart Institute, I ate some chicken once a week or so on occasion, maybe a few ounces if that. But in general, I ate fish three or four times a week, sometimes more, again only a few ounces a day. But I did eat a soft-boiled egg daily. Eggs do not present a problem for me. I think the pertinent information is that I don\u2019t ever eat more than 2 to 4 oz of any meat or fish per day when I eat it. I don\u2019t eat a typical American diet. Never have. \nI eat no trans fats or other vegetable/seed oils other than cold-pressed coconut oils and some organic cold-pressed olive oils on my salads. I don\u2019t eat refined carbs. I read labels, and I eat no oils that have been previously heated. Trans fats and ALL heated oils are not healthy. I eat no processed foods. They often contain heated oils and those I consider to be unhealthy. Trans fats are a big problem for those of us with Lp(a). \nWith the carbs, it\u2019s mostly the beans and whole grains that I limit. Beans have to be sprouted. I avoid grains in general. I do NOT limit fruits and veggies. I can eat all kinds of those \u2014 fresh. I love those! I sprout my beans or I don\u2019t eat them. That is the problem for me with the Lp(a). It\u2019s not other kinds of vegetables. It\u2019s beans and grains in particular. My cardio doc says she has others like myself in her practice who also cannot eat beans and grains without elevating the Lp(a). Of course, sprouting makes beans a plant. This affects my triglycerides and I pay attention to those numbers. \nAlso, I do think something else played a part here. I eat within a certain period of time during the day. I believe this is referred to as intermittent fasting. I stop eating by 3pm each day. That makes a difference for me. I also keep my weight down \u2014 definitely a factor. I\u2019m about 5\u20192\u2033 and keep my weight no more than 128lb. \nOddly enough, I can drink red wine with health benefits. I\u2019ve been following the 23andme.com genetic testing and I see where there are some of us who actually benefit from drinking alcohol \u2013 raises our HDL. In my case, I can drink red wine and see health benefits for HDL as well as lowering of Lp(a). We have a gene that enables this benefit. I have seen in the Lp(a) research that others with this lipid anomaly also benefit from drinking red wine. Are there other hazards of drinking alcohol? Of course\u2026. my job is to understand where I am on that spectrum. \nSo what I would like to see is a forum that helps us all learn to understand how we can be healthier as individuals. I tried vegetarianism, low- to no-fat diets and they don\u2019t work for me. I can prove this with the lab reports. Yes, I think that most of my diet should be WFPB and I love it. That\u2019s what I do. I\u2019ve had that for years. But I do need to include Omega-3 fish oils and some saturated fats for me to be healthy. I can eat fish and some of these oils and maintain health. \nI would like to see a health blog site that teaches everyone how to become that N=1. How can we use this site to learn how to be healthier and share our stories with others? We all have things to learn from each other. Why should we be exclusive of others with different experiences? \nBest, Cindy ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "greger", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "michael greger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "podvalny", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-26T20:36:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e8a0427e10e3017ceeb3c5e1040dfd9e1ee69983", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlDLBzXYialrD_TkU_61ZOsmfmUgjkwNsdIZC6ze.V1bvdBwkKpA8mEF", "site_full": "nutritionfacts.org", "site": "nutritionfacts.org", "site_section": "http://nutritionfacts.org/feed?post_type=video", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "health", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Videos \u2013 NutritionFacts.org", "title": "The Best Food for High Cholesterol", "title_full": "The Best Food for High Cholesterol", "published": "2017-10-27T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2017/10/38-20-The-Best-Food-For-High-Cholesterol-1200x675.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23349, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e8a0427e10e3017ceeb3c5e1040dfd9e1ee69983", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlDLBzXYialrD_TkU_61ZOsmfmUgjkwNsdIZC6ze.V1bvdBwkKpA8mEF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM", "published": "2017-10-27T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Best Food for High Cholesterol", "text": "The Best Food for High Cholesterol 4.91 (98.13%) 32 votes \nAre the apparently amazing benefits of amla\u2014dried indian gooseberries\u2014too good to be true?

To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. \n\u201cMedicinal plants are [said to be] nature\u2019s gift to human beings to promote a disease free healthy life\u201d\u2014here in reference to amla, a fruit, the Indian gooseberry, described as an \u201cAyurvedic wonder.\u201d You hear a lot of that larger-than-life talk about amla coming out of Indian medical journals. Who can forget \u201cAmla\u2026, a wonder berry in the treatment and prevention of cancer.\u201d Amla is so revered that you find serious scientists, at serious academic institutions, in serious peer-reviewed medical journals, making statements like this: \u201c[E]very part of the [Indian gooseberry] plant has its unique therapeutic characteristic for the remedy of almost all the ailments\u2026[and] can be adopted as a [bold italic] single bullet [against disease].\u201d Okay, then. \nI first ran across it in this famous article, looking at the total antioxidant content of thousands of different foods. \nI did a series of videos about it ages ago. And, to my surprise, the #1 most antioxidant-packed single whole food on the planet, on average, was amla: dried powdered Indian gooseberries, beating out the prior heavyweight champion, cloves, with, just for comparison\u2019s sake, up to a hundred times or more antioxidants by weight than blueberries. \nSo, here\u2019s this fruit that has enjoyed \u201ca hallowed position in Ayurveda,\u201d the ancient system of medicine in India\u2014so hallowed that it was mythologically pegged as \u201cthe first tree\u2026in the universe.\u201d So, for thousands of years\u2014before we even knew what an antioxidant was\u2014they were revering this plant that just so happens to turn out to be the most antioxidant-packed fruit on the planet Earth. Okay, you got my attention. But, I still needed to see it put to the test. \nWell, indigenous tribal healers used amla to treat diabetes. So, researchers decided to give it a try. This is the study that originally bowled me over. In fact, it was the subject of one of my first NutritionFacts videos over five years ago: the effect of amla fruit on the blood sugars and cholesterol levels of normal subjects and type 2 diabetic patients. In my video, I talked about the jaw-dropping effects of five cents\u2019 worth of this powdered fruit\u2014 five pennies\u2019 worth\u2014compared to a diabetes drug. But, what about the cholesterol effects? \nIf you take healthy individuals and give them a placebo sugar pill, nothing much happens to their cholesterol. Ideally, we want our total cholesterol under 150. This was a pretty healthy group; the average cholesterol in the U.S. is over 200, which is where the diabetics started out in this study. And, when you give them placebo pills, nothing much happens either. But, give people just about a half-teaspoon of amla powder a day\u2014not some extract or something, just dried Indian gooseberries, a powdered fruit, and this is what happens. That\u2019s like a 35-45% drop in three weeks\u2014absolutely astounding. That\u2019s the kind of thing we see like six months after putting people on statin drugs. \nWhat we care most about is LDL, though\u2014so-called bad cholesterol, shooting for under at least 70, ideally. No impact of the placebos, but again, just about a half-teaspoon of amla, which would cost you about five cents a day, so like a buck fifty a month\u2014and boom. \nThese results knocked my socks off. I mean, they\u2019re just unbelievable. That\u2019s why I was so excited, after all these years, to dig back into the amla literature to see if these findings had been confirmed, replicated elsewhere. So, I typed amla into PubMed, and waded through all the papers on using amla to decrease methane in cow farts, and speed the growth of chickens, or hey, what about amla ice cream? After all, amla is packed with fiber and phytonutrients. In contrast, ice cream is not. Therefore\u2014and indeed, amla incorporated into ice cream increases the antioxidant capacity, though I would not recommend it for cholesterol lowering. \nAh, but here we go. A comparative clinical study of amla head to head against the cholesterol-lowering statin drug simvastatin, sold as Zocor\u2014which I\u2019ll cover, next. \nPlease consider volunteering to help out on the site.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "greger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amla", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-27T22:50:48.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "54b55e8e4426724900e9d08527b0bd4921837f7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlCnUlH2hG455ewsGKskRiKPP8aiJ6B4Xa.Af_RKrClFvHSTuZjvBbAZNbeqOhIEqlgZtNsZzpbzXmQsI4D1yknm", "site_full": "nutritionfacts.org", "site": "nutritionfacts.org", "site_section": "http://nutritionfacts.org/feed?post_type=video", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "health", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Videos \u2013 NutritionFacts.org", "title": "Amla vs. Drugs for Cholesterol, Inflammation, & Blood-Thinning", "title_full": "Amla vs. Drugs for Cholesterol, Inflammation, & Blood-Thinning", "published": "2017-10-30T13:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2017/10/38-21-Amla-vs.-Drugs-for-Cholesterol-Inflammation-and-Blood-Thinning-1200x675.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23349, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "54b55e8e4426724900e9d08527b0bd4921837f7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlCnUlH2hG455ewsGKskRiKPP8aiJ6B4Xa.Af_RKrClFvHSTuZjvBbAZNbeqOhIEqlgZtNsZzpbzXmQsI4D1yknm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM", "published": "2017-10-30T13:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Amla vs. Drugs for Cholesterol, Inflammation, & Blood-Thinning", "text": "Amla vs. Drugs for Cholesterol, Inflammation, & Blood-Thinning 4.56 (91.15%) 52 votes \nIndian gooseberry extracts put to the test head-to-head against cholesterol-lowing statin drugs and the blood thinners aspirin and Plavix.   \nIndian gooseberries, otherwise known as amla, have been touted as everything from a cancer fighter to a \u201chair tonic\u201d to a \u201crefrigerant,\u201d whatever that means\u2014what, like freon? Not to mention, a \u201csnake venom detoxifier.\u201d Complete with fancy diagrams, but based on what kind of research? \nYes, \u201c[d]ietary intake of [both turmeric and amla] increases the life span [of fruit flies].\u201d But, do we really care about the effects of amla on the life span, or the \u201csexual behavior\u201d for that matter, of fruit flies? How do you even study the sexual behavior of fruit flies? Why, obviously, you just introduce \u201ca virgin female and [a] bachelor male\u2026into an \u201cElens-Wattiaux mating chamber.\u201d Can you imagine having an insect-mating chamber named after you? And, it looks like there were two fighting over naming rights, so they had to go with both! \nThen, it\u2019s just a matter of getting out a stopwatch. Twenty minutes is the average duration, but almost a half-hour on amla, the studly beast, and it dropped the mating latency, the time between when they were introduced to one another in the chamber, and when they started getting busy from ten down to seven\u2026seconds! They don\u2019t mess around. Well, actually, they do mess around\u2014and quite rapidly. \nAnd, on amla, they lay more eggs, and more hatched into larvae. But, just like when you hear amla is \u201cthe best medicine to increase\u2026lifespan,\u201d you\u2019re probably not thinking about flies. When you read about amla may be a \u201cpotent aphrodisiac\u201d, you\u2019re probably not thinking, \u201cMore maggots!\u201d \nNow, there was this study that found extraordinary improvements in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol\u2014in actual humans, but that was compared to placebo. What about compared to simvastatin, a leading cholesterol-lowering drug, sold as Zocor? Treatment with the drug \u201cproduced significant reduction[s]\u201d in cholesterol, as one would expect. But, so did the amla. In fact, you could hardly tell which was which. Now note, this was only about a 10 to 15% drop in total and LDL cholesterol. In this study, the amla dose was only 500 milligrams, which is like a tenth of a teaspoon. So, smaller than the eighth of a teaspoon a day. And, it wasn\u2019t just the powdered fruit, but the powdered juice of the fruit, which may have made a difference. \nHow about versus Lipitor, the cholesterol-lowering drug known as atorvastatin? No effect of taking placebos, but significant improvements for the drug, and significant improvements for two amla doses\u2014but again, only about 15% or so. Did they just use the juice again? No, worse; some patented extract of amla. So, instead of five cents a day, it\u2019s 50 cents a day, and doesn\u2019t seem to work as well. But, because there\u2019s this proprietary version, at least there\u2019s someone willing to pony up the funds to do the research. \nIt\u2019s like the cancer story. \u201cFor [Indian gooseberries] to become relevant clinically,\u201d they\u2019re praying that \u201cpatentable derivatives [be] synthesized. Without the possibility of patents, the pharmaceutical industry [isn\u2019t going to] invest\u201d in the research; their shareholders wouldn\u2019t let them. It\u2019s patents over patients. But, without that research, how can we ever prove its worth\u2014or worthlessness, for that matter? \nSo, drug and supplement industry interest in patenting natural food product remedies is a double-edged sword. Without it, there would never have been this study\u2014showing not only benefits for cholesterol, but also arterial function: reducing artery stiffness in the two amla-extract groups and the drug group, but not placebo, as well as a dramatic drop in inflammation; C-reactive protein levels cut in half. \nSo, amla\u2014or at least amla extracts\u2014\u201dmay be a good therapeutic alternative to statins in diabetic patients with [artery] dysfunction because it has [many of] the beneficial effects of the statins but without the well known [potential] adverse [side-]effects of [the drugs]\u201d\u2014including muscle damage or liver dysfunction. \nThe amla extract was also compared to the blood-thinning drugs, aspirin and Plavix, often prescribed after heart attacks, and achieved about three-quarters of the same platelet aggregation-inhibiting effect as the drugs; significantly increasing the \u201cbleeding and clotting time,\u201d where they poke you with a needle, and see how many seconds it takes you to stop dripping. So, that\u2019s actually a good thing, if you have a stent or something that you don\u2019t want to clog up. But, it didn\u2019t thin the blood outside the normal range, and so it may not unduly raise the risk of major bleeding. \nIt also appears to decrease the effects of stress on the heart. They had people plunge their hand into ice water, and keep it there until the pain became \u201cunbearable.\u201d This causes your arteries to constrict and blood pressure to go up\u2014but not as much if you\u2019re taking amla extract. Good to know for your next ice bucket challenge. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amla", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "greger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-30T18:20:14.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "296d80abaa1556fa41e38f25e00caf155b31c935", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2sXsDupUmNE3UzvTDETMhnGD4i1H0v3F1cb6OpuLJo1YAqC3FNHwkF_2sMYUVkJ0RctEnw2cCkgs3ykwHROhAJw--", "site_full": "nutritionfacts.org", "site": "nutritionfacts.org", "site_section": "http://nutritionfacts.org/feed", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "health", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "NutritionFacts.org", "title": "How to Treat Dry Eye Disease Naturally with Diet", "title_full": "How to Treat Dry Eye Disease Naturally with Diet", "published": "2017-10-31T14:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2017/10/Oct-31-Dry-Eyes-1200x675.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23349, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "296d80abaa1556fa41e38f25e00caf155b31c935", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2sXsDupUmNE3UzvTDETMhnGD4i1H0v3F1cb6OpuLJo1YAqC3FNHwkF_2sMYUVkJ0RctEnw2cCkgs3ykwHROhAJw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM", "published": "2017-10-31T14:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "How to Treat Dry Eye Disease Naturally with Diet", "text": "Home > Dr. Greger\u2019s Medical Nutrition Blog > How to Treat Dry Eye Disease Naturally with Diet Image Credit: Neil Wilkie / Flickr.

How to Treat Dry Eye Disease Naturally with Diet Written By Michael Greger M.D. FACLM on October 31st, 2017 \nOne of the most common eye disorders, dry eye disease, causes irritation or discomfort, and can decrease functional vision, sometimes causing a dramatic deterioration in the quality of life. About five million Americans over age 50 suffer from moderate-to-severe dry eyes, and tens of millions more have mild or episodic manifestations of the disease, at a cost of more than $50 billion. \nIn terms of treatment , there are several drops and drugs that can help . We spend hundreds of millions of dollars on things like artificial tears, but currently there is no therapy available to actually fix the problem. If drugs don\u2019t work, doctors can try plugging up the outflow tear ducts, but that can cause complications, such as plugs migrating and eroding into the face, requiring surgical removal. Alternatively, surgeons can just cauterize or stitch up the ducts in the first place. \nThere has to be a better way. \nWhat about prevention? Dry eyes can be caused by LASIK surgery, affecting about 20-40% of patients six months after the operation. With a million LASIK procedures performed annually, that\u2019s a lot of people, and sometimes the long-term symptoms can be severe and disabling. \nThere\u2019s a long list of drugs that can cause it, including antihistamines, decongestants, nearly all the antidepressants, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, anti-Parkinson\u2019s drugs, beta-blockers, and hormone replacement therapy, as well as a few herbal preparations. \nIn the developing world , vitamin A deficiency can start out as dry eyes and then progress to becoming the leading cause of preventable childhood blindness. Vitamin A deficiency is almost never seen in the developed world, unless you do it intentionally . There was a report in the 1960s of a guy who deliberately ate a vitamin A-deficient diet, living off of bread and lime juice for five years, and his eyes developed vascularization and ulceration of the cornea, which you can see (if you dare) in my Treating Dry Eye Disease with Diet: Just Add Water? video. That was better than what happened to an unfortunate woman who was the member of a cult and tried to live off of brown rice and herbal tea: Her eyes literally melted and collapsed. \nThere are also a couple case reports of autistic children who refused to eat anything but French fries or menus exclusively comprised of bacon, blueberry muffins, and Kool-Aid, and became vitamin A deficient. A case in the Bronx was written up as vegan diet and vitamin A deficiency, but it had nothing to do with his vegan diet\u2014the kid refused to eat vegetables, consuming only potato chips, puffed rice cereal with non-fortified soymilk, and juice drinks. \u201cHis parents lacked particular skill in overcoming the child\u2019s tendency to avoid fruits and vegetables.\u201d \nA plant-based diet may actually be the best thing for patients with dry eye disease, those who wear contact lenses, and those who wish to maximize their tear secretions. People with dry eyes should be advised to lower protein, total fat, and cholesterol intake, and do the following: increase complex carbohydrates; increase vitamin A content (by eating red, orange, yellow, and dark green leafy vegetables); increase zinc and folate intake (by eating whole grains, beans, and raw vegetables, especially spinach); ensure sufficient vitamin B6 and potassium intake (by eating nuts, bananas, and beans); ensure sufficient vitamin C intake (by eating citrus); eliminate alcohol and caffeine; reduce sugar and salt intake; and consume six to eight glasses of water per day. \nWe know dehydration can cause a dry mouth, but could dehydration cause dry eyes? It may seem kind of obvious, but evidently it was never studied until recently. Is the answer to just drink more water? We know that those suffering from dry eye are comparatively dehydrated, so researchers figured that tear secretion decreases with progressive dehydration just like saliva secretion decreases and gives us a dry mouth. And indeed, as one gets more and more dehydrated, their urine concentrates and so does the tear fluid. But one can reverse that with rehydration, raising the exciting prospect that improving whole-body hydration by getting people to drink more water might bring relief for those with dry eyes. The researchers recommend eight cups of water a day for women and ten cups a day for men.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "greger", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "michael greger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil wilkie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bronx", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-31T14:15:19.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e7a426a38ceb5156856633d205ecc79ec031f6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlAwryvaJ0DL2MhHZVCD5Dmzhap5FWJQ2Eqcc1XSbWYC_dHejIU4ObbufADcr4QZhTI-", "site_full": "nutritionfacts.org", "site": "nutritionfacts.org", "site_section": "http://nutritionfacts.org/feed?post_type=video", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "health", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Videos \u2013 NutritionFacts.org", "title": "Lycopene Supplements vs. Prostate Cancer", "title_full": "Lycopene Supplements vs. Prostate Cancer", "published": "2017-11-01T13:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2017/11/38-22-Lycopene-Supplements-vs.-Prostate-Cancer-1200x675.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23349, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6e7a426a38ceb5156856633d205ecc79ec031f6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3kljU1f9OudK7e.mGACs2DuSJqkseOlAwryvaJ0DL2MhHZVCD5Dmzhap5FWJQ2Eqcc1XSbWYC_dHejIU4ObbufADcr4QZhTI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Greger M.D. FACLM", "published": "2017-11-01T13:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "Lycopene Supplements vs. Prostate Cancer", "text": "Lycopene Supplements vs. Prostate Cancer 4.93 (98.57%) 28 votes \nHigh doses of lycopene\u2014the red pigment in tomatoes\u2014were put to the test to see if it could prevent precancerous prostate lesions from turning into full-blown cancer.   \nBack in the 80s, the Adventist Health Study found \u201c[s]trong protective relationships [against prostate cancer] with increasing consumption of [legumes],\u2026citrus\u2026,\u2026dried fruit, nuts, and tomatoes.\u201d In the 90s, a Harvard study focused attention on tomatoes, which appeared to be \u201cespecially beneficial.\u201d They suspected it might be the red pigment in tomatoes called lycopene, which has greater antioxidant power than some of the other pigments, like the orange beta-carotene pigment in carrots and cantaloupes. And, lycopene dramatically kills off prostate cancer cells in a petri dish\u2014even way down at the levels one would expect in one\u2019s bloodstream after just eating some tomatoes. So, of course, the Heinz ketchup company, along with manufacturers of lycopene supplements, petitioned the FDA to allow them to print health claims on their products. \nThey were essentially denied, with the FDA saying that the evidence was \u201cvery limited and preliminary,\u201d with no endorsement allowed for ketchup or supplements. By that time, further population studies had cast doubt on the lycopene theory. Consumers of high dietary intakes of lycopene didn\u2019t seem to have lower cancer rates, after all. But, who has high dietary intakes of lycopene? Those that eat the most pizza; so, maybe it\u2019s no surprise there are mixed results. What we need is to put lycopene to the test. \nIt started with a case study. A 62-year old man with terminal prostate cancer; failed surgery, failed chemotherapy, metastases all over, spread to the bone. And so, he was sent to hospice to die. So, he took it upon himself to initiate \u201cphytotherapy\u201d\u2014plant-based therapy, taking the amount of lycopene found in a quarter-cup of tomato sauce, or a tablespoon of tomato paste every day. His PSA, a measure of tumor bulk, started out at 365, dropped to 140 the next month, and then down to 8. His metastases started disappearing, and, as of his last follow-up, appeared to be living happily ever after. \nBut, when given in higher-dose pill form, it didn\u2019t seem to work. A 2013 review of all such lycopene supplement trials \u201cfailed to support [the initial] optimism.\u201d In fact, they were just happy that the lycopene pills didn\u2019t end up causing more cancer, like beta-carotene pills did. But, then came 2014. Researchers in Italy had been giving the largest doses they could of lycopene, selenium, and isolated green tea compounds to men with precancerous prostate lesions, hoping they could prevent full-blown cancer. But, in 2014, the expanded results of a similar trial were published, in which selenium and vitamin E supplements resulted in more cancer. Yikes! So, these researchers stopped their trial, and broke the code to unblind the results, And indeed, those taking high doses of lycopene, green tea catechins, and selenium appeared to get more cancer than those who just got sugar pills. \n\u201cThe potential implications are dramatic,\u201d said the lead researcher, \u201cgiven the current massive worldwide use of such compounds as alleged preventive supplementations in prostate and other cancers.\u201d What went wrong? \nWell, after the beta-carotene pill debacle, researchers measured cellular damage at different natural and unnatural doses of beta-carotene. At dietary doses, beta-carotene suppressed cellular damage, but at higher, supplemental doses, it not only appeared to stop working, but caused more damage. And, the same with lycopene. \u201cBoth lycopene and [beta]-carotene afforded protection against DNA damage\u201d at the kinds of levels one might see in people eating lots of tomatoes or sweet potatoes\u2014\u201dlevels\u2026comparable with those seen in the [blood] of individuals who consume a carotenoid-rich healthy diet.\u201d However, at the kind of blood concentrations that one might get taking pills, \u201cthe ability to protect the cells against such [free radical] damage was rapidly lost, and, indeed, the presence of [high levels of beta-carotene and lycopene] may actually serve to increase the extent of DNA damage.\u201d So, no wonder high-dose lycopene pills didn\u2019t work. \n\u201cPhytochemicals [may be] guardians of our health,\u201d but \u201c[t]he safety of consuming concentrated extracts\u2026is unknown.\u201d The protective benefits of a phytochemical-rich diet is best obtained [through whole plant foods].\u201d The food industry has different ideas, though. Soon, there may be phytochemical-fortified bacon, martinis, and ice cream, says this article in the journal Food Technology . If they can find just the right mix of plant compounds, they hope to reconstruct \u201cfoods that once contributed to illness and disease\u2026to offer significant health benefits.\u201d \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-01T23:19:46.007+02:00"}], "totalResults": 22, "moreResultsAvailable": 0, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=1eee5ef1-4d51-497e-9e88-ed86353bcda9&format=json&ts=1509571186007&q=language%3Aenglish+site%3Anutritionfacts.org&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 856}
