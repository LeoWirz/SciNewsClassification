Other experts say e-cigarettes are still unhealthy. \nMillions of smokers could live longer, healthier lives by switching to e-cigarettes. \nHow much longer? Advertisement Advertisement \nAccording to a new study from the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, an estimated 6.6 million smokers that kick traditional cigarettes to the curb could live a combined 86 million more years than those who don\u2019t. \nThat research , published today in the journal Tobacco Control, is the first to model prospective health outcomes based on a hypothetical situation in which cigarette use is largely replaced by e-cigarettes over a 10-year period. \nThe study authors based their predictions on two separate models: one \u201coptimistic\u201d and one \u201cpessimistic.\u201d Advertisement \nIn the optimistic model, researchers used data from current e-cigarette use patterns and published evaluations for potential harm reduction \u2014 that is, the ability of e-cigarettes to help smokers quit. \nIt\u2019s in this model that researchers discovered the large lifesaving potential of making the switch for millions of smokers. Advertisement Advertisement \nIn the pessimistic model, researchers used a \u201cworst case\u201d scenario, where e-cigarettes are more harmful than currently believed and less likely to help with smoking cessation. \nEven in this model, researchers found beneficial results. \nUnder this scenario, an estimated 1.6 million premature deaths would be averted and 20 million fewer years of life lost. \n\u201cI did go into the study confident of the ability to save lives under the optimistic scenario, which I believe is consistent with the data that we have so far,\u201d David Levy, PhD, professor of oncology at the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center at Georgetown University and the study\u2019s lead author, told Healthline. \n\u201cI did not expect that under the worst-case scenario, where we assumed all of the negative claims that we have found about e-cigarettes, that we would still find substantial public health gains in terms of lives saved,\u201d he said. Advertisement Advertisement E-cigarette benefits disputed \nWhile the lifesaving potential of e-cigarettes hypothesized in the study is promising, it\u2019ll hardly be the last word in an ongoing and ever growing debate about the benefits or harms of e-cigarettes. \nThe American Lung Association declined to comment on this research. But they\u2019ve previously affirmed to Healthline that they don\u2019t support the premise that e-cigarettes are any safer than traditional cigarettes at this time. \nAt the end of the day, e-cigarettes aren\u2019t considered safe from a health perspective. They\u2019re still nicotine products. Advertisement \nHowever, for many researchers and advocates, they\u2019re safer. And, when it comes to getting smokers to stop, safer most likely has to suffice. \nSmoking cigarettes remains one of the largest preventable health risks . Advertisement Advertisement \nFor long-term smokers, 2 out of 3 will likely die prematurely due to ailments from smoking. \nAs tobacco control experts move into what they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cendgame,\u201d or eliminating tobacco consumption entirely, the focus still remains on stubbing traditional cigarette smoking above all else. \nThat\u2019s why some argue that e-cigarettes are generally a good thing, if it means less cigarettes (again, safer, not safe). Advertisement \n\u201cThe best studies to date indicate that the most popular forms of e-cigarettes have a small fraction of the cancer-causing and other toxic chemicals that are ingested with cigarettes,\u201d said Levy. Quitting and starting \nEqually important as the emphasis on the \u201chealthiness\u201d of e-cigarettes are two key public health factors. Advertisement Advertisement \nDoes it help people quit and does it encourage young people to take up smoking? \nAnti-smoking advocates, including the American Lung Association, have been particularly critical of e-cigarettes as a gateway for kids and teens to take up nicotine. \nThe major sticking point is flavorings. \nAdvocates say that e-liquids, taking on all different flavors from fruits to candy, are enticing to youth. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) previously cracked down on flavored tobacco products in 2009, when it banned the sale of flavored cigarettes . \nThe lung association has since argued that the FDA should have the ability to do the same thing with e-cigarettes. \nLevy says the debate over flavorings is more complicated than that. \n\u201cNot only youth are attracted to the flavorings, but so are smokers, and they appear to encourage cessation from cigarettes,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we learn more about which flavors encourage cessation and which flavors encourage initiation, I think that the FDA will be in a better position to determine which should be banned.\u201d \nNonetheless, going back to Levy\u2019s two scenarios, it\u2019s important to remember: Even in the pessimistic scenario, in which all the evils of e-cigarettes argued by the lung association and others are true, they still appear to save lives. \nIn an optimistic scenario, the benefits are significantly more robust. \nAs far as smoking is concerned, e-cigarettes may simply represent the lesser of two evils.

She's a longtime type 1 diagnosed as a child who has grown up to become a certified diabetes educator (CDE), incredibly passionate about improving diabetes care. She advocates on behalf of many in our Diabetes Community, and has a keen eye as to what could change in a clinical setting to benefit patients. \nWithout further ado, here's our recent Q&A with Sarah... \nAn Interview with Diabetes Advocate Sarah Picklo Halabu \nDM) Hey Sarah\u2026 to start us off, how did diabetes first come into the picture for you? \nI was diagnosed with T1D at age 9 after attending a full week of zoo camp. It was an extremely hot week, and I remember being unusually thirsty. Fortunately, my parents noticed how rapidly I was losing weight and scheduled a visit at the pediatrician. When we arrived at pediatrician\u2019s office, I had this sinking feeling that someone would somehow discover how thirsty I was. Thankfully, they did. My blood sugar was somewhere in the high 400\u2019s. I was admitted to the hospital later that day and spent three days there learning the ropes of T1D. \nHow did your parents react to the diagnosis? \nI can only imagine how devastating it was for my parents, but their courage in calming my fears, determination to not let me see diabetes as a limitation, and fearlessness in jumping into the T1D routine was (and still is) heroic. My parents have been a consistent shield of support and encouragement during my journey with T1D, and I cannot emphasize what a tremendous difference this has made in my care and the quality of my life. \nDo you remember how it felt for you at the time, being so young? \nIt was a tough adjustment to life with T1D (as it is for everyone)... but my attitude took a turn for the positive when I spent time with the dietitian at the hospital where I was diagnosed. She was kind, compassionate, and positive and represented the first person to give me a sense of hope after my diagnosis. After meeting her, began telling everyone that I wanted to become a dietitian. And so my pursuit of becoming an RD CDE began\u2026 and it\u2019s of very little surprise to anyone in my family that this is my profession. Having T1D has single-handedly taught me about the capacity for human resilience -- it\u2019s limitless. \nCan you share more about working in the diabetes field? \nYes, I am a registered dietitian and Certified Diabetes Educator, with my practice focusing primarily on adults. Before becoming a CDE, I worked as a clinical dietitian. Currently, I work in medical publishing and my advocacy for improving patient care is vital to my work. \nWhat\u2019s it like, being both an educator and living with T1D yourself? \nAs a PWD, working as a CDE is an incredible experience that I would highly recommend for any PWDs who love science and technology. Day one on the job as a PWD CDE we are able to speak two important languages: the patient experience of diabetes, which varies significantly from person to person; the medical and scientific components of treatment, which also vary significantly from provider to provider. Because diabetes is equal parts personal experience and treatment regimen, being comfortable in both languages/worlds is a real advantage to providing the best care to others. \nMany PWDs will understand the analogy of diabetes management being a full-time job in itself. Working as a CDE who teaches diabetes self-management skills to others can intensify this sentiment. Diabetes (either your own or someone else\u2019s) is front and center of your mind everyday. For me, this was a positive because this actually inspired me to be really on top of my own care. \nSo being both a patient and provider brought perks for you personally? \nYes, when I think of being a PWD-CDE, I tend to reflect on the many positives: Access to endless learning opportunities related to diabetes, diabetes care, and new diabetes treatments. Befriending other PWD colleagues or diabetes healthcare providers who are equally as passionate about diabetes advocacy and care. Great diabetes care teams can move mountains! CDE positions tend to have really great insurance benefits and have broad coverage for diabetes medications and supplies. Immersion with other PWDs and endless opportunities to both a) learn from and b) empower others. It's extremely rewarding work! Knowledge about new, cutting-edge treatments and D-tech. It\u2019s wonderful to know what products and medications are in the pipeline. The opportunity to change the dialogue about living diabetes. Advocating for better diabetes care, diabetes gear, and diabetes solutions. Personally, this is my favorite. \nSounds like a great way to bring an insider\u2019s POV to the clinical side of diabetes, no? \nDefinitely! I also helped a diabetes clinic identify ways to improve the patient experience at our office, and found there are so many opportunities to make office visits more patient-centered! Those opportunities included: Modifying the scripting medical professionals use during visits to include more supportive, understanding language. Simplifying pre-appointment documents and registration materials to encompass only what is truly necessary and valuable for the healthcare team. Providing pump education classes which objectively present all pump models available so patients have ability to choose best \"fit\" for them. Streamlining pump and CGM downloading processes to decrease length of time disconnected from device. Coordinating a program for pregnant women to coordinate appointment times/visits with maternal fetal medicine clinic (as the number of appointments are many). Providing in-office diabetes-centered counseling via psychotherapists with expertise in T1D. Meeting patient-identified psychosocial and diabetes education needs at each office visit using a routine screening tool at visits. Offering same-day diabetes education visits. In-office coaching to help educate PWDs about the nuances of living with diabetes from a patient-centered perspective. Modeling a strengths-based perspective that puts the PWD at the center of decision-making. \nBeing a PWD CDE isn\u2019t about having \u201cperfect\u201d diabetes or wearing a \u201cstar patient\u201d badge. It\u2019s the opportunity to have an insider perspective and use this to help others in their journeys in any way possible. \nGreat insights! You've been involved in diabetes advocacy efforts as well, correct? \nYes, I take every opportunity I get to become more involved with the diabetes community and advocate for PWDs. I have been involved with many efforts over the years, including diabetes camp as both a camper and health care professional volunteer, and JDRF walks, galas, summits and fundraising activities. \nSome may find it interesting that my partner Nathan and I donated proceeds on behalf of all guests at our wedding (in 2015) to JDRF. And my wedding bouquet even had a diabetes twist, as I put grapes in my bouquet as a back-up hypoglycemia stash. \nFun! What are the biggest changes you\u2019ve seen in diabetes care over the years? \nThe good: Many treatments have improved since my diagnosis -- better insulins, smaller blood samples for BG checks, faster BG meters, smaller needles and lancets, and more diversity in pump infusion sets. There are also many new tools available like CGMs, more advanced insulin pumps, and inhaled insulin . Of all of these necessary treatment advancements, I believe CGM has been most transformative. \nThe disappointing: Though it is wonderful that there are more and better tools to assist with diabetes management, this isn\u2019t a long-term fix to T1D. The individuals who design and innovate these tools should be applauded for advancements that DO make large improvements to the quality of our lives. However, we have not yet fully embarked into the era of disease remission. None of these \u201ctech\u201d advancements are actually addressing the cause of the autoimmune process triggering T1D. \nCan you tell us more about the diabetes app development you\u2019ve been a part of? \nI worked with a South African endocrinology team and app developer to create an app for individuals with T2 and to improve the access to diabetes education in South Africa. Access to diabetes education in South Africa is a large challenge, so this was very important work. \nThe app is called Empower Diabetes , and it's part of the first full digital diabetes platform in South Africa for people with T2. It's available on the Apple store, and the pricing information can be found online here. \nI was selected as a contractor for this project based on my experience with diabetes education program development. They were specifically looking for someone with my personal and professional experience. Again, this app is definitely more for T2. \nAny thoughts on current challenges in diabetes innovation? \nCost is the biggest challenge. But I also think there are so many similar diabetes technologies that really don\u2019t offer significantly different features. Also, focusing too much energy/effort/funding on device development and not prioritizing autoimmune research to identify the cause and solution to T1D. Many processes are designed around the efficiencies of industry, business and clinics \u2013 all of which place the needs of PWDs absolutely last... That needs to change. Diabetes Advocate & CDE Sarah Picklo Halabu \nGoing back to my CDE role, though, I do think a lack of focus on the patient experience remains a big challenge. Many processes are designed around the efficiencies of industry, business and clinics \u2013 all of which place the needs of PWDs absolutely last in the hierarchy. That needs to change. \nAs far as technology use and access, what would you suggest? \nMany new diabetes healthcare professionals trial pumps and CGMs during their training. I wish there were a way to make this a more accurate experience for individuals with perfect, normal blood sugars. Sure, adjusting to wearing (and carrying) these devices is noble, but wearing the device is not the full experience. Sounds a little ridiculous, but a \u201cT1D simulator\u201d would be a phenomenal training tool. \nHow about accessing the right provider and healthcare team? \nAnother of my half-baked ideas might be a Yelp for diabetes offices, to help patients find the right provider for their needs and provide clinics with valuable feedback about the needs of their patients. \nTaking that to another level, in light of the recent hurricanes, it would be great if there were a centralized way to donate extra diabetes supplies to individuals in need. Though there are many generous donors and volunteers to coordinate these efforts during emergencies/disasters, there is a need for one organization to own this for providing diabetes medications and supplies in times of natural disaster/emergency. \nAny thoughts on improving affordability and access, as you mentioned? \nI grew up in Metro Detroit, and the practice of going to Canada is quite normal for people from there. Most drugs are cheaper in Canada, so many make the trip for that reason. I have several relatives who\u2019ve purchased drugs in Canada, just no other family members with diabetes who needed to purchase insulin. \nThis idea resurfaced recently when my parents made a visit to Windsor, after I had been complaining to my mom about the cost of insulin on my high deductible plan. She went to Walgreens in Windsor to compare the price of a vial of Humalog -- $32 there. Notably, the new short-acting Fiasp insulin is also available in Canada now and is also not as expensive there as it is in the U.S. \nSo, thinking outside the box to solve the insulin affordability problem in the U.S. \u2013 for residents with a valid U.S. passport (or enhanced driver\u2019s license) who live near an international border like Canada or Mexico, maybe there\u2019s a way to create a specific program or system for being able to bring diabetes supplies in a neighboring country that may be a more affordable option. Isn\u2019t it amazing that the price difference can be so drastic?! Why such disparity? \nWe can continue to ask for answers about these differences and costs associated with insulin production, though looking to new avenues to impact the demand for insulin in the U.S. may also be a viable strategy for some geographic regions. \nGreat thoughts, thank you. What are you looking forward to about the Innovation Summit? \nConnecting with other PWDs and using our collective experiences to provide insight on \u201creal life with T1D,\u201d and innovating with other PWDs to develop new solutions to improve care. \n\nThanks for sharing your story and thoughts with us, Sarah!

Experts say depression can be a difficult condition to spot. \nThe images on the video don\u2019t give any indication of any problem. \nChester Bennington, the lead singer of Linkin Park, sitting with his son and laughing as they taste different Jelly Belly candies. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe video, taken just the day before Bennington took his life, was posted by his wife last month on her Twitter account to show the world that depression has no face. \n\u201cThis is what depression looked like to us just 36 hrs b4 his death. He loved us SO much & we loved him,\u201d Talinda Bennington said in her caption. \nThe juxtaposition of Bennington enjoying a fatherly moment with ending his life 36 hours later doesn\u2019t jibe with what most people think of when they think of a person who is depressed, said Dr. Matthew Hirschtritt of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Advertisement \n\u201cIt\u2019s not our quintessential image of someone suffering internally,\u201d he told Healthline. \nBut the message that Bennington\u2019s wife is trying to convey is true, Hirschtritt added. Advertisement Depression can be difficult to see \nDepression doesn\u2019t carry one type of face. \nKey symptoms of depression include feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness, or hopelessness. \nOther symptoms show up as angry outbursts, loss of interest in normal activities, sleep disturbances, tiredness, and anxiety. \nWhat people need to understand is that these common symptoms will differ in how they manifest, according to Dr. Ken Duckworth, medical director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). \n\u201cDepression isn\u2019t just one thing, either biologically or how it presents,\u201d he told Healthline. Advertisement Advertisement \nNot all depressed people want to sleep all day. \nSome people take to overeating to compensate for their feelings of despair. Others may have no appetite whatsoever. \nThe changes in behavior can be subtle, such as a person sleeping more \u2014 or less. Advertisement \nOther times, symptoms can appear more obvious, such as a pronounced increase in alcohol and drug consumption. \nThe variation in symptoms makes it challenging for family members and friends to know when it\u2019s time to step in and intervene. Advertisement \n\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated thing,\u201d Duckworth said. When depression leads to suicide \nIt\u2019s important to note that depression doesn\u2019t always leads to suicide, as in Bennington\u2019s case. \nBut the two are connected. Advertisement \n\u201cSuicide occurs when stressors exceed your coping abilities,\u201d Hirschtritt said. \nHe noted that in the singer\u2019s case, it\u2019s important to take a step back.

In 2014, guns accounted for over 55 percent of all suicides in men and around 31 percent in women in the United States, reports the CDC . \nBoth Hirschtritt and Duckworth said if a person owns a gun \u2014 whether they have depression or not \u2014 they should always create barriers for people to gain access to those guns. \nThis includes trigger locks, safety locks, keeping the magazines separate from the gun, and keeping the gun locked in a safe. \nBetween 2009 and 2012 , more than 1 in 20 people ages 12 and older say they\u2019ve experienced depression, according to the CDC. \nDuckworth believes the numbers of people who have depression in the U.S. is higher. But because the disease still carries stigma in some communities and within some families, it\u2019s often underreported. \nIf talking about depression was easy, he added, nearly one-third of Americans would be members of NAMI. \n\u201cWe should have 100 million members,\u201d Duckworth said. \nEven so, Duckworth did note that society has made strides in how we deal with depression. \nIn the next 20 years, he expects to see the business community really step up efforts to combat depression and other mental health issues in the workplace. \n\u201cEmployee groups are going to wake up,\u201d he said. \u201cDepression is the number one cause of lack of productivity.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:39:54.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "85cc6920eeeb70d6cbc44e7cd055b3155c35c463", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4Staaa9NdVGoc2MPJTZoxAaof8zwimhngxCLy67p221._.jw1lYJB85GJz", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Personalized Diets May Help People with Irritable Bowel Syndrome", "title_full": "Personalized Diets May Help People with Irritable Bowel Syndrome", "published": "2017-10-03T23:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.994, "main_image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/766x415-IBD_Diets-thumb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "85cc6920eeeb70d6cbc44e7cd055b3155c35c463", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4Staaa9NdVGoc2MPJTZoxAaof8zwimhngxCLy67p221._.jw1lYJB85GJz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Written Kristen Fischer", "published": "2017-10-03T23:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Personalized Diets May Help People with Irritable Bowel Syndrome", "text": "Personalized Diets May Help People with Irritable Bowel Syndrome Written by Kristen Fischer on October 3, 2017 Researchers say food sensitivity testing could guide people with IBS toward diets that reduce the symptoms of their ailment. \nWatching what you eat may not be anything new as a way to treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). \nHowever, following a diet based on the results of food sensitivity testing could be a game-changer. Advertisement Advertisement \nResearchers from Yale University have concluded that the Alcat test could guide people with IBS on what foods to avoid, thus reducing intensity of symptoms. \nDr. Michelle S. Cohen, an assistant professor of gastroenterology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, explained that IBS is divided into different categories based on bowel habits that patients experience. \nIBS is a gastrointestinal ailment, but it\u2019s a separate condition from irritable bowel disease (IBD) . Advertisement \nOf many tests already available for IBS, the Alcat test hadn\u2019t been assessed in detail. It looks at leukocytes, a type of immune cell, to determine food sensitivities. \nThe test manufacturers funded the study, but Yale designed and conducted the research. Advertisement Advertisement \nParticipants went on diets that either restricted foods according to the test results or diets that weren\u2019t consistent with test results. \nUpon assessing the results, the researchers noted that all participants saw improvement. \nThose on diets that adhered to the test results, however, had better outcomes, including improvement in symptoms such as swelling and abdominal pain. \nAs for the test, it may see renewed interest since the study results have been published. \n\u201cIf our results can be replicated in larger and more diverse samples, we would consider this a new potential pathway for treatment,\u201d Ather Ali, ND, MPH, MHS, an assistant professor of pediatrics and medicine at the Yale School of Medicine and a study lead author, said. Advertisement Advertisement Pathways for treatment \nAlthough more than two-thirds of people with IBS identify food as an important trigger for their gastrointestinal symptoms, there has been little attention paid to diet-based solutions, noted Dr. William D. Chey, a professor of gastroenterology and internal medicine at the University of Michigan. \nHe led a team that published a study last year comparing diets, including the low-FODMAP eating plan . \nOver the past decade, there have been a few studies looking at different dietary interventions for people with IBS, including the new Yale research. Advertisement \n\u201cThere is certainly cause for optimism as this is the first study that I am aware of to show possible benefits of an elimination diet based upon leukocyte activation testing,\u201d Chey told Healthline. \nThe study involved only 58 people, so more research would be needed to make a definitive conclusion that this is a viable solution for IBS. Advertisement Advertisement \nOne of the biggest research focuses for IBS relief is on treatments impacting the gut microbiome. \n\u201cDiet is starting to play a key role in the treatment of IBS,\u201d Chey said. \u201cBehavioral treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy or hypnosis are also very effective for some patients.\u201d \n\u201cThere remains a great deal of interest in probiotics and non-absorbable antibiotics like rifaximin, which is already FDA approved for IBS-D [IBS with diarrhea],\u201d he added. Advertisement \nSimilar to basing a diet on the food sensitivity test, these solutions could include choosing treatments based on the gut. \nAnother pathway is looking at fecal transplantation as an IBS treatment. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cThe key for us going forward will be to move away from a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 toward a personalized medicine approach,\u201d Chey said.

Advertisement Advertisement \nAt least 59 people were killed. Hundreds were transported to hospitals after a gunman opened fire from a hotel window on a large crowd attending a music festival. \nOfficials said at a press conference that 527 people were injured in the attack , many with gunshot wounds that needed to be treated at hospitals. \nDr. Matthew Bank, the trauma medical director and chief of acute care surgery at North Shore University Hospital in New York, said even the best-trained hospital staff in the world would have difficulty caring for more than 100 seriously wounded patients in such a short period of time. Advertisement \n\u201cThere\u2019s no trauma center that trains for 100 gunshot wounds in that time frame. That level would be incredible,\u201d he said. \nMore than 100 patients were transferred to the only level-one trauma center at University Medical Center (UMC) of Southern Nevada. Advertisement Advertisement \nAnother 214 patients were treated at Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center. More than 120 of the Sunrise patients had gunshot wounds. \nOfficials released a statement on Monday that they had stopped all nonemergency care at Sunrise and had performed at least 30 surgeries in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. \n\u201cOur trauma center physicians and hospital staff have done an amazing job. So far, we have performed approximately 30 surgeries,\u201d said Todd P. Sklamberg, CEO of Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center, in a statement on Monday. \n\u201cThis has been an unprecedented response to an unprecedented tragedy. Our trauma team and all supporting nursing units, critical care areas, and ancillary services are all at work this morning in the aftermath of this tragedy \u2014 and most stayed throughout the night \u2014 to help the victims and to assist their loved ones,\u201d he said. \nAnother 61 patients were treated at the three hospitals of Dignity Health\u2013St. Rose Dominican, according to their representatives. Advertisement Advertisement Saving lives after mass shootings \nMass shootings and other mass casualty events are routine enough that hospitals train for them, with level-one trauma centers training twice a year. \nBank said once a mass casualty event is declared, most hospitals have a protocol to clear operating rooms and reach out to staff so that there are more people to treat patients. Some staff who are scheduled to leave will stay to assist. Others will be paged. \nBank said a mass casualty event is defined as an event where there aren\u2019t enough doctors and nurses for every patient. As a result, staff will start to perform a type of triage called \u201csecondary triage.\u201d Advertisement \nAt that stage, doctors, nurses, and other staff have a goal to care for the most number of people possible. \nThis means some staff may have to make tough decisions about patients with little chance of survival. Bank said if a patient has a \u201c2 or 3 percent\u201d chance of surviving, they may not get immediate care. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cThe one who is least likely to survive, [staff] may not really help because they\u2019re trying to help the most number of people,\u201d Bank said. Learning from past shootings \nRecent mass shootings, including those at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, and Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, have led medical officials to change how they prepare for mass casualty events. \nUMC staff had even recently met with staff based in Orlando, who had treated patients after the Pulse nightclub shooting, according to public broadcasting station WMFE. Advertisement \nIn 2013, the American College of Surgeons brought together a group of medical and law enforcement experts in Hartford, Connecticut, to come up with a plan to lower the death rate during mass shootings. \nThe group found that stopping bleeding after a gunshot injury was key to increasing the chance of a person\u2019s survival. They\u2019ve encouraged not just law enforcement, but also bystanders, to learn how to stop hemorrhaging. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cMilitary experience has shown that the number one cause of preventable death in victims of penetrating trauma is hemorrhage,\u201d the authors wrote . \nThey also found that EMS responders should be trained to provide care in an active shooter scenario and that all hospitals \u2014 even those that aren\u2019t level-one trauma centers \u2014 be trained for mass casualty events. \n\u201cTo be prepared, all hospitals should routinely practice the enactment of disaster plans. Hospitals that are in proximity to places where large groups of people gather, such as shopping malls, schools, sports arenas, and movie theaters, should practice community scenarios to rehearse the rapid deployment of resources,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cDrills should test the emergency department and hospital-wide activation.\u201d \nAfter the shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Dr. Comilla Sasson, an attending physician at the University of Colorado Hospital, wrote in a post that to keep patients alive, they had to switch between resuscitating them and performing procedures that could save their life. \n\u201cWe were running a chess game \u2014 coordinated chaos as we rotated the nine most critically injured patients in and out of resuscitation so we could place them on ventilators or put tubes in their chests to drain their lungs of blood,\u201d Sasson wrote shortly after the shooting. \nShe continued that they saw patients with bullet wounds to their head, chest, abdomen, and extremities. \n\u201cBullet wounds are tricky. A slug into the shoulder can wreak havoc in the abdomen,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt was crucial for us to monitor vital signs to make sure nobody was crashing.\u201d \nOf the 23 taken to the hospital, 22 survived. \nAside from the devastation emotionally and physically, shooting injuries also take a toll financially. \nA study released today found that emergency room and hospital visits for injuries related to firearms cost approximately $2.8 billion every year.

Advertisement Advertisement \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have announced that they concur with scientific evidence asserting that when an individual has an undetectable HIV viral count, there\u2019s effectively no risk of them transmitting HIV to a sexual partner. \nThe CDC is following the lead of more than 400 international groups that signed a consensus statement in 2016 recognizing that \u201cundetectable = untransmittable\u201d (U=U). \nThe CDC wrote, \u201cWhen ART results in viral suppression, defined as less than 200 copies/ml or undetectable levels, it prevents sexual HIV transmission.\u201d Advertisement \n\u201cAcross three different studies, including thousands of couples and many thousand acts of sex without a condom or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), no HIV transmissions to an HIV-negative partner were observed when the HIV-positive person was virally suppressed,\u201d the CDC letter stated. \u201cThis means that people who take ART daily as prescribed and achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of sexually transmitting the virus to an HIV-negative partner.\u201d \nThe CDC\u2019s announcement came last week on National Gay Men\u2019s HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that the CDC has endorsed what we and many other HIV/AIDS organizations, researchers, and doctors have known for many years: if you\u2019re HIV positive with an undetectable viral load, there is a negligible risk of HIV transmission,\u201d said Eric Sawyer, vice president of public affairs and policy at Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis (GMHC) , an HIV and AIDS prevention, care, and advocacy organization. \nNegligible means the risk is so small statistically that it\u2019s not worth considering. \nIn 2016, two studies, published in The New England Journal of Medicine and The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) , tracked couples in which one partner was HIV-positive and one partner was not. \nBoth studies found that after the HIV-positive partner was on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least six months, there were zero transmissions of HIV to their partner during sex without condoms. \nAdditional research presented at the 2017 International AIDS Society (IAS) Conference in Paris bolstered these findings. Advertisement Advertisement Treatment as prevention \nDoctors put people diagnosed with HIV on ART immediately, even if their viral loads are low. \nDoing so helps prevent the spread of HIV. \nThe technique is referred to as \u201ctreatment as prevention.\u201d Advertisement \n\u201cClinicians have known that treatment as prevention, when coupled with other prevention tools including condoms or PrEP, works and that it\u2019s important to put a newly diagnosed person on antiretrovirals as soon as possible \u2014 not only for their health and to get their viral load under control, but also for the health of their potential partners,\u201d Sawyer told Healthline. \n\u201cThe CDC endorsement of U=U might help further convince newly diagnosed patients to follow this method, which would help us bring down overall incidence of HIV infection,\u201d he continued. Advertisement Advertisement \nDr. Daniel Murrell, an infectious disease fellow at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who works in an HIV clinic, says that the invention of better therapies and a wider selection of ART drugs has made treating HIV easier than ever. \nHIV clinics across the country vary regarding when, or if, they\u2019ve started treating patients under the pretense of U=U. \nBut Murrell mentioned that, \u201cEvery clinic has been operating with the idea that your health must be optimized.\u201d Advertisement \n\"With patients I see that are undetectable, I\u2019ll use this info about the CDC backing as a reinforcement,\u201d Murrell told Healthline. \nHe explained that he\u2019ll let his patients know \u201cthey\u2019re doing a great job, aren\u2019t putting their partner at risk, and will encourage them to keep taking their medicine.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nWhile studies show that HIV is not transmittable even without the use of condoms and PrEP, Murrell said that doctors will still encourage undetectable patients to practice safe sex. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue handing out condoms and PrEP therapy,\u201d he said. \nGay and bisexual men are still affected by HIV. Among gay and bisexual men living with diagnosed HIV, 61 percent have achieved viral suppression. \nThat\u2019s an improvement from past years, but the CDC noted it\u2019s still \u201cwell short of where we want to be.\u201d CDC backing could help lessen stigma \nMisinformation, stigma, and fear around HIV remains prevalent. \nPeople diagnosed with HIV overestimate the risk of infecting their HIV-negative partner. Even though only 10 percent of participants in a recent survey had non-suppressed viral loads, a third of respondents believed their chance of infecting a partner was high, according to AIDSMAP . \n\u201cWe hope the CDC\u2019s endorsement of this fact helps lessen the stigma that still exists around people living with HIV, and that it encourages an open dialogue between sexual partners about their status, treatment, and prevention methods,\u201d said Sawyer. \nPrevention Access Campaign has been a leader in education around the issue with the U=U campaign. \nAdvocates also hope the CDC\u2019s backing will provide additional leverage for challenging state nondisclosure laws, which criminalize HIV-positive people who don\u2019t disclose their HIV status. \nSawyer pointed out, \u201cThe CDC\u2019s acknowledgement is a further indication that our laws around nondisclosure are no longer supported by the current accepted science and research about HIV transmission.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "whitney akers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eric sawyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sawyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel murrell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murrell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gmhc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gay men\u2019s health crisis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england journal of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "journal of the american medical association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T07:37:47.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e58b3ef401c842fd8c4df88a7a3e55ef654d34c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_UgqhSnhIqJqu9pFkEBELQkoZSobWtatg.T.9nfOec6.cI7GiOChiODVpyA-", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "http://www.healthline.com/rss/diabetesmine", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Healthline RSS Feed", "title": "FDA Fastracks mHealth Apps Review, Diabetes Tops List!", "title_full": "FDA Fastracks mHealth Apps Review, Diabetes Tops List!", "published": "2017-10-04T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.healthline.com/resources/healthline/images/logo-lg.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e58b3ef401c842fd8c4df88a7a3e55ef654d34c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_UgqhSnhIqJqu9pFkEBELQkoZSobWtatg.T.9nfOec6.cI7GiOChiODVpyA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mike Hoskins", "published": "2017-10-04T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "FDA Fastracks mHealth Apps Review, Diabetes Tops List!", "text": "Email addresses will not be shared with 3rd parties.

Close \nIn what can only be described as a pretty revolutionary move, the U.S. FDA is looking to change how it reviews mobile apps and digital health software to accelerate the regulatory process and get these products out there for people to start using ASAP. \nIn late July, the agency announced a Pre-Certification for Software Pilot Program that would evaluate and dub certain companies as \"trustworthy,\" to give their products the needed regulatory nod without the usual protracted regulatory review. \nNow, the FDA has chosen nine companies (out of more than 100 applicants) to be part of the initial pilot program. \nNotably for our Diabetes Community, seven of the nine the companies have direct ties to diabetes: Apple : The Goliath behind the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and HealthKit, that has been promoting its ventures into the diabetes space of late; Fitbit : The smartwatch and health-tracker company that just recently teamed up with Dexcom , and is also working with Medtronic and others in the healthcare and diabetes app space; Johnson & Johnson : Which obviously has a longstanding presence in diabetes with its OneTouch, LifeScan and Animas products (though the company has been \" strategically evaluating \" the future of those divisions); Roche : As with J&J, this goes beyond just diabetes but it's significant given the Accu-Chek Connect developments over the years and the recent acquisition of the mySugr platform for diabetes data; Samsung : The consumer electronic giant based in South Korea that's become active in healthcare, notably partnering with Medtronic to develop next-gen smartwatch connectivity that includes CGM data display; Tidepool : The non-profit startup in Palo Alto that came on the scene in 2014 and has changed the conversation around open D-data and creating a new way to upload various diabetes devices into a single hub in the cloud; Verily (formerly Google Life Sciences): Google's health spinoff that is most well-known in the diabetes space for partnering with Dexcom to create next-gen CGM sensor that will be the size of a dime. \nThe other two companies chosen for the FDA pilot program are Pear Therapeutics in Boston , that designs prescription digital health tools for various conditions, and Phosphorus in New York, a biochemical company that focuses on the human genome and related sofware and data platforms. \nReally, if you look at the list, diabetes certainly stands out as a focus. A Needed FDA Fix \n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best to not over-hype it, but I think this is a pretty big deal,\u201d says D-Dad Howard Look, founder of the non-profit open-data startup Tidepool that was chosen for this pilot. \u201cThis is the FDA acknowledging that the old guidance for how software technology is regulated wasn\u2019t working, and that it just couldn\u2019t keep up with the pace of innovation we\u2019ve been seeing in Silicon Valley and the consumer world.\u201d \nNo wonder FDA was overwhelmed, given that estimates show last year 165,000 health-related apps were available for Apple or Android smartphones. Forecasts predict that such apps would be downloaded 1.7 billion times by the end of 2017. \nWhat this new pilot program means is that the FDA is working toward a whole new framework for evaluating mHealth companies and software in a world where things move incredibly quickly. \nThis follows the landmark FDA decision in 2015 to change its approach to regulating mobile apps in healthcare by classifying many as \"low-risk, non-medical function\" items. This had an impact on the Dexcom G5 Mobile at the time \u2013 allowing faster approval. This also comes on the heels of long-awaited medical mobile app guidance and interoperability guidance from FDA. \n\u201cThis is part of a long stream of decisions by the FDA acknowledging that they need to think differently in order to allow for innovation to proceed,\" Look says. How Companies & PWDs Will Benefit \n\"This new program embraces the principle that digital health technologies can have significant benefits to patients\u2019 lives and to our healthcare system by facilitating prevention, treatment, and diagnosis; and by helping consumers manage chronic conditions outside of traditional healthcare settings,\" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottleib wrote in a July blog post previewing this program. \nWhen we asked what the FDA sees this meaning for the average PWD (person with diabetes), an agency spokeswoman responded: \"Consumers will benefit the most from this pilot program; they will have timely access to innovative digital health products.\" \nFor Tidepool, this means they'll be invited to a series of meetings with FDA officials throughout multiple phases of the program, with the goal of helping the agency better understand how groups like Tidepool build their software. \nIndeed, the FDA's requirements for pilot program participants were all about \"opening the kimono\" on the development process: The company must be in the process of developing or planning to develop a software product that meets the definition of a medical device; The company must have an existing track record in developing, testing, and maintaining software products and demonstrating a culture of quality and organizational excellence measures that are tracked by Key Performance Indicators (KPI) or other similar measures; And during participation of the pilot, companies must agree to: Provide access to measures for developing, testing and maintaining software products and demonstrating a culture of quality and organizational excellence measures by KPI; Collect real-world post-market data and provide it to FDA; Meet with FDA for real-time consultation; Be available for site visits from FDA officials; and, Provide information about the firm\u2019s quality management system. \nLook says all that was a no-brainer for Tidepool, as it's how the organization has worked with FDA since the very start. \n\u201cI get very frustrated with companies that say the FDA is the bottleneck, because they don\u2019t believe they are,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you engage early and often, they want to help you move quickly through the process.\u201d \nTidepool learned so quickly that Look recalls Stayce Beck of FDA once telling him he should go give talks at other medical device startups about how to best work collaboratively with the FDA. \nThe new pilot program is meant to codify that kind of collaboration into actual working protocols between the agency and companies. A Three-Phase Rollout \nThree phases are envisioned at the moment: pre-certification, framework for streamlining the approval process, and then post-market selection of data. After the first phase this Fall, the FDA expects to hold a public workshop in January 2018 to go over initial findings. \nLook says participants were told to expect that each of the three phases could last 4-6 months, meaning final draft guidance on all of this could be ready for publication at some point in early 2019. \nHe sees this as being beneficial for public health, with diabetes being very much front and center. In particular, he sees it as very notable that companies like Google and Apple and Samsung are on the list along with traditional therapeutic and medical companies like Roche and JnJ. \n\u201cIt\u2019s another sign that the medical health-tech and consumer electronics worlds are colliding in a big way,\u201d he says. DOC Thanks FDA \nFrom our POV as hosts of the bi-annual D-Data ExChange (diabetes tech leaders) forum for the past five years, we believe the D-Community should stand up and take notice here of how much of an ally the FDA has become. We've not been shy about saying that before, and we echo it again -- especially in light of recent approvals of groundbreaking new technology and treatments here in the U.S., and establishing the first-ever FDA Patient Engagement Advisory Committee that includes well-known DPAC advocate Bennet Dunlap (their first meeting is set for Oct. 11-12). \nWe also have to give huge kudos to Drs. Courtney Lias and Stayce Beck of FDA, who just received some much-deserved national recognition for all their regulatory work on getting the first closed loop (pre-Artificial Pancreas) technology to market here in the States, among other things. \nWay to go, FDA! Thanks for all you're doing to streamline the regulatory process and therefore make life better for PWDs and all patients! Disclaimer : Content created by the Diabetes Mine team.

Written by Whitney Akers on October 4, 2017 A viral post that claims the ballooning size of a uterus during a period is to blame for a \"heavy\" feeling many women experience isn\u2019t backed by science. Photo: Facebook \nA viral photo making its way around Facebook claims to explain the reason many women feel \u201cheavy\u201d during their periods. \nThe photo compares two uterus models side-by-side. One represents a smaller, nonmenstruating uterus. The other model is a dark-colored menstruating uterus almost double in size. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe claim comes from Apples and Ovaries, an account run by a holistic nutritional therapist and natural fertility health consultant. \n\u201cThis is why we feel so heavy at the beginning of our bleed. Why it can feel like our uterus is about to drop out and hit the pavement... And why we need to take things sl w,\u201d Apples and Ovaries wrote as a caption for the photo. \nNearly 25,000 people have shared the Facebook post and 19,000 have liked it. The resounding response in more than 6,000 comments is, \u201cWell that explains it.\u201d Advertisement \nOne woman wrote, \u201cAhhh, that is a wonderful confirmation of the discomfort. All makes more sense now.\u201d \nAnother woman wrote, \u201cWOW good to know cause I do feel so bloated and heavy on the 2nd day.\u201d Advertisement \nBut two gynecologists say the models aren\u2019t grounded in science. Does your uterus really grow? \nHealthline asked Dr. Safrir Neuwirth , an OB-GYN at CentraState Healthcare System , if a woman\u2019s uterus nearly doubles in size monthly during her period. \n\u201cThe simple answer is no,\u201d Neuwirth responded. \u201cIn my 20 years of practice, I\u2019ve never noticed much of a change in the size of the uterus during the period.\u201d \nAnother OB-GYN, Dr. Kimberly Gecsi , who practices at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center , had a similar reaction. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard anything about a uterus increasing in size during a woman\u2019s period,\u201d she said. \n\u201cThere are certain things that happen physiologically during a woman\u2019s period that do increase the volume of the uterus and make it slightly more swollen,\u201d Neuwirth noted. \u201cBut does the uterus double in size like this picture? No way.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nNeuwirth explained that there\u2019s increased blood flow to the uterus during that time of the month, driven by a surge in hormones. \nThe lining of the uterus, which is what sheds during a period, also thickens by about half a centimeter leading up to the first day of menstruation. \n\u201cThe combination of the two factors might slightly increase the volume of the uterus by as much as 10 to 15 percent,\u201d Neuwirth told Healthline. Advertisement \nMegan Assaf, a licensed massage therapist and the founder of Wombs for Wisdom , created these uterus models. She said the two sizes are \u201cbased on a unique combination of medical science data, medical illustrations, cadaver observation, over a decade of manual palpation of living wombs, and concepts from traditional folk healing.\u201d \nAssaf told Healthline that the medical basis she cited comes from a Maya Abdominal Therapy book written by Rosita Arvigo, DN. Advertisement Advertisement \nAccording to Assaf, the book states that in a woman who isn\u2019t pregnant, the uterus weighs 4 ounces. During menstruation, the uterus can weigh as much as 8 ounces. \nHowever, changes in weight and size aren\u2019t the same thing. Uterus size varies among women \nThe typical size of a uterus is approximately 7 centimeters long, 5 centimeters wide, and 4 centimeters thick. Advertisement \nBut the size varies considerably, emphasized Neuwirth. \n\u201cThe uterus models in the picture are both totally normal uterine sizes,\u201d Gecsi clarified. \u201cThe smaller one looks like a uterus you could see in someone who\u2019s never had children or is postmenopausal, and the other is pretty representative of a uterus in a woman who\u2019s had a few children.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nNeuwirth further explained that having babies increases the size of the uterus, or womb. Most of the time after childbirth, the uterus will remain larger, he said. \nThere are a few other reasons for the variety in uterus size. About 20 to 80 percent of women will develop uterine fibroids by the time they're 50. Fibroids are noncancerous growths on the side of the uterus wall. They vary in size and can enlarge the uterus overall. \nGenetics are also at play in uterus size. \n\u201cIt\u2019s important know that if a woman\u2019s uterus is enlarged, it could be a sign of a different problem\u201d and to consult a doctor, Gecsi warned. \nShe pointed out that since the uterus is set deep into the pelvis, a woman wouldn\u2019t be able to notice the change in size herself. The reason for that monthly heavy feeling \nIt\u2019s easy for things to go viral without being fact checked, and these models certainly look compelling. \nBut the lack of scientific evidence to back up the change in uterine size during menstruation highlights the need to research medical information you read on social media if it\u2019s not from a trusted source. \nSince feeling \u201cheavy\u201d during a period is common, the picture of the uterus models resonated with thousands of women. \nWhile women might experience a heavier feeling because of the increased volume of blood in the uterus, Neuwirth said, the main factor behind that full, uncomfortable feeling comes from a combination of bloating, extra water retention, and excess gas. \nYou can blame those symptoms on the plummeting levels of the hormone progesterone during a period \u2014 not a ballooning uterus.

The reason may be related to your body's \"famine reaction.\" \nEveryone has a trick or dieting tip that helped them shed 5, 15, or even 55 pounds. \nDrink this three times a day. Eat that once a week. Take this daily. Advertisement Advertisement \nAs strict diets such as the keto diet and intermittent fasting are gaining steam, it seems there\u2019s nothing most Americans won\u2019t do to drop a few pounds. \nBut the reality is, weight loss typically comes down to two things: eat less and move more. \nNow, a study published in the International Journal of Obesity says the \u201ceat less\u201d portion of the weight-loss equation may need a little adjustment. Advertisement Cheat to lose? \nThe study from researchers at the University of Tasmania found that people who dieted for two weeks and then didn\u2019t restrict their calories for two weeks actually lost more weight and more fat than people who dieted continuously. \nFor the study, 51 obese men were assigned to one of two groups. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe first group cut calories by one-third for 16 weeks. \nThe second group cut calories by one-third for two weeks and then took a \u201cbreak\u201d and ate their maintenance level of calories for two weeks. \nThey repeated these \u201ccheat breaks\u201d for the full 16 weeks of the study. \nAt the end of the study, the men who took the break from their diets lost about 50 percent more weight than the men in the other group. \nPlus, they shed more fat than the control group. Advertisement Advertisement \nSix months later, the researchers did a follow-up to see how well the weight loss was maintained. \nBoth groups regained some weight, but the men who used breaks during their diet were still on average 18 pounds lighter than men in the control group. What\u2019s so great about cheat breaks? \nDieting requires you to eat fewer calories than you burn in a day. Advertisement \nWith a calorie deficit, your body must use fuel \u2014 stored fat \u2014 to keep your energy up. Ultimately, this can result in weight loss. \nBut there\u2019s a dieting catch-22 that often snags those seeking to lose weight. Advertisement Advertisement \nWhen you restrict calories, your appetite actually increases. Plus, you\u2019re burning fewer calories at rest, which means you need less food. \nThis \u201cfamine reaction\u201d results in a weight-loss plateau or even a gain for many people. \nCheat breaks give your metabolism a bit of a boost by convincing your body the \u201cfamine\u201d is over. Advertisement \nYour metabolism increases and you\u2019re able to break through the stalled weight loss. \nCheat breaks also allow for humans to be humans, says Samantha Scruggs, a registered dietitian who works with individuals in weight loss, improving health and vitality, and emotional eating. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cI think this diet fits into a real and busy lifestyle that most of us live,\u201d Scruggs told Healthline. \u201cWe often commit to a diet program for a little while and then \u2018fall off the wagon\u2019 and then decide to give up. If that sounds like you, this study gives a lot of hope that once you fall off, you can get back on and continue your diet and actually potentially lose more weight doing it that way due to avoiding the dreaded drop in metabolism and plateau that occurs for so many and also causes such a loss of motivation.\u201d \nFor David Ezell, clinical director of Darien Wellness, a counseling and wellness group in Connecticut, the study reinforces something he\u2019s done in his own life for a while. \nEzell uses periods of \u201cfeeding up and then feeding down,\u201d which echoes the same techniques this new study used. \nThe goal is to keep the metabolism in flux and prevent a plateau. \n\u201cOur bodies will only allow a certain amount of weight loss before a shift occurs and the fat, which the body sees as its most valuable asset, is conserved,\u201d Ezell told Healthline. \u201cHealthy weight loss \u2014 the loss of body fat \u2014 slows to a crawl. This plateauing is a key survival mechanism on the Serengeti but not so helpful in the suburbs of the USA.\u201d How to practice cheat breaks \nIntermittent energy restriction \u2014 another way to say occasional dieting mixed with no dieting \u2014 is not yet as en vogue as more restrictive diets, but it should be, Scruggs says. \n\u201cIntermittent fasting is where you fast for 12 to 18 hours, and then eat, usually without much if any restriction, for the other 6 to 12 hours over the day,\u201d Scruggs says. \u201cIntermittent energy restriction, on the other hand, is where you follow a calorie-restricted diet for several weeks and then switch to a two-week period where you follow an eating pattern that meets your energy expenditure exactly.\u201d \nTheoretically, Scruggs says, this latter two-week period wouldn\u2019t produce any weight loss but would help you maintain your weight. \nDon\u2019t be tempted to select a \u201ccheat day\u201d in the middle of a week of dieting. The study, Scruggs says, points out a day isn\u2019t enough to change your body\u2019s fat-burning dynamics. \n\u201cCheat days may not allow for the time to reset your body\u2019s metabolism that the full two-week period of iso-caloric intake would,\u201d she explained. \nIf this diet technique sounds like something you\u2019d like to try, you can get started by calculating your calorie needs for weight maintenance and weight loss. \nOnline tools are available or you can meet with a registered dietitian who can help you create a plan specific to your goals. \nOnce you have your calorie goals, select a week to start and closely follow the weight-loss calorie requirements for two weeks. \nAt the end of that period, try two weeks at your weight maintenance calorie level. \nAnd then repeat for several months to see how much you\u2019re able to lose. \n\u201cEven if you maintain your weight for a week, then lose the next week, you are still making progress toward your overall goal,\u201d Scruggs said.

Multiple sclerosis or MS, is a nervous system disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Reports estimate that 2.3 million people are living with MS worldwide, but what are the symptoms and how is MS treated?\nDo you have any desire to travel to Russia?\nYou might if you have multiple sclerosis.\nPeople with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States and Canada are traveling to Russia for an experimental treatment that\u2019s a potential cure for the disease.\nHowever, there are still a number of risks involved.\nHematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) is a therapy for MS that has, in many cases, been shown to halt progression of the disease with a single treatment.\nHowever, in North America, the procedure is still considered experimental and isn\u2019t widely available. It\u2019s also costly.\nThe lure of a cure For individuals facing a potential lifetime of MS, the allure of a cure abroad is tantalizing.\nAccording to Bruce Bebo, executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, HSCT treatment is promising. But he cautions there still aren\u2019t enough rigorous clinical studies on it to weigh the real risks and benefits.\nMS is a demyelinating autoimmune disease in which the body\u2019s immune system begins to attack the myelin, the protective insulation of the nervous system.\nThese attacks cause scarring (sclerosis) that leads to a host of neurological symptoms from tremors and loss of vision, to difficulty with speech.\nIt\u2019s typically diagnosed in individuals between the ages of 20 and 40.\nHSCT is a complex procedure that requires a bone marrow transplant similar to that used by oncologists for certain blood cancers.\nThe treatment is an attempt to \u201creboot\u201d the immune system and stop it from attacking the brain and spinal cord.\n\u201cOne way to think about it is that you are reeducating and creating a new immune system,\u201d Bebo told Healthline. \u201cIt appears that in many cases when you do this, that new immune system learns that the central nervous system isn\u2019t dangerous anymore and it doesn\u2019t attack it anymore.\u201d\nHow the treatment works In the first step of HSCT treatment, chemotherapy is used to stimulate the production of bone marrow stem cells and promote their release into the bloodstream. This blood is then drawn and stored.\nThe patient is then given a strong dose of more chemotherapy, most often in a hospital setting, for up to 11 days.\nDuring that time, immune cells are either dramatically weakened or killed entirely.\nFinally, the patient\u2019s stored stem cells are infused back into the body, learning to leave the nervous system intact.\nThe process can be strenuous.\nPatients must take antibiotics to fight off infections while their immune systems are suppressed.\nThey must also stay in the hospital for weeks at a time while their immune system rebuilds.\nA recent study said that the average hospital stay after the stem cell infusion lasted between 10 and 160 days.\nThat may be a small price to pay to stop a chronic illness, especially for individuals diagnosed young.\nThere\u2019s also the matter of the real price \u2014 as in dollars.\n\u201cI think [the reason] people are leaving the country has to do with cost,\u201d said Bebo. \u201cI\u2019m aware of many people who although they have to fight tooth and nail to get it, can get their insurance company to cover most or all the costs of this procedure in the U.S. It\u2019s expensive.\u201d\nThe cost is in the six-figure range. Healthline previously reported that it could be done in the United States for about $125,000.\nIt\u2019s a lot cheaper to go to Mexico or Russia to get HSCT therapy, where \u201cthey will perform the therapy for a fraction of the cost,\u201d said Bebo.\nRelapsing vs. progressive There are also caveats to the treatment, dependent on the MS diagnosis.\nBroadly speaking, there are two major types of MS: relapsing and progressive.\nRelapsing, the more common form, is identified by intermittent \u201cattacks\u201d or exacerbations in which symptoms will worsen for a period and then dissipate.\nAs the disease progresses, the exacerbations get worse and the overall disability of the person increases.\nBebo describes progressive MS as a \u201cslow, steady progression of disability.\u201d It\u2019s less common but significantly more difficult to treat.\n\u201cWhat little evidence we have at this point suggests that people with progressive MS don\u2019t respond to HSCT,\u201d said Bebo.\nTypical drug regimens for relapsing MS, called disease modifying therapies (DMTs), also tend to be less effective for progressive MS.\nThis \u201cgap,\u201d as Bebo puts it, in treatment between progressive and relapsing MS may be driving medical tourism abroad.\nAgainst doctors\u2019 recommendations, patients may still elect to travel abroad to seek out HSCT for progressive MS.\nNew drugs, such as Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), have been approved more recently by the FDA for the treatment of progressive MS.\nSome serious risks HSCT treatment isn\u2019t without risks.\nIt\u2019s not a trivial procedure and has been known for its serious mortality risk.\nA study from 2017 concluded that while the procedure showed significant benefit against MS progression, the overall transplant-related mortality rate was about 2 percent.\nAs the procedure has improved, so have mortality rates. An older 2002 study of 85 MS patients treated with HSCT documented seven deaths in the group \u2014 a mortality rate of about 8 percent.\n\u201cI think there are still many neurologists who remember the older studies, the high risk of mortality,\u201d said Bebo, \u201cand until there is a rigorous, well-controlled study that documents the effectiveness and mortality risk, then I think some neurologists are going to be hesitant to recommend the therapy.\u201d\nWhat the future holds But Bebo and his colleagues at the MS society are also enthusiastic about the growing interest and research being done on HSCT.\n\u201cI do see the neurology community being more accepting of this approach than they have in the past.\u201d\nHowever, he emphasizes that HSCT isn\u2019t an MS panacea.\nDepending on the diagnosis, the procedure must find its way into established therapy methods.\nWhile HSCT is available in the United States today, it could still be years before it\u2019s easily accessible \u2014 and affordable.\n\u201cWe really look forward to the day when we have results from a really well-controlled, rigorous clinical trial to really tell us once and for all what\u2019s the full benefit of this, what are the full risks, and who is the person most likely to benefit from it,\u201d said Bebo.\nUntil then, people living with MS may choose to seek out treatment abroad, where the chance at a permanent cure may already be available.\nIn the race against a chronic illness, the U.S. medical system may just be moving too slowly for the young and the desperate.\nThis article first appeared on HealthLine.com.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gigen mammose", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bruce bebo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bebo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national multiple sclerosis society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hsct", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T06:40:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5fd44dbefa9cf2c42865cc7bc35e4c6507c03b98", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StabGvKE6Qo4nSGX1gfJzRK2G.8oP_V.w3sqqE9k.zTqAxSqSpegkZVBJzpLwXkSBojVstKnlnonWgCIWKC4wMIoG", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Why Are Disease Outbreaks from Pork Products on the Rise?", "title_full": "Why Are Disease Outbreaks from Pork Products on the Rise?", "published": "2017-10-04T23:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.969, "main_image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/food-nutrition/2662-cutting_pork-766x415-thumbnail.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5fd44dbefa9cf2c42865cc7bc35e4c6507c03b98", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StabGvKE6Qo4nSGX1gfJzRK2G.8oP_V.w3sqqE9k.zTqAxSqSpegkZVBJzpLwXkSBojVstKnlnonWgCIWKC4wMIoG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Written Elizabeth Pratt", "published": "2017-10-04T23:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Are Disease Outbreaks from Pork Products on the Rise?", "text": "Why Are Disease Outbreaks from Pork Products on the Rise? Written by Elizabeth Pratt on October 4, 2017 Foodborne illness outbreaks are still uncommon, but they can be widespread and serious when they happen. Here are some safety tips. \nThe number of disease outbreaks linked to food in the United States has decreased overall in recent years. \nBut the percentage of those attributed to pork has risen. Advertisement Advertisement \nA recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that from the period of 1998 to 2015, 288 outbreaks were linked to pork. \nThe frequency of outbreaks due to pork decreased by 37 percent during this time period, which was in line with a total decline of foodborne outbreaks. \nHowever, in 2015 the number of pork-related outbreaks increased by 73 percent compared with the previous three years. Advertisement \nAnd it\u2019s not just because we\u2019re eating more bacon. \n\u201cEstimates of pork consumption show a slight increase in 2015, but not to the extent that pork-associated outbreaks increased. CDC and partners are monitoring outbreak reports to determine if this was an unusual year or the beginning of a new trend,\u201d Julie Self, PhD, who works in the CDC\u2019s Epidemic Intelligence Service, told Healthline. Advertisement Advertisement What the numbers reveal \nThe 288 outbreaks attributed to pork between 1998 and 2015 resulted in 6,372 illnesses, 443 hospitalizations, and four deaths. \nSalmonella was found to be the most common pathogen linked to pork outbreaks. \nBut it\u2019s probably still safe to eat your ham sandwich for lunch. \nAccording to Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the odds of contracting an illness due to pork remains low. \n\u201cPork-related infections now are rare, considering the huge volume of pork consumed each year. Most are caused by salmonella, a bacterial infection that causes an intestinal illness characterized by fever and diarrhea. Salmonella can sometimes gain access to the bloodstream and cause sepsis \u2014 a serious, life-threatening infection,\u201d Schaffner told Healthline. Advertisement Advertisement \nAlthough the number of overall foodborne outbreaks is declining, Schaffner notes that when outbreaks do occur they have the potential to be serious. \n\u201cBecause of the large-scale commercialization of our food supply, foodborne outbreaks now are less apt to be small or local and more likely to be larger and spread over a greater expanse geographically. Thus they are taken very seriously by public health and the food service industry,\u201d he said. It starts on the farm \nKeeping food safe relies on a number factors working well every day. Advertisement \nIn simple terms, foodborne diseases are the result of eating food contaminated with germs. \n\u201cSometimes, the germs contaminate the animals or plants we eat while they are being raised, even before they are harvested. Sometimes, the contamination occurs during processing, such as during slaughter or packing, and sometimes it occurs in the kitchen during preparation. Most of the illnesses are caused by germs that spend most of their life in farm animals, usually without making them sick,\u201d Dr. Rob Tauxe, director of the CDC\u2019s Division of Foodborne, Waterborne, and Environmental Diseases, told Healthline. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cPreventing foodborne disease starts on the farm, with good agricultural practices for the raising and harvesting of the plants and animals we eat. It also depends on careful processing, and final preparation all along the way, from farm to table. Many people doing the right thing every day are key partners in making our food safe,\u201d he said. What to do in the kitchen \nFollowing food safety practices in the kitchen is an essential component of eliminating the risk of food-related illness. \nA recent study found that only pork chops that were cooked until well done completely eliminated listeria and salmonella pathogens. Advertisement \nPork cooked to rare or medium left a few surviving cells that could then multiply while the food is stored. \nUndercooked pork also puts you at risk of other infections. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cTaenia solium cysticercosis, which is a pork tapeworm, can also occur. Taenia infection may occur through ingestion of undercooked pork, but can also occur through contamination through other humans. Say if someone has the infection and does not wash their hands after using the restroom and then goes to prepare food, they can contaminate the food they prepare,\u201d Dr. Dana Hawkinson, infectious disease specialist at The University of Kansas Health System, told Healthline. \nOn the whole, however, commercially produced pork products should be quite safe to consume. \n\u201cPork that comes from commercial farms is a very safe food. Years ago, there was more \u2018backyard\u2019 pork in local markets that came from pigs fed food scraps and garbage by individuals. That meat occasionally was the source of trichinosis, a parasitic infection, but I do not recall such a case in over 20 years now,\u201d Schaffner said. Antibiotic resistance a problem \nWhile many salmonella infections resolve without medical treatment, serious cases can be deadly without antibiotics. \nA 2016 study found that 20 percent of blood isolates in salmonella bacteria are resistant to a first-line antibiotic treatment. \nAntibiotic resistance represents a significant global health problem, and the use of antibiotics in agriculture is a hotly contested issue in the United States. \n\u201cAntibiotics are used in food animals for many reasons, such as treating ill animals, or preventing and controlling disease outbreaks. Antibiotics have also been used for growth promotion. We can\u2019t combat the spread of antibiotic resistance without improving the prudent use of antibiotics in both humans and food animals,\u201d Tauxe said. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved antibiotic use in food animals for disease treatment of sick animals, disease control for groups of animals, and disease prevention among animals. \nBut use of antibiotics for other reasons in farming continues to generate debate. \n\u201cThe issue of the overuse of antibiotics as growth promoters in raising farm animals for food continues to be a contentious matter in the U.S. The Europeans have been more restrictive than we in the U.S. We in infectious disease practice would very much like to see less use of antibiotics in food production because it contributes to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making it more difficult to treat infections when they occur,\u201d Schaffner said. \n\u201cIt is a tough problem politically because the commercial food producers object to further restrictions. You have to get involved at the local level, letting Congress members and senators know how you feel,\u201d he added.

Close \nHealth insurance is a hot topic these days, with all the political volleying over trying (unsuccessfully) to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the ever-soaring costs of diabetes supplies and medications, and with open enrollment periods just around the corner... \nAs many 22 million Americans (or 7% of the population) have been without insurance at some point, and for those using insulin within the Diabetes Community that number is roughly 3% (or 180,000 people)! Additionally, those enrolled in \"Obamacare\" often point out that very high deductibles make it practically seem like they don't have insurance coverage. \nThese stories must be shared, and we're glad to be able to feature some here at the 'Mine, from those willing to speak out. Today, we welcome longtime T1 Chris Stocker in Florida, who blogs at The Life of a Diabetic , sharing a snapshot of his own struggles. \nT1D Without Health Insurance, by Chris Stocker In mid-2016, I lost my health insurance. I did not obtain health insurance again until January 2017. In total, it was about 5 \u00bd months that I went without health insurance. Being a type 1 for more than a decade, this presented quite the challenge. During this time period my biggest concern was insulin -- where I was going to get it from and how I was going to afford it. Fortunately, I had about a month left of my last 90-day supply before I lost my insurance, so it gave me some breathing room. I also had test strips from that 90-day supply that I could probably stretch out for two months by lowering the amount of times I checked my BG from 5-6 per day down to 2-3 per day. When I initially lost health insurance, my endo office provided me with samples of (long-acting) Tresiba and a few bottles of (fast-acting) Novolog. I knew that paying for pump supplies was not going to be an option during this time period, so I knew I was going to need basal insulin. Unfortunately, the costs of basal insulins were just too expensive to try and purchase out of pocket, even with savings cards. That meant I had no other choice but to switch to older insulins that I haven't used in decades -- specifically Novolin R, because Wal-Mart sold it for $27 a bottle. I use 5-6 bottles of insulin a month. So I would just pay for 4-5 at a time if I could. However, a majority of the time the Wal-Mart I went to only had 1-2 vials in stock, so I just purchased what I could. This still didn\u2019t solve my basal insulin issue, so I had to come up with another solution. This solution is definitely not on-label, but when it comes to dire situations, you do what you have to do in order to survive. The solution was this: I would take a few units extra fast-acting insulin at every meal to act as a correction to not having basal insulin for the previous few hours. At night, whenever I would wake up, I would check my blood sugar. If it was higher than the last time, then I would take a correction of Novolin R. Around 3-4 in the morning, I would give myself a little bolus to act as the make-up for not having basal insulin in my system. \nAs a result of doing this for about five months, I had the two worst A1Cs since I was diagnosed almost 14 years ago. \nThe emotional toll no insurance had on me was excruciating. I wasn\u2019t sleeping. I was stressed at all times because if something happened, I didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford it. My daughter was only a 1-1/2 at the time, so the stress of caring for a toddler was adding to that. But I made it through. I did what I had to do to survive during that time period of \"fllying blind.\" I now have insurance in 2017, and am thankful. It's not a very good insurance plan, but at least it has prescription medication coverage that helps with the costs. When I see all of the attempts of politicians trying to take my insurance away from me again because of my pre-existing condition, it brings back those days of not having the insurance, needing to use Novolin R and having the highest A1C\u2019s I\u2019ve had since diagnosis. And I never want to go there again. None of us should have to. So sorry to hear you had to go through that, Chris, but thank you so much for your willingness to share.

Close \nAfter nearly two decades, the Johnson & Johnson-owned Animas brand of insulin pumps is shutting down. \nIn the early morning hours on Thursday (Oct. 5), J&J issued a press release that finalized nine months of speculation on the future of its diabetes insulin pump division. Effective immediately, no more Animas pumps will be sold in the USA or Canada, and it's TBD what will happen to the brand internationally. \nPharma giant J&J has been \" strategically evaluating \" its three diabetes divisions since January, deciding whether to prop them up financially, sell them off, or shut them down. While many have speculated that an end was near for Animas and possibly even J&J's OneTouch and Lifescan meter brands, nothing has been official until now. The meter brands remain under evaluation, but its pump business is done and J&J has signed an agreement with competitor and market leader Medtronic to take over servicing existing Animas customers. \nOn the heels of Roche also shutting its insulin pump business in January, what this Animas announcement means is that for the first time since 2002, we PWDs (people with diabetes) in the U.S. will have just three choices of pumps: Medtronic Minimed, Insulet's Omnipod and the Tandem t:slim. Total bummer, given that Animas has been a staple in the industry for 17 years and was well-liked for its waterproof design and Animas Vibe system paired with the Dexcom CGM. \nAnimas Shutdown: Nuts and Bolts \nHere are answers to some of the biggest questions: How Many? This affects 90,000 existing Animas pump customers, according to the J&J news release (although other sources quote 120,000). We asked how many employees are impacted, but the company declined to release specifics except to generally say, \"We will continue to operate certain functions of the business \u2013 including manufacturing, customer and safety support, as examples \u2013 for an indeterminate amount of time as we help our patients transition. Accordingly, we will provide support to impacted employees and their families through the transition.\" Global Impact? In its news release, J&J says, \"A decision and timing to exit countries outside of the U.S. and Canada is subject to completing consultation with relevant works councils. For the patients, caregivers and healthcare providers outside of the U.S. and Canada who currently use Animas pumps and products, Animas will continue to sell pumps and operate as usual . \" Hmm, we shall see... Why? In the news release, Animas General Manager Valerie Asbury offered this prepared statement: \u201cWith changing needs of customers, rapidly evolving market dynamics, and increased competitive pressures, it proved too difficult to sustain the insulin pump business and we decided to pursue an exit of the business. This decision was extremely difficult and comes following the extensive exploration of all other viable options for the Animas business.\u201d Existing Customers? J&J says it will continue to \"service all patients and honor patient warranties\" for existing pump customers, and they will be referred to Medtronic Diabetes to get supplies. After Sept. 30, 2019, Medtronic will no longer provide Animas supplies to those who continue using that brand of insulin pump. Of course, customers may also find some third-party distributors selling legacy supplies. Get more information on MedT's \"Welcome, Animas customers\" site , or by calling 800-661-1730 in the U.S. and Canada. Of course, remember Animas-pumping folks: Take a breath and relax -- there's time to decide your next move. Switching to Medtronic: Starting in May 2018, in-warranty Animas customers will be able to get a Minimed 630G (the automatic insulin-suspending, pump-CGM device with a vertical orientation) at no cost. Dexcom CGM'ers: Animas Vibe pumpers who currently use Dexcom products should continue to use the CGM and will receive the same service they have been, according to a company spokeswoman. Not an Acquisition: To be clear, Medtronic does NOT own Animas now. Rather, Animas is being shut down and Animas customers are being referred to MedT, in much the same way that Roche Accu-Chek pump customers were handed off to Medtronic after that company stopped selling pumps in the U.S. at the beginning of the year. No More OneTouch Vibe Plus: Given that, any intellectual property remains with J&J, meaning plans are presumably scrapped for the OneTouch Vibe Plus system that would communicate with the Dexcom G5 and was FDA-approved in early 2016. It's also unclear what impact this could have on the OneTouch Via bolus-only patch pump, purchased from Calibra Medical years ago and just approved by the FDA in June 2017. Also, there appears to be nothing announced at the moment as to future next-gen closed loop devices that Animas had been working on. It's TBD on whether any of that gets sold off, or shelved forever. Not Impacting OneTouch or Lifescan: As of now, J&J says its popular meter and strip brands OneTouch and Lifescan are still being evaluated and no decision has yet been made as to their future. \nNow What? \nClearly, Medtronic is the big winner here -- though some may wonder whether the pump-CGM giant is moving toward monopoly status, and whether it can even handle the influx of new customers, given the reported manufacturing and shipping delays it's been experiencing on the CGM sensor front. \nWhile customers are not forced to switch to Medtronic, the only remaining alternatives are Tandem Diabetes Care, which is experiencing its own business struggles, and Insulet's tubeless OmniPod. \nBoth are naturally making a play to recruit Animas users into their customer ranks: \nInsulet's OmniPod Offer \nWithin hours of the announcement, Omnipod makers Insulet Corp. shot out a marketing email inviting current Animas users to switch, that read: \"With the unfortunate announcement related to Animas, Insulet has developed a program dedicated to those impacted by this decision. At Insulet, we believe people with diabetes should have the freedom to select the insulin delivery system which best meets their needs. We are currently working on a landing page/social media posts and will share later today.\" \nThe details of their \"Welcome to Insulet\" program for former Animas and Roche pumpers includes: No upfront cost Free Personalized Diabetes Manger (PDM) 10 free pods Eligiblity depends on insurance and specific states (MI, MA, MN and RI) are excluded Available through Dec. 31, 2017 More information is available at 1-888-6-GETPOD \nTandem's t:slim Program \nTandem's update came out shortly after, stating: \"Tandem is now the only company currently offering an insulin pump that integrates with the Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM, approved for making treatment decisions without fingersticks (only two fingerstick CGM calibrations required per day)... We welcome the opportunity to help any current Animas customers continue enjoying the benefits of an insulin pump with Dexcom sensor integration when they are ready for a new pump. We know change can be stressful, particularly when it is unexpected, and we are here to help in whatever way we are able.\" A new Tandem pump for use within the final 12 months of current warranty on Animas or Roche pump; not for out-of-warranty pumps One-time payment of $999 Payment plans are not available, but this amount can be credited to the purchase of a new Tandem pump and/or supplies at the end of their current pump warranty period or may be refunded Offer available for \"a limited time\"; end date not specified More details can be found online here \n\nOutside of North America, other pump options do exist, including Dana RS pumps out of Korea and the Cellnovo patch pump in Europe. Those should certainly be on the mind of PWDs living in other countries -- in light of the \"writing on the wall\" that Animas may not be around internationally for much longer, either. \nShrinking Choice in Insulin Pump Market \nAnimas formed in Pennsylvania in 1996 and fours year later entered the U.S. insulin pump market with first-generation product, the IR 2000. Their IR 1250 version followed a few years later, and then in February 2006, J&J acquired Animas into its family of companies. The Animas-OneTouch Ping paired with a fingerstick meter launched in 2008 and then the Animas Vibe CGM combo followed in 2014. As noted, the next-gen OneTouch Vibe Plus snagged regulatory approval in Dec. 2016, but it never launched. \nAnd now, this. \nEven the J&J press release may be tough to stomach for many, with language plugging Medtronic as a \"world leader\" in diabetes devices -- somewhat ironic given that Animas and Medtronic were rivals for so long. We've also seen some conjecture on whether this Animas closure is \"Medtronic's fault\" due to aggressive marketing or if moves like the exclusive agreement Medtronic signed with United Healthcare in 2016 played a part in this. While those may have been factors, they can't be fully blamed. Experts point out that J&J and Animas leadership and new innovation track record -- or lack thereof, more accurately -- set the stage for this over the course of many years. \nIt's amazing to think that just a few short years ago, we had SIX different insulin pumps on the market here in the States, and now that number's been sliced in half. We haven't seen this few pump choices since before 2003, when the only pumps were made by Minimed (bought by Medtronic in 2001), Disetronic (bought by Roche in 2003) and Animas (bought by J&J in 2006). Medtronic now becomes the sole remaining legacy pump company. \nWe also lost new player Asante Solutions in 2015, when it discontinued the Snap pump, and the Deltec Cozmo pump that disappeared in 2009 when Smith\u2019s Medical suspended and eventually discontinued it. And in early 2017, Roche Diabetes Care also discontinued its Accu-Chek pumps in the U.S., and then seven months later announced it would hand remaining customers over to Medtronic. (Accu-Chek pumps remain on the market internationally). \nWhat a shame, how the market changes. Of course, for those using Animas now, it's important to remember: There are still those using Snap and Cozmo pumps years after they closed, so take a breath and think carefully about the next move. There is time, even if this sudden news may seem overwhelming right now. \nIn response to this news, JDRF CEO Derek Rapp expressed the organization's disappointment and urged the industry to embrace the mantra of #DiabetesAccessMatters , allowing PWDs to have choice that goes beyond aesthetics. \" \n\"JDRF is extremely concerned that Animas Corporation will be closing operations and ending the sale of its insulin pumps, as it means fewer treatment options for people with type 1 diabetes,\" he said. \"Pump choice is critical, and people with type 1 diabetes need the ability to choose the devices that work best for them. Innovation and competition are essential to the development of next-generation therapies.\" Pump choice is critical, and people with type 1 diabetes need the ability to choose the devices that work best for them. JDRF CEO Derek Rapp \nIn fact, JDRF has developed a whole campaign to lobby insurance companies against making exclusive agreements that lock patients into using devices that may not be the best therapy choices for them individually. See also this brilliant article by CDE and author Gary Scheiner on how not all insulin pumps are created the same, and how different features can have a profound impact on a person's ability to manage blood sugars successfully. \nOn the CGM side, the Animas shutdown is also clearly not good news for Dexcom, as Animas was a key partner -- integrating their G4 CGM for the first-generation Vibe pump, and the G5 with the Vibe Plus approved more than a year ago. Unfortunately, Dexcom now loses a lot of potential customers, given that switching to a Medtronic likely means users will opt for that company's CGM as well. \nWhat an incredibly sad time in the state of diabetes device choice. \nThis stands as yet another reminder of the reality that we as patients often find tough to swallow: That diabetes is a business, and that if a for-profit company can't make the bottom line work, it's not worth it for them to keep making their products, no matter how important they might be to some people's health. \nRIP, Animas.

Her health problems still continued to plague her. \nThe recent death of the world\u2019s heaviest woman highlights the health problems faced by obese people even when they\u2019re losing significant weight. \nEman Ahmed Abd El Aty, 37, died on September 25 at a hospital in the United Arab Emirates from heart and kidney failure, among several complications related to her weight. \nAbd El Aty had a thyroid problem and a genetic disorder that led her weight to skyrocket to 1,100 pounds. \nIn addition to having a stroke, her health issues included type 2 diabetes, hypertension, severe obstructive and restrictive lung disease, gout, sleep apnea, severe depression, and pressure sores. \nAbd El Aty was being treated by doctors from three countries. She lost 550 pounds after a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was performed earlier this year. \nBy late April 2017, her weight was down to 389 pounds. \nBut it wasn\u2019t enough to save her life. \n\u201cOne of the problems for people who are that heavy is that they can get down to a lower weight but still be morbidly obese,\u201d Dr. Peter LePort, medical director of the MemorialCare Center for Obesity at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in California, explained to Healthline. \u201cSo, your comorbid health conditions can get better, but they don\u2019t usually go away completely unless you get down to about 50 pounds over your normal body weight.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s not a miracle\u2019 \nAccomplishing significant weight loss usually requires adherence to a post-surgery diet and exercise plan, said LePort, who performs LAP-BAND, gastric bypass, and sleeve gastrectomy surgery for weight loss. \n\u201cI always tell my patients, \u2018This is not a miracle.\u2019 We\u2019re doing the surgery, but unless you follow the plan we give you, it will work for a while, but eventually it will fail.\u201d \nStill, even losing 5 to 10 percent of your body weight can ease metabolic-related problems, said Dr. Wendy Scinta, president of the Obesity Medicine Association. \nShe told Healthline the benefits can occur even if \u201cmass related\u201d health issues such as heart disease, sleep apnea, and joint problems persist.

Written by Gigen Mammoser on October 5, 2017 A recent study concludes that marijuana use might actually disrupt your sleep. However, experts point out there may be other factors involved. \nMarijuana may make you sleepy, but does it really help you sleep? \nWith the increasing frequency of marijuana legalization and its medical use throughout the United States, many are turning to the drug to treat insomnia and sleep disorders. Advertisement Advertisement \nHowever, a study from the University of Michigan concluded that depending on how frequently an individual uses marijuana, it may not help them sleep at all. \nIt may actually worsen their sleep quality. \nThe study recruited 98 subjects who were divided into three groups: daily marijuana users, non-daily marijuana users, and a non-user control group. Advertisement \nIndividuals were disqualified from the study for a variety of reasons that could affect sleep. \nIllicit drug users and binge drinkers couldn\u2019t participate, nor could individuals working night shift jobs, or those using sleeping medications. Advertisement Advertisement \nResearchers found that that the daily-use group had higher levels of insomnia (almost 40 percent) compared to non-daily users (10 percent) and the control group (20 percent). \n\u201cThese results are consistent with previous studies showing an association between sleep disturbance and heavy marijuana use in adults,\u201d the researchers wrote. \nThe significance of their report is that it suggests that while marijuana may help some individuals in the short term or through intermittent use, continual use makes insomnia worse. \n\u201cThe effects of marijuana on sleep in intermittent users may be similar, in part, to those of alcohol where improvements in sleep... have been reported with intermittent use, whereas daily use results in the worsening of sleep,\u201d they wrote. What happens if you quit? \nAnother facet that Deirdre Conroy, PhD, a clinical associate professor in the University of Michigan Department of Psychiatry and lead author on the study, touches on in a separate publication is what happens when daily users stop using marijuana. Advertisement Advertisement \nTheir sleep worsens during a withdrawal period if they attempt to quit using the drug or use it less frequently. \nThe study was limited in that quantity of use wasn\u2019t measured. \nAll daily users were considered to be \u201cheavy\u201d marijuana users, but researchers admit they were, \u201cunable to know if the sleep reports of daily users were a result of frequency of use or quantity of use.\u201d Advertisement \nThey say that future studies should recruit individuals who only smoke minimally to observe how quantity could potentially affect sleep quality. Other possible factors \nMedical marijuana is also used to treat a variety of ailments from anxiety to PTSD. Advertisement Advertisement \nThose ailments almost certainly play a role in sleep disorders. \nResearchers discovered that when they controlled the study for anxiety and depression, the difference in reported insomnia levels disappeared. \n\u201cThis raises questions about how marijuana is affecting people with and without anxiety and depression,\u201d Conroy, who is board certified in sleep disorder medicine, told Healthline. Advertisement \n\u201cWe don't know if our participants started using [marijuana] to treat anxiety and developed insomnia or if they used [marijuana] to treat insomnia and developed anxiety,\u201d she explained. \u201cAdditional studies looking more specifically at these relationships will help us better understand this relationship.\u201d Inconsistent research \nThe study further complicates the medical literature on the relationship between marijuana and sleep \u2014 which is already inconsistent. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cTo date, controlled clinical data with regard to the impact of cannabinoids on sleep is limited and somewhat mixed,\u201d Paul Armentano, the deputy director of the National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), told Healthline. \nHe points out a 2017 review on the subject matter as evidence of that. \n\u201cCannabis is frequently used by patients as a sleep aid and they typically report subjective benefits from cannabis with regard to getting to sleep and staying asleep,\u201d Armentano said. \nOne of the problems in making a conclusive assessment is that marijuana contains numerous different chemicals that affect the body\u2019s endocannabinoid system. \nThe two most prominent, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), both exist in varying amounts, depending on the strain of marijuana. \nTherefore, there\u2019s the potential for different strains to affect sleep differently. \nThe review that Armentano brought up suggests that CBD may be helpful for insomnia, but THC may impair sleep quality in the long run. \nMarijuana is also known to decrease REM sleep \u2014 the stage closely related with dreaming. \nA separate study concluded that the \u201csleepy\u201d effects of THC seem to lessen as a user\u2019s tolerance grows. \nAnother study, a newer one from 2017 , found that marijuana users who decreased usage over time had improvements in anxiety, depression, and sleep quality. \nIn short, considering the many variables involved \u2014 including mental health issues, marijuana strain and potency, and quantity of use \u2014 a definitive answer on the relationship between marijuana and sleep remains somewhat elusive. \nHowever, Conroy\u2019s research may be helpful in sorting out some of the details of who are better candidates for using medical marijuana for sleep disorders. \n\u201cIf you have depression, cannabis may help you sleep. But if you don\u2019t, cannabis may hurt,\u201d she writes. \nThe research also points to future work investigating a potential optimal dosing strategy. \nThat is, if smoking heavily every day is too much, how would less frequent, smaller doses affect sleep quality?

Written by Dan Gray on October 5, 2017 World leaders call for the development of new antibiotics, but it\u2019s a time-consuming, costly process that has to balance antimicrobial resistance. \nThere just aren\u2019t enough new antibiotics currently under development to fight the threat of antimicrobial resistance. \nThat\u2019s the warning being issued by world leaders. Advertisement Advertisement \nIn a news release last month, officials at the United Nations (UN) and World Health Organization (WHO) said that most of the drugs currently under development are just modifications of existing drugs and won\u2019t work on a long-term basis. \n\u201cAntimicrobial resistance is a global health emergency that will seriously jeopardize progress in modern medicine,\u201d said WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in the release. \nAn expert interviewed by Healthline explained some of the difficulties in developing new classes of antibiotics while expressing optimism for the future of drug development. Advertisement Antimicrobial resistance 101 \nOver time, microorganisms in the human body gradually evolve to become resistant to the drugs that are used against them. \nWhen a microorganism becomes resistant to a drug, that trait tends to spread across other similar microorganisms. Advertisement \nThat\u2019s when resistance can really get out of hand. \nHow bad could the problem get? \n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a serious problem,\u201d Dr. Kou-San Ju, assistant professor with a joint appointment in the Department of Microbiology and the Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, told Healthline. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been estimated that if this trend continues, it\u2019s possible that we could go back to an era where simple medical procedures can cause life-threatening infections,\u201d he added. \u201cSo the threat is there, but it\u2019s a complicated situation of not only how we use the medicines themselves, but also our ability to find new ones and replenish our medicine cabinet.\u201d Like a needle in a haystack \nTo discover new drugs, scientists traditionally cultivate microorganisms from soil or water because they are isolated from common places. Advertisement Advertisement \nThese lab-grown microbes are studied to find which ones can produce a substance that inhibits an undesired pathogen. \nAfter purifying that substance, the scientists are left with an antibiotic molecule that can eventually be developed into a consumer-friendly drug. \n\u201cThe challenge with this discovery process is that it\u2019s been played over so many times that we tend to find the same molecules over and over again,\u201d said Ju. \u201cIn the industry, research is done with strains on the order of millions at a time. So the number of strains that you have to screen to find a truly novel molecule that hasn\u2019t been found before, using this method, is pretty mind-boggling.\u201d Advertisement \nWhile this process can be time-consuming and yields diminishing returns, scientists are now using alternative research methods, such as genomics. \nBecause every organism has a virtual genomic blueprint of its pathways, researchers are finding ways to sift through a microorganism\u2019s properties by studying its various characteristics. Advertisement Advertisement \nScientists are also finding new ways to grow naturally occurring genomes in a laboratory setting. \n\u201cA challenge of microbiology is that about 98 or 99 percent of all microbes are, quote-unquote, \u2018uncultivatable.\u2019\u201d said Ju. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we can\u2019t grow them. It\u2019s that we haven\u2019t figured out the conditions in which they can be propagated in a laboratory setting. So there\u2019s an effort to figure out how these environmental microbes can be coaxed into the laboratory \u2014 and there\u2019s been some success in this area.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to find that a lot of these strains that we\u2019re able to bring or domesticate into the lab are wildly different than anything we\u2019ve studied before, and by that nature they have quite a variety of new and unexplored genes and pathways, so that\u2019s been another successful source of new molecules,\u201d he added. \u201cThinking about antibiotic discovery, natural products are a new source of next-generation pharmaceuticals.\u201d Advertisement Bridging the gap \nThe UN and WHO may have put out a call for new and better antibiotics, but getting these drugs to market is a complicated issue. \nFor starters, it takes years for drugs to be properly tested and eventually gain approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Advertisement Advertisement \nThere\u2019s also the matter of drug manufacturers. \n\u201cFrom the industry side, it\u2019s kind of a catch-22, because we have these tremendously important medical problems. But from a commercial point of view, it\u2019s something where you can take a medicine, and then hopefully the problem goes away,\u201d said Ju. \n\u201cSo it\u2019s unlike a systemic illness or other type of physiology where you need continual treatment. From a commercial point of view, you have to ask, is this a long-term, economically viable endeavor? I think this is why a lot of large pharmaceutical companies divested away from the early discovery aspects of their pipeline.\u201d \nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that drug companies aren\u2019t interested in making antibiotics, says Ju, but does mean that they\u2019ve stepped away from the early trial-and-error research process. \n\u201cIt takes such a tremendous effort to find these effective lead compounds,\u201d said Ju. \u201cThey want the leads. They just don\u2019t want \u2014 in my opinion \u2014 the riskier parts of investing in early discovery.\u201d \nWith various international agencies sounding the alarm over antibiotic resistance, combined with new technology in microbe research, there is reason for optimism. \n\u201cAdvances in technology, DNA sequencing and analytical chemistry methods are really allowing us to access these untapped resources faster,\u201d said Ju. \u201cI think as a society, we\u2019ve recognized the importance of this challenge, and it\u2019s going to take a lot of hard work, but I personally feel that the future in this area is actually quite bright. \n\u201cWe hear that the golden age of antibiotic discovery, when we found many important drugs that we still use today, was in the \u201940s and \u201950s,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I like to think that with what we\u2019re doing nowadays, with new technologies, genomics, and analytical methods \u2014 and the renewed commitment from everyone \u2014 that we\u2019re going to find many, many new molecules, and the best discoveries are going to come in the very near future.

It can also cause stress and embarrassment for parents. \nRaising a baby can be a stressful experience for parents. \nLate nights, poor sleep, and illnesses are all part of caring for an infant. Advertisement \nBut what happens when a parent can\u2019t afford to buy diapers? \nThat\u2019s the situation for 1 in 3 families in the United States. \n\u201cDiaper need is when a parent or caregiver struggles to provide enough diapers to keep a baby or toddler clean, dry, and healthy. A hidden consequence of living in poverty,\u201d Joanne Goldblum, CEO and founder of the National Diaper Bank Network (NDBN), told Healthline. Advertisement \nDiaper need is one of many consequences of living in poverty that\u2019s not commonly discussed. \n\u201cFamilies and caregivers experiencing diaper need lack the money needed to provide clean diapers for their child, and often must choose between basic needs such as food, housing, utilities, or diapers,\u201d Goldblum said. Advertisement Advertisement \nA survey examining diaper need and its impact on American families was recently undertaken by the NDBN in association with Huggies. \nThe survey found that the 36 percent of families who report struggling with diaper need are falling short of 19 diapers each month. \nInfants require up to 12 diapers per day. Toddlers require up to eight. \nDisposable diapers cost $70 to $80 per month per baby. They can\u2019t be purchased using food stamps. The health effects \nNot having enough clean diapers exposes a baby to many potential health risks. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cThe primary health consequence of a dirty diaper, especially if a baby sits in it too long, is diaper rash. While this may not seem problematic, bad rashes can be very uncomfortable and skin breakdown can lead to bacterial infections of the skin,\u201d Dr. Jaime Friedman, a pediatrician at the Children\u2019s Primary Care Medical Group in California, told Healthline. \n\u201cIf a diaper is not changed, it can become too full and leak,\u201d Friedman added. \u201cLeaked stool can contaminate surrounding areas and the bacteria in the stool can cause gastrointestinal infections in those who come into contact with the bacteria.\u201d \nHow quickly a rash develops varies for each baby due to differences in skin type. Advertisement \nFriedman says a good rule of thumb is to change the diaper as soon as you know it\u2019s dirty. \nShe says a diaper shouldn\u2019t be left so that a baby urinates or has bowel movements multiple times in the same diaper. Advertisement Advertisement \nCaregivers should look out for signs that suggest they may not be changing diapers frequently enough. \nA foul odor from the diaper, skin irritation, severe diaper rash, leakage from the diaper, and a fussy child with poor mobility due to a full diaper are all signs the diaper should be changed more frequently. \nBabies who remain in a dirty diaper for too long are also more susceptible to urinary tract infections (UTIs) as well as more frequent cases of diaper rash. Advertisement \nThe NDBN survey found that 54 percent of respondents who reported experiencing diaper need took their children to the doctor to treat diaper rash. \nOf those respondents, 1 in 4 took their child for treatment of diaper rash three or more times in the past year. Advertisement A hidden problem \nMany families experiencing diaper need feel shame due to not having enough diapers. \nIn fact, 74 percent of those surveyed said they were embarrassed about not being able to afford diapers, and 80 percent agreed that people who are in need of diapers are hesitant to talk about it. \n\u201cI think parents who feel they cannot provide for their child would feel very stressed,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine the shame and guilt a parent might feel having to ask for help with diapers. As pediatricians, we are tasked with assessing the mental health of the family and asking about food security. Perhaps diaper security should be added.\u201d \n\u201cI would hate to see families rinsing diapers and reusing them. That can lead to poor sanitation and contamination of drinking water,\u201d Friedman added. \n\u201cPlus, it would be very uncomfortable for the baby to be in a wet or full diaper, especially if they are trying to get up and start walking. A full diaper would get in the way. And then the subsequent rashes that can occur can create discomfort for the baby and stress for the parent,\u201d she said. The economic impact \nAs well as the negative health impacts on the baby, diaper need can also impact the physical, mental, and economic well-being of entire families. \nThe survey found that almost 3 in 5 parents \u2014 57 percent \u2014 missed work or school in the past month because they didn\u2019t have enough diapers when dropping off their children at day care, child care, or early education programs. \nMost child care centers \u2014 even those that are free or subsidized \u2014 require caregivers and parents to provide a full day\u2019s worth of diapers for their child. \n\u201cA lack of diapers to keep a baby clean can lead to economic hardship and high levels of stress in families striving to provide enough diapers and other necessities, including food, clothing, and housing,\u201d Goldblum said. \nDiaper need has also been linked to maternal depression. The stress of the situation is also thought to negatively impact the children in the home. \n\u201cThe stress on the parent, who may be already stressed due to poverty, trickles down to infants and children,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cToxic stress results from repeated adverse events or environment, and this includes mental health of the parent. Children exposed to toxic stress experience more ADHD and behavior problems.\u201d Raising awareness \nEven though the NDBN and its diaper bank programs in communities across the country distributed more than 52 million diapers in 2016, 65 percent of the families surveyed said they weren\u2019t aware of diaper banks. \nGoldblum hopes that raising awareness of diaper need in the United States will encourage people who are experiencing diaper need to ask for help. \n\u201cWhen individuals and communities learn about diaper need, they want to help get clean diapers to all babies. When families in diaper need learn that resources exist in many communities that can help provide diapers for their children, they seek out assistance. While there are more than 300 NDBN-member diaper bank programs serving families throughout the U.S., far too many communities lack sustainable diaper distribution programs to meet the need fully,\u201d she said.

Written by Whitney Akers on October 5, 2017 New studies show that heat can cause similar skin damage as UV rays, but that hot and sweaty environments might not be significant enough to worry about. \nRecent reports that sweaty workouts can cause skin damage and age spots had some workout fanatics wondering if they should cancel their hot yoga and spin classes. \nThe articles in Allure and Well+Good connected trendy workouts in heated environments to increased skin redness and signs of aging such as wrinkles and age spots. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cSpin instructors and women who were taking hot yoga upwards of five times a week were getting more discoloration and persistent redness than other patients,\u201d Dr. Doris Day, a clinical associate professor of dermatology at New York University (NYU) Langone Medical Center, told Allure. \nWhile Day and other dermatologists with a fitness fanatic population of clients may notice this effect in their clinical practices, it hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet by any research that working out in a hot environment can cause changes to the skin. \nSome dermatologists want to see more research before they start to warn their clients about sweltering workouts. Advertisement More research needed \nPreviously, researchers and consumers were focused on the visible aging effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. \nWhile it\u2019s beneficial to protect yourself from the sun\u2019s UV rays with daily sunscreen, \u201cit\u2019s not just UV light that causes these symptoms\u201d like wrinkles and age spots, Dr . Nada Elbuluk, assistant professor of dermatology at NYU Langone Medical Center and an expert in hyperpigmentation, told Healthline. Advertisement Advertisement \nScientists have done a lot of research around the effects of UV light, but Elbuluk says dermatologists need more data on how heat affects people\u2019s skin. \nThe impacts of visible light and artificial light also warrant more study. \n\u201cWe found that heat can cause, over time, similar changes that UV does,\u201d she confirmed. \nBut heat studies generally look at the effects of direct contact of heated things on the skin. \nSo the research might not be applicable to the potential impacts of hot yoga on skin. Advertisement How heat can age skin \nChanges to the skin resulting from heat are essentially a type of injury. \nHeat can increase inflammation in the skin, which can lead to breakdown of collagen. \nCollagen keeps your skin firm and elastic. Advertisement \nThat means heat can cause more fine lines and wrinkles \u2014 \u201cthings we classically associated with aging and non-exposure,\u201d Elbuluk pointed out. \nA few studies \u2014 not a lot, Elbuluk noted \u2014 specifically look at how heat relates to melanin. Advertisement Advertisement \nAnything that leads to inflammation to a melanocyte, or pigment-producing cell, can cause injury and more pigmentation. \nDark brown spots, or age spots, can start to appear, or a spot you already had can get darker. \nPeople with darker colored skin, which has more melanin production, are more prone to this damage. Advertisement \nThe studies also show heat can prompt an increase in angiogenesis, or the formation of new blood vessels, and blood vessel growth. That makes veins more visible. \nFor people around hot machines, for example, prolonged exposure to heat can injure the skin, which results in a breakdown of collagen and elastin. Advertisement Advertisement \nThis can also be due to a condition called erythema ab igne, which dermatologists have known about for decades. \nErythema ab igne is a skin condition caused by sustained and repeated heat exposure to skin, Elbuluk explained. Initially, the skin turns red, then it turns brown. \nHeating pads were the main culprit in the past, but now there are an increasing number of cases of this condition occurring on people\u2019s thighs because of laptops. \nThe reason the heating pad or hot laptop turns the skin brown goes back to inflammation. \nIf your skin stays red for a long enough time, it shows that there\u2019s increased inflammation \u2014 so it affects the melanocyte, which produces more brown color. \n\u201cWhen there\u2019s prolonged heat, we see damage,\u201d Elbuluk said. \nShe stressed that the exposure has to be lengthy, so she\u2019s doubtful that hot yoga five times a week will really damage your skin. Professions that need to worry \nThere are professionals who need to worry about heat and aging. \nHowever, fitness instructors or hot yoga or cycling aficionados, as far as we know, aren\u2019t among them, according to current research. \nExercise in heat isn\u2019t prolonged enough to cause damage, based on the science that\u2019s currently available. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t know of any effects on human skin with excessive heat exposure and exercise,\u201d Dr. Kord Honda, a dermatologist at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, told Healthline. \nA study done in South Korea stated that \u201cit has been reported that chronic IR (heat) exposure can cause pronounced elastosis in mouse skin, changes that mimic the damage caused by UV.\u201d \nHowever, Honda pointed out the paper was a study of mice exposed to significantly high temperatures. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the effects of extreme heat in humans,\u201d he affirmed. \nHeat is also often studied at the same time as UV, visible light, or artificial light. \n\u201cCurrently, we don\u2019t have enough data to say the other types of light aren\u2019t contributing,\u201d Elbuluk concluded. \nElbuluk told Healthline that she\u2019s not seeing any damage or rapid ageing in her patients who frequent hot yoga or spin classes. \nBut she said that professions that are exposed to high temperatures for a prolonged time, such as bakers, chefs, and glassblowers, might see changes. \nIf you\u2019re in a profession where you\u2019ll constantly be exposed to high heat, make sure your skin is covered and protected. \nCool down your skin as quickly as possible after a dose of extreme heat to prevent inflammation. \nIn terms of spin class or hot yoga, the main things to be worried about are dehydration and folliculitis. \nIncreased sweating combined with tight clothing can cause hair follicles to become inflamed and lead to acne. \nSo go forth to your spin class, drink a lot of water, and wear breathable fabric. \nYou won\u2019t look any older because of it.

Her health problems still continued to plague her. Image Source: Dr. Muffazal Lakdawala \nThe recent death of the world\u2019s heaviest woman highlights the health problems faced by obese people even when they\u2019re losing significant weight. \nEman Ahmed Abd El Aty, 37, died on September 25 at a hospital in the United Arab Emirates from heart and kidney failure, among several complications related to her weight. Advertisement Advertisement \nAbd El Aty had a thyroid problem and a genetic disorder that led her weight to skyrocket to 1,100 pounds. \nIn addition to having a stroke, her health issues included type 2 diabetes, hypertension, severe obstructive and restrictive lung disease, gout, sleep apnea, severe depression, and pressure sores. \nAbd El Aty was being treated by doctors from three countries. She lost 550 pounds after a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was performed earlier this year. Advertisement \nBy late April 2017, her weight was down to 389 pounds. \nBut it wasn\u2019t enough to save her life. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cOne of the problems for people who are that heavy is that they can get down to a lower weight but still be morbidly obese,\u201d Dr. Peter LePort, medical director of the MemorialCare Center for Obesity at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in California, explained to Healthline. \u201cSo, your comorbid health conditions can get better, but they don\u2019t usually go away completely unless you get down to about 50 pounds over your normal body weight.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s not a miracle\u2019 \nAccomplishing significant weight loss usually requires adherence to a post-surgery diet and exercise plan, said LePort, who performs LAP-BAND, gastric bypass, and sleeve gastrectomy surgery for weight loss. \n\u201cI always tell my patients, \u2018This is not a miracle.\u2019 We\u2019re doing the surgery, but unless you follow the plan we give you, it will work for a while, but eventually it will fail.\u201d \nStill, even losing 5 to 10 percent of your body weight can ease metabolic-related problems, said Dr. Wendy Scinta, president of the Obesity Medicine Association. \nShe told Healthline the benefits can occur even if \u201cmass related\u201d health issues such as heart disease, sleep apnea, and joint problems persist. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe five-year success rate of weight loss surgery is about 60 percent \u2014 far better than the 1 to 2 percent of severely obese people who are able to get down to a healthy weight through behavioral changes alone. \nHowever, that also means 40 percent of surgeries ultimately fail, typically because patients continue to eat excessively. This forces their stomach to regain its previous size. \nOther options for addressing severe obesity include the Obalon balloon, a pill filled with air that occupies space in the stomach, and vBloc, a pacemaker-like device that\u2019s surgically implanted and blocks the vagus nerve, which triggers hunger. Advertisement \nMedication can also be effective. Examples include hunger-suppressing phentermine (Adipex-P), liraglutide (Saxenda) to make people feel fuller, and lorcaserin (Belviq), another drug that increases feelings of satiety. While topiramate (Topamax) is approved to treat migraines, it may also be prescribed off-label to control binge eating. Related health problems \nAbd El Aty\u2019s weight may have been exceptionally high, but experts say that the health problems she experienced were commonplace for individuals who are severely obese. Advertisement Advertisement \nThat\u2019s defined as people with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 40, or who are 100 pounds or more over their ideal body weight. \nStudies show that death rates for heart disease, stroke, and other vascular diseases rise 40 percent for every five-point increase in BMI. \nIn addition, life span is shortened two to four years for people with a BMI of 30 to 35, and by 8 to 10 years when BMI is between 40 and 50. Advertisement \nCo-occurring illnesses are added right into another definition of severe obesity, which is having a BMI of 35 or more plus a serious illness such as diabetes or hypertension. \nLikewise, treatment options also can be driven by the presence of co-occurring illnesses. Advertisement Advertisement \nSurgery is recommended for severely obese patients who haven\u2019t been able to lose weight through diet, exercise, and drug therapy. \nIt\u2019s also advised for those who have obesity-related comorbidities, Dr. Runjhun Misra, DO, an internal medicine specialist in California, told Healthline. \nSarah Bramblette, who blogs at Born2lbFat about her experience with lipedema, a condition that causes excessive fat deposits in the legs, as well as with lymphedema, a buildup of lymphatic fluid under the skin, has seen her weight fall from 502 pounds to as low as 250 pounds after gastric bypass surgery. \nStill, she\u2019s had to cope with diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, and sleep apnea. \n\u201cI know carrying excess weight is hard on my body,\u201d she said. Treatment isn\u2019t easy \nEven when obese patients are motivated to make lifestyle changes, unexpected obstacles can arise. \nThese range from overcoming stigma in the doctor\u2019s office to difficulty getting a stress test because their weight exceeds the limit of the treadmill used in the evaluation. \n\u201cSometimes you can\u2019t even get diagnosed and treated because of your weight,\u201d Bramblette said. \nOverweight people shouldn\u2019t be made to feel embarrassed or ashamed about how they look, said Scinta. \n\u201cIt\u2019s OK to accept how you look on the outside, but you still have to be concerned about what\u2019s happening on the inside,\u201d she said. \nA combination of training and reimbursement concerns often leads primary care physicians to treat comorbid conditions rather than the excessive weight that causes them, said Scinta, formerly a primary care doctor herself. \nHowever, a lot of medications used to treat hypertension, diabetes, and depression can also cause weight gain. \n\u201cWe\u2019re fighting the battle but losing the war,\u201d Scinta said. \nShe advises doctors to instead get obese patients on a diet and exercise plan supported by weight loss medication, which she called \u201chighly effective.\u201d \nLePort said that more patients are motivated by concerns over health problems like heart disease than unhappiness with their physical appearance. \nIn that regard, surgery can yield impressive results. \nUp to 70 percent of comorbid conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure will resolve themselves once the weight comes off, said LePort. \nIn some cases, patients simply are predisposed to these conditions regardless of their weight, LePort noted. \n\u201cThe goal is to get them off medication completely, but if they have to stay on, then to have a very reduced amount,\u201d he said. \nMedicare will pay for weight loss surgery for people with severe obesity, said Bramblette, but the federal health program will not pay for surgery for people with a BMI under 35. \n\u201cIt should be offered to patients sooner, when they have fewer complications,\u201d she told Healthline. \nHowever, LePort cautions that surgery carries risks, sometimes fatal ones, that should be weighed against the benefits to a patient who may only need to lose 25 to 40 pounds to get down to a healthy weight. \n\u201cWe should try to get them to diet and exercise first,\u201d he said.

Written by Kimberly Holland on October 5, 2017 Rob Gronkowski has adopted most of the New England Patriot quarterback\u2019s strict diet. However, he won\u2019t give up alcohol. He drinks extra water instead. \nFootball teammates share a lot of things. \nHours on the road, locker room showers, sideline jokes. Advertisement Advertisement \nBut New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and tight end Rob Gronkowski now share a bit more: their diet. \nBrady\u2019s notoriously strict diet has been the talk of the food and fitness curious for many years now. \nHe doesn\u2019t eat or drink dairy, coffee, white sugar, white flour, peppers, mushrooms, eggplants, tomatoes, and most fruits. Advertisement \nHis avocado ice cream has a cult following. \nHe doesn\u2019t drink alcohol, but he does drink liters upon liters of water each day. Advertisement Advertisement \nAt age 40, the five-time Super Bowl champion is in peak physical condition. His gridiron performances continue to dazzle. \nHowever, for 28-year-old Gronkowski (lovingly called \u201cGronk\u201d by his fans), half of his professional football seasons have ended early with various injuries. \nSince starting in the league in 2010, he\u2019s missed 24 of 112 regular-season games, while Brady has missed only two for injury. \nPlus, Gronkowski has undergone multiple surgeries, including his third back surgery at the end of his short 2016 season. \nThe Patriots went on to win another Super Bowl while Gronkowski was on the injured reserve list. Advertisement Advertisement Following the Tom Brady plan \nSeeing his teammate\u2019s health and wellness propel him into a career beyond what many in the National Football League play, Gronkowski turned to Brady for advice and a plan. \n\u201cJust looking at Tom, seeing what he does every day, what he eats, talking to him, personally one-on-one, just learning about the body with him, just seeing how flexible he is, how pliable he is, how loose he is all the time, every day and ready to go,\" Gronkowski told the Boston Herald . \"I just felt like it was the time in my career where I needed to devote myself at all levels.\u201d \nDuring this summer\u2019s off-season, Gronkowski began working with Brady\u2019s body coach, Alex Guerrero, for training and physical development. Advertisement \nBrady and Guerrero have developed their own training philosophy, the TB12 Method. The method is centered around muscle pliability. Muscles that are more pliable, the program says, are softer, longer, and more resilient. Pliable muscles protect the body from injury and bounce back faster. \n\u201cI just felt like I had to add on to what I was doing. Find a way that my body will respond so I can perform every day. Be in prevention mode for injuries happening,\u201d Gronkowski said. \u201cI definitely feel like a brand-new guy just being able to do exercises here [at the TB12 center].\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nThe TB12 Method also follows strict nutrition guidelines. \nThat means Gronkowski had to completely upend his old food habits. He had to give up almost all meat, opting instead for a largely plant-based program. \nHe also eliminated all the same foods Brady avoids, though many of these foods would be considered healthy by almost all standards. Advertisement \n\u201cThe main premise behind Tom Brady\u2019s diet is to eliminate foods that can cause inflammation,\u201d says Mike Kneuer, a personal trainer and a member of the Men\u2019s Health Fitness Council. \u201cAs an NFL player, his body takes a beating and then can be very inflamed as it is.\u201d \nWhat about the long list of foods Brady and Gronkowski avoid is so bad? Advertisement Advertisement \nMany of them are nightshades, a botanical family of more than 2,500 plants. Many of them are used for medicine and food. \nSome people may have a sensitivity to nightshade foods \u2014 tomatoes, eggplants, bell peppers, and potatoes \u2014 and may not be able to fully digest them. \nBrady and his trainer believe these foods cause inflammation. Since the diet is focused on noninflammatory foods, these foods don\u2019t make the cut. \n\u201cRob has been really committed,\u201d Guerrero told the Boston Herald. \u201cHe\u2019s done a great job. The foundation has been set. Certainly, we\u2019re not done.\u201d The one rule Gronk won\u2019t follow \nAs much as Gronkowski has bought into Brady\u2019s diet and healthy lifestyle, there\u2019s just one thing the notorious party animal won\u2019t give up: alcohol. \nGuerrero devised an alternative for the four-time Pro Bowl participant. \nFor every alcoholic drink Gronkowski has, he has to drink three glasses of water to clean out his body. The same rule applies if he drinks coffee. \n\u201cThe whole drinking water to get alcohol out faster is an old wives\u2019 tale,\u201d Kneuer said. \u201cThe only way alcohol can get out of your system is through your liver, which processes only so much regardless of how much water you drink.\u201d \nStill, Linzy Ziegelbaum, a registered dietitian in New York, says this 3-to-1 ratio of water and alcohol might be a good rule for anyone to follow. \n\u201cAlcohol is dehydrating, and drinking water following a drink can help with rehydration to avoid hangovers, but it will not remove the alcohol from your system,\u201d Ziegelbaum told Healthline. Can football fans follow this diet? \nLast year, Brady released a \u201cnutritional manual\u201d \u2014 don\u2019t call it a cookbook \u2014 that outlines his eating philosophy and offers recipes to match. \nThe book is designed to be a \u201cliving document\u201d so that Brady and Guerrero can make changes, modifications, or add new recipes. \nIt\u2019ll set you back $200. \nYou can also order direct-to-your-door meal kits inspired by Brady\u2019s recipes and meals. \nFor $78 a week, you get three meals with two servings each. Each plant-based option meets many of the same guidelines Brady and Gronkowski follow. \nThough it may be tempting to try to mimic the training and nutrition of famous athletes in hopes of seeing similar results, this diet, Ziegelbaum says, isn\u2019t for everyone. \nIn fact, it\u2019s really only for people who have the means and resources to do it, like Brady and Gronkowski. \n\u201cHigh-level athletes require a lot of calories, and they need to eat a balance of carbohydrates and proteins in addition to micronutrients,\u201d Ziegelbaum said. \u201cWhile I do not think their diet approach is a good one, if their diet is planned correctly, they will be able to meet their nutrition needs.\u201d \nPlus, some of the reasoning for eliminating certain foods may be based on science that isn\u2019t fully settled yet, she said. \n\u201cMany people believe that nightshade vegetables, white sugar, and white flour all cause inflammation. Some fruits have also gotten a bad reputation because people think they are too high in sugar to eat,\u201d Ziegelbaum said. \n\u201cHowever, there is no science showing any of these things to be true. The nightshade vegetables and fruits he is avoiding are sources of antioxidants, which actually work to reduce inflammation. Science shows that eating more fruits and vegetables is beneficial, and there is no evidence showing harm from consuming nightshade vegetables,\u201d she said. \n\u201cFor the average person who has not been tested and does not know for sure that their body responds negatively to a fruit or vegetable, I would rather them not avoid it,\u201d said Paige Penick, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Kansas City. \u201cThere is so much nutrition benefit from consuming fruits and vegetables that they would otherwise be missing out on.\u201d \nFor Kneuer, who\u2019s also the conditioning coach for the Florida Atlantic University lacrosse team, this diet resembles what he\u2019d recommend to his clients. \n\u201cI ask that they remove sugars, except one piece of fruit per day if they need it, gluten, dairy, and alcohol from their diets,\u201d he said. \u201cBut unless a client is complaining of being achy, chronically sore, or have a history of arthritis, I don\u2019t normally worry about the nightshades.\u201d \n\u201cIf someone is wanting to eat better,\u201d Penick told Healthline, \u201ca good way to start is to get in more foods from the earth \u2014 things like produce, beans, and legumes. Look at eating from a positive perspective and focus on what you can have, and what is providing your body with needed nutrients, as opposed to creating a list of can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t.

Advertisement Advertisement \nThey\u2019ve collected 120,000 pints of blood in the process. \nOn October 27, an eighth \u201cSaw\u201d film called \u201cJigsaw\u201d (or \u201cSaw VIII\u201d) will be released. Another blood drive will be under way. Advertisement \nThis time, however, the online ad campaign for \u201cJigsaw\u201d features eight latex-laden LGBTQ social media stars dressed as nurses with the slogan \u201cAll Types Welcome.\u201d \nIt\u2019s not just a pun about blood types, but a reference to people who\u2019ve been banned from donating blood by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Advertisement Advertisement \nMen are banned from giving blood if they\u2019ve had sex with another man at any time in the previous 12 months. \nIn fact, earlier this week, former NSYNC singer Lance Bass expressed his frustration about the ban in reference to the mass shooting in Las Vegas. \n\u201cHow is it STILL illegal for gays to donate blood?? I want to donate and I\u2019m not allowed,\u201d he tweeted . What prompted the FDA rules \nThe blood ban dates back to the early 1980s, when the medical establishment first became aware of HIV, according to the HIV-education organization Avert . \nEarly into the HIV and AIDS crisis, doctors were concerned about how the virus was spreading in communities of the \u201c4 Hs\u201d \u2014 homosexuals, heroin users (intravenous drug users), hemophiliacs, and people of Haitian descent, said Eric Sawyer, vice president of policy at Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis , a nonprofit in New York and the country\u2019s oldest AIDS awareness organization. Advertisement Advertisement \nScientists eventually discovered the virus could be transmitted through bodily fluids such as blood, breast milk, and semen. \nIn 1985, the FDA began recommending that blood donation sites refuse to accept blood from any man who, since 1977, had had sex with another man. \nIt took time for the medical community to learn how HIV operates, as well as to discover \u201cthere are antibodies to HIV infection which you can detect in blood screening which lets you know somebody is [HIV-]positive,\u201d Sawyer explained. Advertisement \nDespite the present ability to test all blood donations for HIV and other viruses, men who have sex with men are still singled out in donations. \n\u201cThe only thing that was codified into law that has stuck has been the ban against gay men giving blood,\u201d he said. Advertisement Advertisement \nAfter decades of protest by gay, bisexual, and transgender men and their allies over what\u2019s called the \u201cblood equality\u201d issue, the FDA changed its policy in 2015. \nThe lifetime ban became a ban on donations from any man who had sex with a man in the past 12 months. The Red Cross connection \nJodi Sheedy, a spokesperson for the American Red Cross, told Healthline the organization and its blood drives aren\u2019t involved in the campaign associated with \u201cJigsaw.\u201d Advertisement \nIt\u2019s been affiliated with previous \u201cSaw\u201d films, however. \nOn its website , the American Red Cross \u2014 which collects about 40 percent of the nation\u2019s blood supply \u2014 says the one-year deferral for men who have sex with men \u201caligns... with those for other activities that may pose a similar risk of transfusion-transmissible infections.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nFor example, potential donors through the Red Cross must also wait 12 months if they\u2019ve gotten a body piercing with a reusable gun or any other reusable instrument. \nSame, too, for anyone who\u2019s gotten a tattoo in a state that doesn\u2019t regulate tattoo parlors. \nAdditionally, people who\u2019ve been treated for sexually transmitted diseases also have to defer donations. A person has to wait 12 months after treatment for syphilis or gonorrhea to donate blood. \nThe FDA\u2019s regulations still stigmatize men who have sex with men, activists say. \n\u201cThis particular ban has absolutely no medical or scientific justification any longer,\u201d said Sawyer. \u201cBasically, it comes down to an issue of science and human rights.\u201d \nGroups like GMHC point out that men who have sex with women can contract HIV from them as well, as can women who have sex with women. \nYet the FDA\u2019s regulations exclude men who have sex with other men, regardless of whether they practice safe sex. \nBlood is screened before being distributed to those who need it. \nThe Red Cross website states , \u201cAll donated blood is tested for HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and other infectious diseases before it can be released to hospitals.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s a good message\u2019 \nThe online campaign for \u201cJigsaw\u201d was created by Tim Palen, Lionsgate\u2019s chief brand officer. \nIt includes drag queen Amanda Lepore, personal trainer Dan Rockwell, and burlesque performer Mosh. \nTwo dozen cities around the country will hold mobile blood drives. People who donate will receive a free ticket to see \u201cJigsaw\u201d when it debuts. \nCities, dates, and hours for donations can be found on the Jigsaw Blood Drive website . \nIn an email, a Lionsgate representative declined to provide more information about the blood drives or the ad campaign. \nMichael Musto, a formerVillage Voicecolumnist and an icon in the New York City gay community, approves of the \u201cJigsaw\u201d campaign. \n\u201cI love the fact that a movie\u2019s campaign is using social activism to promote itself,\u201d Musto told Healthline. \u201cIn these days of protest and everyone having a voice, it\u2019s a good message, and should pave the way for more films to make a statement with their campaigns.\u201d \nSawyer is also appreciative of the statement being made by the movie\u2019s online ads. \n\u201cThat they\u2019re choosing to use this ad campaign to draw attention to the blood ban, I think is terrific,\u201d he said. \u201cI really applaud any organization or any product that attempts to raise social consciousness and promote social change in its commercial advertising of its product.\u201d FEEDBACK:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T06:47:59.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c48c4d2edd61a4a85db9ef32cb742d9b97665c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StaYXxBFVGaAH4BKGNjZ61nSTY0_hAyTPuvK_Q1CggtZmmK3kI6va6p4GcSiDUJdRq0c8UonNdt7LVg--", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/feedburner/HFUW", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "FOX News", "title": "The dangers of using 'home remedies' for serious illnesses", "title_full": "The dangers of using 'home remedies' for serious illnesses | Fox News", "published": "2017-10-06T17:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "EU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2017/10/06/dangers-using-home-remedies-for-serious-illnesses/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1507295748198.jpg?ve=1", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 229, "comments": 0, "shares": 229}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c48c4d2edd61a4a85db9ef32cb742d9b97665c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StaYXxBFVGaAH4BKGNjZ61nSTY0_hAyTPuvK_Q1CggtZmmK3kI6va6p4GcSiDUJdRq0c8UonNdt7LVg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Healthline.com", "published": "2017-10-06T17:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "The dangers of using 'home remedies' for serious illnesses", "text": "Most home remedies or natural therapies haven\u2019t been put through the same rigorous clinical testing you expect from pharmaceutical medications. (iStock)\nIn a world where you can fix almost anything with a do-it-yourself video on YouTube, you might think curing your own illness would be a piece of cake.\nIt might be if it weren\u2019t for a couple of (not so small) sticking points.\nOne, the home remedy recommended by your friend \u2014 or one of the many websites promoting \u201cnatural therapies\u201d \u2014 might not work.\nAnd two, it could make you sicker or even kill you.\nThat\u2019s exactly what happened to an Australian man who developed cyanide poisoning after taking high doses of apricot kernel extract, hoping to prevent his prostate cancer from returning.\nBABY DIED AFTER PARENTS REFUSED TREATMENT FOR JAUNDICE, POLICE SAY\nThis \u201csuperfood\u201d is touted as having anticancer properties. It\u2019s a claim that has no reliable scientific evidence to back it up.\nApricot kernel extract isn\u2019t alone in peddling hope alongside an increased risk of harming your health.\nPeople use home remedies for a variety of reasons \u2014 fighting cancer, losing weight, increasing sex drive, or reducing symptoms of illnesses that have few medical treatments available.\nMost home remedies or natural therapies, though, haven\u2019t been put through the same rigorous clinical testing you expect from pharmaceutical medications.\nSo, does that mean you should ignore them completely?\nNot necessarily. It\u2019s more a matter of approaching them with a healthy dose of skepticism.\nDr. Harriet Hall, a retired family physician, former Air Force flight surgeon, and author of the SkepDoc column in Skeptic magazine, is one of those leading the charge against medical \u201ctreatments\u201d not supported by science.\nLike others in the medical and scientific community, Hall is bothered that many questionable home remedies that might once have been called quackery, folk medicine, or fringe medicine now take shelter under the \u201calternative medicine\u201d umbrella.\n\u201cThere is no such thing as \u2018alternative medicine.\u2019 There is only medicine that has been tested and proven to work, and medicine that hasn\u2019t,\u201d Hall told Healthline. \u201cAlternative medicine is a marketing term, not a scientific one.\u201d\nNatural isn\u2019t always healthy It\u2019s common for people to think that \u201cnatural\u201d means healthy.\nBut many natural things can kill you \u2014 asbestos, ionizing radiation from radon, poison hemlock, and deadly nightshade, just to name a few.\nAs surprising as it may seem, some herbal supplements sold in reputable natural food stores or pharmacies can also harm you, even at doses recommended on the package.\nSupplements may be toxic all by themselves, contaminated with another compound that is toxic, or interact with prescription medications.\nDespite the risk of dangerous interactions between supplements and medications, only about one-third of people tell their doctor about the supplements they\u2019re taking, according to one study.\nChildren are especially at risk of poisoning from herbal or dietary supplements.\nA study published this summer found that calls made to poison control centers across the country about herbal and dietary supplements increased almost 50 percent between 2005 and 2012.\nMOM GETS JAIL OVER REFUSAL TO VACCINATE SON\nDietary supplements were the top reason for the calls, followed by herbal, hormonal, and other products.\nSerious medical problems occurred in about 4 percent of these calls. Ninety-five percent of the serious cases were in children under 6 years old. The majority of these poisonings were unintentional.\nOne reason for the popularity of herbal supplements is that they\u2019re easy to buy \u2014 no visit to the doctor or prescription needed. They\u2019re the ultimate health DIY.\nThere\u2019s also little government regulation of these products. If companies don\u2019t make claims that their product can treat or cure a health condition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) won\u2019t bother with them.\nUntil there\u2019s a problem.\nLast year, the FDA issued a warning that homeopathic baby teething tablets and gels may pose a risk to infants and children.\nHomeopathic remedies are based on the idea that \u201clike cures like.\u201d Small amounts of substances \u2014 sometimes toxic \u2014 are used to cure symptoms that those substances would cause at higher doses.\nThe teething tablets contained the poisonous plant belladonna, except in higher amounts than listed on the label.\nThe FDA investigation turned up more than 400 reports of bad reactions to these products over the past six years. Reactions included tremor, fever, and shortness of breath.\nIn 10 cases, children died.\nOn top of the dangers of some homeopathic remedies, there\u2019s little evidence that they\u2019re effective treatments for any condition.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service recently decided to stop using government funds to pay for homeopathic treatments.\nThe debate over homeopathy, though, isn\u2019t just about a lack of clinical trials.\nOne guiding principal of homeopathy is that the more you dilute the active ingredient in water or alcohol, the greater the therapeutic benefit.\nCritics say that for this to work, we\u2019d have to radically change what we know about biology, physics, and chemistry.\n\u201cHomeopathy not only doesn\u2019t work, but couldn\u2019t possibly work,\u201d said Hall.\nHome remedies for cancer Cancer has long been targeted by people promoting natural therapies.\nOne study estimates that use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by cancer patients in 18 countries rose from 25 percent in the 1970s to 49 percent after 2000. Use of these products was highest in the United States.\nAnother study found that herbal supplements were the most commonly used home remedy for cancer, followed by homeopathy, vitamin and mineral supplements, medicinal teas, spiritual therapies, and relaxation techniques.\nOne of the most popular therapies is Essiac tea, which has been promoted as a cancer treatment since the 1920s. This herbal blend contains burdock root, sheep sorrel herb, slippery elm bark, Turkish rhubarb root, and sometimes other ingredients.\nDespite its long reputation as an anticancer remedy, no clinical trials of Essiac have been completed and published in a peer-reviewed journal.\nUnlike apricot kernel extract, the side effects of Essiac are less severe, but they do include nausea, vomiting, increased bowel movements, and slight headaches.\nDIET OF LAMB AND CHEERIOS LEADS TO BOY'S VISION LOSS\nAnother home remedy for cancer is the Gerson method. It involves following a strict diet, drinking lots of fresh fruit and vegetable juices, taking dietary supplements, and giving yourself coffee enemas.\nAlthough some studies on the Gerson method have been published, none were the rigorous randomized clinical trials that are needed to determine if this home remedy actually helps.\nThree people have also died as a result of giving themselves coffee enemas. They can throw off your normal blood chemistry if you do them too often.\nThere are many more home remedies for treating cancer, with side effects ranging from minor to severe.\nBut even natural therapies for cancer that don\u2019t kill you directly can still kill you.\nIn a study published earlier this year, Yale researchers looked at the survival rates of 840 patients with breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer.\nPeople who chose to use only alternative medicine treatments had a higher risk of dying compared to those who used conventional cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or hormone therapy.\nThere\u2019s also the fact that people spend a lot of money on unproven treatments.\nAccording to the 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) , 83 million adults spent almost $34 billion out-of-pocket on CAM therapies that year. This accounts for 1.5 percent of the total healthcare spending in the United States.\nWhy people turn to home remedies One study found that people are more likely to use herbal supplements if they\u2019re uninsured, use more prescription and over-the-counter medications, or have certain health conditions.\nOther research has found higher herbal supplement use among women and people with a higher education.\nSome of the most common conditions that people try to treat with herbs include colds, stomach or intestinal illnesses, and problems like rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis. These are all conditions that have few effective medical treatments available.\nA person\u2019s culture may also influence their use of CAM therapies. For example, botanical medicine is important to many indigenous cultures in Mexico and the Southwestern United States. Chinese herbal medicine has been for centuries by Chinese people and Chinese-Americans.\nThese studies try to explain why people turn to home remedies in the first place.\nONE SHOT FOR ALL VACCINES? STUDY SHOWS PROMISE\nBut a bigger question is why people use home remedies that don\u2019t have any scientific evidence showing that they\u2019re effective.\nThe Australian man who developed cyanide poisoning from taking apricot kernel extract \u2014 a mix of a supplement he purchased and a brew he made at home \u2014 apparently had a \u201cscientific background,\u201d according to an anesthetist at the hospital where he was treated.\nHis doctors also warned the man about the risks of the extract, saying the cyanide was blocking the cells in his body from getting the oxygen they needed to survive.\nHe still refused to give up his daily ritual.\nOur Paleo brains drive us In a post on Skeptic , Hall suggests that human evolution has made it easy for us to fall into the trap of thinking that an herb might cure our cancer, that burning a candle in our ear could improve our overall health, or that a homeopathic remedy diluted almost to nothingness might help us have better sex.\nFirst, our brains are designed to look for patterns, even if they\u2019re wrong.\nIn our distant past, we reacted quickly if we saw a shadow that looked like a lion in the bushes. It\u2019s better to see a pattern that isn\u2019t there than to miss seeing a real lion.\nWe also tend to listen to what others tell us. If your friend says there are lions on the other side of the hill, often you\u2019ll listen rather than do your own research.\nOur emotions \u2014 especially fear \u2014 can also motivate us to act, such as running away as fast as we can from a lion.\nWhile these traits helped us survive in a world without technology, they can get us into trouble today.\nIf a friend has a cold, takes an herbal supplement, and gets better, we might think the pill cured her. But the cold could\u2019ve just as likely gone away on its own. Without clinical studies, we\u2019re just guessing.\nOr if you have a headache and your friend says, \u201cI put three drops of lemon oil on my wrists and my headache went away,\u201d you might give it a try. What the heck, right?\nOr if you have cancer and you\u2019re afraid of dying, you might try anything to get better \u2014 even if it\u2019s never been shown to be effective in a clinical trial, doesn\u2019t make any sense how it might work in the first place, or you have to shell out thousands of dollars at a clinic in another country for treatment.\nChoosing treatments for your illness is complicated by research that suggests many published studies \u2014 yes, scientific studies \u2014 are wrong.\nZIKA VACCINE SHOWS PROMISE IN EARLY HUMAN TRIAL\nScience isn\u2019t infallible. But it is methodical and self-correcting. Over time, new studies either confirm past results or weed out the mistakes.\nNot everyone has a strong background in science or clinical trials, so how are we supposed to decide which treatments work?\nHall offers what she calls her SkepDoc\u2019s Rule.\n\u201cBefore you accept any claim, try to find out who disagrees with it and why. That can be very illuminating,\u201d she said.\nAlso, you can always ask your doctor for advice. But even with that, Hall suggests some level of skepticism.\nPeople should \u201cask their doctor to provide evidence to support his or her recommendations,\u201d said Hall, \u201cand then they should check to see what others have said about that evidence.\u201d\nThis article first appeared on HealthLine.com.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T16:49:53.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "47be16691febd0ecb4a8cbb4f19573a4ce97d303", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StabGvKE6Qo4nSCMVkOCVszRfEPGa7FAzyhrC7Xk3UhYo20CK5p9nOhyy4zWsEbkt8lk-", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "White, Rich Seniors Are Getting Healthier", "title_full": "White, Rich Seniors Are Getting Healthier", "published": "2017-10-06T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.163, "main_image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/2611-happy_seniors-766x415-thumbnail.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 11, "comments": 0, "shares": 11}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "47be16691febd0ecb4a8cbb4f19573a4ce97d303", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StabGvKE6Qo4nSCMVkOCVszRfEPGa7FAzyhrC7Xk3UhYo20CK5p9nOhyy4zWsEbkt8lk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Written Matthew Berger", "published": "2017-10-06T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "White, Rich Seniors Are Getting Healthier", "text": "White, Rich Seniors Are Getting Healthier Written by Matthew Berger on October 6, 2017 More higher income and white seniors report they are in good health. However, African-American, Latino, and lower-income seniors don\u2019t show the same gains. \nMedicare may have survived the budget cuts included in congressional Republicans\u2019 plans to repeal Obamacare. \nHowever, even at current funding levels, there\u2019s only so much it can do for the health of older Americans, new research shows. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe number of Americans 65 and older who report being in good health is growing, but that progress is limited to certain demographics. \nAnd the health disparities between those demographics is growing. \nOverall, 48 percent of seniors reported being in good health in 2014 compared to 42 percent in 2000. Advertisement \nBut those gains were mostly in the wealthiest, highest educated, and white demographics. \nSome other demographics \u2014 including African-Americans, Latinos, and those with less than a high school education \u2014 saw a decrease in average self-reported health status since 2000. Advertisement Advertisement \nThose are the findings of a recent study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. \nMatthew Davis, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Nursing and the study\u2019s lead author, said he was surprised to see the \u201cwidening of disparities in good health over the 15-year time period despite health insurance coverage.\u201d What causes the disparities? \nMedicare provides near universal health coverage to older Americans. \nSo, that mean the causes of the disparities in senior health likely lie in something other than access to healthcare. \n\u201cI believe it points to the impact of social, economic, and environmental factors. In some ways, the growing disparities in health echo the growing divide in income. Income impacts health,\u201d Davis, who uses data science to research health services issues, told Healthline. Advertisement Advertisement \nPeople with more financial resources and more education are more likely to \u201cinvest\u201d in their health through healthy behaviors, he explained. \nThat might include higher priced actions such as joining a gym, buying fresher and healthier food, or living in a neighborhood with less pollution. \nHowever, the study didn\u2019t specifically address the reasons behind the disparities.

Advertisement Advertisement \nBut, he said, that possibility likely wouldn\u2019t explain the growth in self-reported health disparities over time. \n\u201cWe cannot completely rule out a potential self-reporting bias by group,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the question used in our study is well validated as a measure of health. Potential differences in self-reported health might impact differences at any one point, but would not likely impact changes over time.\u201d What can be done \nDavis said there\u2019s lots more work to be done in answering questions about how socioeconomic status relates to health and the impact of public health initiatives. Advertisement \nChief among those questions may be how to close the health disparity gap. \nThe Department of Health and Human Services has a Disparities Action Plan that outlines a road map for addressing the gaps. Advertisement Advertisement \nAnd health disparities are among the trends the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) track in the older U.S. population. \nThe CDC says it\u2019s \u201caware that even though life expectancy and overall health have improved in recent years for most Americans, not all older adults are benefitting equally because of factors such as economic status, race, and gender. CDC acknowledges that this is a growing problem and is trying to incorporate these issues into our work.\u201d \nBut that has proven difficult for other initiatives. \nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) \u201csharply reduced\u201d uninsured rates for people of color and low-income Americans of all ages, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation . \nHowever, disparities remain. \nLike the ACA for the general population, Medicare may only be able to do so much to close health gaps among older Americans. \n\u201cAs boomers turn 65 and go on Medicare, it is not surprising that the overall population gets healthier,\u201d said Tricia Neuman, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation and director of its Program on Medicare Policy. \nBut \u201ceven a successful program like Medicare can only go so far in narrowing the disparities in health revealed by this study,\u201d Neuman told Healthline.

Why are they reluctant to enter adulthood? \nAre today\u2019s teens taking longer to grow up than their predecessors? \nAccording to a recent study published in the journal Child Development , American adolescents are waiting longer than past generations to participate in activities associated with adulthood. Advertisement Advertisement \nResearchers from San Diego State University and Bryn Mawr College analyzed four decades worth of data from seven nationally representative surveys of adolescents in the United States. \nThey found that in recent years, fewer adolescents are working for pay, driving, going out without their parents, drinking alcohol, dating, and having sex than in previous decades. \nSince the early 1990s, for example, the percentage of high school students who work for pay has dropped from 57 percent to 32 percent among 10th graders. It\u2019s dropped from 72 percent to 55 percent among 12th graders. Advertisement \nOver the same time period, the proportion of high school students who drink alcohol has declined by 40 percent among 10th graders and 26 percent among 12th graders. \nThe share of high school students who\u2019ve had sex has also declined, from 54 percent in 1991 to 41 percent in 2015. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe researchers report that adolescent participation in adult activities has declined across gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic, and geographic strata. \nThey suggest that a \u201cbroad-based cultural shift\u201d has taken place, in which a generation of young people is \u201ctaking on the responsibilities and pleasures of adulthood\u201d later than before. Parental investment has increased \nAre teenagers less likely to participate in activities associated with adulthood because they\u2019re busier with homework and extracurricular activities? \nNot according to this study. \nResearchers found that time spent on homework and extracurricular activities has declined among 10th graders. It\u2019s remained relatively steady among 12th graders. Advertisement Advertisement \nOn the other hand, internet usage has increased. This might account for some of the changes. \nIn fact, one documentary labeled today\u2019s teens as \u201c screenagers .\u201d \nThe study researchers also found an association between a slower developmental trajectory and smaller family size, higher parental age at first birth, and higher median income. Advertisement \nWith fewer children and more money, parents can invest more time and resources in their kids. This may allow them to follow a slower developmental path. \n\u201cGreater parental investment leads to teens growing up more slowly because parents supervise children and teens more carefully and organize their activities,\u201d Jean Twenge , PhD, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University and lead author of the study, told Healthline. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cThere are also economic factors. With shifts in the economy, more people go to college and are dependent on their parents for longer. That also engenders more careful nurturing with the idea that education will last longer,\u201d she continued. \nOther researchers have also highlighted the role of economic and education changes in shifting patterns of adolescent and adult behavior. \nFor example, Jeffrey Arnett , PhD, research professor of psychology at Clark University in Massachusetts, has found that 18- to 29-years-olds spend more time getting educated, marrying later, and having children later than previous generations. Advertisement \n\u201cThere are a lot of things involved, as there is in any big social change, but part of it is the economic change from a manufacturing economy to what\u2019s been called a knowledge economy,\u201d Arnett told Healthline. \n\u201cIt takes longer to prepare yourself for a place in the economy, and so people stay in education longer. They usually go through a series of short-term jobs in their 20s before they settle into a stable career path, and that partly contributes to making the marriage age later and the age of having your first child later,\u201d he continued. Advertisement Advertisement \nArnett suggested that the decline in adult activities among younger adolescents fits into this larger picture of people growing up more slowly and entering adulthood later. Teens may be safe but less prepared \nAccording to Twenge, there are benefits and drawbacks to the decline in adult activities among adolescents. \nOn the upside, teens are less likely to engage in risky behaviors. They\u2019re more likely to wait until they\u2019re ready to participate in adult activities. \nOn the downside, they may arrive at college or work without much experience making their own decisions and leading independent lives. \nArnett considers the slower developmental path of today\u2019s teens to be largely positive. \n\u201cThings like unprotected sex, alcohol and most other substance use, and crime rates have gone way down among adolescents. Another thing that\u2019s really gone down is rates of automobile accidents, especially in the last 10 years,\u201d he said. \n\u201cAnd I think it\u2019s pretty clear that a lot of that is explained by what Twenge is reporting here. You have fewer kids getting their license right away at 16 or even 17 or 18. They\u2019re not in as much of a hurry to do that because they\u2019re spending more time at home and their parents are more willing to drive them where they want to go,\u201d he explained. \n\u201cNow that\u2019s a big thing, to have automobile fatalities go way down, and it\u2019s an example of why we should celebrate this. Giving kids more time to make their way gradually into adulthood is a good thing in many ways,\u201d Arnett noted.

Written by Gillian Mohney on October 6, 2017 A nerve implant may have helped a man regain some consciousness after he was in a vegetative state for 15 years. Could the procedure help others? \nFor decades, scientists have looked for ways to reach patients in persistent vegetative states in the hopes of \u201cwaking them up.\u201d \nA new study has found that there may be one sign of hope in the form of an implant that stimulates a key nerve in the body. Advertisement Advertisement \nResearchers from the Institut des Sciences Cognitives Marc Jeannerod in France wanted to see if an implant that affected the vagus nerve could help a person in a persistent vegetative state. \nThe team worked with the family of a 35-year-old man who had been in a persistent vegetative state after being in a car accident 15 years prior. \nThe team was able to implant a device, often used for patients with epilepsy, that stimulates the vagus nerve. Advertisement \nThis is the longest cranial nerve, extending from the cranium to the abdomen. It affects a host of systems in the body from the digestive system to the respiratory system. \nThe team implanted the device and then monitored the patient\u2019s brain activity, eyes, and other functions that would indicate consciousness. Advertisement Advertisement \nDr. Angela Sirigu, director of the Institut des Sciences Cognitives Marc Jeannerod, and other researchers published their findings last month in Current Biology. \n\u201cBrain plasticity and brain repair are still possible even when hope seems to have vanished,\u201d Sirigu said in a statement. \nBy using EEG and PET scans the team found that after the device was implanted the patient\u2019s brain activity increased dramatically and he appeared to respond to simple commands and even react in surprise. \nWhile this was only in one patient, the team hopes to replicate their findings in a larger study. \nAlthough the patient did show signs of being more aware, he died months later from a lung infection. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe authors said his death was not related to the study. \n\u201cThe patient\u2019s death was not linked to our protocol,\u201d Sirigu told the Guardian . \u201cWe respected the family decision to not communicate about the event. What was important for us was to keep the event in the privacy of this wonderful family.\u201d Why target the vagus nerve \nDr. Richard Temes, director at the Center for Neurocritical Care at North Shore University Hospital in New York, said these vagus nerve implants have been used for years in epileptic patients. Advertisement \nHe added that a key part of the vagus nerve is its relationship to the thalamus area of the brain. \n\u201cThe thalamus is very important for instance for arousal sleep,\u201d Temes told Healthline, explaining its ties to circadian rhythms. \u201cWhat that is, is the levels of consciousness. Thalamus is sort of the engine behind that.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nTemes said this work was important for helping shed light on what happens to a brain as it achieves consciousness. \n\u201cThis is trying to take a dive deep into that and looking at the brain itself and the electrical activity of the brain,\u201d Temes said. What this means for other patients \nDr. Aaron Lord, director of neurocritical care at NYU Langone Health, said the development of certain devices like brain implants for people with Parkinson\u2019s disease has helped renew interest in the field of waking patients in vegetative states. Advertisement \n\u201cThere\u2019s been some brewing interest in the last 15 or 20 years,\u201d Lord told Healthline. \u201cAre there things we can do for these patients to improve their level of conscious?\u201d \nLord pointed out that there are different levels of \u201cunconsciousness\u201d and that people can move between levels or plateau at a certain level, including being comatose, in a vegetative state, and in a minimally conscious state. Advertisement Advertisement \nSome people who arrive at a hospital in a coma can recover quickly, while others may need years of rehab. Some will remain in a persistent or permanent vegetative state for the rest of their lives. \nPatients who have been declared \u201cbrain dead\u201d exhibit no response to stimuli and have no chance of recovery. \nLord cautions that this study\u2019s findings do not mean patients can miraculously \u201cwake up\u201d with the right device. \n\u201cThis is not a dramatic awakening from a vegetative state that we see in the movies, but I think it does provide some hope for patients and families,\u201d Lord said. \nAdditionally, he said it will take a lot more research before this kind of therapy could be considered standard practice. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice proof of principal study,\u201d he said. But \u201cevery patient is going to be different.\u201d \nHowever, Lord said this study may help families looking for even small signs of hope or awareness in a loved one. \n\u201cGoing from no response to maybe being able to recognize a loved one \u2026 or some sense that they\u2019re interacting with the world could be meaningful,\u201d he said.

It can range from clinically isolated incidents (CIS) and relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) to a more disabling, progressive form of MS. \nPeople who originally receive a diagnosis of RRMS may transition into progressive MS, taking 10 to 15 years to do so. Advertisement Advertisement \nMany people don\u2019t progress at all. \nLittle is known about what drives the development of progressive MS, but inflammatory factors may contribute to this path. \nA recent study has discovered two closely related molecules that may explain why some people develop progressive MS. Advertisement \nThe research comes from Yale University, Oregon Health Science University (OHSU), and University of California, San Francisco. \nIt was supported financially by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS). Advertisement Advertisement A molecular problem \nThe molecules involved are known as a macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its related protein, D-dopachrome tautomerase (D-DT). \nMIF and D-DT cause inflammation. They work by binding to the CD74 receptor, which triggers inflammatory reactions throughout the body. \nThese molecules are called cytokines. They can wreck havoc on the central nervous system if overproduced. \nIn the study, researchers discovered that there were elevated MIF and D-DT levels in men with the progressive disease compared to men with RRMS. \nIt\u2019s the first time a correlation between MIF and D-DT cytokine levels in the blood of male subjects with a severe form of MS was revealed. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cTo prevent progressive disease would be a big help,\u201d Arthur Vandenbark, a professor of neurology and molecular microbiology and immunology at the OHSU School of Medicine and the study\u2019s co-senior author, told Healthline. \u201cWhile a cure is what everyone wants, this points the way for targeted therapy in an at-risk population.\u201d \nHe explained that the focus on understanding disease modifiers and what makes MS worse is what\u2019s important. A genetic marker discovered \nThe study also revealed for the first time a genetic marker that connects these molecules with males who have progressive MS. Advertisement \nThis suggests that a simple genetic test could be used to identify people with MS who are at risk of developing a more severe form of the disease. \nThe study was based on a hypothesis that the genetic markers that enhance production of MIF would predispose males to make more of this cytokine than others in the population. Advertisement Advertisement \nSome genetic markers go with high expression of MIF and D-DT, so researchers looked at males with high levels of MIF and D-DT to see if they had these genetic markers. \nThe researchers concluded they did, allowing for ways to \u201ctarget and potentially stop progression,\u201d said Vandenbark. \n\u201cIt is not an absolute test for who will progress,\u201d Bruce Bebo, executive vice president of research at NMSS, told Healthline, \u201cThere are plenty of men with this genetic change that do not have progressive disease, and many with progressive disease that do not have this marker.\u201d Advertisement \nWhile there\u2019s an increased risk for a more progressive disease, it\u2019s not an absolute. What lies ahead \nThe next step is to identify drugs in development or approved for therapy that could block this overproduction of MIF. Advertisement Advertisement \nStudies to treat people with MS over time to prevent the transition from RRMS to progressive MS would require some years of follow up, explained Vandenbark, due to the time needed to observe changes in the study population. \n\u201cOne day, we might be able to use this knowledge to help predict who is at a higher risk for developing progressive MS,\u201d Bebo said. \u201cBut more work still needs to be done before this can be a reality.\u201d \nDr. Jaime Imitola, director of the Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Multidisciplinary Clinic and Translational Research Program at The Ohio State University, told Heathline that this was a \u201cvery timely and important study, but [I\u2019m] cautious to extrapolate too much from the data.\u201d \nWhile the data was statistically significant, it needs to be repeated, and with a larger population group. \nMIF was one of the first cytokines discovered and has been studied as an inflammatory factor in the past. But it wasn\u2019t known until now how it might contribute to a progression of the illness. \nPerhaps the most important role of MIF has to do with progressive MS rather than RRMS. \n\u201cThis study is changing people\u2019s thoughts as to what MIF can do and the role MIF might have in progressive MS,\u201d explained Bebo. \nEditor\u2019s note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

Here\u2019s how to make that happen. \nMen who are physically active in their 40s and 50s are more likely to stay active as they get older. \nThat\u2019s according to new research. Advertisement Advertisement \nIt sounds good on paper. \nBut if you want to know what this looks like in real life, you only have to look as far as 82-year-old John Berg. \nThis past year Berg competed in 18 events at the Senior Games in North Carolina, including running, swimming, cycling, and shot put. Advertisement \nHe took home 13 gold medals and two silver. \nAlthough Berg works hard to achieve these results on the track and field \u2014 and in the pool \u2014 he\u2019s been laying the groundwork for decades. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cThrough high school and college, I ran track,\u201d Berg told Healthline, \u201cand that stayed with me as I aged. Running three miles a day during my lunch break, and running in 5K and 10K races.\u201d Sports keep men active \nA new study published last month in the journal BMJ Open found that this kind of lifelong commitment to exercise seems to help men stay active in their 60s and 70s. \nTo understand how men\u2019s physical activity changed as they aged, researchers followed more than 3,400 men for 20 years \u2014 starting when the participants were between 40 and 59 years old. \nOver the course of the study, around two-thirds of the men were physically active. \nAlso, at each of the check-ins \u2014 at 12, 16, and 20 years \u2014 around half of the men reported participating in one or more sports. Advertisement Advertisement \nThis includes team sports like soccer and hockey, as well as bicycling, running, working out at the gym, hiking, skiing, and similar activities. \nMen who were physically active at the start of the study were nearly three times as likely to still be active 20 years later, compared to those who had lower activity levels. \nThis was also true for men who had participated in sports during mid-life. Advertisement \nOverall, the longer men played sports, the more likely they were to stay active. \nAt the high end, men who had 25 years of sports under their belt at the start of the study were almost five times as likely to be physically active by the end of the study. Advertisement Advertisement \nLevels of walking also increased over the course of the study \u2014 from 27 percent of men to 62 percent \u2014 possibly due to men having more free time in retirement, the researchers said. \nBut recreational activities such as gardening and do-it-yourself activities dropped sharply from 56 percent of men to 40 percent by the end of the study. \nResearchers think this may be the result of declines in physical functioning and the onset of chronic disease as men aged. Advertisement Aging and inactivity \nBecause the study was done on men, the results may not apply to women. \nBut women like Kittie Weston-Knauer, 69, prove that the potential for lifelong physical activity is real for them, too. Advertisement Advertisement \nWeston-Knauer has always been athletic and active \u2014 in spite of having osteoarthritis since her 20s. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t let the pain stop me from playing, being active, and doing what I loved to do,\u201d she told Healthline. \nWhen Weston-Knauer was 40 years old, she started BMX racing after her son challenged her and his father to a race. \nWeston-Knauer has been racing ever since \u2014 and still riding through the pain. \nRecently, though, that all changed. \n\u201cI knew it was time for me to do something about my pain, so I found a doctor who recommended knee and hip replacements to compete stronger and harder,\u201d she said. \nWeston-Knauer said her doctor credits her active lifestyle \u2014 \u201ceven when my knees and hips were literally bone on bone\u201d \u2014 with helping her recover faster after surgery. \nAlthough osteoarthritis can occur in people of all ages, it\u2019s most common in those older than 65 years. \nBut it\u2019s not the only age-related change that can keep people from being physically active. \nAs we get older, our skin, tendons, and ligaments become less elastic, which can lead to stiffer joints. \nWe may also lose muscle mass and see a drop in our aerobic fitness. Plus, our reaction times may slow down. \nCombined, these kinds of physiologic changes can increase your risk of injuries such as muscle strains and joint problems, all of which can derail your fitness program. \nMany of these changes are noticeable. \n\u201cAs I have aged \u2014 going into year 30 with the sport \u2014 what I have found is that I don\u2019t have the same agility as I once had, and racing or just riding is not enough,\u201d said Weston-Knauer. \nEven though we can\u2019t turn back the clock on our bodies, becoming sedentary past middle age is not a given. \n\u201cThere are things that happen as we age that are normal, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to being frail,\u201d Dr. David Kruse, a sports medicine specialist with Hoag Orthopedic Institute in California, told Healthline. \nKruse said a big goal for people wanting to stay active as they age should be avoiding injuries. \nFor some people, this may mean choosing \u201cless impactful activities and less injury-prone activities.\u201d \nFor example, a hockey player might take up swimming. Or a runner might switch to bicycling. \n\u201cYou can also try to sustain the things that you enjoy doing, that you have a passion for,\u201d said Kruse. \u201cBut you have to balance them out with more time spent cross-training and building a base of fitness.\u201d \nThis approach has helped Berg keep competing. \n\u201cI now focus more on yoga or isometrics to stay limber and strong, things that are easier on my body and don\u2019t strain my joints,\u201d said Berg. \u201cWith SilverSneakers [fitness program for seniors], I also focus on balance exercises to help improve my stability.\u201d Staying active means being smart \nStaying active is important at any age. \nBut older adults may need to be more diligent in choosing the right kinds of physical activities. \n\u201cAs you age, a comprehensive program should be the focus,\u201d said Kruse. \nHe said this includes resistance or weight training to maintain lean muscle mass and joint stability. And activities that promote flexibility such as Pilates, yoga, tai chi, and stretching programs. \nKruse also recommends activities that improve balance as well as ones that get your heart rate up. \n\u201cThe better your aerobic fitness, the stronger you will be,\u201d said Kruse, \u201cand the better outcomes you\u2019ll have with your resistance training, as well as a greater ability to sustain other sport-related activities.\u201d \nPeople who have been competitive athletes for much of their lives may have a harder time adjusting to the age-related changes in their body. \n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy for them to just want to maintain the way they\u2019ve always done it,\u201d said Kruse. \u201cThey may not realize that these normal physiologic changes do happen over time and they do have to adapt to them.\u201d \nHe added that athletes can still be successful as they age. But they need to constantly look at their training program, and adjust it in order to maintain a solid fitness base and prevent injuries. \nFor Weston-Knauer, this means balancing BMX racing with other activities. \n\u201cI do a lot of TRX training, and work with a trainer to help build a routine that uses my body to build strength, stability, and flexibility,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has helped me compete at a higher level.\u201d \nShe also skips the fried foods and walks at least three miles, five days a week. \nBerg is also mindful of what he eats. \n\u201cAs I\u2019ve aged, I\u2019ve focused on eating healthy,\u201d he said. \u201cI grow a lot of my own food in my garden, including kale, lettuce, tomatoes, and asparagus. This helps fuel my body and keep me going.\u201d \nWhat about if you find yourself approaching your 60s and haven\u2019t really started being active? \nDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not too late. \n\u201cIf your goal is to be fit, to work on joint strength, for general fitness or for stress relief,\u201d said Kruse, \u201cthose are very achievable goals that you can implement at any age.\u201d \nSometimes your goals may be more than just fitness. \n\u201cStaying active allows me to continue to live an active life,\u201d said Berg, \u201cto continue my hobbies of gardening, wood carving, singing in the choir and a barber shop group, playing the ukulele, and ballroom dancing.\u201d \nWeston-Knauer suggests that people wanting to be more active find an activity that is a \u201cpassion\u201d for them. \nFor her, it\u2019s cycling. But for others it might be pickleball, softball, or maybe even walking with their children or grandchildren. \n\u201cOur bodies were built to move,\u201d she said, \u201cand if we don\u2019t continue to move, our bodies will feel it, and I believe our minds will feel it, too.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shawn radcliffe", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kittie weston-knauer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kruse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john berg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weston-knauer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david kruse", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "healthline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hoag orthopedic institute", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T04:54:01.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7f62ca06065c65e708e21212744d4d09761424f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_UgqhSGEAizGKuJMZPzff92ULWfRyBCAtFcjj2mZ.xOgSdwT", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "http://www.healthline.com/rss/diabetesmine", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Healthline RSS Feed", "title": "Ask D'Mine: What to Call \"Reversing\" Prediabetes?", "title_full": "Ask D'Mine: What to Call \"Reversing\" Prediabetes?", "published": "2017-10-07T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.healthline.com/resources/healthline/images/logo-lg.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 9, "comments": 4, "shares": 9}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7f62ca06065c65e708e21212744d4d09761424f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_UgqhSGEAizGKuJMZPzff92ULWfRyBCAtFcjj2mZ.xOgSdwT", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Wil Dubois", "published": "2017-10-07T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ask D'Mine: What to Call \"Reversing\" Prediabetes?", "text": "Email addresses will not be shared with 3rd parties.

Please try again later. Close \nHappy Saturday! Welcome to Ask D'Mine , our weekly advice column hosted by veteran type 1, diabetes author and community educator W il Dubois . \nThis week, Wil is pondering what to tell (and call) a woman who seems to have beat prediabetes, for the time being anyway... \n{ Got your own questions? Email us at } \n\nCathy, told she has prediabetes, writes: After being diagnosed as having prediabetes, I lost about 80 pounds in two years with lots of hard work. I am told I am no longer prediabetic because I got my A1C and BG in the normal range using diet and exercise. So I understand I am not diabetic at all, but I will have to follow the diet and exercise for the rest of my life anyway. So what would my label be at this point? Would I describe myself as high risk and/or genetically predisposed to diabetes? I have multiple deceased and living family members with diabetes, both type 1 and 2. When I told my endocrinologist about my strong family history of diabetes, he decided he would continue to see me twice a year and the PCP will see me twice a year as well. \nWil@Ask D\u2019Mine answers: First, a round of applause for Cathy. Woot, woot, woot! Eighty pounds? That\u2019s awesome! Do you realize how much weight that is? That\u2019s the equivalent of sixteen Chihuahuas, or eight bowling balls, or four car tires, or two microwave ovens, or one sack of Quickrete concrete mix. \nSo anyway you slice it, that\u2019s a frickin' amazing amount of weight to lose! \nAnd as you point out, it\u2019s changed your health destiny. But that being the case, what the Sam Heck do we call you now? An ex-prediabetic? A one-time prediabetic? A formerly glucose-impaired individual? A previous prediabetic? An erstwhile prediabetic? Cathy, late of diabetes\u2026 \nOr as you suggested, a person at risk for diabetes (PARFD)? A person genetically predisposed to diabetes (PGPD)? \nOr just Plain Jane, a normal, ordinary person? \nH ... so many choices. And none fits as well as Cinderella\u2019s glass slipper after the Prince\u2019s Ball. \nOK, for background, generally speaking, diabetes diagnoses are like tattoos. They never go away, no matter how much you might regret getting one. Even with an A1C deep into the \u201cnormal\u201d range, the diabetes tattoo remains. Why is that? Well, generally speaking, being in control doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve been cured. Diabetes isn\u2019t curable. \nBut prediabetes is. \nWell, maybe... \nHere\u2019s the deal: There\u2019s much press and research on what is officially called \u201creversing\u201d prediabetes. Basically, it\u2019s well known that if you have prediabetes and do nothing to improve your health but to loose weight (or have surgery to remove a bunch of it), your sugar levels will go back to normal. And they seem to stay normal, at least as long as the weight stays off. \nBut I think there\u2019s a risk in talking about the normalization of elevated blood sugars as \u201creversing\u201d prediabetes. Not in any way to belittle your accomplishment, but if you put that 80 pounds back on again, I\u2019d be willing to bet that your blood sugar woes will return. So there\u2019s no true cure here. Just a change of circumstance. You\u2019ve changed the numbers that make up the equation\u2014and that is wonderful\u2014but you can\u2019t change the underlying formula. So I\u2019m really glad to hear that you will keep seeing the endo and your family doc to help keep tabs on your non-prediabetes. \nAll of that being the case, I am not in favor of saying there\u2019s no longer an issue here. I\u2019m uncomfortable saying that you are now a sugar-normal person. As this condition can and will likely return, we need to be careful in both our wording and our thinking when it comes to how you should define yourself, and how the medical community should define all the hard workers like you. \nSimply put, I worry that if we use words like \u201ccure\u201d or a \u201creversal\u201d it sets people up for carelessness down the road. Both words suggest that the problem won\u2019t come back. But abnormal blood sugar is a problem that can come back. \nSo rather than look at the lexicon of contagious disease, which is where cures come from, maybe we need to take a page from the book of cancer. Cancer docs avoid the \u201ccure\u201d word, as cancers have a nasty propensity to return after they are presumed to be defeated. So cancer is never cured. Cancer, instead, goes into remission .

It helps maintain strong and healthy bones, aids your immune system and may help protect against many harmful conditions ( 2 , 3 ). \nDespite its importance, roughly 42% of people in the US have a vitamin D deficiency. This number rises to a staggering 82.1% of black people and 69.2% of Hispanic people ( 4 ). \nThere are several other groups of people that have higher vitamin D needs because of their age, where they live and certain medical conditions. \nThis article will help you discover how much vitamin D you need daily. Advertisement Advertisement What Is Vitamin D and Why Is It Important? \nVitamin D belongs to the family of fat-soluble vitamins , which include vitamins A, D, E and K. These vitamins are absorbed well with fat and are stored in the liver and fatty tissues. \nThere are two main forms of vitamin D in the diet: Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol): Found in plant foods like mushrooms. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol): Found in animal foods like salmon, cod and egg yolks. \nHowever, sunlight is the best natural source of vitamin D3. The UV rays from sunlight convert cholesterol in your skin into vitamin D3 ( 1 ). \nBefore your body can use dietary vitamin D, it must be \u201cactivated\u201d through a series of steps ( 5 ). \nFirst, the liver converts dietary vitamin D into the storage form of vitamin D. This is the form that is measured in blood tests. Later, the storage form is converted by the kidneys to the active form of vitamin D that's used by the body ( 5 ). \nInterestingly, D3 is twice as effective at raising blood levels of vitamin D as vitamin D2 ( 6 ). \nThe main role of vitamin D in the body is to manage blood levels of calcium and phosphorus. These minerals are important for healthy bones ( 7 ). \nResearch also shows that vitamin D aids your immune system and may reduce your risk of heart disease and certain cancers ( 8 ). \nA low blood level of vitamin D is linked to a greater risk of fractures and falls, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, several cancers and even death ( 9 , 10 , 11 ). Summary: There are two main forms of vitamin D in the diet: D2 and D3. D3 is twice as effective at raising blood levels of vitamin D, which is linked to a variety of health benefits. How Much Vitamin D Do You Need for Optimal Health? \nIn the US, current guidelines suggest that consuming 400\u2013800 IU (10\u201320 mcg) of vitamin D should meet the needs of 97\u201398% of all healthy people ( 12 ). \nHowever, many experts believe the guidelines are far too low ( 13 . \nYour vitamin D needs depend on a variety of factors. These include your age, skin color, current blood vitamin D levels, location, sun exposure and more. \nTo reach blood levels linked to better health outcomes, many studies have shown that you need to consume more vitamin D than the guidelines recommend ( 14 , 15 , 16 ). \nFor instance, an analysis of five studies examined the link between vitamin D blood levels and colorectal cancer ( 15 ). \nScientists found that people with the highest blood levels of vitamin D (over 33 ng/ml or 82.4 nmol/l) had a 50% lower risk of colorectal cancer than people with the lowest levels of vitamin D (less than 12 ng/ml or 30 nmol/l). \nResearch also shows that consuming 1,000 IU (25 mcg) daily would help 50% of people reach a vitamin D blood level of 33 ng/ml (82.4 nmol/l). Consuming 2,000 IU (50 mcg) daily would help nearly everyone reach a blood level of 33 ng/ml (82.4 nmol/l) ( 15 , 17 , 18 ). \nAnother analysis of seventeen studies with over 300,000 people looked at the link between vitamin D intake and heart disease. Scientists found that taking 1,000 IU (25 mcg) of vitamin D daily reduced heart disease risk by 10% ( 16 ). \nBased on current research, it seems that consuming 1,000\u20134,000 IU (25\u2013100 mcg) of vitamin D daily should be ideal for most people to reach healthy vitamin D blood levels. \nHowever, don\u2019t consume more than 4,000 IU of vitamin D without your doctor's permission. It exceeds the safe upper limits of intake and is not linked to more health benefits ( 12 ). Summary: Consuming 400\u2013800 IU (10\u201320 mcg) of vitamin D should meet the needs of 97\u201398% of healthy people. However, several studies show that taking more than this is linked to greater health benefits. Advertisement Advertisement How Do You Know If You Have a Vitamin D Deficiency? \nA vitamin D deficiency can only be discovered through blood tests that measure levels of storage vitamin D, known as 25(OH)D. \nAccording to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), the following values determine your vitamin D status ( 19 ): Deficient: Levels less than 12 ng/ml (30 nmol/l). Insufficient: Levels between 12\u201320 ng/ml (30\u201350 nmol/l). Sufficient: Levels between 20\u201350 ng/ml (50\u2013125 nmol/l). High: Levels greater than 50 ng/ml (125 nmol/l). \nThe IOM also states that a blood value of over 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/l) should meet the vitamin D needs of 97\u201398% of healthy people ( 20 ). \nHowever, several studies have found that a blood level of 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l) could be even better for preventing fractures, falls and certain cancers ( 3 , 21 , 22 ). Summary: Blood tests are the only way to know if you are vitamin D deficient. Healthy people should aim for blood levels over 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/l). Some studies find that a blood level over 30 ng/ml is better for preventing falls, fractures and some cancers. Sources of Vitamin D \nGetting plenty of sunlight is the best way to increase your blood vitamin D levels. \nThat\u2019s because your body makes dietary vitamin D3 out of the cholesterol in the skin when it is exposed to the sun's UV rays ( 1 ). \nHowever, people who don\u2019t live in sunny countries need to consume more vitamin D through foods and supplements. \nGenerally speaking, very few foods are great sources of vitamin D. However, the following foods are exceptions ( 20 , 23 ): Cod liver oil: 1 tablespoon contains 1,360 IU (34 mcg) or 227% of the RDA. Swordfish, cooked: 3 ounces (85 grams) contain 566 IU (14.2 mcg) or 94% of the RDA. Salmon, cooked: 3 ounces contain 447 IU (11.2 mcg) or 74.5% of the RDA. Canned tuna, drained: 3 ounces contain 154 IU (3.9 mcg) or 26% of the RDA. Beef liver, cooked: 3 ounces contain 42 IU (1.1 mcg) or 7% of the RDA. Egg yolks, large: 1 yolk contains 41 IU (1 mcg) or 7% of the RDA. Mushrooms, cooked: 1 cup contains 32.8 IU (0.8 mcg) or 5.5% of the RDA. \nIf you\u2019re choosing a vitamin D supplement, find one that contains D3 (cholecalciferol). It is better at raising your blood levels of vitamin D ( 6 ). Summary: Sunlight is the best source of vitamin D, but many people can\u2019t get enough for various reasons. Foods and supplements that are high in vitamin D can help and include cod liver oil, fatty fish, egg yolks and mushrooms. Advertisement Some People Need More Vitamin D \nThere are certain groups of people who need more dietary vitamin D than others. \nThese include older people, those with darker skin, people who live far from the equator and those with certain medical conditions. Older People \nThere are many reasons why people need to consume more vitamin D with age. \nFor starters, your skin gets thinner as you grow older. This makes it harder for your skin to make vitamin D3 when it is exposed to sunlight ( 24 ). \nOlder people also often spend more time indoors. This means they get less exposure to sunlight, which is the best way to naturally boost vitamin D levels. \nAdditionally, your bones become more fragile with age. Maintaining adequate blood levels of vitamin D can help preserve bone mass with age and may protect against fractures ( 25 , 26 ). \nOlder people should aim for a blood level of 30 ng/ml, as research shows it may be better for maintaining optimal bone health. This can be achieved by consuming 1,000\u20132,000 IU (25\u201350 mcg) of vitamin D daily ( 3 , 17 , 18 ). People With Darker Skin \nResearch shows that people with darker skin are more prone to vitamin D deficiency ( 27 , 28 , 29 ). \nThis is because they have more melanin in their skin \u2014 a pigment that helps determine skin color. Melanin helps protect the skin from the sun\u2019s ultraviolet (UV) rays ( 30 ). \nHowever, it also reduces the body's ability to make vitamin D3 from the skin, which can make you prone to deficiency ( 31 ). \nPeople with darker skin can benefit from consuming 1,000\u20132,000 IU (25\u201350 mcg) of vitamin D daily, especially during winter months ( 32 ). Those Who Live Farther Away From the Equator \nCountries close to the equator get plenty of sunlight all year round. Conversely, countries farther away from the equator get less sunlight all year round. \nThis can cause low blood vitamin D levels, especially during winter months when there is even less sunlight. \nFor instance, a study of Norwegians discovered that they don\u2019t produce much vitamin D3 from their skin during the winter months of October to March ( 33 ). \nIf you live far from the equator, then you need to get more vitamin D from your diet and supplements. Many experts believe that people in these countries should consume at least 1,000 IU (25 mcg) daily ( 13 ). People With Medical Conditions That Reduce Fat Absorption \nBecause vitamin D is fat-soluble, it relies on the gut's ability to absorb fat from the diet. \nThus, people who have medical conditions that reduce fat absorption are prone to vitamin D deficiencies. These include irritable bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease, liver disease and also people who have had bariatric surgery ( 20 , 34 ). \nPeople with the above conditions are often advised to take vitamin D supplements in an amount prescribed by their doctors ( 34 ). Summary: Those who need the most vitamin D are older people, people with darker skin, those who live farther from the equator and people who can\u2019t absorb fat properly. Advertisement Can You Take Too Much Vitamin D? \nWhile it is possible to take too much vitamin D , toxicity is very rare. \nIn fact, you would need to take extremely high doses of 50,000 IU (1,250 mcg) or more for a long period of time ( 35 ). \nIt\u2019s also worth noting that it is impossible to overdose on vitamin D from sunlight ( 36 ). \nAlthough 4,000 IU (250 mcg) is set as the maximum amount of vitamin D you can take safely, several studies have shown that taking up to 10,000 IU (250 mcg) daily won\u2019t cause side effects ( 37 , 38 ). \nThat said, taking more than 4,000 IU may provide no extra benefit. Your best bet is to take 1,000 (25 mcg) to 4,000 IU (100 mcg) daily. Summary: Although it is possible to take too much vitamin D, toxicity is rare, even above the safe upper limit of 4,000 IU. That said, consuming more than this amount may provide no extra benefit. Advertisement The Bottom Line \nGetting enough vitamin D from sunlight and foods is necessary for optimal health. \nIt helps maintain healthy bones, aids your immune system and may reduce the risk of many harmful diseases. Yet despite its importance, many people don\u2019t get enough vitamin D. \nIn addition, older people, people with darker skin, those who live farther away from the equator and people who can\u2019t absorb fat properly have higher dietary vitamin D needs. \nThe current recommendations suggest consuming 400\u2013800 IU (10\u201320 mcg) of vitamin D per day. \nHowever, people who need more vitamin D can safely consume 1,000\u20134,000 IU (25\u2013100 mcg) daily. Consuming more than this is not advised, as it is not linked to any extra health benefits. An evidence-based article from our experts at Authority Nutrition .

Will other AI assistants follow the same trend? \nAs smartphones have become nearly ubiquitous in much of the country, many of us live our daily lives with virtual assistants like Siri in our pockets. \nWhile these assistants can be helpful with simple tasks like relaying the weather forecast, in times of crisis a disembodied robot voice might not be so reassuring. Advertisement Advertisement \nHowever, this could change as Apple officials search for engineers with psychology backgrounds in the hopes of making Siri more relatable and helpful in emergencies. \nIn a job posting, Apple put out a call for engineers to work on Siri with a \u201cpeer counseling or psychology background,\u201d among other requirements. \n\u201cPeople talk to Siri about all kinds of things, including when they\u2019re having a stressful day or have something serious on their mind,\u201d Apple officials wrote in the posting . \u201cThey turn to Siri in emergencies or when they want guidance on living a healthier life. Does improving Siri in these areas pique your interest? Come work as part of the Siri Domains team and make a difference.\u201d Advertisement \nBruce Arnow, PhD, a psychologist and psychotherapist at Stanford Health Care, said increasingly mental health professionals have seen an opportunity to reach people in need of help via apps on their phone. \nAs a result of those collaborations, he said it wasn\u2019t surprising to see Apple pursue psychology experts to make Siri more relatable. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cA couple years ago it would have seemed odd and now it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Arnow said. \nHe pointed out that people already turn to their phones for help on a daily basis and that some likely have already turned to their virtual assistants in times of crisis. \n\u201cI saw an article about how Siri has responded to people who said things like \u2018I was raped. What should I do?,\u2019\u201d Arnow said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get very wise answers, so it\u2019s not surprising to me that they would hire psychologists.\u201d \nArnow clarified that he doesn\u2019t think of Siri as a mental health app, but that it could be engineered to steer people in the midst of a mental or physical health crisis in the right direction. \n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of Siri as an assistant that could \u2014 if you\u2019re in a crisis \u2014speak to you in a kind manner and direct you to a suicide hotline,\u201d or other helpline, he said. Advertisement Advertisement \nIn general, mental health applications have become increasingly popular with new apps now available that are designed to assist people with addiction issues, eating disorders, or other mental health concerns. \n\u201cWe do have a major access problem with respect to mental health services,\u201d Arnow said. \nHe did point out that these kinds of services can\u2019t replace full mental health treatment for those in critical need of help. Advertisement \n\u201cMost patients will need a higher level of care,\u201d Arnow said. \nBut he said these apps could be a first step for those in need of help. Advertisement Advertisement Making Siri a better friend or assistant? \nRamani Durvasula, PhD, a professor of psychology at California State University, Los Angeles, said as people become more attached to their phones, it will be interesting to see how Siri and other AI assistants develop. \n\u201cTo the degree they want to make Siri more appealing, it\u2019s the most logical way to start,\u201d Durvasula told Healthline. \u201cWhat gets complicated with Siri, is Siri your assistant or is Siri your friend?\u201d \nShe said engineers may be able to make Siri and similar devices more adept at mimicking human behaviors and that engineers with a psychology background will have more insight and information about how to effectively mimic that behavior. Advertisement \nHowever, Durvasula pointed out that some people will want to shout at Siri or be combative, and engineers will have to figure out if they want the device to mirror that combativeness or remain passive. \n\u201cAre there ways that over time you can have the phone learn the kind of language that the person is using, whether that\u2019s obscenity or volume or pace of language, and using that data?\u201d Durvasula said Advertisement Advertisement \nShe said there\u2019s a potential that people\u2019s interactions with Siri or other devices could someday impact how they interact with real people. \n\u201cIf you\u2019re screaming at a phone and get away with it, you may be more likely to talk like that to other people,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you scream at a normal breathing human being, they\u2019re going to scream back or walk away.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gillian mohney", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "bruce arnow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "durvasula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramani durvasula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arnow", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "california state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford health care", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siri domains", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-08T21:59:01.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0428893e87ee14fbd05642cda9be3534c6fb9c27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_UgqhX3bEr5IRlgzx68MKv1bI6moDxmxmXwvmx2JLSdzzAw3UAc5_duEVHgNgHqy17sc5Q--", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Texas Woman with Diabetes Bikes Cross-Country, Writes Book", "title_full": "Texas Woman with Diabetes Bikes Cross-Country, Writes Book", "published": "2017-10-09T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.285, "main_image": "http://www.healthline.com/resources/healthline/images/logo-lg.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 13, "comments": 0, "shares": 13}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0428893e87ee14fbd05642cda9be3534c6fb9c27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_UgqhX3bEr5IRlgzx68MKv1bI6moDxmxmXwvmx2JLSdzzAw3UAc5_duEVHgNgHqy17sc5Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Written Diabetesmine Team On", "published": "2017-10-09T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Texas Woman with Diabetes Bikes Cross-Country, Writes Book", "text": "Email addresses will not be shared with 3rd parties.

Close \nSince today is Columbus Day and many are talking about historic journeys, we thought it'd be the perfect time to share the story of a Texas woman who recently rode clear across America on her bike -- all to mark her 40th anniversary of living with type 1 diabetes. \nThis isn't the first time Tracy Herbert has done something to honor her \"dia-versary,\" this amazing 3,527-mile bike trek across the country from the Golden Gate Bridge to Brooklyn Bridge (!) is not the finish of her story, either. Nope, Tracy has multiple projects up her sleeve that she hopes to use to both inspire others with diabetes and raise awareness among the general public. \nAside from that major biking feat, Tracy is a published author with a book released in the summer of 2016 and she's now writing a new book about her cycling adventure, filming a documentary about it, has just released a new podcast talking diabetes, and she's even decided to start a new non-profit foundation to help those who can't afford diabetes technology. \nPretty impressive! \n\"It's about being better, instead of being bitter,\" the 57-year-old quips, reiterating a tagline she's said many times over the past several months during her journey. Tracy's Diabetes Story \nDiagnosed in 1978 at the age of 17 during her senior year of high school in northern Indiana, Tracy remembers being told she wouldn't survive past age 20 and that she'd endure an unpleasant, complication-ridden life before it was cut short by diabetes. Many diagnosed back in those \"dark ages of diabetes\" know that frame of mind well, as many heard the same thing from the medical profession at the time. \nClearly, that didn't happen. Now, two decades later she's in her late '50s, without any diabetes complications and a healthy mother of two kids. She has learned about the nuances of diabetes -- all types of it -- through her athletic adventures and her work as health / wellness coach and author who channels her energy into teaching others about diabetes. \nWhen her bigger milestone dia-versaries near, Tracy admits she likes doing something a bit crazy. \nHer previous adventures include completing the Hotter N Hell 100-mile bicycle ride in late August in Texas to mark her 20th year with T1D, and competing in a triathlon ten years ago to mark her 30th dia-versary, despite being afraid of water. \nFor her 40th, though, she upped it a few notches and went all out. Riding Across America \nTo make this recent bike trip happen, Tracy and her husband Fred decided in May to sell their Texas apartment and buy an RV. They stretched out what might normally have taken her about 1-1/2 months to three full months, from mid-June through Sept. 13, 2017, in order to enjoy the journey. \nFred followed along in the RV, where her insulin and diabetes supplies were stored -- along with all the other necessities they own. They also had along for the ride Tracy's service dog, named Indiana Jones! \nOver the course of the trip, Tracy made multiple stops along the way to speak at diabetes camps and organizations, community groups and just to meet people in the street. While she started this venture with a very personal mission, Tracy ended up being inspired by everyone she met and turned the bike ride into a way to increase visibility and awareness about diabetes. News stories and broadcasts began to pop up in places she'd made an appearance. \nMeanwhile, Tracy's riding pace ranged from roughly 50 to 80 miles a day, with her time through Wyoming including stops every 76 miles based on rest stop locations. Along the way, she wore her OmniPod pump and Dexcom CGM sensor, and had a smartphone connecting to the CGM app attached to the top bar of her bike, below the handle-bars. \n\"The overall experience was even better than I could have imagined,\" she said. \"Before leaving Texas, my husband and I said, 'if we can just encourage and make a difference in one person\u2019s life, this ride would be worth it.' As it turned out, from the responses I received along the way, this ride encouraged hundreds of people. Many parents reached out throughout the ride and said I was giving them and their children with type 1 hope and inspiration.\" \nThat sense of inspiration and hope is what fueled her to continue, Tracy says. She'd eat her oatmeal in the morning, keep track of her blood sugars through CGM, and manage with her Omnipod -- taking breaks regularly to keep everything in check. She even scheduled in rest days, to recharge herself. \nThe journey was rough, she handled it like a boss -- even in the 118-degree heat, carrying her bike on her shoulders for 7 miles over boulder-terrain, and navigating the fierce winds of Nebraska. \nShe hopes folks will look at her and think, \"If an old lady and grandma can make it this far and do this, then why can't I?\" she says with a smile. More Writing and Speaking \nTracy and Fred are currently still on the East Coast, but plan to return to Texas soon to figure out what happens next. \nAs noted, when not cycling, Tracy actually works as a health coach who also travels regularly around the country sharing her story and serving as a voice of inspiration in the D-Community and beyond. \nThe book she wrote in June 2016 is called Diabetes Tragedy to Triumph: 40 Years of Beating the Odds . While it's largely a basic educational guide, it also includes some distinct \"motivational\" aspects and tales of her own D-life throughout the 100+ pages. \nShe's now in the process of penning a new book about the cross-country cycling experience and is working on a documentary about the ride as well. And if all that weren't enough, she also just recently launched a new podcast, called Your Diabetes Breakthrough . A New Foundation \nAnd to top it all off, Tracy was so inspired by the Diabetes Community she encountered all over America that she's decided to establish a new non-profit foundation to help PWDs in need get access to the latest tools. \n\"Because of so many parents I met this summer during the ride, I felt led to start a Foundation which provides technology that often insurance companies do not provide, or their parents can\u2019t afford their out of pocket expense,\" she says. \"We are currently working through the legal structure and hope to have it operating before the end of the year.\" \nWhat a cool story! Tracy is definitely someone who doesn't let diabetes stop her from doing anything she wants to do -- and even using the condition to help inspire and help others.

But they have some allowable differences due to the fact that they\u2019re made from living organisms and the complexity of the manufacturing process,\u201d Kennerly told Healthline. \n\u201cThey don\u2019t lend themselves to be reproduced exactly. Mvasi can be used for the same indications as Avastin. We can expect clinical outcomes to be the same. But the physician has to indicate one or the other. They can\u2019t be switched or changed without a new prescription,\u201d she continued. \nShe noted that biosimilars are allowed because of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 . So, they\u2019re fairly new. Advertisement \n\u201cWe\u2019re just starting to see them come to market,\u201d said Kennerly. \nTo be called interchangeable, the drug must meet the same standards as biosimilars. In addition, they must prove they can produce the same result as the reference product in any patient, even if they switch from one drug to the other. Advertisement More cancer biosimilars on the way \nKennerly believes more biosimilars for cancer treatment will be available in the near future. \nShe said that others in the pipeline include biosimilars for trastuzumab (Herceptin), pegfilgrastim (Neulasta), and rituximab (Rituxan). \nGetting biosimilars into general use is more complicated than it is for generics. Advertisement \nHow will doctors choose which drug to prescribe? \nMuch will depend on how medical insurers respond, according to Kennerly. Advertisement Advertisement \nKennerly suggested it might be particularly challenging for outpatient infusion centers to decide how much of each drug to stock. \nBut cancer centers are likely to have more success in deciding which ones to use. The impact on healthcare costs \nBiologics are expensive and a big driver of escalating healthcare costs . \nIn the United States, generic drugs saved the healthcare system $253 billion in 2016 alone. \nIt remains to be seen if biosimilars will have a similar impact. \nDr. Timothy Byun, a medical oncologist with St. Joseph Hospital\u2019s Center for Cancer Prevention and Treatment, said it\u2019s not clear how Mvasi will affect cost of treatment. \n\u201cObviously on the surface, this should help to curb the rising cost of cancer treatment. But medical economics does not appear to follow the rules of true market economy,\u201d he told Healthline. \n\u201cIf you have a product that is similar, then that drug\u2019s cost should be substantially less expensive. However, some health insurances have co-pay policy that may end up making generic drugs more expensive for patients. We will have to wait and see whether patients pay more out-of-pocket for Mvasi compared to Avastin,\u201d Byun said. \nKennerly believes biosimilars will end up decreasing the cost of cancer care. \nBut estimating how much is a complicated task. \n\u201cCompetition drives prices down. What is unknown is how far. This will largely be determined based on the CMS [Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services] ruling on how to approach reimbursement for biosimilars. What the CMS does, insurers usually follow suit,\u201d said Kennerly. \n\u201cThe current CMS policy requires all biosimilars related to the reference products be given a shared code. Reimbursement is based on the average sell price. The challenge is that it could end up stifling the biosimilar production market,\u201d she continued. \n\u201cMany people have urged the CMS to reverse its current biosimilar reimbursement policy. The 2018 final regulations from CMS are expected in November,\u201d said Kennerly. What does it all mean for cancer patients? \nCancer patients won\u2019t necessarily see any difference, said Kennerly. \n\u201cThe whole idea behind biosimilars is that the FDA has vetted them and approved them as similar enough. I don\u2019t think the patient will really see a difference, outside of potentially the pricing scheme that\u2019s utilized,\u201d she said. \nWith current biosimilars on the market, Kennerly said the main difference for the patient is what insurance covers. \n\u201cPharmacy benefits are driven primarily by insurers. As the healthcare provider, you don\u2019t necessarily have as much say, perhaps, as you would like,\u201d she said. \nByun emphasized that biosimilars have the same efficacy and safety profiles as brand name biologic drugs. \n\u201cThey [patients] should not be fearful when oncologists use biosimilars,\u201d he said.

Written by Temma Ehrenfeld on October 9, 2017 The island nation scores better than the United States when it comes to infant mortality and life expectancy. Part of the reason is healthcare is a right there. \nLet\u2019s say you are pregnant, and at risk for complications. \nAre you and your baby better off if you live in Mississippi \u2014 or Cuba? Advertisement Advertisement \nGoing by the statistics, you\u2019re better off in Havana than in Biloxi or many other places in the United States if you\u2019re poor. \nThat\u2019s true even though the United States spends more than $9,000 per person per year on healthcare and Cuba spends less than $3,000. \nOne big reason: Providers are paid much more in the United States. Advertisement \nIn addition, Cuban leaders have made a commitment to healthcare for all. \nIn the United States, unless you\u2019re a veteran or Native American who lives near a tribal health center \u2014 and get free government care \u2014 you must seek out services and usually contribute to your costs. Advertisement Advertisement \nThere\u2019s no guarantee. \nAnd on basic measures of public health \u2014 infant mortality, life expectancy, pregnancy-related deaths, and obesity \u2014 the U.S. scorecard is weak. Infant mortality \nIn Cuba, between 4 and 5 infants die for every 1,000 live births, according to 2016 estimates from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency . \nThe province of Cienfuegos in Cuba reports getting the number down even lower, to 3 per 1,000. \nIn the United States, nearly 6 infants die for every 1,000 live births. Advertisement Advertisement \nAlthough a small island, Cuba is matching the infant mortality rate in Canada and the United Kingdom \u2014 two other, much richer, countries with a plan to assure care for all. \nNow look at populations within the national U.S. number. \nIn much of the South, the infant mortality rate is above seven. Advertisement \nIn Mississippi, it was 9.3 in 2015 \u2014 more than twice Cuba\u2019s. \nAmong African-American residents in Mississippi, who tend to be poorer than whites, the figure is 13. Advertisement Advertisement Life expectancy \nIf your baby girl was born in 2015 in Cuba, she could expect to live until 82 . \nIn the United States, her lifespan would be a year less, on average. \nA newborn girl in Mississippi can expect to live until 78 , four fewer years than in Cuba. Advertisement \nThat\u2019s also the life expectancy for all African-American girls . \nBoys do better in Cuba, too. Advertisement Advertisement Pregnancy-related mortality \nWe think of death in childbirth as a problem for the prairie pioneers long long ago. \nBut more than 17 U.S. women die for reasons related to pregnancy for every 1,000 live births, a number that shocks observers of U.S. healthcare. \nIn Mississippi , the rate is close to 40, and if you\u2019re African-American, it jumps to almost 55. \nIn Cuba, the number is also 40. \nIt\u2019s \u201cnot as low as it should be, and they are focused on that now, embarrassed by it,\u201d notes Dr. C. William Keck, professor emeritus at Northeast Ohio Medical University and past president of the American Public Health Association. \nPregnancy-related deaths have been falling rapidly around the world . The big exception is the United States, where for three decades they\u2019ve been going up. \nCuba has made maternal and infant health a priority, setting an example for developing nations around the world. \n\u201cPregnant women see a doctor or nurse 17 times on average, before delivery,\u201d reports Gail Reed, executive editor of MEDICC Review: International Journal of Cuban Health & Medicine, a peer-reviewed journal. \n\u201cDoctors make a big effort to identify high-risk women, particularly those who are diabetic, very young, or having a first child at a later age,\u201d Reed told Healthline. \nIn Cuba, if your pregnancy is considered high risk, you might be asked to live in a home for pregnant women, with a doctor in residence \u2014 all paid for by the government. \nIf you choose to stay at home, you get visits from a doctor or nurse to monitor you. \nAlmost all babies are born in a hospital, a big achievement for Cuba. Focusing on public health \nIn Cuba, healthcare is considered a right under the constitution. \nTo make good on that promise, Cuba brings the professionals to you. \nA family nurse or doctor lives in a local \u201cconsultorio\u201d near your home, where your visits are free. \nDoctors also make house calls. \nEach team is responsible for the health of families in its area \u2014 not just for treating disease or injuries. \nThe team keeps careful records required by the government to identify problems early. You\u2019ll be evaluated every year and about every three months if you have a chronic illness. \nForget your Pap smear? The nurse might show up at your house. \nYou might find a doctor at a large factory or school, aboard ships, in child care centers, and in homes for senior citizens. \nCuban doctors, who are educated for free, must spend two years as a family doctor. \nThe physician may then leave, but nurses tend to stay for years in one neighborhood and follow individuals over time. \nYour local family doctor can refer you to a polyclinic, which offers a range of services. From there, you might go to a hospital or specialist. \nAt all levels, Cuba stresses preventive care. \nIt has eliminated the major diseases for which we have vaccinations. In the United States, cases of measles and mumps recently cropped up because of parents resisting vaccines. \nCuba was the first country to eliminate HIV and syphilis transmission between mother and child, an achievement confirmed by the World Health Organization in 2015. \nCuba prides itself on combining the best of high-tech and low-tech care. \nFor example, you might be offered acupuncture for back pain, Reed reports, and there\u2019s no talk of an opioid crisis. The U.S. Swiss cheese system \nThere are many sources of healthcare in the United States and ways to get help paying for it. \nHowever, that has created a complex Swiss cheese healthcare marketplace that lets people fall through holes. \nPeople skip tests and doctor\u2019s visits because of deductibles and co-pays and uncertain \u2014 and often large \u2014 costs. \nUninsured people go to the emergency room, pushing costs up for the system as a whole. \nLow income people have special options. If you\u2019re also pregnant, you qualify for Medicaid. \nIn fact, in half of the states, Medicaid finances half or more of all births . But hospitals say that Medicaid isn\u2019t covering their costs. What will happen next? \nYou might qualify for a subsidy to buy insurance on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges. \nEither way, you have to apply and follow up, and some people fail. \nBefore the ACA reforms mandating benefits and consistent price tags, less than half of women with private plans had maternity benefits. Women were routinely charged more than men for insurance, the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund reports . \nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re obese and want to have weight loss surgery. Cubans who qualify can get it for free. \nIn nearly all U.S states, Medicaid covers this kind of surgery \u2014 but not currently in Mississippi. \nAnother U.S. problem is inconsistent care. \nIf you go to a community health center, you\u2019ll see rotating doctors. \nIf you switch between private insurers, you\u2019ll also generally need to switch doctors. You could get poor care because your current doctor doesn\u2019t know your complete history. \nIn short, some people get the world\u2019s best care and some people fall through a hole. The fight against obesity \nWhen people in poor countries no longer face starvation, they tend to gain too much weight. \nCubans have seen the connection between weight and disease firsthand. \nIn the 1990s, when gas prices soared and Cuba lost Soviet food supplies, President Fidel Castro responded by rationing food, promoting small-scale gardens, and distributing more than 1 million bicycles. \nAdults lost about 10 pounds, on average, as they ate less and rode their bikes. Obesity, diabetes, and deaths from heart disease all dropped dramatically. \nWhen the rationing eased, obesity rates climbed and the diabetes and heart disease statistics got worse, too. \nThen, when Cuba allowed people to be self-employed, fast-food stands popped up on every corner. \nToday, more Cubans are becoming obese, as people are around the world. \nAmong American preschoolers enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, 14 percent are obese compared to about 8 percent of Cuban preschoolers. \nBoth countries face the challenge of getting those numbers down. \nKeep on the lookout to see who wins.

New Technology May Help with Diabetes Management.", "text": "No More Finger Prick. New Technology May Help with Diabetes Management. Written by Ginger Vieira on October 9, 2017 The FreeStyle Libre system allows people with diabetes to check their glucose without a skin prick, but there are concerns about its lack of alarms. \nType 1 and type 2 diabetes technology and medications have come a long way since the invention of insulin in 1921. \nBut day-to-day management still requires countless finger pricks to draw blood and measure glucose levels. Advertisement Advertisement \nFreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System , manufactured by Abbott Diabetes Care Inc. and officially approved on September 27 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), strives to be a true game-changer for people with diabetes. \nUnlike the Dexcom or Medtronic\u2019s Guardian and Enlite continuous glucose monitors (CGM), which require a minimum of twice-daily finger pricks to calibrate the CGM\u2019s readings with that of a traditional blood glucometer, the Libre system requires zero calibration. \nThe technology is still similar in that the Libre also uses a small sensor wire that a patient inserts into their subcutaneous tissue. Advertisement \nThis sensor measures glucose levels in the interstitial (body fat) fluid versus glucose in the bloodstream. How the device works \nWhere the technology continues to differ greatly is in how the glucose levels measured by the sensor wire are then reported to the person using it. Advertisement Advertisement \nFrom the get-go, the Libre requires a lengthy 12-hour startup period before the sensor is able to measure and report glucose levels while the Dexcom and Medtronic sensors startup window is a mere two hours. \nThe most significant difference between these technologies is that the Libre isn\u2019t \u201ccontinuous.\u201d \nWhen a patient wants to measure their blood glucose level, the Libre requires them to wave a small handheld \u201cmobile reader\u201d over the part of the body where their sensor is located. \nThe handheld device then displays the glucose level, allowing the user to determine if it\u2019s too high (hyperglycemia) or too low (hypoglycemia). \nDexcom and Medtronic CGMs both send blood glucose data wirelessly to a handheld device (or the user\u2019s own iPhone), which displays a simple graph with new glucose measurements automatically marked every five minutes. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe Libre sensor itself can be used for up to 10 days. \nDexcom and Medtronic\u2019s sensors are FDA approved for use up to seven days, but users of these CGMs have learned that simply stopping and restarting the sensor\u2019s \u201cstartup\u201d process enables them to use a sensor for as long as the sensor\u2019s tape keeps it attached to their body. \nMany report getting 10 to 14 days out of a sensor. Advertisement \n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten as much as 22 days out of one Dexcom sensor,\u201d reports Sarah \u201cSugabetic\u201d Kaye, who has lived with type 1 diabetes for 29 years and is well-known in the blogging community for her diabetes technology reviews at Sugabetic.me . \nAll three glucose monitoring technologies provide a graph on their handheld devices, allowing patients and their healthcare providers to identify patterns and make changes in their medication regimen and improve overall blood glucose levels. Advertisement Advertisement Missing a critical detail \nAs groundbreaking as the FreeStyle Libre\u2019s prick-less and zero-calibration system may be, the most notable shortcoming of this new technology is its lack of alarms. \n\u201cLibre is a good option for those who don't check their blood sugar a whole lot using traditional finger-stick meters,\u201d explained Gary Scheiner, MS, CDE, author of \u201c Think Like a Pancreas \u201d and founder of Integrated Diabetes Services . \n\u201cIt's easy to use and minimally inconvenient. And it will provide healthcare providers with some robust data for making beneficial recommendations and adjustments,\u201d he told Healthline. Advertisement \n\u201cHowever, I don't think many current CGM users will (or should) switch to Libre since it lacks those all-important high and low blood sugar alerts. Without early high and low warnings, users open themselves up to potentially dangerous hypoglycemia as well as prolonged and more severe hyperglycemia.\u201d \nIn addition to simply alerting patients when their blood glucose levels are rising or falling with indicating arrows, Dexcom and Medtronic technology allow them to customize their own alarm settings, and automatically alert them if glucose levels drop below 55 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Advertisement Advertisement \nThis customizable alert feature is crucial, for example, because the blood sugar goals for a patient during pregnancy will be tighter than the goals of a non-pregnant patient. \nBlood sugar goals for a teenager or a young child are generally going to be far more lenient than they would be for an adult. \nThose with a history of \u201chypoglycemia unawareness,\u201d in which they no longer experience symptoms of low blood sugars such as lightheadedness and trembling, would likely want to be alerted far sooner than others. \nFor parents of children with diabetes, the alarms provide a level of security and peace of mind, especially while children are sleeping, playing sports, at recess, or at a friend\u2019s home for a sleepover. Reluctant to make the switch \nThe lack of alarms in the Libre isn\u2019t just an inconvenience, it may actually deem the technology useless for many. \nThis crucial detail is likely the strongest motivators for a patient being willing to wear a sensor wire in their flesh 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \n\u201cFor me, the purpose of a monitoring system is to have those alerts and alarms,\u201d Kaye told Healthline. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t do that, then using a standard meter is just as good as the Libre in my opinion. To be honest, the Libre is not even on my radar of interest because of the lack of alarms.\u201d \nWhile all of the sensors themselves are thin and short, they are inserted with a large, thick needle, which is a quick but still painful application process. \nPossible side effects of wearing any type of sensor include skin rashes due to the medical tape, constantly healing punctures from past sensor locations, and the constant presence of the noticeable external parts of the device that can be as thick as a stack of three or four quarters sitting on the skin. \nThe trade-off for that sometimes tedious discomfort is the safety and security provided by the alarms. \nThose pertinent alarms are also perhaps the only way to reduce the anxiety and worry that any patient (or their parents) taking daily doses of insulin inevitably experience due to the risks associated with taking even just slightly too much or too little. \n\u201cThe Libre feels like a good replacement for your traditional blood glucose meter,\u201d explained Scott Benner, host of the all-things-diabetes Juicebox Podcast and whose daughter was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as a toddler. \u201cHowever, the lack of the \u2018C\u2019 in the \u2018CGM\u2019 makes the Libre an unworthy competitor to the Dexcom [or Medtronic] device.

Written by Gigen Mammoser on October 9, 2017 New figures show continued increases for gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia. Experts say there are a number of reasons for the rise in these STDs. \nAfter winning the battle for years, the United States is starting to lose the war against sexually transmitted diseases. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , 1.6 million cases of chlamydia, 470,000 cases of gonorrhea, and 28,000 cases of syphilis were reported last year. Advertisement \nIndividuals aged 15 to 24 are the most affected age group. \nAll three of these sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) have been increasing in frequency since 2014. \nThat was after a downward trend between 2006 and 2013. Advertisement \n\u201cIncreases in STDs are a clear warning of a growing threat,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. \n\u201cSTDs are a persistent enemy, growing in number, and outpacing our ability to respond,\u201d he said in a press release . Advertisement Advertisement \nChlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis can typically be cured with antibiotics. \nHowever, if they\u2019re left untreated they can lead to serious health problems, including infertility and stillbirth. \nThese diseases can also go unnoticed because they don\u2019t have symptoms or the symptoms can be ignored. \nThe CDC also stressed that growing STD rates have a far greater impact on certain parts of the population. \nWomen, babies, and gay and bisexual men are the most affected of these groups. Advertisement Advertisement Chlamydia causing serious problems \nWith more than 1 million cases of chlamydia in 2016, the disease is the most highly reported of all the major STDs. \nIts rate of infection increased about 5 percent from the previous year. Cases of the disease are significantly higher for young women between the ages of 15 and 24, than the rest of the population. \nChlamydia infection in women may be asymptomatic, making regular screening for the disease a necessity. Advertisement \nIt\u2019s more harmful in women because, if untreated, it can result in pelvic inflammatory disease , which may lead to infertility and other issues with pregnancy. \nThe disease can also be passed on to children from their mothers. This can lead to complications, including blindness and pneumonia in babies. Advertisement The issues with syphilis and gonorrhea \nSyphilis rates increased by roughly 18 percent from 2015 to 2016. \nThe majority of the cases occurred in men, particularly gay and bisexual men. \nSyphilis is also characterized by a high rate of HIV coinfection. Nearly 50 percent of gay and bisexual men with syphilis were also HIV-positive, compared with 10 percent of heterosexual men. Advertisement \nThe disease is also appearing more frequently in babies, being passed down from their mothers. The rate of that condition, known as congenital syphilis, nearly doubled to 632 cases between 2012 and 2016. \nCongenital syphilis is most common in the African-American community. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cEvery baby born with syphilis represents a tragic systems failure,\u201d said Gail Bolan, director of the CDC\u2019s Division of STD Prevention, in a statement . \u201cAll it takes is a simple STD test and antibiotic treatment to prevent this enormous heartache and help assure a healthy start for the next generation of Americans.\u201d \nRates of gonorrhea have been steadily climbing since they reached a historic low in 2009 . \nCases increased by 22 percent in men and 14 percent in women between 2015 and 2016. The disease is most prevalent among African-Americans and Native Americans. Why is this happening? \nWhile the CDC\u2019s report helps paint a picture of the current STD problem gripping the nation, it does less to explain why it\u2019s happening or how we got here. \nThe report touches on the threat of drug-resistant gonorrhea, but it doesn\u2019t say that it\u2019s specifically responsible for growing rates of the disease in the United States. \nThey are continuing to monitor this issue. \nInstead, health officials seem to think it has a lot more to do with education and access. \n\u201cWe know that there\u2019s a vast unmet need for reproductive and sexual health care and education in the U.S. Too many people don\u2019t have the health care and education they need in order to keep themselves healthy, and STD rates continue to be a significant public health concern,\u201d Dr. Raegan McDonald-Mosley, chief medical officer for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told Healthline. \nThe CDC recommends that in order to bring down rising STD rates, local and national health departments must be able to disseminate and provide up-to-date information and preventive resources to patients. \nCertain population groups, including young men and women as well as gay and bisexual men, must make regular STD screening a standard part of their care. \n\u201cThe only way to know your status for sure is by getting tested,\u201d said McDonald-Mosley. \u201cPart of combatting STD rates is helping people get comfortable talking about STDs with partners, using protection, and getting tested as a normal, healthy part of a good sex life.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gigen mammoser", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "gail bolan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan mermin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcdonald-mosley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raegan mcdonald-mosley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "std prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tb prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "planned parenthood federation of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthline", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T21:50:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc73d4f02c1776bf859f3590af06ffc1caffb1ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StaZF91Aj_NM6MvnRHwsLXRrp0UfWVxsip9AKaGro2322.hfiSLjaf0_AUFY.iPZMvMF1AuuZwaoBLufU3EdZhwj9", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Too Many People Are Donating Blood After Hurricanes, Shooting", "title_full": "Too Many People Are Donating Blood After Hurricanes, Shooting", "published": "2017-10-09T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.177, "main_image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/2925-blood_donation-766x415-thumnail.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 18, "comments": 0, "shares": 18}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc73d4f02c1776bf859f3590af06ffc1caffb1ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StaZF91Aj_NM6MvnRHwsLXRrp0UfWVxsip9AKaGro2322.hfiSLjaf0_AUFY.iPZMvMF1AuuZwaoBLufU3EdZhwj9", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Written David Mills", "published": "2017-10-09T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Too Many People Are Donating Blood After Hurricanes, Shooting", "text": "Too Many People Are Donating Blood After Hurricanes, Shooting Written by David Mills on October 9, 2017 People are lining up to give blood, but officials say if you really want to help, wait a few weeks and then come in to donate. \nThere can be too much of a good thing. \nEven when it comes to donating blood.

What can agencies do to help? \nLas Vegas residents aren\u2019t the only ones grappling with the aftermath of the largest mass shooting in modern American history. \nFirst responders to the incident will themselves be at risk for a host of acute stress symptoms, including insomnia, flashbacks, and irritation. Advertisement Advertisement \nWhat they\u2019ll be reliving is the carnage left behind by a gunman who managed to kill 58 and injure more than 500 people at a Las Vegas concert in just a few minutes. \nAfter the shooting started, paramedics, police officers, and even off-duty firefighters went toward the sound of gunfire in the hopes of helping people. \nSome first responders were injured and off-duty officers were killed. Advertisement \nIn the wake of the shooting, experts warn that officers and first responders face the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). \nWhile first responders are trained to deal with a variety of threats, experts point out no one can train themselves to be immune to a mass shooting. Advertisement Advertisement Trying to save others \nMichael S. Broder, PhD, clinical psychologist, author, and former stress manager for the Philadelphia Police Department, said police officers and other first responders face additional stress because they feel they have to act to save others. \n\u201cIf you\u2019re somebody just witnessing the event, you really have yourself to worry about,\u201d Broder said. \u201cWith a cop, they have to be taking care of themselves and doing their job.\u201d \nHe said cops may feel \u201cthere\u2019s no excuse for not doing your job because you\u2019re stressed out.\u201d \nFollowing the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in December 2012 that left 26 dead, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, and the U.S. Justice Department released a report to illustrate what psychology experts and police experts have learned about how first responders can be affected by tragedies. \n\u201cNormal reactions to trauma in the first 24 to 48 hours include replaying and re-imagining the event over and over,\u201d the report authors wrote. \u201cSome officers will have insomnia or nightmares or feel like they are on an emotional roller coaster. Some may worry about what to tell their kids and spouses and then say nothing.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nAdditionally, officers can face specific pressures if they interact with families of the victims. \n\u201cOfficers who were first on the scene or who worked the crime scene should not be reassigned to support families or to conduct death notifications,\u201d the report authors wrote. \u201cThis can create potential conflicts, where officers have information about the scene that they can\u2019t share, and can intensify feelings of guilt about not being able to save a life.\u201d What issues can crop up \nEllen Kirschman, PhD,has written multiple books about first responders including \u201cCounseling Cops: What Clinicians Need to Know.\u201d Advertisement \nShe said first responders will also have to deal with the effects of the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response, where the body goes through a host of physical changes in reaction to a threat. \nThis response, which results in part from a flood of hormones, can cause \u201ctunnel vision,\u201d shaky hands, and knots in the stomach. Advertisement Advertisement \nKirschman said it can take days to get through this physical response, which can make responders more irritable in the short term. \nAdditionally, Kirschman said first responders at the scene of the shooting are at risk for acute stress responses in the immediate aftermath. \nThese stress responses \u201cmight take the form of not being able to sleep well, of having the incident replay itself over and over and over again,\u201d she explained. Advertisement \nOfficers might be \u201cvery, very self-critical over situations in which they have no control,\u201d Kirschman stressed. \n\u201cI think feeling helpless is another aspect that pops up,\u201d for first responders, Kirschman said. \u201cWhen you think that you\u2019re are supposed to be in control of a situation and you\u2019re not.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nShe said officers might also start to question religious beliefs, among other convictions. \n\u201cWhen innocent people are basically shot like fish in a barrel, that\u2019s pretty hard to get over,\u201d she explained. \u201cSometimes that causes police officers to question their belief in the goodness of people.\u201d What should agencies do? \nBroder said there are clear actions departments can take to help first responders in the immediate aftermath. \n\u201cWhen those things happen, we do debriefing where we would get the people involved in a room and talk to them \u2014 give them a safe place to air their feelings and do follow-up sessions,\u201d he said. \nBroder explained that the event was a way to check in with officers to see if anyone was exhibiting signs of distress. \n\u201cThe most important part of the debriefing group was the coffee breaks,\u201d Broder said. \nHe explained that the goal of these breaks was to reach out to each officer individually without making them feel they were on the spot in front of the group. \n\u201cA lot of these cops would not be able to talk about certain things in front of their peers,\u201d Broder said. \u201cWe would be very strategic about this with my team, and we would have coffee breaks. And we would make sure that one of us talked to just about everybody.\u201d \nKirschman said once the immediate threat is over, departments need to do \u201cpsychological first aid.\u201d \n\u201cJust check around. \u2018Who\u2019s OK? Is there somebody over there who looks like their blood pressure is going through the ceiling?\u2019\u201d she explained. \nKirschman said these events can even affect people who weren\u2019t there, like dispatchers. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t forget the dispatchers, though they weren\u2019t on scene, they were right there, listening to it all,\u201d she said. \nKirschman said even those with acute stress reactions in the aftermath of the attack will likely recover within a few weeks. She said she prefers to use the term \u201cpost-traumatic stress injury,\u201d rather than use the word \u201cdisorder.\u201d \n\u201cWe call it an injury because a disorder sounds like a life sentence,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know\u2026 that people do recover from post-traumatic stress.\u201d \nKirschman also said it\u2019s normal that some people will feel fine for months, but then feel PTSD effects later if something triggers stressful feelings. \n\u201cIf [you\u2019ve] got symptoms after 30 days, that\u2019s when you can be classified as having PTSD,\u201d she said. \nNAMI\u2019s report has a detailed list of actions departments can take to mitigate the emotional and mental stressors related to a mass casualty event. \nThese recommendations include preparing for the possibility of a large-scale event by assigning a mental health incident commander, being aware of emotional exhaustion in officers, considering setting up formal peer support networks, and creating long-term infrastructure to support officer mental health. \nKirschman said the NAMI report and other research has helped psychology experts assist first responders after a mass casualty event. \n\u201cThose of us who deal with first responders have gotten a lot better at knowing how to deal with these events psychologically,\u201d she said.

Faster Action, Learned Dosing \nSince Afrezza hit the market two years ago, it's been compared to insulin lispro (Humalog) when talking with doctors and on the research front. Now, MannKind says that's no longer the case. \n\"This is really a confidence builder for the company,\" MannKind CEO Michael Castagna told the 'Mine . \"We were always tiptoeing around the truth of this product, having to basically say 'Afrezza gets in the body faster, but doesn't work any faster.' We kept trying to tell prescribers that it's different, but couldn't clearly tell them it was a starting dose and this was different from any other insulin out there. We can do that now, to help them understand how to have conversations with patients about using Afrezza, for the starting dose and then to adjust accordingly.\" \nThe FDA based its decision on clinical trial results published earlier this year showing that dosing adjustments make Afrezza more effective, and MannKind is confident this will make it easier for docs to write prescriptions -- ultimately boosting the number of people prescribed this ultra fast-acting inhaled insulin. \nHere's what the updated label includes, specifically: Study data that describes the time-action profile by dosage strength, showing that Afrezza is in the blood within a minute and the first measurable effect hits in approximately 12 minutes; peak effects occur ~35 to 45 minutes after dosing, and a return to \"baseline\" levels comes at 1.5 to 3 hours for the largest and smallest cartridges. Description of \u201cStarting\u201d and \u201cAdjusting\u201d mealtime doses -- making it clear that patients should begin using Afrezza with a starting dose at mealtimes, and expect to make adjustments after a meal with follow-up dosing. Use in Specific Populations: The Pregnancy and Lactation sections of the label have been updated to conform to the current FDA label guidance, giving healthcare providers clearer risk-benefit information for these populations. \n\"So if you normally took an 8-unit dose of Novolog, you would start with 8 units of Afrezza and then titrate upward, depending on results. If you ate a bagel and coffee, and saw that the 8 units wasn't enough, you'd adjust with another 4-unit cartridge and make a note that next time you need 12 units of Afrezza to cover that,\" Castagna explains. \"Because there is now documented evidence that Afrezza is out of the system within 1.5 hours, if your BG is still going up after that, you know you need another dose.\" \n\"It comes down to a fear of the unknown and understanding this is not a 1-to-1 unit conversion, but a different way of titrating insulin from injected or subcutaneous insulin,\" Castagna adds. \"Doctors have been able to push back (on the traditional mindset) but we haven't been able to fully explain this until now.\" \nMannKind says it's making sure sales reps have the revised info and updated marketing materials, to take that into clinics as the final months of the year roll on. No Hypo or Ultra Labels \nWhat the new labeling does NOT address is Afrezza's reported advantage in reducing hypoglycemia, or the fact that it outperforms Novo's newly approved Fiasp insulin in terms of rapid action. \nDespite having clinical data showing a reduction in hypos using Afrezza, MannKind did not even bother asking FDA if they could include that info in new labeling. Why? \n\"This label change was all about dosage and PK data ( pharmacokinetic, i.e. curve of insulin action), not hypoglycemia, for one thing. And the FDA does not see safety data as a marketing point,\" Castagna explains, adding that the regulatory agency no longer allows competitive data in labeling anyway, as they once did. \nMeanwhile, data also shows that the new competing subcutaneous insulin Fiasp begins its first action within 17-20 minutes, peaks at two hours, and remains in the system for five hours at least. By comparison, Afrezza shows first action at 3-7 minutes, peaks in 30-45 minutes, and is out of the system within 1.5 to 3 hours depending on the dose, Castagna says. But he says FDA only allowed the Afrezza label to note that first measurable effects begin at the 12-minute mark, because the clamps used to measure this in studies have difficulty with accuracy at lower intervals. \nStill, given the super-rapid course of action, MannKind did ask FDA for permission to label Afrezza as \"Ultra\" fast-acting. But regulators declined that because they are not prepared to create a whole new product category at this time. \"What qualifies as 'ultra'? We'd need consensus on a definition. And what\u2019s the purpose? We knew it was longshot, but we thought we'd try anyway. This will take some work with FDA and the industry at large if we want to pursue that designation,\" Castagna says. Prescription Woes for Afrezza \nNo one seems to disagree with a basic fact: Doctors are not widely prescribing Afrezza, and most people with diabetes (PWDs) haven't even heard of it. And a good chunk of those who do know about this inhaled insulin have concerns about it. \nTo date, MannKind says it has roughly 15,000 prescribers across the U.S. and more than 10,000 people have tried Afrezza. But a majority have decided to not continue using it -- something this starting and adjustment dosing mentality can help address. It's expected to help patients experience better real-world effect on blood sugars, and thus quality of life and A1C. \nInterestingly, this video points out why that may be the case; it makes the fascinating analogy that doctors attempting to teach Afrezza is like trying to teach patients how to ride a bike. Some PWDs may need training wheels and some may need escorting before they're eventually ready to let go and ride the bike on their own. \nIn an investor call on Oct. 3, Castagna was quite excited about the new label change. He described it as a \"pivotal moment\" in the company's history, and also noted that prescription totals leading up to that label change had just hit the highest number per week than ever before. \nNote that the FDA kept the Afrezza label's safety warning, advising that bronchospasms have been observed in certain patients who have asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and they kept intact a requirement that patients get a spirometry lung test before they can start on the inhaled insulin. This has been a concern for some exploring Afrezza, and some doctors have indicated that worries about potential lung effects are behind their hesitancy prescribing the medication. \nWhile that wasn't a part of the FDA label change here, Castagna said on the investor call that MannKind would like to work with the regulatory agency in the future to possibly revise or optionally include that information. But that's all TBD down the road. \nStill, in just the first few days following the Afrezza label change announcement, calls inquiring about the product were supposedly higher than they had been. MannKind's stock also shot up by 45% in those first days to levels it hasn't seen before. Observers noted that this new stock energy, combined with the label change, could help the company turnaround. \nWhether that will really materialize is anyone's guess at this point. Endos Say... \nWe reached out to several providers across the U.S. who have experience with Afrezza, either as prescribers or having used this inhaled insulin themselves. While some agree that the label changes will help them and patients, others wondered whether doctors will really start flocking to Afrezza just based on this relatively minor change. \nA theme we heard across the board is that the revised labeling still doesn't address their biggest issues with Afrezza: the 'Ultra' fast aspect that it starts working and is out of the system in unprecedented time , and the reduction in hypoglycemia risk. \nDr. George Grunberger of the Grunberger Diabetes Institute in Michigan: Noted that he likes the visual table to figure out the initial dosing, and that's a positive he sees from the label revision. But he wasn't 100% sure if it would help more doctors prescribe it. \n\"I saw this update, but am not sure how it would influence existing prescribers or recruiting new ones,\" he said. \"There is no specific guidance for dose titration, so I'm not sure how that would help the 'amateur' prescribers.\" \nDr. Michael Bush, clinical chief for the endocrinology division at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in LA: Hadn\u2019t heard about the label change in the initial days it was announced \u2013 something that he believes speaks to the overall lack of awareness about Afrezza in both the patient and prescriber community. He has roughly 10 patients on Afrezza, including one T2 physician. But in talking with other physicians, he doesn\u2019t believe many have even a handful of patients on the inhaled insulin. He also isn\u2019t sure what this label change may mean in helping that problem. \n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s painting a slightly different picture for Afrezza, but this is not a breakthrough in doing what\u2019s needed for physician or patient awareness,\u201d he said, noting that one of the most influential marketing tactics could be for MannKind to piggyback onto Novo Nordisk\u2019s promotions for the now-approved Fiasp \u2013 as far as how the two compare on the fast-action front. \nDr. Steve Edelman at Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Diego, CA: \"In my experience going around the country talking to patients and providers\u2026 most HCPs do not know much about Afrezza. At our TCOYD conferences, most patients have not heard of it. I am now emailing a participant who really wants it, as he is a cop and really would appreciate the route of administration but also the rapid-off. The new label should help.\" \nDr. Tricia Santos Cavaiola at University of California, San Diego Health: \"I think the new label is great, but I'm not sure how much it will help. Part of the problem is that most still think of the main benefit as having less injections and miss the real benefit of rapid on/rapid off. The real issue is getting enough patients and providers excited or knowledgeable to go read the label in the first place... then everyone would see how great it is.\" \nDr. Jeremy Pettus, also at University of California, San Diego: \"In my opinion, the new dosing guidelines are a little better but still don\u2019t address the major gaps in knowledge and won\u2019t really help move the needle in terms of getting more providers to use it. Lots more to say, but that\u2019s the bottom line! The dosing needs to be adjusted (with better unit-to-unit conversion), the timing needs to be clarified relative to a meal, and the need for several doses for most meals\u2026 That should all be a part of it.\" \nGary Scheiner, a CDE in Pennsylvania who lives with T1D himself: \"The new labeling will definitely help, particularly since the old label included ineffective methods for dosage titration and failed to key in fully on the single most beneficial element of the product: SPEED. The new labeling will certainly support improving postprandial glucose management, and it will allow MannKind to promote the product in better ways and shorten the learning curve for those who start on it.\" The Future for Afrezza (?) \nWith recent news of Novo's Fiasp approval helping MannKind compare the fast action of both insulins, and with both Dexcom CGM and the newly-approved Abbott FreeStyle Libre allowing more real-time data comparison, Castagna sees this as an especially exciting time for this Afrezza label change to happen. \n\"It's important for us,\" he says. \"While it may seem simple on the surface, I would highlight that just being able to understand what a 4-unit cartridge does... is key. It's the first time a doctor will be able to really see and understand, and that's really important when you think of your child or loved one going to bed, and not seeing nocturnal hypoglycemia or sugars running high. To be able to know your sugars will comfortably come down over a certain period of time is really important. We think that's critical as we go forward.\" \nAside from these label changes, MannKind says it also recently dosed its first pediatric patient in the clinical trials setting (in collaboration with JDRF ), and is exploring a 2-unit cartridge as a possibility for kids down the road. The company also just filed for regulatory approval in Brazil, as the first international country to start selling this inhaled insulin globally. \nImportantly, MannKind also said it's continuing conversations with payers for increased access, and the company expects this label change to help motivate more payers to put Afrezza on the formulary for patients. Improved access will be a crucial step in all of this, Castagna says. \nWe're happy to hear of this progress for MannKind, and hope for the best on everything related to Afrezza. This product works well for us (both 'Mine editor AmyT and I myself use it), and we certainly continue keeping our fingers crossed that Afrezza becomes an option for anyone who wants it. Whether this label change is really the trigger remains to be seen. \nThe long inhale continues in the story of Afrezza , but things are looking positive at the moment.

Advertisement Advertisement \nDrug makers had attempted to block the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation law targeting extreme increases in generic drug prices. \nThe ruling adds Maryland to a growing number of states taking action against high drug prices, as Congress lags behind with similar proposed legislation. \nThe Maryland law, which took effect on October 1, enables the state attorney general to sue makers of generic or off-patent drugs for an \u201cunconscionable\u201d price increase, one that isn\u2019t justified by the cost of making or distributing the drug. Advertisement \nManufacturers could be fined up to $10,000 for each violation or be required to roll back price increases. \nThe attorney general\u2019s office will also be able to request information from companies to help determine if there is evidence of \u201cprice gouging.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nThe Association for Accessible Medicines, a drug industry trade group, had filed a lawsuit arguing that the Maryland law is unconstitutional because it doesn\u2019t define \u201cprice gouging\u201d and would allow the state to intervene in interstate commerce. \nU.S. District Judge Marvin Garbis denied the association\u2019s request for an injunction. \nBut he allowed the lawsuit to move forward based solely on the association\u2019s claims that the law is vague. However, he dismissed the other arguments. Drug prices rising \nEven if the Maryland law is found to be unconstitutional, it\u2019s unlikely to slow down the rising concerns about the high cost of prescription drugs. \nA 2016 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 77 percent of Americans surveyed said the cost of prescription drugs is \u201cunreasonable.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nThere\u2019s good reason for consumers\u2019 concerns. \nPrescription drug spending in the United States rose sharply in 2014, according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). \nPrice increases were steeper among new specialty drugs, such as those for cancer and hepatitis C. Advertisement \nThere have also been several recent cases of extreme price hikes by Turing Pharmaceuticals, Marathon Pharmaceuticals, and other companies. Action being taken \nAlthough Maryland is the first state to target price gouging, other states have already taken action on the high cost of prescription drugs. Advertisement Advertisement \nAccording to a report released in August by the Yale Global Health Justice Partnership, more than 30 states have introduced more than 80 pharmaceutical drug pricing bills. \nOne of these is a law signed in June by Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval. The law requires pharmaceutical companies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to justify any significant increases in the price of diabetes drugs. \nThis includes disclosing the costs of producing and marketing the drug, as well as rebates given to the PBMs by drug companies. Advertisement \nSupporters of the law point out that these rebate savings may not always be passed on to consumers. \nConnecticut\u2019s Governor Dannel P. Malloy also signed a law this year that supporters hope will reduce prescription drug costs. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe law bans \u201cgag clauses\u201d in PMB contracts that prevent pharmacists from telling consumers that they can save money by opting for a generic drug. \nThose drugs sometimes cost less than the copay for a covered brand-name drug. Congress makes some progress \nAs states move forward with legislation to tackle drug prices, Congress seems to be lagging behind, although there has been some recent movement. \nOne bill that is before Congress right now is the bipartisan Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples (CREATES) Act . \nThe bill would increase competition by removing roadblocks to the development of lower-cost generic drugs. \n\u201cGenerics are indisputably a real solution to out-of-control prescription drug prices,\u201d Will Holley, spokesperson for The Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing, told Healthline. \nA report by the IMS Institute found that oral generic drugs cost 80 percent less than the brands they replace within five years of being introduced. \nAdvocacy groups have accused pharmaceutical companies of using anti-competitive practices to keep these cheaper alternatives out of the market. \nAnother bipartisan bill \u2014 the FAIR Drug Pricing Act \u2014 introduced earlier this year in the House and Senate attempts to address price transparency. \nIt would require drug companies to disclose planned price increases, including research and development costs. \nHolley also pointed to the need for other kinds of price transparency \u2014 such as \u201chow much of the research that went into a new drug was funded by taxpayers.\u201d \nPatients for Affordable Drugs estimates that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) spent more than $200 million on basic research on CAR-T therapies, in which a patient\u2019s immune cells are genetically engineered to go after cancer. \nIn an interview with The Atlantic, the advocacy group\u2019s David Mitchell argued that drug companies developed their drugs using this government-funded science. \nThis includes Novartis, developer of Kymriah, a treatment for children with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) \u2014 which has a price tag of $475,000 . \nMany of the state efforts are facing legal challenges. It remains to be seen how drug price legislation will fare in a highly bipartisan Congress. \nBut price transparency will likely play an important role in keeping drug prices in check. \n\u201cThere are no silver bullets to high drug prices,\u201d said Holley, \u201cbut transparency provides information that allows consumers, providers, and payers to make more informed decisions.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shawn radcliffe", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "maryla", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brian sandoval", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "will holley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dannel p. malloy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marvin garbis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yale global health justice partnership", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaiser family foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "association for accessible medicines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american medical association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ims institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institutes of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nih", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turing pharmaceuticals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novartis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marathon pharmaceuticals", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kymriah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T21:25:57.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3fbdd6bee63e89d2ae9684a13c0ee3302eddb080", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4Stabgfs3H3eE9EN2N_7dyuGKu9ZRKYR0Fl9nwl_Ew8j0zAOizU.RAmwYS2F4bZ8_WQyG39Q.Io0tn0rRFI4nLOlng", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "The Cancer-Causing Chemical Probably in Your Drinking Water", "title_full": "The Cancer-Causing Chemical Probably in Your Drinking Water", "published": "2017-10-10T01:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.268, "main_image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/cancer/2849-child_drink_water-766x415-thumnail.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 64, "comments": 0, "shares": 64}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 15}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3fbdd6bee63e89d2ae9684a13c0ee3302eddb080", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4Stabgfs3H3eE9EN2N_7dyuGKu9ZRKYR0Fl9nwl_Ew8j0zAOizU.RAmwYS2F4bZ8_WQyG39Q.Io0tn0rRFI4nLOlng", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Written Gigen Mammoser", "published": "2017-10-10T01:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Cancer-Causing Chemical Probably in Your Drinking Water", "text": "The Cancer-Causing Chemical Probably in Your Drinking Water Written by Gigen Mammoser on October 9, 2017 Researchers are starting to focus on dioxane, a potential carcinogen that\u2019s starting to show up in tests of tap water. \nYou probably haven\u2019t heard of the chemical dioxane. \nBut there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve been drinking it. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe chemical, 1,4-dioxane, is an industrial solvent used in the production and manufacturing of a whole range of common products, including cosmetics, varnishes, dyes, and detergents. \nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies the chemical as \u201clikely to be carcinogenic in humans.\u201d \nAnd it\u2019s found its way into water supplies in the United States. Advertisement \nAccording to a report released last month by the Environmental Working Group , a nonpartisan advocacy group, dioxane was found in tap water samples that affect 90 million Americans in 45 states. \nIn August, the New York State Department of Health passed legislation requiring all water systems, regardless of size, to begin testing for dioxane . Advertisement Advertisement \nNew York joins a handful of other states, including New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, that have established dioxane tolerance standards in water. \nThere\u2019s currently no federal standard for dioxane levels in water. Regulating water quality \nDioxane is one of many contaminants that the EPA has been monitoring since the mid-1990s. But the agency has yet to regulate it. \nThe 1996 amendment of the Safe Drinking Water Act introduced the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR). It requires the EPA to monitor a list of no more than 30 unregulated contaminants in water. \nBased on its findings, the EPA uses data and survey information from the UCMR to make regulatory decisions about potentially harmful contaminants. Advertisement Advertisement \nSo far, dioxane hasn\u2019t been directly linked to any major health events in the United States. \nThere also hasn\u2019t been any \u201csmoking gun\u201d incident in which a group, community, or water system contaminated with dioxane resulted in people getting seriously ill. A spotlight now on dioxane \nSo, why are people starting to pay attention to dioxane now? Advertisement \n\u201cTo the best of my knowledge, it\u2019s not that people have gotten sick from 1,4-dioxane,\u201d Wendy Heiger-Bernays, PhD, a professor of environmental health at Boston University, told Healthline. \u201cThe reason why these things start to get looked for is because people start to measure them.\u201d \n\u201cThis has been going on for many, many years, but it wasn\u2019t until our analytical tools got good enough to be able to detect 1,4-dioxane at fairly low levels,\u201d she explained. Advertisement Advertisement \nDioxane has previously been detected in high concentrations in and around landfills. That\u2019s because it\u2019s common in so many different products that it tends to accumulate in areas filled with garbage. \nAmong other things, dioxane is a byproduct of sodium laureth sulfate, a foaming agent found in shampoo, soap, detergent, and toothpaste. \nIt\u2019s also water-soluble and can travel rapidly through soil to permeate groundwater supplies. Advertisement The possible effects of dioxane \nAs far as a public health risk and a toxicity threshold in water, there still needs to be more research. \nHowever, dioxane is known to affect the liver and kidneys. It\u2019s also been identified as a probable carcinogen .

EPA priorities \nDespite the attention dioxane has received in recent months, federal regulation of the chemical may not be a priority under the current administration. \nMichael Dourson, President Trump\u2019s nominee for the EPA\u2019s chemical safety office, has been accused of downplaying the risks of some chemical contaminants. \nDioxane in particular has already been brought up in testimony between Dourson and Democratic senators. \nIn a tense exchange, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) stated that Dourson\u2019s proposed level of acceptability for dioxane was thousands of times higher than EPA levels. \nFor dioxane and the other chemicals included on the UCMR, additional EPA regulation can be tricky, requiring additional money, monitoring, and resources. \nHowever, according to Heiger-Bernays, we\u2019ll inevitably begin to find new and different chemical contaminants in our water supplies. \n\u201cPeople are unaware that many of these chemicals that are being found are unregulated, although they are in our water supply,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really need a comprehensive way of looking at water and doing a better job of screening what\u2019s in the water and then figuring out what are the priorities for regulation.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T00:10:14.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2fa45102d3d70b5cffc27bf42368f3821887d8ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StaYAYvRMdexFLuzrfOIx38.ClYSggyqW0noM.2mqeLF4atlnHcvZNCZD", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "How Dirty Is Your Office Kitchen?", "title_full": "How Dirty Is Your Office Kitchen?", "published": "2017-10-09T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.735, "main_image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/2846-Office_Kitchen-766x415-thumnail.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 9, "comments": 0, "shares": 9}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 7}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2fa45102d3d70b5cffc27bf42368f3821887d8ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StaYAYvRMdexFLuzrfOIx38.ClYSggyqW0noM.2mqeLF4atlnHcvZNCZD", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Written Elizabeth Pratt", "published": "2017-10-09T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Dirty Is Your Office Kitchen?", "text": "How Dirty Is Your Office Kitchen? Written by Elizabeth Pratt on October 9, 2017 Researchers say there are 500 forms of bacteria that can travel to 50 percent of your office in just four hours. \nDo you avoid your office kitchen? \nWipe down the toilet seat in the office bathroom? Advertisement \nShudder when your colleague sneezes? \nSome may call you a hypochondriac, but your fears may in fact be justified. \nIt turns out our offices are full of bacteria. Advertisement \nA 2012 study that examined offices in Tucson, New York, and San Francisco found that there were 500 forms of bacteria in the average office environment. \nAnd that bacteria travels fast. Advertisement Advertisement \nA 2014 study that examined the spread of viruses in workplace settings, found that the germs from a single sick individual had spread to 50 percent of surfaces and employees within four hours. \n\u201cWe conducted a study in the workplace because we know this is a site where many people continue to come to work even when they're sick,\u201d Kelly Reynolds, PhD, associate professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Arizona and lead author of the study, told Healthline. \n\u201cWorkplace environments typically include numerous sites where people congregate, such as in the shared kitchen, shared copy room, bathrooms, and shared conference rooms. These shared sites act as central germ transfer stations. As workers move about the office and touch surfaces they leave behind germs picked up along the way.\u201d \nAccording to Reynolds, adults can touch up to 300 surfaces per hour making the spread of germs in the workplace an almost inevitable reality. Norovirus dangers \nNorovirus is the most common cause of severe gastroenteritis in the United States. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that norovirus causes about 20 million acute cases of gastroenteritis every year. \nThose illnesses lead to nearly 2 million outpatient visits and 400,000 emergency department visits per year. \nCharles Gerba, PhD, a professor of microbiology and environmental sciences at the University of Arizona, has spent decades studying germs. Advertisement \nIn 2014, he conducted a study to see how easily norovirus was able to spread in an office environment. \nGerba and his colleagues used a bacteriophage (a virus that infects other bacteria but not humans) called MS-2. MS-2 is similar in size, shape, and resistance to disinfectant, as the norovirus. Advertisement Advertisement \nAt the start of the day it was placed on commonly touched surfaces within an office building such as doorknobs and tabletops. \nWithin just two to four hours, 40 to 60 percent of other surfaces in the office were contaminated with the virus. \nBut Gerba says use of basic hygiene practices could help curb the spread of germs and he, himself isn\u2019t worried. Advertisement \n\u201cSince doing the work on germ movement in offices and interventions to reduce the spread of germs in this environment, I feel confident that I can easily significantly reduce my risks. Just use of a hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes can reduce your risk of infection by up to 80 percent,\u201d he told Healthline. \nIn the industrialized world, millions of people spend around 90 percent of their time indoors and Gerba says the pressure to come to work even when ill is only making things worse. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cWork has changed so much in the 21st century. We spend more time indoors than any generation in history, and more of us work in offices than ever before,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring the cold season we have found that one-third of the surfaces in an office will have the cold virus on it. One of the major problems is many people come to work ill, especially with colds, and spread it around the office. This is called presenteeism, which has a significant impact on office productivity. It is now believed that presenteeism costs companies more in lost productively than absenteeism.\u201d Where the germs are located \nAs for the germ hotspots in the office, the areas with the most germs may surprise you. \nThe bathroom is among the cleanest places in the office. \n\u201cThe toilet seat germ-wise is usually the cleanest object in a restroom because so many people (48 percent of American women) will wipe it or place toilet paper on it before use. Also, disinfectants are usually used by cleaning crews on the toilet seat,\u201d Gerba said. \nIf you\u2019ve ever used your sleeve or a hand towel to open the bathroom door after washing your hands you can probably skip that. \nGerba\u2019s studies have found at least 70 percent of people wash their hands in the restroom. The handle on the outside of the door actually holds more germs than the handle inside the bathroom. \nAreas you should watch out for are where you may be spending the bulk of your time. \n\u201cHot spots in the office are in order: desk phones, desktops, computer keyboards, computer mouse, and photocopier buttons. I do not think most people clean their desktops till they stick to them,\u201d Gerba said. \nThings aren\u2019t much better where you prepare lunch or grab a cup of coffee. \n\u201cThe coffee pot handle in a shared kitchen was the most commonly contaminated site. Refrigerator and microwave handles were also hot spots,\u201d Reynolds told Healthline. \nBut Reynolds and Gerba say there\u2019s no need to panic or vow to never enter your office kitchen again. \n\u201cMost of the cold, flu, and diarrhea-causing organisms likely to spread in the workplace do not cause serious illness, but a few simple practices can significantly reduce your chances of getting ill,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cWe should not be fearful, just more aware of the control we do have for improved health.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "elizabeth pratt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "charles gerba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reynolds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly reynolds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerba", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of arizona", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tucson", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T00:10:15.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b79a56c4f363a5115d1fe59e843b88a9813b94d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StaYTq4bn8pqu0joTNoDsNP3qObTdxGWpUnHxkyYjFOzlpQeONYgSR2iM1zKs.Ku.NiRmi6JIZPqxjQbG.8jQqD4wLQ.VJggIg3t22h41Z89kxg--", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/original_posts/index.xml", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Huffington Post", "title": "I Slept On The Floor For 2 Weeks -- Now My Husband And I Can\u2019t Share A Bed", "title_full": "I Slept On The Floor For 2 Weeks -- Now My Husband And I Can\u2019t Share A Bed", "published": "2017-10-11T03:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dd6b652000000c3408628c.jpg?ops=1910_1000", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 38, "comments": 0, "shares": 38}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b79a56c4f363a5115d1fe59e843b88a9813b94d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StaYTq4bn8pqu0joTNoDsNP3qObTdxGWpUnHxkyYjFOzlpQeONYgSR2iM1zKs.Ku.NiRmi6JIZPqxjQbG.8jQqD4wLQ.VJggIg3t22h41Z89kxg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Healthline", "published": "2017-10-11T03:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "I Slept On The Floor For 2 Weeks -- Now My Husband And I Can\u2019t Share A Bed", "text": "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you. EDITION Healthline , Contributor We want to be your most trusted ally in pursuit of health and well-being. I Slept On The Floor For 2 Weeks -- Now My Husband And I Can\u2019t Share A Bed My initial approach to floor sleeping was entered with trepidation and skepticism, but after two weeks I\u2019m a believer. 10/10/2017 09:03 pm   \nThis article was originally published on Healthline.com . \nFor a while, my sleep has really sucked. \nI\u2019ve been waking up groggy and in pain. Ask my why, and I\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m not sleeping well. Obviously, you say. But rather than dish out a small fortune for the latest \u201csmart\u201d mattress or set of pillows, I wanted to see if there was a road less traveled in the world of sleep. \nIn my quest for a solution to my insomnia and aches and pains, I searched online to find numerous results on the topic of floor sleeping. While there\u2019s little to no scientific evidence that points to improved sleep from sleeping on the floor, there are some cultures that prefer the hard ground over the plush mattresses of the West. \nDo they know something we don\u2019t? Desperate for a solution, I wanted to find out. So, I decided to try crashing on the floor for two weeks and journal my slumber results \u2014 without my husband, unfortunately. But, hey, a girl\u2019s gotta sleep. \nNight 1: A hard adjustment \nMentally, my first night felt closer to a slumber party than a school night. Following a technique that I found online, I positioned myself flat on my back with my knees slightly bent. I normally sleep in the fetal position, so it was a challenge. \nI\u2019m not going to sugarcoat it: My first night of sleep was horrible. But, what struck me as odd was in spite of a sore shoulder, I did get some solid REM sleep. This tells me that while my body might\u2019ve physically taken a hit, my mind didn\u2019t. \nEmotionally, I was off to a good start. Physically, there was (a lot) of room for improvement. \nIt\u2019s worth noting that I had a dream so vivid that it haunted me the entire next morning. I dreamed that I bought a used van from a carpeted outdoor dealership. Maybe my subconscious was begging for a return to my cushiony mattress? \nNight 2 and 3: Rolling into it \nI shared my sleep experiment with my co-workers the next morning, capturing the interest of a fellow back-sleeper and sleep-sufferer. They offered a very helpful tip (outside of abandoning my experiment altogether): Try using a foam roller or stick to help loosen any muscles in my lower and upper shoulder muscles. \nBefore I crawled into my makeshift bed, I took a foam roller up and down my lower back over and over again for about five minutes. Like a good massage or chiropractic adjustment, my body and mind felt relaxed and in sync enough to go to sleep. I followed the same nightly routine the next night, hoping I might be able to finally realize the benefits of sleeping on your back . \nHowever, the rest of my body refused to cooperate. I woke up with horrendous shoulder pain and what can be best described as purgatory for people caught between fetal and back-sleeping positions. To date, it was the worst night of sleep so far. \nNight 4: Dreaming of better sleep \nThe plan was to sleep in past 6 a.m., so I didn\u2019t stress too much about an earlier bedtime. My shoulder pain was a bit better after going to town with a foam roller earlier in the day. \nI also was able to stay on my back throughout the night, but my knees were still not bent long enough for the support needed. On the plus side, my dream cycle didn\u2019t disappoint, and I experienced more vivid dreams. \nNight 5 and 6: Sleep, no sleep \nZero trouble falling asleep on night five, but staying asleep was a bit harder. I did have a few glasses of vino at my husband\u2019s birthday party, so that might\u2019ve been the culprit. Still, I did wake feeling rested. My neck and back were slightly less stiff, but not enough to rave about. \nThe next night was more disappointing. I couldn\u2019t get into a comfortable position. I used my trusty roller to loosen up my lower lumbar region of my back, and that did the trick. I slept through the night and woke up with minimal issues, although my REM sleep did taper off a bit. \nNight 7: Still dreaming of better sleep \nI was out like a light until 2 a.m. when a series of very vivid nightmares played out. I guess my lucid dreams are a double-edged sword. All the tossing and turning took a bit of toll on my body. One week in, and I\u2019m still adjusting. But Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day, right? \nNight 8 and 9: Don\u2019t mind the nerves \nMake no mistake: No amount of sleeping on the floor is going to curb your anxiety. I had a big presentation at work the following morning, and in spite of having a back that felt great and nearly accustomed to floor sleeping, I could not fall asleep. \nMy anxiety also messed up the great REM sleep that I\u2019d been experiencing. The next night, I was so exhausted from the prior night from hell, that I had no trouble rolling onto my back and drifting to slumber land. I slept so hard that I didn\u2019t hear my alarm clock for the first few minutes it\u2019d been going off. \nNight 10: We\u2019re getting there \nFor the first time, I actually trust that I\u2019ll get a good night\u2019s sleep on the floor. After getting some much-needed rest after a whirlwind weekend, I woke from my floor palette feeling amazing with no shoulder or back pain. Should I start redecorating my bedroom for a sans-mattress look? \nNight 11, 12, and 13: Beddy-bye \nI twisted my back while lifting weights earlier in the day. Before I could even think about sleeping, I had to spend some time using my foam roller on my back. I did wake feeling rested, and while my back was sore, it wasn\u2019t painful. Victory! \nI did the same the next day, feeling doubly sure I wouldn\u2019t have any issues. As planned, I got plenty of rest and was ready to take on the day. \nAs night 13 rolls around, I can honestly say I\u2019m enjoying my new routine. As I enjoy another night of solid slumber, I don\u2019t even miss my mattress. As night 13 rolls around, I can honestly say I\u2019m enjoying my new routine. \nNight 14: New routine, renewed woman \nMy last night of sleep was one for the books. I slept soundly and awoke feeling refreshed. Despite the first rocky week, I don\u2019t think I can sleep anywhere else but the floor at this point. I might be a changed woman. \nTakeaway \nI have to admit that my initial approach to floor sleeping was entered with trepidation and skepticism, but after two weeks I\u2019m a believer. \nSurprisingly, my biggest takeaway was the deep sleep I experienced coupled with lucid dreams that lingered past breakfast into lunch. Whether it\u2019s the floor, new sleeping position, or both, this new routine helped me get better, deeper sleep and wake up more rested. \nWith the experiment over and being less than thrilled about ditching the mattress for the floor, my husband asked me to back to bed. So, I went back to my old routine for a week\u2026 And then the back and neck pain hit. It was so bad that the only place I found relief was on the floor. Sorry, husband, I\u2019m back to full-time floor sleeping. Remember: Happy wife, happy life. \nBefore starting any new health routine, please consult your physician first. \nAngela Cavallari Walker is a writer, mom, runner, and wannabe foodie who hates onions.

Fortunately, Mandy continues her own advocacy both personally and professionally, and today we're excited to share an interview delving into her story and what she has on tap these days. \nQ&A with Diabetes Advocate Mandy Jones \nDM) OK Mandy, first hit us with your diagnosis story please... \nMJ) I was a senior at U.C. Berkeley when I was diagnosed, about five years ago. Surprisingly, my first reaction was relief \u2014 I finally had an answer to why I had been feeling lethargic, sluggish, and not myself. After the first six months, I understood the basic science, but mentally things began to intensify. As a young adult, I was now living in San Francisco working my first (remote) full-time job. I didn\u2019t have a strong familial support network close by, and only a few scattered college friends remained in the area. For the first time in my life, I felt alone. I had always prided myself on being an adventurer, a solo feminist who could tackle any challenge by herself. But now, even a bike ride across town was scary and made me re-evaluate how close I\u2019d be to death with the wrong calculation of insulin. \nWhoa, and did you find support? \nI dove into diabetes meet-ups and support groups, but while my peers remembered teenage annoyance of their parents\u2019 anxiety, my journey was completely different -- burdened with all of my own anxiety from figuring out everything on my own. Between phone calls to insurance companies, visits to poorly-trained doctors, and an internal rollercoaster of emotions, no one seemed to understand my journey or have good answers for me. Everyone kept asking \u201chow are your numbers? What\u2019s that device your using?\u201d But the medical, logistical and mathematical questions seemed to miss 95% of life with diabetes. \nThe healthcare system was guided by the wrong signposts, inefficient where it was working, and its impersonality normalized. Those emotionally and mentally challenging experiences my first few years ignited my passion for improving the healthcare space and drove me to where I am today. I now view my diagnosis as one of the best things that ever happened to me. I learned how to tune in to my body, have a greater awareness of myself, meet fantastic people in the diabetes community, change to a career I am extremely passionate about, and understand greater depths of myself and the world. \nSo you began to work in diabetes professionally? \nYes, I worked as the Director of Advocacy for the non-profit Diabetes Hands Foundation (DHF), from February 2016 to May 2017. I helped them create a strategy to re-build the Diabetes Advocates program. I wore many hats in that role -- helping with landscape research, program design, grant preparation, building partnerships, website development, and project management. For me, the most exciting part of that work was having a vision for MasterLab Leadership Institute and turning it into reality. People with diabetes are inherently the \"experts\" on the daily challenges that members of their community face -- whether related to education, access, or support -- and are best-suited to be grassroots leaders, implementing solutions that are in-tune with needs. We had a really special, awesome weekend . \nAnd what do you do for a living now? \nAs a strategic consultant, I now work with organizations in the healthcare, diabetes, and patient advocacy space, helping them design and launch programs that improve the healthcare experience -- from the patient perspective. \nCurrently, I am helping PatientWidsom understand the landscape of online health communities, identify strategic non-profit partnerships, and pilot new product delivery. Have you ever been to a doctor's appointment where you felt like an A1C statistic, rather than a human allowed to ask questions and make decisions about your own care? PatientWisdom has designed a digital platform that focuses on what matters to patients as people, recognizing that we are experts on our own life. After sharing stories about yourself, your health, and your care, PatientWisdom shares what's important with your healthcare team to make the most of the visit. PatientWisdom turns the \"soft stuff\" into actionable insights for healthcare providers, to understand what we patients want and need. \nWhat did you learn about advocacy during your time with DHF? \nWhew, quite a lot, but I'll try to package it up... \nThe challenge with learning more is that with every realization comes an ever-growing conceptualization of how much we don't know... \"The more you know, the more you realize you don't know\" syndrome. As I've started to peel back the layers of healthcare, I've come to recognize it as its own industrial complex with historical forces at play, realizing how much more complex the system is . \nAs far as advocacy, there's a big spectrum that includes a lot of issues that people are fighting for depending on their perspective. At one end, advocacy includes the development of new technologies and fighting for insurance coverage. We as patients have a right to have scientific efforts put towards our struggles, and compared to advances on iPhones and mobile apps, our technology is antiquated. That's a needed fight. \nOn the other end of the spectrum, advocacy includes ensuring that everyone has access to really basic care, test strips and insulin. Many countries, many communities, and many people struggle with lack of funds, insurance coverage, or access to supplies due to a myriad of socio and political issues. We as patients have a right to basic care and a right to live. That's also a needed fight. It's hard to feel the need to \"pick one issue\" as a means of banding together, because it feels then that we are giving up on other important things, and letting go of the healthy utopia we strive for. So we have two ends of this continuum being pushed forward. But the reality of the situation is that there is a shortage of advocates and leaders... not just in lobbying, but in other types of change-making as well. \nWhat specific diabetes activities and advocacy are you involved with? \nI am passionate about making life with diabetes easier for PWDs and their families, by providing decision-making support, help to navigate a complex healthcare world, and social support. I want to help empower PWDs to know their rights at the doctor\u2019s office, and to make informed healthcare decisions to ensure the care that is best for their lifestyle. \nI am also passionate about connecting diabetes advocates with the resources they need to effectively become leaders, improving the diabetes space. In 2017, I designed MasterLab Leadership Institute for DHF, an intensive, exciting, weekend conference featuring expert mentorship, leadership development, and social entrepreneurship workshops to support leaders implementing positive changes for the greater diabetes community. \nCould this work have implications for causes beyond diabetes? \nCertainly. With everything that's happened politically this year, it's also very clear that there is a long list of other worthy causes OUTSIDE of healthcare, and we're all spread thin. We aren't unlimited fountains of \"fight\" and we have to recognize that and get smart to prevent burnout. The upside of everything is that technology makes democracy easier and easier and traditional power dynamics are starting to shift. From my point of view, there is so much overlap between the diabetes community and other chronic disease communities -- and we're all fighting for the same base principles. My hope is that advances in civic tech will enable us to connect easier, see our commonalities quicker, and mobilize as a united force more efficiently. \nWhat's next for you then? Something outside the diabetes world? \nI am currently sketching out ideas for my next \"side project.\" To be honest, with everything that's been happening with the current administration and healthcare, it's shifted my perspective on priorities and needs within our community. I just got accepted to a Los Angeles-based mentoring program, the Women's Accelerator Network. I will be paired with a female mentor for the course of 8 months, and plan to use that time and her expertise to refine my \"personal mission\" and goals for my work in the healthcare system. I definitely want to connect with other advocates in the space and brainstorm ways to impact the space moving forward; the DiabetesMine Innovation Summit will be a perfect place for some of those discussions! \nWhat gets you excited or disappoints you as to diabetes innovations? \nDevelopment of the DIYPS ( Do It Yourself Pancreas System by Dana Lewis and Scott Leibrand ). Upon my diagnosis, I wondered why we weren't harnessing computing power to calculate and respond to blood sugar fluctuations, and why we as patients had to do complex mathematical calculations in our head, with extreme inaccuracy. It's inspiring to see this work come out of a patient-centered movement, that's working independently, without funding, and sits within the larger \"maker\" and \"open source\" movements with an emphasis on access for all. It shows the power of creativity and innovation outside established frameworks. \nI am not currently using OpenAPS / Loop -- I'm on finger testing and MDI right now, but appreciate the movement and the strides it's taken for PWDs. From what I understand, the OpenAPS system requires an initial set-up trial and adjust effort; most of my bandwidth now is going into experimentation to figure out some suspected thyroid issues and food allergies contributing to brain fog and other system imbalances. \nWhat do you think are the biggest challenges right now in the diabetes innovation landscape? \nAn unstable and already complex political and financial healthcare market which adds uncertainty to the riskiness that is inherent in innovation and startups. It creates a private market that is less attractive than other more stable sectors. \nDevelopers and innovators working on the wrong part of the problem from the start or not doing enough early-stage patient feedback. \nAnd perhaps stating the obvious, a pain point in many sectors, not just diabetes \u2014 is people working in silos, competing for the same funding, re-creating the wheel, and increasing inefficiency. \nWhat ideas do you have to address these issues? \nThree stand out for me: Create a platform like Idealist or Patreon to connect people working on projects to those who want to get involved. An online questionnaire to help patients craft a checklist of important questions to ask their doctor during their next visit, to improve the patient/HCP experience. Implementing an educational experience during a doctor's office wait time that introduces PWDs to emotional support and health literacy information to improve their decision-making in a confusing healthcare world. \nAside from those things, I see a large need for a platform that allows patients to quickly and easily \u201cprice compare\u201d before they \u201cshop.\u201d Doctors and patients should be able to search online for a specific prescription that is covered in the patient\u2019s health plan, and know the price, before the prescription is sent to the pharmacy. Same for selecting healthcare plans \u2014we should have a standardized comparison tool that allows customizable patient information to be entered. CoveredCalifornia improved this system, but it could be expanded even more. This would require some political support as well as infrastructure needs. \nSounds like you're equipped to take a crack at those issues, no? \nMy dad is a handyman who can fix just about anything; from a stool in the garage at a young age, he taught me to see a problem, encounter roadblocks, and keep going until we found a solution that worked. As I went through my own diabetes experience, I used that to contemplate the macro-level problems, and kept asking, \u201cHow do we better articulate the patient experience, change policies and standards, leverage the power of our community network, and create innovative solutions to make life with diabetes better?\u201d And down the rabbit hole we go! \nWhat are you looking forward to about the Innovation Summit? \nMeeting the other attendees! Ideas always seem to flow better in person, bouncing off others. Can\u2019t wait to connect and learn from everyone else there. \n\nThanks for sharing, Mandy! We're looking forward to seeing you at the annual Innovation Summit and hearing more of your thoughts.

Written by Shawn Radcliffe on October 11, 2017 In an attempt to slow the opioid epidemic, some drugstore chains, states, and health insurers are limiting the number of days for new prescription opioids. \nEasy access to prescription opioids since the late 1990s has helped fuel an epidemic that now kills more than 40 Americans every day . \nHoping to slow the epidemic, drugstore chain CVS Health will limit initial opioid prescriptions to seven-day supplies for new patients with acute pain. Advertisement Advertisement \nThis kind of limit has already been imposed by several states. A bill to this effect was introduced in the U.S. Senate earlier this year. \nBut can prescription limits reduce the number of people who become addicted to opioids? Seven-day prescriptions \nCVS, which manages medications for almost 90 million people, is the first drugstore chain to impose a limit on opioid prescriptions. Advertisement \nUnder the new plan , customers who haven\u2019t filled an opioid prescription through CVS before will only be able to get a seven-day supply of opioid medication for acute conditions. \nThis includes the use of opioid pain medication after an injury, minor surgery, or a dental procedure. Advertisement Advertisement \nThis doesn\u2019t impact people taking prescription opioids for chronic pain conditions and cancer. \nThe number of pills dispensed will depend upon the strength of the opioid. Patients will also be prescribed opioids that provide pain relief over a shorter duration instead of a longer one. \nIf a doctor or dentist prescribes over these limits, the pharmacist will ask them to revise the prescription. Prescribers will also be able to request an exception if they feel the patient\u2019s care warrants it. \nThe program will go into effect February 1. \nThe company\u2019s new approach fits with opioid prescribing guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2016. Advertisement Advertisement \nThese acknowledge that \u201clong-term opioid use often begins with treatment of acute pain.\u201d \nTo minimize the risk of opioid dependence, the CDC recommends that doctors prescribe these medications in the lowest dose and for the shortest duration that\u2019s effective at relieving a patient\u2019s pain. \n\u201cThree days or less will often be sufficient; more than seven days will rarely be needed,\u201d state the guidelines. Advertisement \nThe CDC also cites research showing that high doses of prescription opioids and the use of extended-release opioids have \u201ccontributed to the overdose epidemic.\u201d \nThe CVS plan targets both of these. Advertisement Advertisement \nHowever, there\u2019s nothing to stop a patient from asking a doctor for a refill. \n\u201cPatients who are in significant pain will have no choice but to get refills; this may result in higher out-of-pocket cost to the patient and substantial inconvenience to both patients and physicians,\u201d Robert Stein, PharmD, JD, a professor of practice for pharmacy law and ethics and healthcare information technology at the Keck Graduate Institute School of Pharmacy, told Healthline. \nStein added that a new federal law allows a \u201cpartial dispensing\u201d of Schedule 2 controlled substances such as opioid medications. A doctor could write a prescription longer than seven days, but the pharmacy would only dispense a one-week supply at a time. Advertisement \nCVS will also expand the number of kiosks available at its stores for the disposal of unused medication. This could cut down on unused prescription opioids being misused. \nA recent report by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) found that about half of people who misused prescription opioids in the past year obtained them from a friend or relative for free. Advertisement Advertisement \nAbout 4 percent of people who misused prescription opioids took the pills from a friend or relative without asking. Will other companies follow? \nWalgreens officials didn\u2019t respond to a Healthline email, asking whether the company intends to follow in CVS\u2019 footsteps. \nHowever, the company launched a campaign last month to educate teens about the opioid epidemic. \nExpress Scripts, the country\u2019s largest pharmacy benefit manager, rolled out a program similar to that of CVS at the beginning of last month. \nSnezana Mahon, the company\u2019s vice president of clinical product development, said that an earlier pilot program that included 106,000 patients showed that this limit led to a 38 percent drop in hospitalizations and a 40 percent decrease in emergency department visits. \nMahon also said that the average opioid prescription written for patients covered by its programs was 22 days. \nStein thinks opioid limits will also \u201cindirectly educate prescribers to avoid writing prescriptions for excessive quantities of opioids.\u201d \nWhile the seven-day limit fits with the CDC\u2019s guidelines, even that carries a risk of opioid dependence. \nA CDC report from earlier this year found that the risk of long-term opioid use increased with each additional day of taking the pills \u2014 starting with the third day. \nThe report noted that the \u201csharpest increases in chronic opioid use\u201d occurred after 5 days and 31 days of opioid therapy. \nThe risk also spiked when a patient was given a refill, a high-dose prescription, or an initial 10- or 30-day supply. States crack down \nSeveral states \u2014 including Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont \u2014 have laws limiting initial opioid prescriptions to around seven days. \nNew Jersey has the strictest law in the nation \u2014 a five-day limit signed into effect by Gov. Chris Christie in February. \nPhiladelphia-area Independence Blue Cross also set a five-day limit for initial opioid prescriptions for people covered by its health insurance plans. \nAnd earlier this year, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) introduced a bill that would set a seven-day limit for opioid prescriptions for acute pain. The bill remains in committee. \nCritics of state limits for opioid prescriptions \u2014 including some doctors \u2014 are worried that limits will restrict a doctor\u2019s ability to treat patients individually. \n\u201cA one-size-fits-all approach to medical care and specifically pain management seems unwise,\u201d Stein told Healthline. \u201cAn orthopedic patient may need weeks of opioid pain control, making the limit inconvenient for those physicians and their patients. A dental patient, on the other hand, should reasonably require no more than a seven-day supply.\u201d \nOf course, a bigger question remains: What\u2019s the most appropriate length of an opioid prescription for different acute conditions? \nA recent study in JAMA Surgery adds some clarity to that. \nResearchers found that the ideal prescription length for general surgery likely falls between four and nine days. For women\u2019s health procedures, it\u2019s between 4 and 13 days. And for procedures like knee and hip replacements, it\u2019s between 6 and 15 days. \nStudies like this might make it easier for states, drugstores, and insurers to set opioid prescription limits that still allow doctors to provide the care they feel is needed.

Researchers say alternative pain relief for kids should be considered. \nEven after minor surgery, most children need some kind of pain reliever. \nOften they\u2019re given a kind of opioid to help lessen the pain, but increasingly doctors are looking at how kids fare on other kinds of pain relievers. Advertisement Advertisement \nA new study has found that children taking opioids after surgery report more side effects than those taking ibuprofen, despite both medications providing equal pain relief. \nResearchers at London Health Sciences Centre, Western University in Ontario in Canada, the University of Alberta in Canada, and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Wisconsin studied 154 children to see how they were affected after taking either opioids or ibuprofen. \nThe children were between the ages of 5 to 17 and had undergone minor outpatient orthopedic surgery. Advertisement \nOrthopedic surgery is associated with highest incidence of pain in patients who have been discharged, according to the study authors. \nThe research was published today in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ). Advertisement Advertisement \nThe authors found that significantly more of the children who took opioids reported side effects compared to the children who only took ibuprofen. \nBoth drugs were effective at diminishing overall pain. \nThe team found that 45 of the 65 children who took opioids reported side effects, most commonly drowsiness and nausea. \nOf the children who took ibuprofen 26 of 67 reported side effects. \n\u201cThis result suggests that adequate pain management should be an important goal of care, even after minor outpatient surgery,\u201d Dr. Naveen Poonai, clinician scientist at the Lawson Health Research Institute and associate professor of Emergency Medicine at Western University, with coauthors, said in a statement. Advertisement Advertisement \nPoonai also said more pain reliever options, including pharmacological and nonpharmacological options, need to be explored. \nDr. Michael Grosso, chair of pediatrics and chief medical officer at Huntington Hospital in New York, said physicians have been concerned for some time about the risks for some children who rapidly metabolize certain opioids. \nChildren who metabolize the opioid codeine quickly could be at risk for dangerous side effects. Advertisement \n\u201cSome individuals that rapidly metabolize codeine actually generate morphine as a breakdown product,\u201d Grosso told Healthline. \nAs a result, \u201cThere\u2019s a concern that they may have breathing difficulties or respiratory arrest.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nGrosso said while the study\u2019s findings were \u201cinteresting,\u201d there would need to be more research in a larger population to confirm the findings about the side effects. \nHowever, \u00ad\u00adGrosso said the study also provides key information about the side effects of opioids amid the ongoing opioid crisis. \nWhile it\u2019s unlikely for young patients to become addicted to opioids, Grosso said doctors may be concerned about giving the medication to older patients and instead look for other less addictive options for pain relief.

How will that affect women in the workplace? \nIf you currently receive birth control as part of your workplace health plan, you might want to check on the religious beliefs of your company\u2019s owner. \nAs of this week, employers and insurers that claim religious or moral objections will no longer have to cover birth control in their insurance plans. Advertisement Advertisement \nThat\u2019s because of changes announced last Friday by the Trump administration. \nSince August 2011, health plans across the country have been subjected to a contraceptive coverage mandate implemented under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). \nThat mandate required most private health plans to include coverage for female contraceptives at no cost to patients. Advertisement \nSome religious employers were exempted from this requirement, including churches and houses of worship. \nHowever, many other enterprises controlled or owned by religious organizations that oppose contraception were required to follow the mandate. Advertisement Advertisement \nThat changed last week, when the White House issued two new interim final rules that make it easier for employers and insurers to opt out of providing contraceptive coverage. \nUnder the new rules, any company that can demonstrate a \u201csincerely held\u201d religious or moral objection will be exempt from covering the cost of birth control. \nWhile the rules came into effect immediately, the administration is accepting comments on them until Dec. 5. Reactions have been mixed \nMany opponents of the contraceptive coverage mandate welcomed the change in policy. \n\u201cEmployers with religious objections to providing contraception and potentially abortion-inducing drugs will now be protected,\u201d Eric Scheidler, executive director of the Pro-Life Action League, told Healthline. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cThat said, we\u2019d have preferred a total rollback in the policy, which was instituted under the ACA\u2019s preventive care provision. Fertility is not a syndrome that needs to be prevented, but rather a marker of health. Our first objection to the HHS mandate was that it treats pregnancy as a kind of disease,\u201d he added. \nSimilarly, Scott Phelps from the Abstinence and Marriage Education Partnership thinks the entire policy of promoting contraceptive coverage \u201cis backward.\u201d \n\u201cWe don\u2019t see pregnancy as a health problem. We see it as a necessity for a growing, thriving society and economy,\u201d Phelps told Healthline. Advertisement \n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the declining fertility rate, which in America is now at an all-time recorded low,\u201d he added. \nOn the other hand, many members of the medical community and women\u2019s rights advocates oppose the change in rules. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cUnplanned pregnancies have a serious, negative impact on both women and babies,\u201d Dr. Michael Munger, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), told Healthline. \n\u201cThese rules would create a new standard that would allow employers to deny [contraceptive] coverage to their employees, based on their own moral objections,\u201d he added. \u201cThat inappropriately inserts the employer into the patient-physician relationship, interferes with patients\u2019 personal health care decisions, and opens the door to exceptions for other essential, physician-recommended preventive services, such as immunizations.\u201d \nAlong with five other medical organizations representing more than 560,000 frontline physicians, the AAFP is calling on the White House to withdraw these interim final rules. Advertisement \nThe administration is also facing legal challenges to the rules, including lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and California\u2019s attorney general . Increasing financial costs \nAccording to an Obama administration report , more than 55 million women were guaranteed access to no-cost birth control under the contraceptive coverage mandate. Advertisement Advertisement \nNow, an unknown number of women will lose that access. \n\u201cI don\u2019t expect to see any negative health impact at all on women as a consequence of this change,\u201d Scheidler told Healthline. \n\u201cAs we\u2019ve argued all along, birth control was already widely available and inexpensive before the HHS mandate was implemented,\u201d he continued. \nBut Munger disagrees. \nHe expects the change to \u201chave a financial impact that could deny access to contraception to many of the 55 million women\u201d who currently are guaranteed access to no-cost birth control. \nAlong with other contraceptive methods, more employers and insurers can now opt out of providing no-cost IUDs and birth control implants. \nThese long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods are highly effective. \nBut they\u2019re also costly to purchase without health insurance coverage. \nWithout coverage, birth control pills cost up to $50 per month . With typical use, they are about 91 percent effective at preventing pregnancy. \nIn comparison, IUDs and implants cost as much as $800 and $1,000 up front. They are 99 percent effective at preventing pregnancy. Access improves health outcomes \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , the proportion of women who use an IUD or implant has increased from almost 4 percent in 2006\u20132010 to slightly more than 7 percent in 2011\u20132013. \nSome researchers have suggested that increased usage of IUDs and implants helps account for declining rates of unintentional pregnancy and abortion . \nStudies have also linked these LARC methods to more optimal \u201c birth spacing ,\u201d or intervals between births. \nLonger intervals between births are associated with better health outcomes for mothers and infants , including lower risk of premature birth, low birth weight, and infant death. \nThe ability to plan and space births also tends to improve women\u2019s education and employment prospects, reduce conflicts in their relationships, and lower their risk of depression and anxiety, reports the Guttmacher Institute . \nFor affected women, the new interim rules may negatively affect their ability to prevent, delay, and plan pregnancies. \nIt may also affect the ability of some women to prevent other medical conditions. \n\u201cContraception medications are necessary for multiple medical reasons,\u201d Munger said. \u201cFor example, contraceptive pills are necessary to prevent osteoporosis in young women with ovarian failure due to chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer.\u201d \n\u201cWhether the 2018 budget preserves adequate funding for Medicaid coverage of contraception, and whether that coverage would be at no cost to women, is yet to be seen,\u201d he added.

Advertisement Advertisement \nTheir work could lead to new therapies to treat brain trauma, stroke, and other neurological issues. \n\u201cNothing we\u2019ve done can be turned around tomorrow and given to a human, but it\u2019s proof of principle. We\u2019ve established a mechanism by which a ketogenic diet suppresses inflammation,\u201d Dr. Raymond Swanson, a study author who also oversees a research lab at UCSF, told Healthline. \nThe ketogenic diet is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet that\u2019s been touted for years for its beneficial health properties, including being an anti-inflammatory. Advertisement \nIt has been demonstrated to work effectively for the treatment of epilepsy. \nIt has also been theorized that it could help treat other neurodegenerative disorders , including Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s. Advertisement Advertisement \nHowever, the actual biological process through which the ketogenic diet induces these anti-inflammatory effects hasn\u2019t been clear \u2014 until now. \nThe UCSF study , published last month in the journal Nature Communications, has identified the mechanism involved in this complex process. \nAnd the researchers were able to do it pharmacologically. That is, without actually having to use the ketogenic diet for their study. \n\u201cYou can get the benefits of the ketogenic diet, at least this benefit, without actually having to be on a ketogenic diet,\u201d said Swanson, who is also chief of neurology services at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center. How the research was conducted \nScientists induced a state of inflammation in rat brains using the molecule lipopolysaccharide. Advertisement Advertisement \nThey then introduced another molecule called 2-deoxyglucose, which blocks glucose metabolism, a characteristic of the ketogenic diet. \nThe process effectively lowered levels of inflammation to nearly those of their control group of rats. \n\u201cWe had really huge effects,\u201d says Swanson. \u201cThe inflammatory response in the brain was almost completely shut down.\u201d Advertisement \n\u201cThat was pretty damn convincing,\u201d he added. \nResearchers had similarly positive results with their experiment when conducted on brain cell cultures. Advertisement Advertisement \nInflammation is a complex process that the body relies on as part of a defense mechanism against potentially harmful agents, such as bacteria. \nHowever, in certain cases, such as head trauma and stroke, inflammation in the brain can actually be harmful. \nReducing inflammation in these cases can \u201creduce tissue loss and improve functional outcomes in animal models,\u201d the researchers wrote. Advertisement The study\u2019s significance \nThe significance of the study is also broader than just this application, said Swanson. \nIt also spotlights other potential benefits of the ketogenic diet by identifying the mechanism of the diet\u2019s anti-inflammation properties. Advertisement Advertisement \nSwanson says this work puts the study of the ketogenic diet on \u201creal, firm, scientific foot.\u201d \n\u201cIn the long run that may encourage other people to get into this field with modern scientific approaches,\u201d he added. \nAdditionally, major health concerns, including diabetes and obesity, have been linked with chronic inflammation . \nTapping into the ketogenic diet\u2019s anti-inflammatory properties could also potentially lead to treatment innovations in this area as well. \n\u201cThe broadest possible application of this research would be that we might be able to negate pro-inflammatory effects of a high-carb diet and people who are diabetic by interfering in the same mechanism,\u201d said Swanson. \nThe study also successfully demonstrated a way to achieve the benefits of the ketogenic diet without actually having to abide by it. \nThe ketogenic diet is notoriously difficult to maintain , which is why researchers have been searching for pharmacological ways to mimic its effects rather than putting patients through its strict dietary demands. \nHealthline reported last month on scientists attempting to turn BHB, a ketone produced by the diet linked to increased lifespan in animal models , into a pill or supplement that could then be sold to consumers. \nThe search for a magic pill, particularly one that might make the ketogenic diet unnecessary, remains tantalizing but still elusive. \nNonetheless, this study represents a potentially large step in that direction \u2014 one with health implications for a broad spectrum of diseases, including stroke and diabetes. \n\u201cWe showed how the ketogenic diet is suppressing inflammation,\u201d said Swanson, \u201cand we designed a drug that would accomplish the same thing.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "keto", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gigen mammoser", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "swanson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raymond swanson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "san francisco veterans affairs medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nature communications", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucsf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of california san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthline", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-12T06:57:13.037+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc25198a4b75d74dbd492dfc71f57247e466fcb8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_UgqhTsx6ciM7G4NlX.q9pFRuMCAIqwDzPzvBjSSW2KOUIh4jWDBjHy38LyVXCD5Nw4Z8Q--", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "http://www.healthline.com/rss/diabetesmine", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Healthline RSS Feed", "title": "A 'Caffeinated Diabetes Pirate' Addresses the Insulin Pricing Crisis", "title_full": "A 'Caffeinated Diabetes Pirate' Addresses the Insulin Pricing Crisis", "published": "2017-10-12T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.healthline.com/resources/healthline/images/logo-lg.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 20, "comments": 0, "shares": 20}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc25198a4b75d74dbd492dfc71f57247e466fcb8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_UgqhTsx6ciM7G4NlX.q9pFRuMCAIqwDzPzvBjSSW2KOUIh4jWDBjHy38LyVXCD5Nw4Z8Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mike Hoskins", "published": "2017-10-12T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "A 'Caffeinated Diabetes Pirate' Addresses the Insulin Pricing Crisis", "text": "Email addresses will not be shared with 3rd parties.

Today we're happy to host longtime type 1 Scott Mullins in North Carolina, who fancies himself a pirate and jack of all trades. \nDiagnosed as a baby back in November 1983, the now 35-year-old married father of three and coffee fanatic tells a great tale of his medical woes that includes a sponge pancreas, Dr. Langerhans (who discovered the cells that secrete insulin), video game production, and even a multi-tentacled healthcare monster that's after our wallets. \nSo grab your cup of java or whatever you may prefer, and sink into Scott's quirky POV here at the 'Mine today. A Tale of Coffee, Odd Jobs and Chasing Insulin - by Scott Mullins \nClearly I enjoy a good pirate theme. But let's start with the obvious: Why is my online name Caffeinated Diabetic? \nWell, a phrase of mine is that I survive on insulin and coffee. At this point I'm not sure which one is more important to me. \nIt\u2019s pretty much an understatement to say I enjoy drinking coffee. You can follow my caffeinated posts about my life, diabetes, and coffee consumption on Instagram ( @CaffeinatedDiabetic ) or Twitter ( @DiabeticBarista ). \nThis next month marks my 34th year with type 1, after being diagnosed at age 1. \nProfessionally, I've worked in a few areas of interest to me -- from diabetes, gaming, and yes, coffee. I majored in business management in college, before switching to the software side of things and taking Microsoft certification courses. Then I tried video game development several years back, but never finished the degree. So, you might say I am more a \"jack of all trades,\" or maybe a \"Master of Coffee\" since I am a \"Coffee Master\"? :) \nI ran a video game blog for several years that really got me started and allowed me to practice photo editing and some video editing, and I just kept doing those things after I stopped writing on the site. The site was called CoffeeWithGames.com , and it wasn't the typical video game review and video game news site; it was more data-based. I would show how many hours certain Nintendo Wii games were being reportedly played, record data for the games every week when it was available, and do occasional interviews for the site. \nAs of writing this, I work at Starbucks during the days and I just hit three years at that job on National Coffee Day Sept. 29. I attempt to work on other projects at night, and one side project I've been working on slowly but surely, is actually video game-related, while the other project is coffee-related (surprise!). \nSo as you can see, coffee and diabetes are two big themes in life for me. To my family and friends in real life, I'm just Scott -- though we often joke that if I were a pirate, they'd be my pirate crew helping me sail the highs and lows of the diabetes seas. My Diabetes Story \nMy diagnosis came in November 1983 as a one-year-old. My mom said my blood sugar was somewhere near 800 when I was rushed to hospital, and it was probably a blessing in disguise that I had gotten strep throat before my diagnosis. That apparently caused me to lose my appetite and stop eating, which probably helped keep my blood sugar from going even higher, but that's just a guess on my part. \nI was in the hospital for about two weeks, while they figured out how much insulin would work for me, and my mom learned how to do my shots and check my blood sugar, what I should eat, when I should eat, and all those things. After being rushed to the hospital when I was diagnosed, I've fortunately never had to go back to the hospital because of my diabetes. \nMy parents did their best to raise me as normally as they could and they never let diabetes stop me from doing much of anything that I wanted to do. They did a great job at helping me accept it for the craziness that it is. I played basically every sport when I was little and in high school I did power-lifting for three years. Highs and Lows Growing Up \nFor me, the memory of first using test strips involved holding the side of the strip container and comparing the color of the strip with the color range on the vial to see which \"range\" my blood sugar was in. My blood sugar readings were written down. I went to a diabetes camp for a week one summer, I think it was the Louisiana Lions Camp, where I remember learning to do my own shots, and getting into a pillow fight. \nIn junior high, I did my science project on diabetes, dressing up as Dr. Paul Langerhans and crafting a pancreas model out of a sponge and tubing for the blood vessels and other parts. I still have the sponge pancreas, and I'm sure there's a picture of me out there somewhere dressed up as Langerhans! \nOne way I've tried to stay on top of my diabetes throughout the years is by checking my blood sugar often. Very often. My endocrinologist told me several years ago something like, \"You may be the only type 1 diabetic I have told that you check your blood sugar too much.\" My A1C at that appointment came back in the 5s, and she never said anything after that about how much I check. :) \nI was on multiple daily injections (MDI) from 1983 until about 2002, and used insulin pumps until 2016, when I ended my run with the Animas Vibe and switched back to MDI by accident when I ran out of pump supplies one weekend due to a bad infusion site. \nFortunately, I had some NPH (N) insulin from Walmart that had been sitting in the fridge for two months, and that was the first time I'd purchased any long-acting older insulin since I'd changed to pumping 14 years earlier. Kind of crazy how it worked out. It's been a nutty year navigating this new MDI routine, and there have been some big lows thanks to going through five different types of insulins -- Lantus, Humalog, Novolog, N, and R -- all because of costs and insurance plan changes. Insurance \"Coverage\"? \nSpeaking of the costs associated with T1D, \"health insurance\" and insulin costs I think are areas that need to really be addressed! This is what led me back to MDI, unwittingly. \nA year ago, I had switched my insurance plan to one that had a super-high deductible, because of how much the premium was increasing on the old plan. Due to this insurance change, my prescribed insulins were going to be over $300 per vial (!), until I met the deductible. Meeting the deductible would have taken me almost an entire year. This exorbitant deductible made my health insurance basically useless to me as a type 1. \nI made the decision to switch to N and R insulins when my other insulins ran out, because of the costs of the other insulins on my useless insurance plan. The first day I used both N and R for the first time again was on Feb. 8, 2017 -- probably close to 20 years since the last time I'd done that. \nI had heard about the lower costs of N and R from fellow PWDs online, and I'm glad that I had heard about it from them when I did, which was prior to my insulin pump supply issue and prior to my insurance plan changing for the worst last year. \nN and R are definitely not the best or fastest-acting insulins on the market, but they do lower my blood sugars and have helped me survive the last year with a junk insurance plan. \nI've had others ask me about my use of N and R over the last several months, and even though those insulins are available without a prescription in many states and at a great price, it's not a change you should make without talking to your doctor. \nAs noted, these insulins are definitely not the best on the market; they're 30+ years old now. But I do hope everyone with diabetes who faces dire straights with insulin prices knows that these insulins are currently available as options, and that they can talk with their doctor about them. \nUnfortunately, we know of at least two fellow T1s who've passed away in recent years, in some part due to their health insurance plans changing, and the costs of their prescribed insulins being more than they could afford. If I hadn't seen fellow T1Ds online talking about the availability of older low-cost insulins, I wouldn't have known where to turn. \nThe fact I am even having to mention and use these N and R brands in 2017 is crazy to me. \nWhat good is health \"insurance\" that you can afford, if it doesn't cover the medicines you need and are prescribed? What good are newer, better insulins, if patients can't afford them? Why is it 2017 and I'm using the same insulins to treat my diabetes that my parents were buying for me in the 1980s? \nI think the United States is the last major profit haven for the publicly traded companies in the healthcare industry. Until the market either collapses or a new competitor can somehow get into the insulin market, I think we are stuck with the ridiculously priced better insulins, as well as the ridiculously priced health insurance plans to \"cover\" them. \nI don't see any easy solutions to the insulin pricing issues PWDs are facing in the United States. That's because we are dealing with a multi-tentacled profit monster on the healthcare and insulin pricing front, with each tentacle attached to our wallets. The monster protects itself, at our expense. Possible Solutions? \"... A multi-tentacled profit monster on the healthcare and insulin-pricing front, with each tentacle attached to our wallets.\" Scott Mullins in North Carolina, T1D since age 1 \nOne solution that I think would work, and that I hope happens quickly for us, would be a company and/or insulin philanthropist entering the insulin manufacturing market, and causing market disruption in the United States. A company that is looking to make profits, sure, but one that is not publicly traded would be ideal. Finding an \"insulin philanthropist\" to help open an insulin manufacturing company to provide the better types of insulins at lower costs would be great. \nShort of that, I would settle for someone becoming like Drs. Banting and Best and finding the \"next great discovery\" for us (see: CURE!). \nI'm not even sure how this pricing crisis got so acute... maybe the Powers That Be thought we could treat ourselves with cinnamon? Or maybe they thought we really could survive on just coffee? Of course I'm all for coffee and cinnamon, but even I (with my pirate's resolve) can't survive on those alone. \nNo, I don't know what the answers are, but I\u2019m open to discussing anything that might constitute a real solution to the problems we face. I think it's important for us patient/advocates to keep an open mind and be willing to consider numerous options. Whatever the possible solutions may be, stay caffeinated, My Friends! \n\nMay we also say... 'AAAARRRGGG' as to insulin pricing?

Advertisement \nCarol Cummings, the senior director of Optimum Life Engagement and Innovation at Brookdale Senior Living, makes this case in a recent blog . \nShe says the human brain is designed to grow and change throughout a person\u2019s life. Advertisement \nIn fact, she says, your creativity may get better with age. \nIt also may help you ward off disease and cognitive decline. \nAnd there\u2019s some science to back up this assertion. Creativity and aging study \nIn 2006, The Center on Aging, Health & Humanities at The George Washington University (GW) released a report called \u201cThe Creativity and Aging Study.\u201d \nThe two-year study had six prominent sponsors. The lead sponsor was the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). Advertisement Advertisement \nThe study was designed to evaluate what effects participation in cultural, artistic activities has on the general health, mental health, and social lives of older adults. \nActivities consisted of, among other things, painting, dance, drama, poetry, and music. \nA total of 300 persons took part in the study, 100 in each of three different locations: Washington, D.C., Brooklyn, and San Francisco. Advertisement \nIn each region, one-half of the participants were placed in a control group. \nThe other half, the intervention group, actively participated in various creative activities provided and overseen by professional artists. Advertisement Advertisement \nAbout 70 percent of the subjects were Caucasian. The others were members of ethnic or racial minority groups. \nSubjects had an average age of 80 years. Overall, ages ranged between 65 and 103 years. \nIn order to provide a baseline measurement, each person began with a face-to-face interview during which they filled out multiple questionnaires. Advertisement \nParticipants also filled out questionnaires at the end of both the first and second years of the study. \nIn every category, analysis of the study results found that those in the intervention groups exhibited positive outcomes relative to those in the control groups. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe findings looked at overall health, number of doctor visits, over-the-counter medication use, falls, morale, depression, and loneliness. \nThe study authors note among their conclusions, \u201cIn that [these results] also show stabilization and actual increase in community-based activities in general among those in the cultural programs, they reveal a positive impact on maintaining independence and on reducing dependency.\u201d The power of your mental muscle \nHealthline spoke about the study with Dr. Joe Verghese, MBBS, MS, director of the Montefiore-Einstein Center for the Aging Brain at the Montefiore Health System in New York. \nVerghese discussed the importance of something called cognitive reserve. \n\u201cCognitive reserve is a concept that is kind of akin to mental muscle. The more you exercise your brain, you build new connections, [and] you build new networks,\u201d said Verghese. \n\u201cSo when aging hits your brain,\u201d continued Verghese, \u201cthen you\u2019re able to ward off symptoms of these diseases for a longer period of time. Engaging in these types of activities helps you do it.\u201d \nGenevieve Saenz, MA, LMFT-A, long-term expressive arts therapist who has for many years worked with AGE of Central Texas , spoke with Healthline about the beneficial effects of creativity on aging. \nSaenz said, \u201cI look at creativity in general, not just visual art, but anything from gardening, to dancing, to going to the ballet, to creating a piece of art, to listening to music. Those are my therapeutic tools.\u201d \nThose tools provide, \u201can awakening of the human potential for creativity,\u201d said Saenz. \nBut Saenz cautions that the elderly face a real problem within our society. Importance of reducing senior isolation \n\u201cIn the culture that we live in, there\u2019s a cultural norm of isolation and uselessness that is placed on people,\u201d said Saenz. \u201cAnd people reach that age and all of a sudden society sees them as less than people anymore.\u201d \n\u201cWe don\u2019t respect our elders in this culture. And that has a psychological, and I believe, a physical effect on people because of that projection from the culture,\u201d she added. \u201cWell, what do you do with that? Right? Who am I now? So there\u2019s this identity crisis that comes along with the change in life?\u201d \nThat\u2019s why, continued Saenz, \u201cGetting people out of isolation is just so important.\u201d \nVerghese echoed similar sentiments. \n\u201cA lot of [older] people, they do live alone, they have limited social contact, and limited social interaction,\u201d he said. \u201cSo by getting them to engage in activities, especially in activities where you have to do it as a group, you automatically increase the social engagement, and that has been associated with less depression and a better sense of well-being.\u201d Ideas for reconnecting \nVerghese acknowledges that outside of cities, it may be hard for some older adults to travel outside the home in order to partake in social activities. \nSo he offers some alternatives. \n\u201cThere are other organizations that provide cognitively stimulating activities through telephones,\u201d said Verghese. \u201cThere\u2019s an organization called DOROT [dorotusa.org] which has the University Without Walls where they do a mixture of group discussion, lectures, [and more,] all available through the telephone.\u201d \n\u201cAll you need to do is call in and you\u2019re either part of a group or you\u2019re listening to a speaker talking about a particular topic,\u201d said Verghese. \n\u201cThere are audiobooks, and then... the other area, of course, is the internet and computers,\u201d continued Verghese. \nSaenz remarked that, \u201cThere are excellent resources on the internet about art. There are courses you can take online. And those courses may not seem accessible to the elderly, and yes, there\u2019s a learning curve, but it can be bridged.\u201d \n\u201cI think the main thing that invites creativity into your life is taking risks,\u201d said Saenz. \u201cEven taking a risk is a creative act. You\u2019re doing something. You\u2019re imagining. You\u2019re thinking about something. You\u2019re thinking outside the experience you\u2019re in and wondering what a new experience could be.\u201d \n\u201cAnd that,\u201d said Saenz, \u201cis creativity.\u201d Express yourself through your art \n\u201cOne of the things the arts can do, that other community-based things can\u2019t, is that it also facilitates expression for elders,\u201d said Saenz. \n\u201cSo, when you\u2019re working with the arts, or you\u2019re working with creativity, you have an opportunity to share your knowledge, to share your story, to do some transmission of all the things that have happened to you in your life, and to express yourself and be authentic,\u201d said Saenz. \u201cAnd that is empowering and so healthy for anyone at any age.\u201d \n\u201cPeople are always saying, \u2018Listen to your inner child. What does your inner child need?\u2019\u201d said Saenz. \nSaenz believes that\u2019s only one of the questions we should ask ourselves. \n\u201cWhat does your inner elder need?,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhat do they say? Because they have a lot of wisdom too.\u201d \nHealthline asked Saenz if she could choose one thing that she believes differentiates those who age well from those who struggle. \nSaenz replied, \u201cThe people who seem to embrace aging and not be afraid of it, seem to be the people who age best.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T03:02:44.066+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "63895332b483f224e010f7b3f7cee1131abbfb91", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StaYdsnaRSiu55wAdQ9Fz83ddT1s7_D3JqHObP1TvN5D.E7DCSWXaRBktqpkh_W2h9Tw-", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Allergies May Develop Before Birth", "title_full": "Allergies May Develop Before Birth", "published": "2017-10-11T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.723, "main_image": "https://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/2931-mother_baby-766x415-thumbnail.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 53, "comments": 0, "shares": 53}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "63895332b483f224e010f7b3f7cee1131abbfb91", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StaYdsnaRSiu55wAdQ9Fz83ddT1s7_D3JqHObP1TvN5D.E7DCSWXaRBktqpkh_W2h9Tw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Written Kristen Fischer", "published": "2017-10-11T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Allergies May Develop Before Birth", "text": "Allergies May Develop Before Birth Written by Kristen Fischer on October 11, 2017 New research indicates that children may develop some allergies while still in the womb. Is there anything expectant mothers can do to lower the risks? \nIt\u2019s estimated that allergies affect 40 percent of children in the United States. \nMost parents feel powerless to treat these ailments, let alone prevent them. Advertisement Advertisement \nBut what if allergies start before a child is born and we could actually do something to avert their onset or severity? \nIn recent years, several studies have suggested that allergies could be developed while babies are in the womb. \nThis might mean that mothers can modify their diets or take supplements in an effort to limit the development of allergies. Advertisement \nDeveloping allergies involves a \u201ccomplex interplay of genetic predispositions and environmental factors,\u201d Dr. Stacey Galowitz , an allergist from New Jersey, told Healthline. \n\u201cIt is known that infants with a sibling, or at least one parent, who has allergic conditions are at an increased risk for the development of allergic disease themselves,\u201d she said. Advertisement Advertisement \nDr. Scott Sicherer , a professor of pediatric allergy and immunology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, agreed that genetics can play a major role in whether a child has hay fever, asthma, or eczema. \nIn addition, almost 6 million children under the age of 18 \u2014 1 in 13 kids \u2014 have food allergies, and about 30 percent of them are allergic to more than one food, Food Allergy Research & Education reports. Preventing allergies during pregnancy? \nWhat can an expectant mother do to reduce the chance of her child developing allergies? \nDiet may be a good place to start. \n\u201cThough there are no current recommendations of specific interventions parents can take to definitively prevent allergies in their unborn child, the majority of publications support maintaining a well-balanced diet throughout pregnancy and lactation, as specific restrictions of key allergens have not been shown to prevent the future development of allergic disease in children,\u201d Galowitz said. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cIn fact, some studies suggest that avoiding select foods during pregnancy may actually increase the risk of developing future allergies in infancy or childhood.\u201d \nSimilarly, the use of prenatal vitamin D, prebiotics and probiotics, and fish oil supplementation during pregnancy has not clearly demonstrated a benefit in the reduction of allergic diseases, Galowitz added. \nSicherer said there are no studies that look at any preconception prevention strategies for allergies. Advertisement \nIn fact, there is \u201cno strong rationale to expect that a preconception strategy would be relevant,\u201d he noted. \nWomen should maintain a healthy diet, but there have been no clinical trials on that theory, as randomizing women into healthy and unhealthy diets would be unethical. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cThere is soft evidence that a nutritious, varied diet with healthy fats may help,\u201d Sicherer said. \nBut there\u2019s been inconclusive evidence that using probiotics, for example, lowered the risk for allergic rashes. \nThere is some evidence that allergies may be predetermined by several factors. Advertisement \nA 2014 study out of Australia concluded there was preliminary evidence of pre-birth programming of food allergies. \nThe study was conducted on 12 infants. Advertisement Advertisement \nAs a result, Dr. David Martino of the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute said epigenetics had a role in allergy development. Epigenetics refers to genes being turned on and off due to the environment. \nResearch conducted last year reported that factors such as maternal cigarette smoking, preterm birth, and cesarean delivery were \u201cimplicated in predisposing\u201d babies to allergy development later on in life. \nHealthy eating, larger families, and healthy in utero growth were protective, although researchers were not sure how that worked. \nA team at the University of Southampton reported last year that there are DNA markers that link a person\u2019s season of birth to developing allergies. \nThose born in autumn had a higher risk for having eczema while spring babies had less of a risk. Introducing allergens \nWhat about the notion that feeding children small amounts of \u201ctrigger\u201d foods can desensitize them to having an allergy to that food? \nSome research indicates that introducing previously feared foods such as milk, egg, nuts, and shellfish can decrease an infant\u2019s risk for developing allergies to those foods. \nEczema has already been linked to having a food allergy or sensitivity . \nIt is important to consult with an allergist prior to introduction of these foods if your child has moderate to severe eczema, preexisting food allergies, or a peanut-allergic sibling, Galowitz added.

Advertisement Advertisement \nA new study shows there are financial benefits to losing weight in addition to the well-documented benefits to your overall health. \nResearchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health released a report last month that says adults can save anywhere from $18,000 to $31,000 within their lifetime if they lose weight. \nThe findings were published in the journal Obesity. Advertisement \nExact figures depend on age and how many pounds a person loses. \nFor example, a 20-year-old adult or a 40-year-old adult who goes from obese to overweight would see a lifetime cost savings of approximately $18,000. Advertisement Advertisement \nIf that same 20-year-old drops to a healthy weight, they\u2019d see their savings increase by nearly $10,000. \nIn contrast, a 40-year-old who drops to a healthy weight would see their lifetime savings jump to $31,000. The maximum savings peak is around $36,000 at the age of 50. \n\u201cIt\u2019s an important study because it really does calculate the cost of obesity,\u201d Ted Kyle, RPh, founder of ConscienHealth and a board member of the Obesity Action Coalition, told Healthline. The cost of obesity \nThe study\u2019s authors used data from the Coronary Artery Disease Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. \nIn addition, 15 other health statuses were examined. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe researchers\u2019 computational model simulated the weight and health of an adult as they age year by year. \nThey looked at adults starting at age 20 and ending at age 80, by increments of 10. \nThe researchers tracked individual medical costs and productivity losses within the model. Estimated direct medical costs to the insurer and sick time were also included. Advertisement \nDr. Scott Isaacs, an endocrinologist and member of the American Board of Obesity Medicine, said it\u2019s important to remember that the cost of obesity goes beyond just health issues. \nIt includes everything from absenteeism at work and the burden that puts on co-workers to something else called presenteeism. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cIt\u2019s when people go to work but aren\u2019t as productive as they should be,\u201d he said. \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the medical care costs of obesity in the United States is $147 billion. \nNationwide, productivity costs range between $3.3 billion and $6.4 billion. Advertisement Obesity on the rise \nThe argument for people to maintain a healthy weight is strong. Yet obesity remains an issue in the United States. \nRoughly 36 percent of people in the United States are considered obese, according to the CDC. Advertisement Advertisement \nAnd that number continues to rise. \nSo, if most of us understand how to lose weight and understand the health and financial benefits, what gives? \n\u201cAwareness isn\u2019t the problem,\u201d Kyle said, \u201cIt\u2019s equipping people to do something about it.\u201d \nHe said right now, the conventional weight loss narrative puts the onus on the individual. If a person wants to lose weight, all they need to do is eat less and exercise more. \nA plethora of diet and exercise regimens are available in books, magazines, websites, and blogs. \nBut people with obesity may need more specialized care. \nMore than a new way of eating and exercising, according to Isaacs. \nEven a general practitioner may not be the right person to talk to. \n\u201cObesity is a disease,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of willpower.\u201d A combination of treatments \nIsaacs said doctors that focus on obesity can help determine if medication, surgery, or both are needed. \nAs with other diseases, such as cancer or heart disease, successful treatment of obesity usually calls for the right balance of therapies to cure a person. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of things,\u201d said Isaacs. \u201cDevices such as ballooning or stapling of the stomach. It\u2019s not usually one medication that treats it.\u201d \nBut because society views obesity as a cosmetic problem and not a chronic health disease, many people don\u2019t pursue medical treatment, Isaacs noted. \nSome companies don\u2019t offer such treatment in their insurance plans. \n\u201cJust 1 percent of patients eligible for bariatric surgery utilize it,\u201d Isaacs said. \nIn addition, Medicaid recipients don\u2019t have access to any obesity treatments at all. \nThat may change, Isaacs noted, if Congress passes the Treat and Reduce Obesity Bill Act of 2017. The bill would fund medication designed for weight loss management within the Medicare Part D plan. \nBoth Kyle and Isaacs said that until society shifts its views on obesity, people who have the disease will remain on their own. \n\u201cObesity is really the last form of discrimination,\u201d Isaacs said. \nIn the meantime, people will continue to gain weight. The costs associated with obesity in the form of productivity loss or ongoing health problems will continue to rise. \n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of insane. We have a growing burden of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and many of those flow from obesity,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cWe let the disease of obesity progress and then we treat the complications.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T03:36:58.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a58b6a540ac7d6059205c3ee0d4c1fa5e5357b07", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StaZgLhrMwFedBJhA7VHzXoo.4ltJvaFDEIJQSbr6JMZfRgPh9WWhXyMGxYxp9o4O7mgvzfnii0s3ieb0hxK0zqId", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Big Pharma Creating Startup Firms to Do Drug Research", "title_full": "Big Pharma Creating Startup Firms to Do Drug Research", "published": "2017-10-12T00:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.244, "main_image": "https://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/tech/2042-New_ALS_Drug_Clinical_Trial-766x415-thumbnail.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 22, "comments": 0, "shares": 22}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 10}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a58b6a540ac7d6059205c3ee0d4c1fa5e5357b07", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StaZgLhrMwFedBJhA7VHzXoo.4ltJvaFDEIJQSbr6JMZfRgPh9WWhXyMGxYxp9o4O7mgvzfnii0s3ieb0hxK0zqId", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Written Shawn Radcliffe", "published": "2017-10-12T00:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Big Pharma Creating Startup Firms to Do Drug Research", "text": "Big Pharma Creating Startup Firms to Do Drug Research Written by Shawn Radcliffe on October 11, 2017 Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies are investing in independent startups, hoping to find the next popular and profitable drug. \nPharmaceutical companies are trying to capture a little bit of the startup magic. \nPfizer and several other firms have invested in a small spinoff company that will develop drug therapies for underserved patients. Advertisement Advertisement \nWith $103 million in initial funding , SpringWorks Therapeutics will focus at first on therapies for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and three rare forms of cancer. \nPfizer owns the rights to the drugs that will be tested. \nThis is good news for people with diseases that are harder to treat. Advertisement \nBut it may also be a sign that Big Pharma is willing to step outside the bureaucratic box in search of the innovation that startup companies are so well known for. \nBiotech startups focused on drug development aren\u2019t new phenomena. Advertisement Advertisement \nWhat\u2019s different about this particular startup is that it\u2019s heavily financed by large pharmaceutical companies. \nDifferent\u2026 but not unique. \nAnother startup, Symic Bio, received $73 million in funding over the past three years, including money from pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. \nStill, for each of these, there are dozens more startups that see pharmaceutical companies as the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, not at the beginning. Small but agile \nGetting a new drug into the hands of patients who need it isn\u2019t an easy thing. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cMost people don\u2019t know the painstaking labor and efforts that go into the development of a drug from inception to the patient finally taking it,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Hausfeld, chairman of the board and chief medical officer of BioFactura , a pharmaceutical startup that develops and commercializes biosimilar drugs . \nIt can take years for scientists to identify or create promising new compounds for treating disease. \nThis is followed by several rounds of laboratory and clinical testing before the drug hits the pharmacy\u2019s shelves. Advertisement \nHausfeld pointed out that while the early stages of this drug development pipeline thrive on innovation, later steps like manufacturing and distribution depend more on consistency and reliability. \nThe large size of a pharmaceutical company \u2014 with tens of thousands of employees \u2014 can make it ideally suited for the later stages of the pipeline, but it may hinder its ability to come up with new products. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cSmaller companies are much better at innovating and potentially taking a product pretty far down the road as they grow,\u201d Darryl Sampey, PhD, president and chief executive officer of BioFactura, told Healthline. \nStartups \u2014 sometimes with only half a dozen employees \u2014 are built for creativity and agility. \n\u201cIf somebody has a great idea,\u201d Hausfeld told Healthline, \u201cwe have the ability and the nimbleness to check it out and do an experiment or two, and see whether or not our idea has merit.\u201d Advertisement \nSome startups innovate by developing new drug compounds. Or by looking for new uses of existing compounds. \nOthers find better ways to move compounds through early laboratory and clinical testing. Advertisement Advertisement \nIf successful, a startup may hand off a promising new compound to a pharmaceutical company for further testing \u2014 in exchange for an upfront payment and royalties on successful drugs. \nOr a larger pharmaceutical company may acquire a startup outright, along with its new compound. \nThis happened with San Diego-based Trius Therapeutics, which researches antibiotics. \nIn 2013, Cubist Pharmaceuticals acquired Trius and Optimer Pharmaceuticals for more than $1 billion . \nThe next year Merck spent $8.4 billion to buy up Cubist. Big payout, big risk \nFor successful startups like Trius, the payout at the end of the R&D rainbow can be huge. \nBut successful startups have to overcome several challenges. \nA big one is money. \n\u201cStartups have a lot less money, and they have to be very efficient in the way that they spend their money,\u201d said Joseph Mallon, JD, PhD, an intellectual property attorney at Knobbe Martens. \n\u201cThis is essentially the difference between them and a larger pharmaceutical company, which doesn\u2019t have that life-or-death struggle over funding that the startups have,\u201d Mallon told Healthline. \nThis is especially true for drug development, where doing science is expensive. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for drug startups to make hundreds \u2014 if not thousands \u2014 of brand new compounds and test them,\u201d said Mallon, \u201cnot knowing which one is going to have the perfect balance of properties to treat a human being without adverse effects.\u201d \nSo, in order for a startup to succeed, it needs more than just great ideas. It needs a steady flow of cash. \n\u201cIt\u2019s my job to go out and find investors who are willing to take a risk on a small biotech firm that could potentially give them a nice return, even though there are no guarantees,\u201d said Hausfeld. \nStartups also have to find talented staff willing to work in a less stable environment, where employees have to be more independent and fend for themselves. \n\u201cStartups really appeal to creative people that are do-it-yourselfers. I think that\u2019s where a lot of the great ideas come from,\u201d said Sampey. \u201cThose are typically people who take more risk and are looking for some kind of reward.\u201d \nAlthough the financial rewards of a new drug entice many to ride out the rough waters of the startup world, there are also other benefits. \n\u201cThis is not easy. This takes a lot of time, a lot of effort, and a lot of money,\u201d said Hausfeld. \u201cHopefully at the end it will benefit society by the advances that we make.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T03:37:44.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ca148b59b00e68f8829a92f1193e3b334a342d56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_UgqhTpXW6mRSkPLQeyQu3oGTDfW6r.ktOmTcuxVHJlL_eH_.frbkpBXQ8Y-", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "http://www.healthline.com/rss/diabetesmine", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Healthline RSS Feed", "title": "Musical Soundtracks to Our Diabetes Lives", "title_full": "Musical Soundtracks to Our Diabetes Lives", "published": "2017-10-13T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.healthline.com/resources/healthline/images/logo-lg.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 17, "comments": 1, "shares": 17}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ca148b59b00e68f8829a92f1193e3b334a342d56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_UgqhTpXW6mRSkPLQeyQu3oGTDfW6r.ktOmTcuxVHJlL_eH_.frbkpBXQ8Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mike Hoskins", "published": "2017-10-13T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Musical Soundtracks to Our Diabetes Lives", "text": "Musical Soundtracks to Our Diabetes Lives Musical Soundtracks to Our Diabetes Lives Written by Mike Hoskins | Published on October 13, 2017 Email addresses will not be shared with 3rd parties.

Close \nEver since I was little, music has been a part of shaping my life with diabetes. \nDiagnosed with T1D at age five, I have vivid memories growing up singing and changing up lyrics to tunes like Foreigner's Juke Box Hero and Pour Some Sugar On Me by Def Leppard. \nOver the years, I've written about the musical influences in my life and how they've boomeranged back to diabetes, even if only in my own brain -- and it was an incredible honor two years ago to talk with Mick Jones of Foreigner , who is a T2 D-peep himself! \nOne of my all-time faves has been classic rock legend Tom Petty, after I discovered my dad's old vinyl records in my early teen years and \" Free Fallin' \" became a mutually-loved tune that we bonded over. From then on, I attended countless Petty concerts over the years -- even more recently with my wife. \nNow, I'm among those mourning Petty's death on Oct. 2. \nHe was without doubt the most influential musician in my life, across the board. And some of his songs are, to me, perfect illustrations of my T1D life. \nHere's a snippet I wrote in November 2010, when I was poking some fun at diabetes with this musician in mind: Tom Petty can apparently tap into my soul and sing songs in the voice of my pancreas: Breakdown, go ahead and give it to me (insulin, of course!). You Don't Know How It Feels (to be diabetic). We all know the Waiting Is the Hardest Part when coming down from a High, but we don't want to find ourselves Free Falling way too Low. You Wreck Me, diabetes. When it comes right down to it, we people with diabetes just have to say Damn the Torpedoes and just step out Into the Great Wide Open to start Running Down a Dream. \nAnd in 2009, when I was working very hard to lower my A1C: As rock legend Tom Petty tells us, \" The Waiting is the Hardest Part... \" Indeed. The anticipation of knowing what the A1C result is can be daunting. It can feel as though you're Free Falling into an abyss of diabetic uncertainty, or that you might actually Breakdown. But, with the love and support of my American Girl, I continue Running Down A Dream that my A1C will reach that desired level. Then, I'll be able to smile in the mirror and say, \"'You Got Lucky,' Hoskins.\" This isn't your Last Dance, but the start of something great.... even a Great Wide Open land where great diabetes care isn't a worry, but a reality. \n\nAnd yes, there have been times I've referred to my lazy insulin organ as Tom \"My Pancreas\" Petty, in jest. \nAs you can probably imagine, I've been streaming Petty tunes almost non-stop since hearing the news, and my diabetes glucoaster has been penduluming high and low along with the song notes. \nRIP, Tom. \nDiabetes Community Says \nCurious what the commuity thought, we asked around on Facebook and Twitter about this very important topic of D-soundtracks. Here's what we heard from various D-peeps, starting right here at home: \n'Mine editor Amy Tenderich: I often think back to the '90s Madonna tune \" Over and Over ,\" along the lines of \"You Can Do This .\" \nKendra Gallagher Durdock, T1D in Pennsylvania: Tom Petty's \" Waiting \" is my song for when I am low waiting for my BG to respond! \nTom Webb, a T1D for 45 years, in South Carolina: \" Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" by U2 in regard to my hope for a cure someday. \nMelissa Lee, T1D for 31 years, in California : Sheryl Crow and \" Everyday is a Winding Road ,\" with the lyrics \u201c Everybody gets high, everybody gets low. These are the days when anything goes .\" \nAllison Marx, T1D for 17 years, in Georgia: \" A Little Bit Longer \" by the Jonas Brothers. \nD-Mom Paula Fairchild in Kentucky : In 2012, I organized the first Big Sandy 'walk to cure type 1 diabetes' for JDRF. It was the first-ever walk held in eastern Kentucky. The walk grew each year, and in its last year drew more than 720 people and raised $23,000... which is pretty phenomenal for rural eastern Kentucky and especially given that that summer we had devastating floods that took the lives of four people and destroyed 40 or more homes. The song, \" I Won't Back Down ,\" was one of my theme songs and that of many T1Ds I know personally. Very thankful for the years of musical talent that we were able to enjoy from Tom Petty. His legacy will live on. \nTom Goffe, T1D in North Carolina : A whole list of tunes come to mind -- Pat Benatar: \u201c Hit Me With Your Best Shot \u201d Tom Petty: \u201c Waiting (on an AIC) Is The Hardest Part \u201d Alabama: \u201c Close Enough to Perfect \u201d and \u201c Take Me Down \u201d B. B. King (who was a PWD himself): \u201d I\u2019ll Survive \u201d Blue Oyster Cult: \u201c Don\u2019t Fear The Reaper \u201d Boston: \u201c More Than A Feeling \u201d Bryan Adams\u2019 \u201c Let Me Down Easy \u201d \nD-Mom Sherry Kelly in New York: \"When my son was diagnosed with type 1 in 2014 when he was 11, it was the second time that type 1 diabetes entered my life... though there was a long absence in between. My dad passed away from T1D complications in 1982, when I was 11 years old. The song ' Pompeii ' by Bastille was popular in 2014 and it was played often on the radio. Devastated over my son's diagnosis, many of the lyrics described how I felt that night the endo pulled up a chair in ER and told us our son had diabetes. Hearing that song within the first several months was so difficult; I always had to change the station. More than 3-1/2 years later I still can't listen to it.\" \"I was left to my own devices Many days fell away with nothing to show And the walls kept tumbling down In the city that we love Grey clouds roll over the hills Bringing darkness from above But if you close your eyes Does it almost feel like Nothing changed at all? And if you close your eyes Does it almost feel like You've been here before?\" \nOriginal Music Vid: You may remember that in 2015, we at the 'Mine created our very own music video about not letting diabetes get you down, set to Tori Kelly's song Unbreakable Smile. \nMusical D-Talent: And of course, we also have some pretty amazing music talent in our D-Community -- both successful commercial artists including Nick Jonas (who sang about his diagnosis specifically), Adam Lasher, Valery, RaeLynn, Eric Pasley to home crooners who've created their own diabetes-versions of popular songs. \nYou can't forget the Type 1 D-Moms Song back in 2011, the cute kid version of \" All About the Cure \" made for a JDRF fundraiser, the Diabetic Danica \"Frozen\" adaption from 2014, and of course Melissa Lee's D-parodies that are SO worth checking out. \nIn scouring the Interwebz, we also found this lovely version of the Lukas Graham song \" 7 Years ,\" adapted to \" Once I Was 2 Years Old \" by a young lady named Sam Price, singing about her T1D diagnosis at such a young age. Pretty incredible stuff! \n\nOK, D-Friends : Any D-soundtrack suggestions you'd like to add here? Please drop us a comment below, or hit us up via or at Twitter or Facebook . \nAnd in the meantime, keep on rockin' your diabetes to whatever music fits your life appropriately.

Written by Gillian Mohney on October 12, 2017 The former football player who was convicted of murder was found to have CTE after his suicide. How would \u201clive CTE\u201d diagnoses affect such cases? Image Source: Jeffrey Beall | Flickr \nCould a \u201cliving\u201d diagnosis of a brain disorder affect the outcome of a trial? \nIn the case of former NFL player Aaron Hernandez, experts think it might have. Advertisement Advertisement \nIn 2015, the former tight end for the New England Patriots was convicted of murder. \nTwo years later, Hernandez died by suicide days after being acquitted in a second homicide case. \nAfter his death, Hernandez was found to have signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in his brain tissue. Advertisement \nJose Baez, the attorney for Hernandez\u2019s family, said the former player\u2019s CTE was \u201cthe most severe case they had ever seen in someone of Aaron\u2019s age,\u201d according to ESPN . Is CTE a defense? \nCTE is a degenerative disease known to cause a variety of side effects, including aggression, impulse control, and suicidality. Advertisement Advertisement \nThere\u2019s no cure for the disease. It can only be diagnosed posthumously with brain tissue. \nIn the wake of Hernandez\u2019s diagnosis, some have wondered if a definitive diagnosis during his lifetime would\u2019ve made a difference. \nA person with the disease may be at more risk for aggression. But it\u2019s still impossible to know if it\u2019s the person or disease responsible in the case of a murder or suicide. \nAmy Dillard, an associate professor of law at the University of Baltimore School of Law, said that a CTE diagnosis could\u2019ve affected Hernandez\u2019s trial. \nIn an opinion column published in The New York Times, Dillard and another law professor at Drexel University\u2019s Thomas R. Kline School of Law wrote that a recent study finding that 110 of 111 brains from NFL players had signs of CTE could be enough evidence to convince a jury of reasonable doubt. Advertisement Advertisement \nDillard told Healthline that with more information about CTE and its link to impulse control and aggression, a lawyer could make a case that Hernandez\u2019s condition affected his \u201ccriminal intent.\u201d \nDillard pointed out that in Massachusetts, prosecutors have to prove criminal responsibility beyond a reasonable doubt. \nIf a person has a disorder that affects their ability to develop criminal intent, that can lead a jury to decide if a person is not guilty by reason of insanity. Advertisement \n\u201cI might say [in court], \u2018I\u2019ve given you some scientific evidence about my client, he had these symptoms,\u2019\u201d Dillard said. \nShe explained she could then tell the jury they\u2019d have to look at the evidence of head injury and decide if it affected a defendant\u2019s ability to \u201cform criminal intent\u201d and \u201cto control his impulse to know what he was doing was right or wrong in that moment.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nShe pointed out that even without a specific test that could definitively \u201cprove\u201d a player had CTE before their death, in a court of law, the attorneys could bring up the possibility of the disorder as a reason to cast \u201creasonable doubt.\u201d \n\u201cThe lawyer\u2019s job is often to take those sorts of pillars of knowledge and connect them together so that the jury might understand,\u201d she said. A new test on the horizon? \nDoctors have had difficulty giving people even a suspected diagnosis of CTE because the symptoms can be caused by a variety of other conditions. Advertisement \nHowever, recent research has pointed to at least one way people at risk of CTE may finally be able to get a definitive diagnosis while still alive. \nResearchers from the CTE Center at Boston University School of Medicine concluded that a protein called CCL11 could be a biomarker that indicates a person has CTE. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe team tested brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid of 23 deceased NFL players with CTE, as well as 50 people who had Alzheimer\u2019s disease and 11 people who had neither condition. \nThey found that the players with CTE were far more likely to have this kind of protein in the spinal fluid and brain. \nHowever, it\u2019ll take more time and a much larger pool of data before that test could be considered effective for a CTE diagnosis. Why doctors can\u2019t diagnose CTE before death \nToday, medical experts say that despite the known risks for football players and other athletes with head injuries, it\u2019s still impossible to definitively tell someone they have CTE. \nDr. Michael De Georgia, director of the Neurocritical Care Center at UH Cleveland Medical Center,said despite advances, doctors still can\u2019t definitively diagnose a person with CTE until they\u2019ve examined their brain posthumously. \n\u201cThere was a case [of] Todd Ewen,\u201d De Georgia recalled. \u201cHe\u2019d been playing hockey his entire life and he also developed cognitive problems.\u201d \nEwen developed \u201cmemory loss, chronic body pain, diabetes and undiagnosed depression,\u201d according to a report released by the Krembil Neuroscience Centre\u2019s Canadian Concussion Centre. \nEwen eventually died by suicide in 2016. However, doctors found no sign of CTE when they examined his brain. \n\u201cWe were very surprised by the results, as we were sure Todd must have had CTE,\u201d Kelli Ewen said in a statement about her husband released by the concussion center. \u201cWe hope that anyone suffering from the effects of concussion takes heart that their symptoms are not an automatic diagnosis of CTE. Depression coupled with other disorders can have many of the same symptoms as CTE.\u201d \nDe Georgia said doctors have learned much more about CTE in recent years. He pointed out they now classify the disease into four stages, which can help them treat patients: Stage 1. The earliest stage can lead to headaches, difficulty paying attention, short-term memory problems, among other symptoms, according to a published report by Boston University. Stage 2. This stage can build on the previous symptoms with \u201cdepression, explosivity, and short-term memory loss.\u201d Stage 3. In this stage, a patient may start to also exhibit cognitive dysfunction and executive impairment. Stage 4. During this final stage, patients may have \u201cdementia, word-finding difficulty, and aggression,\u201d according to the report. \nDe Georgia said doctors try to rule out other causes of these symptoms so that the patients can get the best care possible. \nBut without a better method of testing, he said they can\u2019t definitively tell people whether or not they have CTE and what their symptoms will be in the future. \n\u201cCertainly, if your patient is a professional football player with a history of multiple concussions, you\u2019d be attuned to CTE,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not always the case. It\u2019s very difficult to tease out.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aaron hernandez", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "gillian mohney", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "aaron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael de georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy dillard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dillard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hernandez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelli ewen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ewen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "todd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey beall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose baez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "todd ewen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "drexel university\u2019s thomas r. kline school of law", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krembil neuroscience centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uh cleveland medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neurocritical care center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "espn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of baltimore school of law", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england patriots", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston university school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cte center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T23:50:10.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "092043379de3d842244137cbf8dc2ea604d69366", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StaYXxBFVGaAH4BaZe8KisQcxbVGGQe4DW6Az8MX05fQFc6C_8UME8CQQ", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Diabetes Drug Can Now Be Used to Treat Obesity", "title_full": "Diabetes Drug Can Now Be Used to Treat Obesity", "published": "2017-10-12T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.236, "main_image": "https://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/Diabetes/3101-weight_scale-766x415-thumbnail.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 30, "comments": 0, "shares": 30}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 15}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "092043379de3d842244137cbf8dc2ea604d69366", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StaYXxBFVGaAH4BaZe8KisQcxbVGGQe4DW6Az8MX05fQFc6C_8UME8CQQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Written Ginger Vieira", "published": "2017-10-12T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Diabetes Drug Can Now Be Used to Treat Obesity", "text": "Diabetes Drug Can Now Be Used to Treat Obesity Written by Ginger Vieira on October 12, 2017 Researchers say liraglutide, which is sold as both Victoza and now Saxenda, can be used to help with weight loss as well as type 2 diabetes. \nMore than one-third of the United States\u2019 population qualifies as \u201cobese.\u201d \nThat means the pursuit for a pharmaceutical weight loss drug has only become more intense. Advertisement Advertisement \nAnd there\u2019s some encouraging news on this front. \nA recently published study from the Mayo Clinic reports that a pharmaceutical weight loss drug already exists and has proven to be effective, even in those who are obese. \nLiraglutide is a prescription medication that is self-administered via injection once per day. Advertisement \nIt was originally created to treat type 2 diabetes under the brand name Victoza , manufactured by Novo Nordisk. \n\u201cOur paper shows that liraglutide, administered for 3 months at the approved dose of 3 milligrams per day, was associated with an average weight loss of 12 pounds compared to an average 6.6-pound weight loss for patients receiving a placebo,\u201d explained Dr. Michael Camilleri, a gastroenterologist at Mayo Clinic and a senior author of the study. Advertisement \nIn order to prescribe this medication specifically for weight loss, healthcare providers encountered an obstacle. \nInsurance companies would only cover Victoza for people with an indication of diabetes or prediabetes. \nBeing obese does not necessarily mean a person has diabetes, so there\u2019s a hurdle to jump in order to prescribe the drug for weight loss. \nConsequently, Novo Nordisk rebranded liraglutide as Saxenda and categorized it as a weight loss drug, resulting in the same drug with two different names and with two primary purposes. \nAnd for many patients, it works. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cLiraglutide appears to be very effective in inducing weight loss over three months of treatment,\u201d Camilleri told Healthline. How drug helps you lose weight \nEssentially, liraglutide works like the hormone GLP-1, which is released from the small intestine during and after meals. \nThis is the framework for many other diabetes medications , such as exenatide (Byetta/Bydureon), lixisenatide (Lyxumia), albiglutide (Tanzeum), and dulaglutide (Trulicity). Advertisement \nHowever, these other medications have not yet proven in research to aid in weight loss as effectively as liraglutide. \nFor patients on the drug for its original purpose \u2014 improving blood sugar levels \u2014liraglutide works in three specific ways: Advertisement Advertisement It slows down the rate at which food leaves your stomach and empties into your small intestine for further digestion, which helps to prevent blood sugar spikes after eating. It helps to prevent your liver from producing and releasing too much sugar (glycogen). It helps your pancreas produce more insulin. \nThe aspect of the stomach emptying more slowly is what leads to weight loss in people who do not have diabetes. \n\u201cIn clinical practice,\u201d explained Camilleri, \u201cmeasurement of stomach emptying at five weeks may serve as a biomarker to determine which patients should continue on the treatment and which patients might be better candidates for other weight loss treatments.\u201d \nThe most notable side effect reported by patients is nausea, but this is also what helps people lose weight due to the nausea\u2019s reducing effect on appetite. Advertisement \n\u201cIt is essential to titrate the dose up slowly, over five weeks,\u201d said Camilleri, \u201cand to \u2018pause\u2019 for patients to become less nauseated with treatment dose before escalating by 0.6 milligrams every week.\u201d \nCamilleri adds that taking liraglutide if you don\u2019t have diabetes doesn\u2019t seem to result in hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Advertisement Advertisement \nBesides their names, the only true difference between Saxenda and Victoza is in the dosages \u2014 both of which are delivered via injection with Novo Nordisk\u2019s Flexpen device. \nFor patients prescribed the drug under the name Victoza for diabetes management, doses in a Flexpen can be adjusted gradually up to as high as 1.2 milligrams per day. When prescribed specifically for weight loss, Saxenda can be adjusted up 3 milligrams per day. \nSome insurance coverage may require a note from the doctor, says Camilleri, explaining that all other weight loss approaches to achieve \u201cclinically meaningful weight loss\u201d have failed, especially when other obesity-related comorbidities are present. Can drug help non-obese patients? \n\u201cWe use Victoza a lot,\u201d explained Marcey Robinson MS, RD, CSSD, BC-ADM , co-founder of Achieve Health & Performance in Colorado. \nThe company\u2019s clients include patients with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been using liraglutide with my patients since 2005,\u201d Robinson told Healthline. \u201cIn terms of the GLP-1 drugs, it\u2019s become the \u2018go-to\u2019 for weight loss.\u201d \nIn her practice, Robinson says she sees success when using liraglutide in patients with prediabetes who need to lose a little weight, reduce their HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin test), and in a sense, \u201cre-set themselves.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s not a miracle drug, but it does make it easier for people to lose weight because they aren\u2019t as hungry between meals. And they feel full more quickly, to the point that if they do overeat they will feel sick,\u201d explains Robinson. \nIf a patient is experiencing strong symptoms of nausea, Robinson continues their current dose for at least two weeks, giving their body time to adjust to the medication before making another increase. \nAnother important part of preventing nausea is simply eating less. Robinson instructs all her patients to begin by putting two to three fewer tablespoons of food on their plate in order to avoid any gastrointestinal distress. \n\u201cFor weight loss, it works,\u201d said Robinson. \nBut that weight loss comes not without effort. \nBoth Robinson and Camilleri emphasize that liraglutide should be used in conjunction with behavioral changes around nutrition and exercise. \nDue to how expensive liraglutide is, whether prescribed as Saxenda or Victoza, many insurance providers will not cover the drug unless the patient is enrolled in a weight loss program. \nCertain people, particularly men, seem to be able to eat through that \u201cfullness\u201d feeling, preventing them from successfully losing weight. \nRobinson recalls a male patient who only lost three or four pounds on the drug and eventually gained it back. \n\u201cBut I see other patients where it completely changes their metabolism, and they\u2019re able to eat less, cut their calories, and lose weight,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a patient who was diagnosed with prediabetes; then she was diagnosed with type 2. She was drinking a half or full bottle of wine nearly every night, eating a lot of junk food, a very unhealthy lifestyle. When she started taking Victoza, she stopped drinking, changed her diet, started exercising. She lost 40 pounds in 6 months.\u201d \nUnfortunately, for those who just want to \u201cdrop a few pounds,\u201d getting insurance coverage may be nearly impossible. \n\u201cSome insurance policies will require that you have an indication for weight loss with a BMI [body mass index] greater than 30 to be prescribed Saxenda, or greater than 28 with comorbidity diagnoses,\u201d explained Robinson. \nThis insurance obstacle means a percentage of the U.S. population will have to rely on good old-fashioned willpower, nutritional changes, and exercise in order to slim down. \nEditor\u2019s note: Ginger Vieira is an expert patient living with type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and fibromyalgia.

Advertisement Advertisement \nAn Australian blogger, Belle Gibson, was recently fined more than 410,000 Australian dollars ($320,000) for misleading the public with claims she had cured her own cancer. \nGibson said she had healed her multiple cancers, including terminal brain cancer, by eating whole foods. \nGibson also went on to publish a book, \u201cThe Whole Pantry,\u201d and a corresponding smartphone app. Advertisement \nHer social media empire and the sales of her book and smartphone app earned Gibson AU$420,000. \nIt was then revealed by authorities that Gibson never had cancer. Earlier this year, she was found guilty of misleading and deceptive conduct in an Australian court. Advertisement Advertisement \nWhen handing down her judgement , Australian Federal Court Justice Debbie Mortimer said, \u201cIf there is one theme or pattern which emerges through her conduct, it is her relentless obsession with herself and what best serves her interests.\u201d Taking advantage of people \nGibson\u2019s case, however, is just one example of the many hucksters who take advantage of people\u2019s vulnerability. \nRobert Goldberg, PhD, vice president and co-founder of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, says it\u2019s an all too familiar tale. \n\u201cScaring people with uncertainty about risks is a good business model for people like Belle Gibson. Gibson, like\u2026 many others, cashed in by scaring people about the dangers of just eating and breathing and then offering their own cure for the dangers they heralded,\u201d he told Healthline. \nIn the age of social media, people like Gibson are able to build a high profile in a short period of time, but Goldberg says the idea of promoting quick fixes for illness has been around for a long time. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cThis is nothing new. People have always sought protection from demons and dangers from those peddling quick fixes, especially those who position themselves as knowing what those demons are,\u201d he said. \nThe internet has for many people become the first point of reference for a medical question. \nA 2013 survey by Pew Research Center reported that one in three adults in the United States say they go online to try to find the cause of their medical condition, or the medical condition of someone else.

Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cThere is an incredible amount of health information at our fingertips. Most of it is good. However, it is still very easy to get flooded with information that is accurate but not true,\u201d he said. \nThe problem with seeking out medical advice online, Goldberg says, is that it can reinforce inaccurate views or biases. \n\u201cIn the words of Simon and Garfunkel, people hear what they want to hear, and they disregard the rest. It\u2019s good to ask questions, and in some cases you can tell your doctor about new treatments or studies that they might not have seen. But in general, before doing so, it\u2019s good to take a step back and ask ourselves, are we confirming our own biases or fears in the process?\u201d Goldberg said. Advertisement \u2018Dr. Google\u2019 will see you now \nLast year, researchers from Harvard Medical School set about comparing real doctors with online symptom checkers. \nThe team sent 45 hypothetical patient scenarios, including medical history and list of symptoms, to 234 doctors and 23 online symptoms checkers. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe doctors weren\u2019t allowed to conduct blood tests or examine the patients and could only work off notes. \nThe researchers found that the doctors were correct in their first diagnosis 72 percent of the time compared with 34 percent for the online options. \nDr. Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, a practicing internist and past president of the American College of Physicians, says despite the obvious benefits of seeing a doctor in person, patients are still likely to consult the internet before or after a visit. \n\u201cDr. Google is already in the exam room whether we like it or not. Information is powerful but is only as good as its source. Make sure the information comes from a trusted source. Be discerning. Ask your doctor for trusted websites,\u201d she told Healthline. \nAs for cases like Gibson\u2019s, Fryhofer warns people to be critical of quick-fix remedies and bold claims. \n\u201cIf it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Talk to your doctor. Don\u2019t believe everything you read on the internet. Not only can untested remedies not help you, they might hurt you. Don\u2019t be a guinea pig,\u201d she said.

Written by Shawn Radcliffe on October 12, 2017 High prescription drug prices may be forcing people to skip the medicines they need to treat and manage their health conditions. \nAs prescription drug prices continue to rise, more people are being forced to choose between paying for their medications and buying basic necessities. \nAbout one-quarter of people in the United States said they have difficulty affording their medications, according to a 2016 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe report also showed that overall prescription drug prices increased 8 percent in 2015, mainly due to new drugs, higher costs for existing drugs, and fewer drug patents expiring. \nThe list prices for the most commonly used brand-name drugs increased almost 208 percent between 2008 and 2016. \nHowever, during the same time, generic drug prices fell about 74 percent. Advertisement \nSome people pay more for their prescription drugs, while others pay less, depending on what their health insurance plan covers. In 2015 the average out-of-pocket spending was $142 per person. \nAmong traditional therapies, diabetes medications were the most expensive, in terms of out-of-pocket costs. This was followed by drugs for pain and inflammatory conditions, high blood cholesterol, and ADHD. Advertisement Advertisement \nFor specialty drugs, out-of-pocket costs were highest for drugs used to treat inflammatory conditions, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and HIV. People skip pricy meds \nHigh prescription drug prices offer a harsh economic lesson \u2014 as the out-of-pocket cost goes up, the number of people using the drug often goes down. \nIn a recent study in JAMA Cardiology, researchers saw this happen with people who were approved by their insurer to fill a prescription for alirocumab or evolocumab , two new specialty drugs for treating elevated \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol levels. \nCo-pays for these drugs ranged from $0 to $2,822 per month. \nAlmost 93 percent of people with no co-pay filled their prescription. This dropped to 20 to 25 percent for people with a co-pay over $350 per month. Advertisement Advertisement \nA group of researchers from the Cleveland Clinic found a similar trend with two common heart medications \u2014 nitroprusside and isoproterenol. \nIn a letter to the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers reported that between 2012 and 2015 the cost of nitroprusside increased from about $27 to $881. The cost of isoproterenol increased from about $26 to $1,790. \nDuring this time, patient use of these drugs decreased by 53 percent and 35 percent, respectively. Advertisement \nFor people struggling to make ends meet, the cost of prescription drugs may have already reached a tipping point. \nAccording to a recent Truven Health Analytics-NPR Health Poll , people with annual incomes under $25,000 were more likely to not fill a prescription, compared to people with higher incomes. Almost all of the lower-income people cited high cost as the reason. Advertisement Advertisement \nBut this group isn\u2019t alone. \n\u201cHigh drug prices appear to affect everyone across the socioeconomic spectrum. So it\u2019s not just low-income people who are having these issues,\u201d Minal Patel, PhD, MPH, an assistant professor in the University of Michigan School of Public Health, told Healthline. \nPatel added that this is especially true \u201cin the context of severe, acute illnesses like cancer, or major chronic diseases.\u201d Advertisement \nThese conditions are often treated with newer \u2014 and more expensive \u2014 specialty medications, which may not be fully covered by insurance. High drug prices impact health \nWhen faced with high out-of-pocket costs, people may opt to skip their medications. Advertisement Advertisement \nThis can worsen their health and quality of life. It may also lead to higher medical costs down the road. \n\u201cThere have been some studies showing that people who cut back on medicines are at increased risk for hospitalizations and emergency department visits, which we know are very expensive forms of care,\u201d said Patel. \nSome research estimates that when people don\u2019t take their medications as prescribed for a chronic health condition, it costs the U.S. health care system between $100 billion and $289 billion annually. \nThis includes people not filling their prescriptions due to high cost, skipping doses, or cutting their pills in half to make them last longer. It also includes people forgetting to take their medications or not taking them because of side effects. \nOther studies on Medicare enrollees found that older adults sometimes cut back on basic needs such as food in order to pay for their medications. \nAlthough high drug costs can deter people from taking their medications, lower costs can have the opposite effect. \nA 2016 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that older women who received Medicare Part D subsidies were more likely to continue hormonal therapy after breast cancer surgery. \nPeople facing high drug costs have many options for lowering their out-of-pocket payments, including rebates from drug companies and prescription assistance programs . \nThe problem is finding out what works for your situation. \n\u201cPeople don\u2019t always know about everything that\u2019s available to them,\u201d said Patel. \u201cI think we need better structures to help people understand what they qualify for and what\u2019s available to them.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shawn radcliffe", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "minal patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kaiser family foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of michigan school of public health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland clinic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "truven health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england journal of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jama cardiology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T23:50:32.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1e55c73c115ba357b415e901315c89d44e66d482", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4Staa7ZPqLEE19U8Er1mGpW2sUoFtU8KW9nwluUIheur7x5xD0A0rlmaEMzboxoi0K7iBIk_RRppwxAX8vb6glKPu2", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Should Parents Be Punished for Not Vaccinating Their Children?", "title_full": "Should Parents Be Punished for Not Vaccinating Their Children?", "published": "2017-10-13T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.177, "main_image": "https://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/childrens-health/2935-rebecca_bredow-766x415-thumbnail.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 101, "comments": 0, "shares": 101}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1e55c73c115ba357b415e901315c89d44e66d482", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4Staa7ZPqLEE19U8Er1mGpW2sUoFtU8KW9nwluUIheur7x5xD0A0rlmaEMzboxoi0K7iBIk_RRppwxAX8vb6glKPu2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Written Bob Curley", "published": "2017-10-13T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Should Parents Be Punished for Not Vaccinating Their Children?", "text": "Should Parents Be Punished for Not Vaccinating Their Children? Written by Bob Curley on October 13, 2017 A Michigan mother was sent to jail for disobeying a judge's order on her son's vaccination. As the vaccine debate heats up, there may be more cases like this. \nA Michigan mother recently spent a week in jail. \nShe also lost custody rights to her 9-year-old son. Advertisement Advertisement \nWhy? \nShe refused to vaccinate her child as part of a custody agreement with her former husband. \nAlthough this was a contempt of court case , it does put a spotlight on the potential legal pitfalls for parents who oppose vaccinations. Advertisement \nRebecca Bredow had primary custody of her son, but she was held in contempt of court for failing to live up to the terms of a custody agreement. \nThat agreement stipulated that she keep her son\u2019s vaccinations up to date. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cI\u2019m a passionate mother who cares deeply about my children, their health and their well-being,\u201d Bredow, who cited religious objections to vaccination, said in court. \u201cIf my child was forced to be vaccinated, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it.\u201d \nHowever, the judge in the case granted the child\u2019s father temporary custody and ordered the vaccinations to take place. \nThe Michigan case centered on the custody issue, not vaccination per se \u2014 the judge made no formal ruling for or against vaccination. \n\u201c[The case] is fundamentally about custody, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s irrelevant that the dispute between the parents is over vaccination,\u201d attorney Mary Holland, director of the graduate lawyering program at the New York University School of Law, told Healthline. \nHolland is also a member of the legal advisory board of the World Mercury Project, which opposes mandatory vaccination. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cThe notion that the court would take away primary custody from the custodial parent based solely on the issue of one parent\u2019s decision not to vaccinate in a nonemergency situation \u2014 that\u2019s pretty unusual,\u201d Holland said. \nBut Holland expects that similar cases, pitting pro-vaccination and anti-vaccination parents against each other, are likely to follow. \n\u201cAs more people question the vaccine schedules established by the states, more people are going to say \u2018no, thanks,\u2019 and I think that you\u2019ll see more cases like this,\u201d she said. Advertisement What states require \nAll 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia require that school-age children be vaccinated against childhood diseases. \nHowever, as of 2016, nearly all the states allow parents an exemption if they oppose vaccination on religious grounds. Advertisement Advertisement \nIn addition, 18 states permit exemptions on moral or philosophical grounds, such as the belief that vaccines contain dangerous ingredients, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. \nCalifornia, West Virginia, and Mississippi are the only states that don\u2019t allow such exemptions. \nFollowing a measles outbreak in 2015, California passed one of the strictest mandatory vaccination laws in the country. Advertisement \nIt requires that all children attending school in the state have up-to-date vaccinations for 10 diseases: tetanus, diphtheria, measles, pertussis, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, influenza B, polio, and chickenpox. \nUnder the California law, unvaccinated children are barred from attending public or private schools, as well as day care programs. The only permitted exemptions are for medical reasons. Advertisement Advertisement Possible consequences \nTo date, having to choose between vaccination and sending their children to school is the biggest legal consequence facing most \u201canti-vax\u201d parents. \nThere haven\u2019t been any liability lawsuits filed against parents who failed to vaccinate their children, said Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, a professor of law at University of California Hastings College of the Law who writes frequently about vaccination policy and law. \n\u201cNon-vaccination was pretty rare until the \u201980s and \u201990s, so we haven\u2019t had enough preventable disease transmission to raise a lot of claims,\u201d Reiss told Healthline. \n\u201cIf we have more harm caused by this, it\u2019s inevitable that a lawsuit will happen at some point,\u201d added Reiss. \u201cI don\u2019t think lawsuits are a very strong deterrent, but I think it is important to have compensation for the child, who shouldn\u2019t have to pay the price for these decisions.\u201d \nDespite the absence of lawsuits, there has been a heated debate in legal circles about the potential liability of parents who don\u2019t vaccinate. \n\u201cIf you know the dangers of measles or for that matter whooping cough or mumps, and you still choose to put others at risk, should you be exempt from the consequences of that choice?\u201d asked Art Caplan, PhD, head of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University Langone Medical Center, in a 2013 post on the Harvard Law School\u2019s Bill of Health blog. \nHowever, filing such claims is \u201chard for a number of different reasons,\u201d said Reiss. \nChildren who get sick because their parents didn\u2019t vaccinate them could file a negligence or battery lawsuit, but \u201cemotionally it\u2019s very hard to sue your parents,\u201d she noted. \nMany states also have parental immunity statues that prevent such lawsuits. \nHowever, Reiss said that such a lawsuit would have a high chance of success if based on the parental duty to provide reasonable care to their children, such as providing the measles vaccine, which has a high efficacy rate. \n\u201cIt would be very easy to show that if parents did vaccinate, then the child would not have gotten measles,\u201d she said. Affecting others \nIn theory, parents of children infected by unvaccinated kids \u2014 or even communities \u2014 also could sue for liability, but again the law sets up significant roadblocks, said Reiss. \n\u201cNormally you don\u2019t have to take action to protect others,\u201d she said. \nBystanders, for example, can\u2019t be sued for failing to help the victims of a car crash. \nReiss said that an exception could be made to this \u201cduty to act\u201d standard if plaintiffs argued that anti-vaccination parents weren\u2019t passive observers but rather took deliberate or negligent actions that caused harm. \nLawmakers also could carve out a legal exception to make such lawsuits easier. \nAttorney Teri Dobbins Baxter, writing in the University of Cincinnati Law Review, argued that parents\u2019 rights not to vaccinate does \u201cnot absolve them of their duty to exercise ordinary care to prevent causing harm to others.\u201d \nEven then, however, proving causation could be a challenge in court, Reiss and Holland agreed. \n\u201cEven in the California measles outbreak at Disneyland, investigators never tracked down \u2018Patient Zero,\u2019\u201d said Holland. \u201cIt\u2019s not always plainly identifiable where the infection came from.\u201d \n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about liability, but I haven\u2019t seen it go very far,\u201d she added. \nLiability for the manufacturers of vaccines is somewhat limited. \nThe National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 prohibited liability lawsuits against manufacturers in certain categories such as design defects. Manufacturers, however, can be liable for issues such as manufactoring errors. \nThe act also set up a compensation fund for victims of vaccine-related injuries. The fund is paid for through excise taxes. \nThe fund has paid out $3.5 billion in claims since its inception, although only about one in three filed claims gets compensated.

Advertisement \nOn the surface, they may all seem happy, cordial, and eager. \nThat\u2019s why the story of SNL cast member Pete Davidson may surprise you. \nThe 23-year-old actor who has a sly grin and booming voice has been with SNL since 2014. Advertisement \nLast year, he announced he was struggling with pot use, chronic depression, and mental health issues. \n\u201cI started having these mental breakdowns where I would, like, freak out and then not remember what happened after,\u201d the Staten Island native told Marc Maron on his podcast, WTF with Marc Maron last month. Advertisement Advertisement \nDavidson took a break from the show last December and decided to check into a rehabilitation program. \nThinking his chronic pot use might be related to mental breakdowns and unusual emotional reactions, he thought quitting could correct his issues. \n\u201cI used to smoke weed all day every day until last year, for eight years,\u201d Davidson told Maron. \nIn rehab, Davidson found more help than just kicking his pot habit. He also found a possible explanation for the symptoms that seemed to plague him for so long. \n\u201cThey told me there, they're like, \u2018You might be bipolar,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018OK,\u2019\u201d he recalled to Maron. \u201cSo they're like, \u2018We\u2019re gonna try you on these meds.\u2019\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nHe soon left rehab with a prescription \u2014 but started smoking again. \nTwo months later, Davidson says he \u201cjust snapped\u201d and had one of the worst mental breakdowns he\u2019d ever experienced. \nHe returned to a rehabilitation program and announced on his Instagram that he was \u201chappy and sober for the first time in eight years.\u201d Advertisement \nBut the euphoria of sobriety didn\u2019t last. \nIn May 2017, Davidson was still struggling with his mental health issues and emotional turmoil. Advertisement Advertisement \nSoon after a visit to his doctor, he received a new diagnosis. \n\u201cI found out I have BPD, which is borderline personality disorder,\u201d he explained to Maron. \u201cOne of my psychiatrists [diagnosed me]. He was always saying before this big meltdown, \u2018You\u2019re probably bipolar or borderline. We\u2019re just going to have to figure it out.\u2019\u201d What is borderline personality disorder? \nBorderline personality disorder (BPD) is \u201ca severe mental illness which involves difficulties relating to other people in a meaningful way, unstable self-esteem, impulsivity, inability to control mood, and a strong impulse to harm yourself,\u201d explains Elena Mikalsen, PhD, a clinical psychologist in Texas. Advertisement \n\u201cIndividuals who suffer from BPD are often unable to have stable relationships with family, friends, or partners,\u201d she told Healthline. \u201cThey struggle to trust anyone and feel they will be abandoned or betrayed by another person at any time.\u201d \nAs a child, Davidson felt that sting all too personally. Advertisement Advertisement \nOn September 11, 2001, his father, a New York City firefighter, died while trying to rescue people after the terrorist attacks that day. \n\u201cMy big thing is trust,\u201d Davidson told Maron. \u201cOne day he was here and the next day he was gone.\u201d \n\u201cIt is certainly possible that the loss of one's father through a traumatic event such as 9/11 could impact one's mental health, and life in general,\u201d said Anthony P. DeMaria, PhD, a licensed clinical psychologist in New York and a clinical professor at Mt. Sinai\u2019s Icahn School of Medicine. \u201cThough it is impossible to say that someone's diagnosis of BPD is accounted for by any one factor, events like the tragic loss of a father could definitely play their part in the disorder's development and expression.\u201d \nBut DeMaria, who is also currently a supervising psychologist at Mt. Sinai Roosevelt\u2019s Center for Intensive Treatment for Personality Disorders, cautions that there\u2019s no one causal factor for BPD. \n\u201cBiologically, we know that BPD has a genetic and heritable component, [which] shows itself differently and at different rates between men and women,\u201d he told Healthline. \u201cAlso, it's been shown that individuals with BPD demonstrate different brain activity than non-clinical populations when experiencing emotional pain, forming and ending relationships, responding to stress, etc. Psychologically, factors such as black-and-white thinking style, abilities to self-soothe and regulate emotions, and level of emotional reactivity, seem to correlate with BPD.\u201d \n\u201cFinally, individuals with BPD have higher reported rates of traumatic experiences, chaotic family or early development environments, and life stressors such as loss, abuse, and neglect,\u201d DeMaria explained. Living with borderline personality disorder \nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all treatment for BPD. \nIt\u2019s also almost certain that symptom management will last through a person\u2019s lifetime. \nTreatment for BPD is often designed specifically for each individual person, Mikalsen says. \nThe primary focuses involve teaching skills to control intense emotions, reduce self-destructive behaviors, and improve relationships. \n\u201cThe vast majority of individuals who engage in long-term treatment for BPD experience symptom remission,\u201d DeMaria said. \u201cIt is important, though, to acknowledge that BPD is a complicated and extremely challenging disorder, which often takes years of treatment to overcome.\u201d \nDavidson isn\u2019t hiding his diagnosis. \nHe\u2019s been public about his addiction issues and depression for almost a year and now he\u2019s talking openly about BPD. \n\u201cIt is working, slowly but surely,\u201d he told Maron. \u201cI've been having a lot of problems. This whole year has been a f\u2014ing nightmare. This has been the worst year of my life, getting diagnosed with this and trying to figure out how to learn with this and live with this.\u201d \nIn early October, Davidson sat down with the anchors of SNL\u2019s satirical news program, \u201c Weekend Update ,\u201d and told co-anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che about his diagnosis. \n\u201cAs some of you may know, I was recently diagnosed with BPD, a form of depression,\u201d he said. \u201cDepression affects like 16 million people in this country, and there\u2019s no cure per se, but for anyone dealing [with] it, there are treatments that can help.\u201d \nIt should be noted that the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) doesn\u2019t consider BPD a form of depression, although one of the many symptoms of BPD is depression. \nIn fact, NIMH classifies BPD as a condition of its own right. Other symptoms include extreme mood swings, intense fears about rejection, and self-injurious behaviors. \nNonetheless, during his \u201cWeekend Update\u201d skit, Davidson delivered poignant advice to others who struggle as he has, couched with a few lines for laughter. \n\u201cFirst of all, if you think you\u2019re depressed, see a doctor and talk to them about medication. Also, be healthy. Eating right and exercise can make a huge difference,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd finally, if you\u2019re in the cast of a late-night comedy show, it might help if they do more of your sketches.\u201d \n\u201cAre you saying that you are depressed because you are not getting enough airtime?\u201d Jost asked. \n\u201cNo, I was born depressed, but it might make me feel better if I was on TV more,\u201d Davidson replied. \nDavidson even pulled out a \u201cdoctor\u2019s note\u201d outlining what SNL could do to help his condition. \nThe suggestions included \u201cplease use Pete in more sketches where he gets to kiss the host\u201d and \u201cuse more of his rap videos.\u201d \nThese lines did what they were intended to do for Davidson and fans \u2014 give a face to a serious condition, offer help to those who feel lost, and make you laugh at the same time.

We thank you all for keeping our mailbag full of great queries! \n{ Got your questions about navigating life with diabetes? Email us at } \n\nShannon, 'diabetes curious' from New York, writes: Hi. I have a question regarding the expiration of diabetes checking equipment. The one I have is OneTouch Ultra 2. The expiration date on it is on 11/2016. My question is, is it safe to use this equipment after the expiration date? I tried to research, but I couldn\u2019t get a proper answer. Kindly help me with this. And I\u2019m not diabetic, I just thought I\u2019d check my diabetes level. \nWil@Ask D\u2019Mine answers: Safe? You betcha. Accurate? Hell, no. Test strips can be stretched a bit and still work OK, but almost a year is too much of a stretch. The results you\u2019d get from test strips that far out of date will be wrong. They might be artificially high or artificially low. Either way, you won\u2019t get the information you need. \nThe best way to \u201ccheck your diabetes level\u201d is to get screened for diabetes at your doctor\u2019s office or county health office. And that\u2019s a good idea. Whether you have a family history, diabetes-like symptoms, or simply idle curiosity, screening makes sense. Diabetes is one of those things that\u2019s best intercepted and dealt with at the earliest possible moment. \nYou can read more about why glucose test strips have a limited shelf life in one of my July columns here , and in even more detail from 2014 here . \n\nMaria, type 2 from Canada, writes: My husband and I are on holidays & I put my only refill of Lantus in the hotel fridge and it froze. Can I still use it in the morning when I wake up? I have 16 units left in my old refill & I need 5 more units for Thursday & 21 units for Friday. Thank you in advance! \nWil@Ask D\u2019Mine answers: Damn. I hate it when things like that happen. The official CDE-certified, doctor-approved, Pharma-blessed answer is: No. You can\u2019t use it because it probably won\u2019t work right. \nTh t said\u2026\u2026 \nIf you were at home, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not worth it, pitch it out. But as you are on the road and getting insulin can be tricky when traveling, I think there\u2019s no harm in trying. It\u2019s not like freezing it is going to turn it into a poison. It might keep it from working as well. Or it might keep it from working at all. I suppose there\u2019s a remote chance it might make it work faster or more powerfully if the freezing process broke down the suspension chemicals and not the insulin proteins, although I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing happening. \nSorry. That was a long-winded way of saying that\u2014so long as you monitor your blood sugar frequently and avoid high carb foods\u2014I don\u2019t see a downside to thawing it out and giving it a try, especially as you really only need a splat to get you through the rest of your vacation. \nOh, and for what it\u2019s worth, I wouldn\u2019t give the same advice to a type 1. Well\u2026 Maybe I would, but with a lot more warnings. As a T2, if it doesn\u2019t work out, a day of high blood sugar won\u2019t kill you. \nThe same can\u2019t be said for us T1s, because you know... DKA . \nFor more on frozen (and freezing!) insulin check out our archives from 2013 and read \u201cInsulin on the Rocks.\u201d If nothing else, you\u2019ll love the photos. \n\nGina, type 3 from Connecticut, writes: My Dad recently passed away and I have insulin (Lantus) and individual supplies... any suggestions on what to do with them? \nWil@Ask D\u2019Mine answers: I\u2019m sorry for your loss, and I think it\u2019s wonderful that at a time like this you can think of the needs of others. In fact, the need for helping people right now is at a critical point with all the devastation caused by natural disasters in the Gulf Coast and surrounding southern states, in Mexico and especially right now in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean Islands. \nMany options exist (see this recent resource roundup ). But the best bet is probably to send it to Insulin for Life USA , a well-regarded outfit that redistributes orphan unopened, unexpired insulin and other supplies to the Third World. It\u2019s too bad we can\u2019t help people closer to home more easily, but prescribing laws and such in the USA make it nearly impossible for organizations to do that. In fact, when the Insulin for Life people here in the USA wanted to help out Hurricane Harvey victims, they encountered monstrous red tape! Thankfully, it all worked out , but it shows you how messed up our system is. \nStill, while we can\u2019t always help our neighbors, sending your dad\u2019s supplies to Insulin for Life will, really and truly, save other lives globally. And that\u2019s a great legacy. \nThis is not a medical advice column.

Advertisement Advertisement \nMore people are flying with their pets. \nA recent survey found that 53 percent of travelers take their pets on the road \u2014 or in the skies \u2014 with them. \nEmotional support animal or not, people flying with pets seem to win out over travelers who complain about pet allergies. Advertisement \nEven if a passenger isn\u2019t booted from a flight for complaining, allergies to dogs and cats can make a long trip uncomfortable or miserable. As many as 30 percent of Americans have pet allergies. \nAllergists know that a cat is much more allergy-inducing than a dog. Advertisement Advertisement \nPeople are approximately twice as likely to be allergic to Fluffy than Fido. Cats also trigger more severe allergic symptoms than dogs, according to Dr. Janna Tuck, an allergist and spokesperson for the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) . \nSomeone with mild allergies might get an itchy or running nose, congestion, itchy eyes, or swollen eyelids. \nPeople with severe symptoms could break out in hives if they touch a dog or cat. \nThe woman kicked off the Southwest flight allegedly said she had a \u201clife-threatening\u201d allergy to dogs. Many skeptical commenters questioned whether that\u2019s actually possible. \nThe answer: Yes, pet allergies can be pretty terrifying and, in the worst-case scenario, cause death. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cA lot of people have allergies to pets, but for some people it\u2019s a trigger for asthma,\u201d Sanaz Eftekhari, a spokesperson for the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) , noted. \nThat can lead to coughing, wheezing, or even an asthma attack. \n\u201cSome people who don\u2019t have any asthma or allergies, or don\u2019t know someone who does, don\u2019t understand that dogs and cats actually can be a life-threatening allergy,\u201d Eftekhari told Healthline. Advertisement \nAvoiding these symptoms when sharing a space with an animal is nearly impossible. \n\u201cPet dander can trigger it,\u201d Eftekhari said. Advertisement Advertisement \nNearly 45 percent of households include a dog and 35 percent own a cat, according to a recent survey from the American Pet Products Association . \n\u201cThere is going to be some sort of pet dander on every flight. Even if a pet isn\u2019t on the flight, people bring it on their clothes and hair,\u201d she said. \nWith allergens living all over the seats and passengers, many people are in for an unbearable flight. Advertisement Take pet allergies seriously in the skies \n\u201cThe last place someone wants to have a medical emergency is in the air,\u201d Eftekhari pointed out. \nPassengers kicked off of flights tend to receive mixed reactions. Some commenters are understanding, but some are skeptical that pet allergies are really that bad. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for people to understand how miserable allergies can be,\u201d Tuck said. \u201cIt can be very scary and uncomfortable, especially for people who suffer from asthma.\u201d \nWhen someone starts to feel their throat constrict and is struggling to getting air into their lungs, they could even have an anxiety attack. \n\u201cAll of us needs to breathe, so when you can\u2019t, it\u2019s horrible \u2014 especially at 40,000 feet, when you only have your inhaler,\u201d Tuck added. \n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a preference. If someone has a true allergy, it\u2019s not that they just don\u2019t like dogs,\" Eftekhari said. \nEftekhari and Tuck both agree that if someone is actually horrifically allergic to pets, they need to work with an allergist to manage their allergies before a flight. \nOtherwise, traveling will be way worse than it has to be. \n\u201cIf their symptoms aren\u2019t under control, something that they\u2019re allergic to can give them rapid and severe symptoms,\u201d Tuck said. \nPeople who suffer from dog and cat allergies also need to develop a day-of-travel plan with their doctor so that they can travel in comfort. 8 Ways People Allergic to Dogs and Cats Can Make Flights Less Miserable 1. Wipe down everything in your space \nTell the flight attendant that you have an allergy and ask to preboard. Get on the plane early and wipe down your entire area \u2014 the armrest, tray table, and even the fabric seats \u2014 with wet wipes. 2. Sit as far away from dogs and cats as possible \nCall your airline ahead of time and ask the representative if anyone has booked a pet in the cabin, and to be seated as far away as possible. But don\u2019t count on completely escaping itchy eyes. \u201cProximity will help some, but you won\u2019t necessarily be able to avoid symptoms,\u201d Tuck explained. Still, \u201cnot sitting in the same row would be smart.\u201d 3. Consider the length of the flight \n\u201cThe longer the animal is around you, the worse the allergic reaction,\u201d Tuck shared. Rules vary by airline in terms of how many dogs and cats can be on a single flight, although that doesn\u2019t include service animals. Aim to at least book longer-haul flights on airlines that have lower maximum pet limits to minimize your exposure. 4. Put your medication under the seat in front of you \n\u201cKeep your medications with you \u2014 don\u2019t check them or stow them away,\u201d Eftekhari suggested. \u201cThat way, you can have them at arms\u2019 distance at all times,\u201d in case you\u2019re experiencing serious symptoms, like breathing problems. Tuck also suggested considering popping a Benadryl before the flight. 5. Wear a scarf and sunglasses \nAn M95 face mask might be a bit too intense during a cross-country flight, and typical painters\u2019 masks won\u2019t help much with keeping allergens out. Instead, allergy-proof yourself for the flight in a less noticeable way with a scarf around your face, Eftekhari recommended. She also suggested wearing sunglasses. \u201cThey can help block allergens\u2019 contact with your eyes,\u201d she explained. 6. Don\u2019t even think about using the airline blankets or pillows \nAirplanes aren\u2019t cleaned that regularly, and blankets may have been used by other passengers with pets at home \u2014 and pet dander on their clothes and hair. Bring your own clean blanket or neck pillow, or go without. 7. Take a shower right after you get off the plane \nTuck says this will help \u2014 a lot. 8. Prep ahead of time with allergy shots \nIf you\u2019re severely allergic to dogs or cats, it\u2019s likely time to consider allergy shots. \u201cSo many people have cats, it makes it worth your while to go on shots, because you never known when you\u2019ll be exposed,\u201d Tuck explained. \nAllergists will test you, then make up an extract personalized for you. You don\u2019t have to take the shots forever. \"The standard course of therapy is three to five years, which is a big commitment, but it can make a significant difference in your symptoms and quality of life,\u201d Tuck said. \nTuck urges people who are allergic to pets to develop a plan with a primary care doctor or allergist. \n\u201cAllergies can impact your overall health.

Written by Gillian Mohney on October 13, 2017 Fires have led to extreme levels of air pollution in the San Francisco area. Experts say those little masks provide some benefits if you use the right one. \nThe wildfires in Northern California have grown so intense that the smoke can be seen hundreds of miles away from outer space . \nAs a result, many people, even those dozens of miles away from flames, are at risk for asthma attacks, respiratory distress, and cardiac events due to the increased air pollution. Advertisement Advertisement \nThis week, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District said the fires had led to \u201cunprecedented\u201d levels of air pollution, which \u201cdue to active wildfires and changing wind patterns, air quality could be impacted for many days to come.\u201d \nIn San Francisco, the smoke and haze led some residents to wear masks to protect themselves from the smoke. \nDr. Robert Blount, assistant professor of pulmonary pediatric and adult medicine at the University of California San Francisco, said if people can smell or see smoke they should take steps to protect themselves. Advertisement \n\u201cIf there's enough smoke that you can see it or smell it\u2026 then it's a dangerous level,\u201d he told Healthline. \nChildren, the elderly, and people with lung or cardiac conditions are at the highest risk of developing symptoms, Blount explained. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cPeople need to be pretty careful about heavy smoke exposure,\u201d he said. \nHe added that due to children\u2019s small size, \u201cthey get a higher dose of the air pollution than adults.\u201d \nDr. Naveena Bobba, the director of public health emergency preparedness and response at the Department of Public Health in San Francisco, said that if people start to have symptoms related to the smoke they should stay inside and seek out buildings with filtered air. \n\u201cThey should also go indoors to a place that has a good HVAC system,\u201d Bobba told Healthline. \nIf smoke or haze makes its way indoors, Bobba advises running an air conditioner to try and keep out the worst of the pollution. She also said air filters can help clean out the air, if a person doesn\u2019t have an air conditioner. Advertisement Advertisement \nAs a last resort, Bobba said people can head to a newer building like a mall or movie theater to stay out of the polluted air. San Francisco Department of Public Health has set clean air shelters, where the air is being filtered. \n\u201cGood hydration is also very important so drinking lots of water [can help],\u201d she added. A mask can protect against smoke \nFor extra protection, special face masks called respirators can help. Advertisement \nThese masks can provide protection from the small microscopic particles in smoke that can damage the lungs. \nThe California Department of Public Health advises only certain masks will work and other common types of face masks, like surgical masks, won\u2019t filter out the harmful particles. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cWildfire smoke has a higher proportion of particulate matter in the air \u2014 so solid matter \u2014 that can be filtered out,\u201d Blount said. As a result, these masks, \u201ccan be very effective\u201d at keeping out pollution. \nThose who want extra protection from smoke can use the \u201crespirators\u201d or masks that are certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). \nThe only types of masks that should be used are labeled with N95 or P100. Advertisement \nThe California Department of Public Health explained that the filter material rated 95 will capture \u201cat least 95 percent of very small particles.\u201d \nThe filter material rated 100 filters out \u201cat least 99.97 percent.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nThe California Air Resources Board also explained that people with facial hair cannot get an appropriate \u201cseal\u201d around the face to ensure there isn\u2019t dangerous particles being inhaled. \nWithout the masks or other protection, microscopic particles from smoke can travel through the lungs to exacerbate respiratory disease like asthma. \nIt can even raise the risk of cardiac events such as heart attacks or strokes.

Advertisement Advertisement \nA team from Princeton University found that new mothers shift the timbre of their voice to communicate with their infants, even across multiple languages. \n\u201cTimbre is best defined as the unique quality of a sound,\u201d Elise Piazza, a postdoctoral research associate with the Princeton Neuroscience Institute and lead author of the study, said in a statement. \u201cBarry White\u2019s silky voice sounds different from Tom Waits\u2019 gravelly one \u2014 even if they\u2019re both singing the same note.\u201d \nPiazza and other researchers looked at how 24 mothers and their babies interacted. Half of the women were English speakers. The other 12 spoke a variety of nine other languages, including Mandarin, Russian, Polish, and French. Advertisement \nThe team recorded the mother-child pairs as they interacted to see how their voices changed. They used a special device that classified the different timbres. \nThey found that the mothers\u2019 voices changed in a similar manner. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe researchers also found that the timbre changes were so comparable that a computer algorithm could detect in most cases when a mom was talking to her baby or to an adult. \n\u201cThus, shifts in timbre between adult-directed and infant-directed speech may represent a universal form of communication that mothers implicitly use to engage their babies and support their language learning,\u201d Piazza said in a statement. New light on baby interactions \nDr. Jonathan Fanaroff, a neonatologist and the director of Rainbow Center for Pediatric Ethics at UH Cleveland Medical Center, said the the evidence that \u201cbaby talk\u201d is universal is a new idea and sheds new light on parent-child interactions. \n\u201cLanguage and auditory communication is extremely important for a baby\u2019s development,\u201d he said. \nHe explained that doctors have long known that babies instinctively react to their mother\u2019s voice. Talking and singing to babies can help soothe them and help them learn. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cCertainly, there are recommendations for parents to talk directly to the babies and sing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important not only for sort of their cognitive development for learning language and learning communication skills, but it\u2019s also very soothing for babies.\u201d \nFanaroff said that even newborns can sense a parent\u2019s mood through their voice. \n\u201cImmediately and through timbre and tone, babies learn to read cues and know when someone is angry,\u201d he said. \u201cEven newborns \u2014 they recognize their parent\u2019s voice and their mother\u2019s voice compared to other adults.\u201d Advertisement \nThe American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents to talk to their babies from the start to help them learn vocabulary. \n\u201cEven before your baby can talk, back-and-forth conversation will help your baby learn the meaning of words and later be more ready to start school,\u201d the AAP advises. \u201cSo, ask him questions and then answer them. Name and label what you see inside and outside your home.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nFor Piazza and the other researchers, they hope they can expand their findings and look at how people might change their timbre in other situations. \n\u201cOur work also invites future explorations of how speakers adjust their timbre to accommodate a wide variety of audiences, such as political constituents, students and romantic partners,\u201d she said in a statement.

Written by Heather Cruickshank on October 15, 2017 Chinese scientists report they have used genetic \u201cbase editing\u201d to create mutations in cloned human embryos. Ethical questions, however, remain. \nIs it possible to eliminate disease-causing mutations from the human genome? \nIn a study reported in the journal Protein & Cell, researchers from China have used genetic editing to correct disease-causing mutations in cloned human embryos. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe investigators used a procedure known as base editing to repair mutations in the HBB gene that give rise to beta thalassemia. \nBeta thalassemia is an inheritable blood disorder. It causes potentially life-threatening anemia in people who carry two copies of the mutated HBB gene. \n\u201cOur study demonstrated the feasibility of correcting pathogenic mutation by base editing in human cells and embryos,\u201d Puping Liang, PhD, the first author of the study, told Healthline. Advertisement \nWhile more research is needed on the efficiency, safety, and precision of base editing in human embryos, the investigators believe it holds promise for curing genetic diseases. \n\u201cGermline gene therapy by base editor still needs to be investigated and discussed thoroughly,\u201d Liang said. \u201cBut clinical applications of somatic cell gene therapy by base editors might be available in the near future.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement Base editing is precise and efficient \nThis study is the first to use base editing to correct disease-causing mutations in human embryos. \nBase editing was pioneered by David Liu, PhD , professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard University. \nAlso known as \u201cchemical surgery,\u201d base editing uses an RNA-protein complex to catalyze conversions in the nucleotides that make up human genes. \nThis process allows scientists to target and change specific nucleotides in mutated genes with more precision than CRISPR-Cas9, an older genetic editing technique. \n\u201cFor some applications, traditional CRISPR nuclease is a preferred approach,\u201d Liu told Healthline. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cBut many human genetic diseases are caused by single point mutations that need to be precisely corrected, rather than disrupted, in order to treat or study the corresponding disease,\u201d he continued. \nBeta thalassemia is one of those diseases. \nIn earlier studies, Liang and other Chinese researchers tried to correct HBB mutations using CRISPR-Cas9 and another technique known as homology directed repair. Advertisement \nCompared to those earlier efforts, base editing proved to be more precise. \n\u201cThe researchers observed quite efficient correction of the target mutation, by in vivo genome editing standards,\u201d Liu said. Advertisement Advertisement \nOngoing technical advancements might help further improve efficiency in base editing. \nFor example, Liu\u2019s team at Harvard has recently developed fourth-generation base editors. They show improved editing efficiency and product purity. \n\u201cWe are hopeful that base editing might advance the study and treatment of genetic diseases, and our laboratory is working hard toward this goal,\u201d he said. Advertisement Ethical concerns remain \nNone of the edited embryos in Liang\u2019s study were implanted in utero or allowed to develop into fetuses. \nBut the changes made to the mutated HBB genes are heritable. Advertisement \nIn other words, they could theoretically be passed from parent to child. \nThis possibility has raised concerns among bioethicists, scientists, and policymakers. \n\u201cThere has been a long-standing debate in bioethics and the public forum about the idea of making permanent or heritable changes to the genome of individuals,\u201d Josephine Johnston , director of research at the Hastings Center, a bioethics research institute, told Healthline. \n\u201cThere are a lot of broadly writ safety concerns that are heightened by the idea that the change would be heritable. Because how do you assess intergenerational safety? It\u2019s very difficult to know how you actually design those studies and whether it\u2019s ethical to do that,\u201d she continued. \n\u201cThere are also concerns that some people have about whether or not it\u2019s the appropriate role for humans to play in human evolution,\u201d she added. \nSome stakeholders have taken the position that heritable human genome editing should be avoided entirely. \nOthers have argued that it might be ethically permissible to use heritable human genome editing to prevent or treat serious genetic diseases. \nEarlier this spring, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a report on the subject. \nIt took the position that clinical trials for genome editing of the human germline \u201ccould be permitted in the future, but only for serious conditions under stringent oversight.\u201d \nFor now, however, federal regulations limit this field of research in the United States. \n\u201cIn the U.S., if you are going to develop this [procedure] in order to offer it to patients, you would need to go to the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] with your study. And the FDA is currently prohibited from considering any application that involves germline or heritable modification,\u201d Johnston said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly illegal, but you could not do human clinical trials of this,\u201d she continued. \nLiang thinks that more research and discussion are needed to address ethical concerns about base editing in human embryos. \n\u201cFrom the view of technology, the safety issues associated with gene editing may be solved one day in the future,\u201d he said. \n\u201cAs to the ethics issues, the public, the scientists, the bioethicists, and the governments should reach a consensus on when it is ethical to modify the human germline.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "heather cruickshank", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "david liu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josephine johnston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puping liang", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "harvard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "protein & cell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national academies of sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hastings center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-15T16:28:02.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "649169e0feecaaace774d05106fd5bb9914a8df6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_Ugqhbp7C30zVmo2PfzNAOkhm9Y0AKqbO.N9XTFoIjZhplVU", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "http://www.healthline.com/rss/diabetesmine", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Healthline RSS Feed", "title": "Yoga and Diabetes: A Core Mission in Life and New Book (with Giveaway!)", "title_full": "Yoga and Diabetes: A Core Mission in Life and New Book (with Giveaway!)", "published": "2017-10-16T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.healthline.com/resources/healthline/images/logo-lg.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 64, "comments": 4, "shares": 64}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "649169e0feecaaace774d05106fd5bb9914a8df6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_Ugqhbp7C30zVmo2PfzNAOkhm9Y0AKqbO.N9XTFoIjZhplVU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mike Hoskins", "published": "2017-10-16T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Yoga and Diabetes: A Core Mission in Life and New Book (with Giveaway!)", "text": "Email addresses will not be shared with 3rd parties.

Close \nToday, we're turning the 'Mine mic over to Rachel Zinman, a longtime type 1 who's originally from the United States but has lived in southeastern Australia in the state of New South Wales for about three decades now. \nRachel was diagnosed with the LADA (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults) form of type 1 almost a decade ago in 2008. Fortunately, she'd been practicing yoga since her teen years and has continued with that -- along with maintaining a passion for music that led her to release a devotional CD to help herself and others cope with diabetes. Those active in the Diabetes Online Community (DOC) may have caught her writings over at the Yoga for Diabetes blog and at a number of other D-sites through the years. Just this past week on Oct. 10, Rachel published her first book, Yoga for Diabetes , and she's been here in the States doing a book tour (currently in New York). \nWithout further ado, here's what Rachel has to say... and be sure to read through to end, where you'll have a chance to win a free copy of Rachel's new book! \nYoga: A Mission in Life with Diabetes, by Rachel Zinman \nI\u2019m a yogi. That doesn't mean I can bend myself into a pretzel, it means that yoga and yoga practice have been the cornerstone of my life for the last 34 years, given that I started when I was a teenager. \nBut there have been bumps along the way. \nThe biggest one being my diagnosis at 42 of Type 1 LADA. The diagnosis floored me. For months afterwards I was in denial, convinced the doctors had made a mistake because I had very few symptoms. I wasn\u2019t thirsty, hadn\u2019t lost weight and wasn\u2019t peeing all the time. I was just so fatigued one day that I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. It was my husband who urged me to get blood tests. I thought I was the picture of health. After all, I did yoga every day didn\u2019t I? \nWhen I was first diagnosed my blood sugar levels were still fairly stable. Although the tests showed that I was producing islet antibodies, my levels were just above normal. My doctor encouraged me to lower my glycemic food intake and to keep up my daily yoga practice. With regular checks and by managing my diet, I managed to keep my levels in range for almost six years after my diagnosis. \nBut then things got tough. \nI stopped going to the doctor and missed a few lab blood tests. I was still testing my blood sugar regularly but I noticed the numbers creeping up. Instead of seeing 5-7 mmol (90-126 mg/dL) on my meter, I was looking at 12-18 mmol (216-325 mg/dL)! I kept telling myself that tomorrow would be better. If I just climbed one more hill and ate one less carb my levels would come back down. No matter how hard I tried \u201cnaturally\u201d to lower my levels nothing worked. \nAnd then my hands started buzzing. \nAfter a visit to the neurologist, I was told I had mild nerve damage and that if I didn\u2019t get my blood sugar in range the damage would be permanent. \nThat\u2019s when I hit my all-time low. I had no idea how things could have gotten so out of hand. Having put in my all for so many years I couldn\u2019t try any harder. My way of giving up was to stop having regular visits with my doctor and to deny the actual numbers on my meter. Recognizing this was my wake-up call. Two weeks later, I took my first dose of insulin and within months I was back to my energetic and positive self. \nDuring my journey from diagnosis to denial and finally acceptance, I kept up my yoga practice and focused on some of the deeper aspects of yoga. Having solid tools in my toolkit to reduce stress, increase my sensitivity to insulin, help me sleep better and stay happy, literally saved my life. \nOne of those tools was devotional chanting from the tradition of Bhakti Yoga . I discovered this form of yoga when my teacher had given me specific sounds to balance my nervous system. I found that singing with an emphasis on gratitude and releasing emotion through the medium of Kirtan (aka: call and response chanting) opened my heart and helped me to surrender more to what was happening to me and it even helped to lower my blood glucose levels. \nReaping the benefits from incorporating the postures, breathing practices, meditation, the science of Ayurveda (individual healing), visualizations and devotional chanting helped me manage my condition. \nNow, I just want to spread the word and share that yoga is the perfect compliment to a daily diabetes management plan and that any body can do yoga. \nThat's what led me to write a book, to share my story and passion for yoga and it's ability to support people in managing their diabetes. My new book is Yoga for Diabetes, How to Manage your Health with Yoga and Ayurveda . I wrote this because after scouring the Internet for books about yoga and diabetes, I couldn\u2019t find one single book by a yoga teacher who also lived with diabetes. It was the perfect opportunity for me. Living with this condition means I know first-hand how important it is to have simple tools to manage my health. \nAside from my personal story, the book also dispels quite a few myths about what yoga is and what it isn\u2019t. \nFor example, you don\u2019t need to be fit or flexible to try yoga because yoga is not just a system of exercise. It\u2019s an ancient science designed to detoxify the body, strengthen immunity and balance the nervous system with the ultimate aim of reminding you that wholeness, oneness is the nature of who you are. \nThere are so many different kinds of practices that someone living with diabetes can use to support well-being. Breathing, mindfulness, working with sound and visualization, and even hand gestures . Most practices can be done seated in a chair and can be implemented anywhere, any time. \nSo why does yoga rock my world? Gives me an anchor throughout the highs and lows Shows me that life doesn't just happen to me, rather I am inseparably part of the flow of life Gives me permission to soften, release and relax when I think I should fight my way through Teaches me that the thoughts about my condition often stress me out more than the condition itself And finally, no matter what happens to my body, no matter what diabetes throws at me, I am strong enough to handle it \nKnowing this and sharing this is my core mission in life. \n\nWe thank Rachel for sharing her story!

Living with it hasn\u2019t gotten much easier, either. \nEarly detection and better treatments helped prevent 322,000 breast cancer deaths between 1989 and 2015. \nA new American Cancer Society (ACS) report shows that the breast cancer death rate decreased by 39 percent during those years. Advertisement \nIt\u2019s encouraging news. \nBut breast cancer remains a significant health problem. \nIt\u2019s second only to lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. Advertisement \nThe disease affects women and men of all ages. \nAbout 81 percent of diagnoses occur in women aged 50 and up. About 89 percent of breast cancer deaths also occur in this age group. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe ACS estimates there\u2019ll be more than 252,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer in women this year. \nAnd more than 40,000 will die of the disease. Stubborn disparities \nDr. John A. P. Rimmer , a breast cancer surgeon in Florida, told Healthline that a number of factors working together for the past 30 years contributed to the improved survival rate. \nAmong them are better diagnostic tools and surgical techniques, as well as newer chemotherapy regimens and targeted therapies. \nThe ACS report notes that not all women have benefited from these improvements. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe overall incidence rate was 2 percent lower in non-Hispanic black women, compared to non-Hispanic white women. \nBut from 2011 through 2015, the death rate was 42 percent higher in black women. This is a small improvement from 2011, when it was 44 percent higher. \nThe lowest incidence and death rates are among Asian and Pacific Islander women. Advertisement \nThe report indicates that biologic, social, and structural factors all contribute to these disparities. \nThese include stage at diagnosis, other health issues, and access and adherence to treatment. Advertisement Advertisement \nAlso, black women have a higher rate of triple-negative breast cancer, a particularly aggressive form of the disease. \nDisparities vary from state to state. Access to healthcare is still a problem. \n\u201cBreast cancer is very complex socially and emotionally,\u201d said Rimmer. Advertisement \nIn his practice, Rimmer has seen women who skipped screening or didn\u2019t initially seek medical care due to lack of health insurance. \nDelayed diagnosis and treatment affects chances of survival. Advertisement Advertisement \nOthers refuse all or part of treatment due to cultural differences or misconceptions. And there are some who choose nonconventional treatments that simply don\u2019t work. \nRimmer said that people aren\u2019t always forthcoming about the reasons why they don\u2019t show up for treatment. What it\u2019s like to live with breast cancer \nAt the start of 2016, there were more than 3.5 million breast cancer survivors in the United States. \n\u201cIf we treat you and you\u2019re alive, it\u2019s a good thing. But there\u2019s nothing good about breast cancer,\u201d said Rimmer. \nHe added that survivors often experience long-term consequences of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation treatments. \nLaura Holmes Haddad, author of \u201c This Is Cancer ,\u201d is one of those survivors. \nThe California mother of two received a diagnosis of stage 4 inflammatory breast cancer in 2012. \nShe was 37 years old. \nTo say her life changed would be an understatement. \n\u201cWhen I look back, I think about how na\u00efve I was. The things I thought would be the hardest, like being bald, were actually the easiest for me. But the things I thought I would breeze through, like having both breasts removed and having breast reconstruction, were the hardest,\u201d Haddad told Healthline. \n\u201cPhysically, I faced pain and discomfort and physical changes I couldn\u2019t have imagined,\u201d she continued. \nHaddad lists nerve pain, nausea, sensory issues, and being bedridden among the physical side effects of treatment. \nThen there\u2019s the mental and emotional toll. \n\u201cI felt angry and bitter at first, and sad. And then I felt guilty and helpless. And I tried to feel hopeful and I tried to laugh when I could, because everything just gets so absurd that you just have to laugh to relieve the darkness. I felt lonely and isolated, and that was tough. And then I felt grief and then I finally hit acceptance. And that felt good,\u201d explained Haddad. \nFor her family, it was a month after month marathon of logistical and emotional challenges. \nHer husband helped as much as he could. But he also had to continue working to keep up with health insurance and mounting cancer-related expenses. \nTo get through it all, they relied on help from their extended family, friends, and community. A new normal \n\u201cI still have nerve pain in my chest and discomfort, so it is hard to ever completely forget what you have been through,\u201d said Haddad. \nShe still sees her oncologist every three months. She\u2019ll need to take estrogen blockers for the rest of her life. \n\u201cBecause I am BRCA2-positive, I have a higher risk of developing melanoma, especially after the extensive radiation treatment I had,\u201d she added. \nThat means seeing a dermatologist every three months and avoiding the sun as much as possible. \n\u201cI also have to keep my weight at a healthy level to lessen the risk of recurrence. Finally, I have to watch for lymphedema in my left arm because I had 14 lymph nodes removed. I also received radiation on my left side, leaving a high risk for developing lymphedema. I see a physical therapist and do daily arm exercises for that,\u201d she continued. \nHaddad\u2019s pet peeve is that people often think of breast reconstruction after mastectomy as a \u201cboob job.\u201d \n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many times people told me that at least I\u2019d have a new pair of boobs at the end of it. I tried to smile and joke about it, but in the end, my bilateral mastectomy was one of the hardest aspects of having breast cancer. I will never, ever forget the day the bandages around my chest were unwound in the surgeon\u2019s office, a few days after the surgery,\u201d she said. \n\u201cBut after all those challenges, I can tell you one thing. I do not take one second for granted. I really do try and pay attention to every moment, every interaction, every bird I see, every conversation I have. There is no time to waste on nonsense. And I wouldn\u2019t trade that,\u201d Haddad said. Research is key \n\u201cCancer cells are nasty and sophisticated,\u201d said Rimmer. \u201cThe amount of knowledge we have is huge, but the cellular mechanism is hugely complex.\u201d \nHe emphasized that breast cancer isn\u2019t a single disease. Some types are more aggressive than others. \nHe believes research is one way to keep the death rate on the decline, especially when it comes to targeted therapies for the most aggressive types of breast cancer. He also said it\u2019s important to identify high-risk women, such as those with BRCA gene mutations. \n\u201cAt the other end of the spectrum, just simple things like getting a mammogram or going to the doctor when you have a lump are beneficial. Prevention is better than a cure,\u201d Rimmer said. \nClinical trials are crucial to developing new treatments. \nHaddad took part in a clinical trial for the drug veliparib. She credits it with shrinking her tumor enough for surgery. \nThere are challenges to participating in trials, even if your health insurance covers all or part of the treatment. \nFor Haddad, that meant weekly plane fares, hotel nights, and other travel-related expenses. \n\u201cNo one really tells you about the logistics of navigating all that while on chemotherapy,\u201d she said. \nBut she believes that funding research and encouraging people with cancer to participate in clinical trials is important. \nMany people don\u2019t realize that breast cancer can still be deadly, according to Haddad. \n\u201cI also don\u2019t think they realize \u2014 I certainly didn\u2019t \u2014 how important medical research is in developing treatment options and hopefully one day a cure for breast cancer,\u201d she said.

Advertisement Advertisement \nSo far, 48 deaths have been attributed to the hurricane since it made landfall on Sept. 20. \nAnd that number appears to be growing almost by the day. \nMore than 100 people are still missing. Advertisement \nPlus, a bacterial infection caused by contaminated water is starting to spread across the island territory. \nDamage to major infrastructure, including roads and electrical facilities, has also created new challenges as well. Advertisement Advertisement \nBasic medical supplies are sorely needed. \n\u201cThe initial and the ongoing need right now that has come up over and over again is the medications needed to manage chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension,\u201d said Danielle Butin, founder of the Afya Foundation , a New York-based organization that distributes surplus medical supplies and humanitarian provisions for healthcare crises around the world. \nAfya has so far delivered more than 3,000 vials of insulin as part of 10 airlifts of medication and supplies to Puerto Rico valued at more than $1.7 million in the past weeks. Access and supplies \nOutside the capital and metropolitan center of San Juan, access to healthcare and the ability to deliver supplies has become increasingly difficult. \n\u201cThere has been really, really poor coordination and distribution of medical supplies and medical care in the rural areas,\u201d Butin told Healthline. Advertisement Advertisement \nShe said their next focus will be to help supply nursing homes with basic supplies, including diapers for elderly and frail patients. \nElderly patients and those with chronic illnesses that require ongoing treatment, such as dialysis, are particularly at risk because of the hurricane\u2019s damage to Puerto Rico\u2019s electrical grid. \nIn Florida, 14 elderly nursing home patients died after their care center lost power when Hurricane Irma hit the state in early September. Advertisement No power, no water \nIn Puerto Rico, there\u2019s an urgency to get adequate generators supplied with fuel to keep hospitals up and running. \n\u201cThere are people who require generators for life-sustaining measures,\u201d said Butin. \u201cThey require electricity to run medical machinery and there aren't enough generators operating. There aren\u2019t enough generators to distribute for what\u2019s needed at this point.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nAn estimated 84 percent of Puerto Rico is still without power . \nReuters reported that in some instances, fuel for hospital generators has been delivered by armed guards to protect against looting. \nFresh water is also an ongoing problem that has led to an increase in bacterial infections. Forty percent of the population is believed to still be without running water . Advertisement \nLeptospirosis , a disease that can be spread by animal urine and flood waters is being investigated as the cause of four deaths so far . \nThe disease can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and respiratory disorders. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cPeople are drinking out of creeks that are incredibly problematic. Water access and treated waters is a huge issue,\u201d said Butin. \nDrinking from a stream is believed to have caused at least one of the cases of leptospirosis. \nThe spread of contaminated water either through flooding or from drinking from a polluted source also increases the risk of other serious diseases, including cholera and hepatitis . \nConjunctivitis (pink eye), caused by fecal matter, has seen an uptick on the island. \n\u201cConjunctivitis is everywhere, so now they are in need of medicated eye drops,\u201d said Butin. A worried population \nBeyond the acute and immediate medical needs on the island, there\u2019s also a specter of despair brought on by the near constant back and forth between the island\u2019s leadership and President Trump. \nThe president\u2019s public comments have done little to calm the fears of those in Puerto Rico. \nHis statement last Thursday that federal workers may leave the island soon added to those worries. \n\u201cThey are really scared there,\u201d said Butin. \u201cPeople are worried about where they are going to get their medication.

Get Cliterate: The Art (And Science) Of Owning Your Pleasure Misconception 1: It\u2019s always inappropriate to talk about female genitalia 10/13/2017 06:21 pm ET Updated 2 days ago \nThis article was originally published on Healthline.com \nThe world isn\u2019t flat and women don\u2019t orgasm from their vaginas. \nFor years, conceptual artist Sophia Wallace has been spreading cliteracy throughout the land: educating both women and men about the central truths of female pleasure and female sexuality. Through her mixed media art installations, she shares this central message: the clitoris has a right to being and women have a right to pleasure. \nIt sounds simple, but it\u2019s not. \nThese are some of the same statements she hears, again and again, as she speaks to women around the world: \nI never thought women were sexual like that. \nI could never say that word out loud. \nI never knew the anatomy of the clitoris. \nI always thought my body just didn\u2019t work. \nWallace fights back against these misconceptions first and foremost with her art: providing men and women with visual representations of female pleasure and female anatomy, paired with powerful statements that shatter taboos. \n\u201cIn terms of the visual representation of sex, the clit doesn\u2019t exist at all,\u201d Wallace explained. \u201cThere\u2019s never a natural beautiful image of a woman or man touching a clit. It\u2019s treated as very crass. Penetration is great, but the idea that you can never talk about the pleasure of the clit is akin to the idea that the earth is flat. Just because it offended people that the earth is not the center of the universe doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true.\u201d Wait, why is an artist educating us about our bodies? \nIt might at first seem strange that an artist \u2014 and not a doctor or scientist \u2014 is trying to educate the world\u2019s women about female anatomy, orgasm, and pleasure. But to Wallace, it makes perfect sense. \n\u201cScience is necessary,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what artists are charged with is to ask questions that no one else is asking. We\u2019re supposed to be looking at the world from another perspective. Western medicine and science have been complacent in a lot of awful bogus ideas, especially with women and with minorities.\u201d \nWallace is right. \nFor much of history, including up to the present day, the clitoris and the female orgasm have been ignored, misunderstood, and largely unstudied, especially in comparison with male genitals and male sexual pleasure. The reasons are many, but have their roots in sexism: the researchers and scientists were overwhelmingly men, who overwhelmingly saw women as passive beings who didn\u2019t require physical pleasure. \nWallace\u2019s art seeks to give a voice and a face to female pleasure. The billboard was on view in November on I-25 Southbound near mile marker 247.2. I was pleased by the range of comments we received from the billboard exhibition, such as \"What are you trying to sell?\" and \"How do I explain this to my son?\" \nOne of her pieces, \u201c100 Natural Laws,\u201d is a 10x13 foot panel that shares 100 statements about female pleasure, from simple facts: \u201cPenetration is just one of innumerable ways to have sex,\u201d to bold statements \u2014 \u201cBe real: Sex is primarily about pleasure, not reproduction.\u201d Another project focuses on street art: spray painting the image of the clitoris in urban spaces \u2014 mirroring the phallic symbols so common in graffiti. All of these projects strive to open discussion about female sex, while helping women shed shame and jettison misinformation. \u201cDon\u2019t sleep with anyone who doesn\u2019t care about attending to your body.\u201d Sophia Wallace Shattering 3 misconceptions about the clitoris and female sexuality \nThe first step to achieving cliteracy is to stamp out long-held myths regarding female pleasure. Here are three places Wallace would like to start: \nMisconception 1: It\u2019s always inappropriate to talk about female genitalia \nShaming and silencing people for talking about female pleasure is a means of control. While it might not be ideal to talk about the clitoris at certain times or in certain places, shattering the notion that we can never openly talk about how we feel and what we want related to female sex is central to moving forward. \nSex shouldn\u2019t be defined by penetration. Sex shouldn\u2019t be defined by penetration. \n\u201cIf there\u2019s not a place in public discourse to talk about female genitals, it makes it really easy to take away women\u2019s rights,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cWhen it comes to male bodies, there\u2019s so much respect for their bodily integrity and their right to pleasure. We talk about Viagra, penis pumps, condoms that are made as thin as possible for their pleasure. On our side, we fight for every tiny bit, from birth control to our right to pleasure.\u201d \nMisconception 2: Penetrative orgasms aren\u2019t the ultimate goal \nThe vagina isn\u2019t the inverse of the penis, and the woman isn\u2019t a strictly passive participant in the sex act. So it follows that penetrative orgasms shouldn\u2019t necessarily be what women are striving for in the bedroom. \n\u201cThe idea of us being opposite is not true,\u201d said Wallace. \u201cWe\u2019re not exactly the same, of course not, but we are more similar than different. We are not the object versus the void. If you really know the female anatomy, that is clear. And male bodies can be receptive and be penetrated.\u201d \nSex shouldn\u2019t be defined by penetration if we want sex to be supremely pleasurable for women, and research shows that vaginal orgasms are weaker and harder to achieve \u2014 if they exist at all. \n\u201cBeing queer, lesbians are having a very different experience with sex and our bodies,\u201d said Wallace. \u201cEven saying the word sex and what that means, and getting beyond sex revolving around a penis penetrating a vagina. Queer sex is about mutually pleasuring each other until everyone is satisfied.\u201d \nMisconception 3: Female pleasure is shameful \n\u201cPeople are told by science, religion, and pop culture that women aren\u2019t as sexual,\u201d said Wallace. \u201cThey\u2019re told their natural desire is family and security, that they don\u2019t have a natural biological desire to get off like people with penises. So, women blame themselves when they aren\u2019t being sexually satisfied.\u201d \nSo many issues holding women back from fully embracing female pleasure can be traced back to shame. Many women have been told for their whole lives that female desire is only to be desired. Let\u2019s change that by getting cliterate. A few ways to start getting cliterate \nHow can you become cliterate? Here are some places to start. \nCliteracy basics Make sure your partner cares about your pleasure. Do some research. Understand how to improve your sexual health. \n1. Know your own anatomy: Most people can draw a penis, but few can draw an anatomically correct clitoris. \u201cI want the form of the clitoris to be known,\u201d said Wallace. \u201cI want it to be an icon and a symbol that is recognized. I want it never to be forgotten again.\u201d Understanding your body is vital to having pleasurable, healthy sex , and knowing how to orgasm. \n2. Make sure your partners care about your pleasure: Your partner in the bedroom should also not be under the misconception that women aren\u2019t sexual, that penetrative sex is the ultimate pleasure, or that women\u2019s bodies are shameful. \u201cDon\u2019t sleep with anyone who doesn\u2019t care about attending to your body,\u201d said Wallace. \u201cGiving a woman pleasure should be part of their pleasure.\u201d \nFor example, direct stimulation to the clitoris can be too much, but your partner won\u2019t know unless you tell them \u2014 or you\u2019re both cliterate. Practice touching around the clitoris in a circular or up-and-down motion instead. Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment! \n3. Do some research: Wallace has a 20-minute TEDx talk that reviews all of the basics of being cliterate \u2014 and while not enough research has been done about the clitoris and female sexuality, some does exist. Another good place to start? This award-winning animated short by French filmmaker Lori Mal\u00e9part-Traversy which is just three minutes long but filled with history and information. \n4. Understand that being cliterate can improve your sexual health: Simply talking to your partner about how you like being touched, and communicating about needs like clean hands , safe sex, and lubricant , can mean not only a healthier sex life, but a healthier body: a decreased chance of STIs, UTIs, and yeast infections, just to start. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to carry shame anymore,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cImagine if there was a monument in the world that told girls that they had a right to feel good, and showed the truth of how their body actually is. What would life be like for future women?\u201d \nAll photos courtesy of Sophia Wallace unless otherwise stated.

Not fitting neatly into a category used to bother me a bit more and probably led me to be resistant to going on insulin for longer than I should have. Diagnosis was a big shock since no blood relatives were diabetic at the time I was diagnosed, and I didn\u2019t really know anyone in my age bracket who had been diagnosed, either. I was lucky, however, that my mother is a registered dietician, so I grew up reading nutrition labels, which certainly made things easier. Perhaps ironically I think being diagnosed made me healthier overall as it sort of forced me to dial back some bad eating habits. I got more active, lost a little bit of weight, and generally put a better focus on my health. Can you tell us about your job running communications for a local non-profit? Right now, I am employed by a 501c4 campaign committee formed specifically for getting an anti- puppy mill initiative on the ballot in Ohio. I am here in Columbus, as I came here to attend Ohio State University and despite previous plans, never left. In the past, I\u2019ve worked in various capacities on campaigns, political consulting, advocacy communications, and so on. Basically, I\u2019ve tried to connect my career with things I care about, and that\u2019s taken a number of different forms. I haven't had the privilege to work on anything healthcare or diabetes-related yet, but that's definitely on the short list of things I'd like to be involved in. What kind of diabetes activities or advocacy do you have your eye on? This is actually something that\u2019s fairly new to me. For a long time, I\u2019ve been pretty quiet about my diabetes, even with people I\u2019m close to. Despite being outspoken on nearly any other issue I care about, I\u2019ve largely seen diabetes as something I have to personally overcome to get by and have shied away from getting involved. I\u2019m still trying to figure out where I feel most comfortable within the diabetes advocacy community. Wearing diabetes on your sleeve can be a bit scary at first... how has it been for you, starting to open up? Family and friends have been overwhelmingly supportive. My girlfriend, Sarah, has been encouraging me to be more open about having diabetes, and generally I think doing so has made life better and more interesting. Like every person with diabetes, I've encountered some people who are quick to share their foolproof method for reversing diabetes, or their horror story of an uncle who lost a limb, but generally people are pretty supportive. Have you been able to find support when you've needed it? Diabetes can be an isolating disease. In other areas of life I make an effort to be involved in other communities that are important to me: local politics, bicycle advocacy, professional organizations, and so on. These groups all allow me to connect with like-minded individuals and spur innovation through shared ideas. However, I rarely meet any other type 1 diabetics and my main in-person connection to innovation in diabetes care is my doctor. This leaves online communities the only substitute for in-person interaction, and I would relish the opportunity to join a conversation in person with others who face similar challenges. But shortly after diagnosis, I dove into diabetes forums and didn't like what I found. They seemed to be full of no-carb evangelists who put perfect readings above all else in life. Since then I've found diaTribe useful for keeping up with new tech and research, and although I'm not generally a Redditor, I've found the diabetes subreddit to be a good community. And of course you found us at DiabetesMine , and applied for a scholarship to our Summit...? Yes! Besides the obvious benefit of learning about new ideas and innovations from people who spend a lot of time thinking about these things, I\u2019m just excited to be in the room with other people with diabetes. I so rarely meet anyone in person who deals with the same day-to-day challenges. I think a lot of good ideas come from face-to-face interaction. What are some of the biggest changes you've noticed in care since you were diagnosed? I\u2019ve been really excited by changes that allow for better control while living a fairly normal life. When I could finally link my Dexcom directly with my iPhone, I was overjoyed. I think user-friendly design has finally started to be a consideration in diabetes tech, which isn\u2019t just about things that look cool. A well-designed meter case makes it a lot easier to take a walk with all of my necessary equipment, and that creates a better quality of life overall. On the other hand, important items are just as expensive and nearly as hard to get as they\u2019ve ever been. Despite data on how access to things like insulin pumps improve outcomes, there are still massive hurdles whether they\u2019re financial or put up by insurance companies. Insulin is still really expensive. A lot of insurance companies won\u2019t cover enough test strips to get an accurate picture of your blood glucose. It\u2019s hard to get excited about tech innovation when there is a massive Facebook group where people basically beg for supplies. What do you think are the biggest challenges right now in diabetes innovation? I think they are all related to access. Whether that\u2019s access to the best tech, consistent and affordable access to insulin, or access to education about how best to manage your own diabetes, these things aren\u2019t available to everyone. I\u2019ll read blogs and tweets about new pump features all day every day, but I think the real innovation will come in how to improve access for all people. DiabetesMine Patient Voices Winner Karl Rusnak \nThe fact is that innovation has come far enough that if you\u2019re a person with resources you can access these things and live a pretty good life with diabetes. The divide is pretty stark, though, if you don\u2019t have means. I\u2019ll read blogs and tweets about new pump features all day every day, but I think the real innovation will come in how to improve access for all people. If you were to think outside the box to problem-solve a specific healthcare need in diabetes, what would you suggest? Over the past 8 years, I\u2019ve had five different insurance plans and have lost countless hours just trying to navigate these plans to get the treatment my endocrinologist and I decide is right for me. Some of the plans have had diabetes treatment programs that allegedly help you manage your diabetes, but these are usually focused on things like diet and exercise, not streamlining the process of getting approval for the out-of-formulary strips that actually fit my meter. There has to be a way to put expert advocates in place to make this process* easier. Diabetes has taken too much of my brainpower already without worrying about whether I can enact the treatment program I\u2019ve decided on with my doctor. *Editor's Note: Check out the #PrescriberPrevails initiative on the big issue of so-called \" Non-Medical Switching \" -- might be right up your advocacy alley here.

Advertisement Advertisement \nIf you\u2019re taking medicines that can interact with alcohol, there is no safe way to drink. Instead, you must avoid it. \nIf you choose to drink despite the warnings, it\u2019s important you understand the most common side effects and adverse events. That way you\u2019re aware of possible problems when they arise. What a medicine-alcohol interaction can look like \n\u201cAlcohol, a central nervous system depressant, has the potential to negatively interact with virtually all classes and types of medications, from OTC supplements or herbs to prescriptions,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Ferrara, RN, a family nurse practitioner and an associate dean of clinical affairs and assistant professor at the Columbia University School of Nursing. Advertisement \nSymptoms of an interaction, Ferrara said, include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal pain or discomfort, headaches, increased redness of the skin, rashes, dizziness, drowsiness, and damage to the liver. \n\u201cThe lethal interaction between alcohol and either prescription or OTC drugs generally involves suppression of breathing. This can happen even with common over-the-counter drugs that are marketed as cold pills, such as Benadryl, and all the way to controlled substance medications used to induce sleep, or to treat depression, anxiety, or other mental disorders,\u201d said Dr. David Cutler, a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John\u2019s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. \u201cBasically, any medication which can make you sleepy can have a deadly interaction with alcohol.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nIf you begin experiencing any unusual symptoms when you\u2019re taking a medicine and drinking, call your doctor\u2019s office. Severe reactions that require emergency treatment are rare, but talking with your healthcare provider can help you gauge the severity of your reaction.

The more medications that people take, the more likely there may be interactions.\u201d \nWhat\u2019s more, the interactions of medicine and alcohol can make many age-related problems like difficulty walking, memory problems, and weakness worse. \n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to prevent these dangerous interactions by doing two things: Don\u2019t drink any alcohol if you are taking any medication which has even the remote possible effect of making you sleepy,\u201d Cutler said. \u201cAnd only ever consume alcohol in moderation \u2014 one drink for an adult woman, two for an adult man per day.\u201d Safely manage your meds \nNo matter your age or health status, you can take steps at each visit or with each new prescription to make sure you or someone you care for is safe while using their medicine. \nThese three steps can help: Be honest \n\u201cIt is critical that people are honest and inform their healthcare providers of the medications that they are taking, even over-the-counter medications and supplements or herbs,\u201d Ferrara said. \nIf you\u2019re unsure of all the medicines you use, bring a list with you to each appointment. Hand the list to your healthcare provider or pharmacist so they can make the best choice for you and prevent possible interactions. \n\u201cHealthcare providers will help to provide important information about these types of interactions \u2014 especially when patients disclose all medications they are taking, whether they be legal or not,\u201d Ferrara said. Ask questions \nWhen a new medication is prescribed to you, don\u2019t leave your doctor\u2019s office or the pharmacy until you have a clear understanding of the medicine you\u2019re taking, what the benefits are, and what the potential risks are, too. \n\u201cPrescribers and pharmacists have a responsibility to check for possibilities of interactions \u2014 but again, only when we have the information [on what] a patient may be taking,\u201d Ferrara said. \nNCPIE suggests using these questions as a starting point for conversation with your provider: What side effects are possible? What should I expect from the medicine, and when should benefits occur? Are there any possible risks or dangers? Use the same pharmacy \nFerrara said ColumbiaDoctors Nurse Practitioner Group, which he oversees, utilizes an electronical medical record system to make sure there are no critical interactions between medicines a patient has been prescribed. \n\u201cReviewing medications can be especially challenging if a patient is seeing multiple providers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is advisable to have all prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so that interactions of medications dispensed at that location can be identified.\u201d \nMany pharmacies can now do this, but pharmacies can\u2019t always communicate with one another. If you\u2019re filling scripts at different stores, you increase your risk for serious side effects.

Experts say they will cause the health insurance industry to implode. Photo: Gage Skidmore | Wikimedia Commons \nLet the unraveling begin. \nExperts say the executive actions taken last week by President Donald Trump on the nation\u2019s healthcare system will cause dramatic changes. Advertisement Advertisement \nThose impacts could be felt as early as this week, experts say, and certainly in the weeks after the latest enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) insurance marketplaces, which begins on Nov. 1. \nThe actions brought swift condemnation from health-related organizations across the board, as well as quick legal action. \nOn Friday, 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a joint lawsuit against the president\u2019s decision to immediately stop the payments to insurance companies that subsidize policies purchased in ACA marketplaces by lower-income consumers. Advertisement \nThe next monthly payment on those subsidies was scheduled for this Wednesday. \nThe insurance subsidy decision was announced by the White House late last Thursday. Advertisement Advertisement \nA few hours earlier, President Trump unveiled an executive order that\u2019ll allow small businesses and individuals to form association health plans. \nThat order also allows individuals to purchase short-term insurance plans for up to one year. \nIn addition, it encouraged the loosening of regulations of health savings accounts (HSAs). \nThe president said he was taking the action because Senate Republicans failed on several attempts this year to approve a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare \n\u201cWith these actions, we are moving toward lower costs and more options in the healthcare market and taking crucial steps toward saving the American people from the nightmare of Obamacare,\u201d Trump said at the signing of the executive order.

Advertisement \n\u201cWe strongly believe that this funding must continue for the good of the American people. We have consistently maintained that uncertainty around [the] funding drives up costs and reduces choice for those who buy their own coverage,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe administration\u2019s decision to end this essential support for millions of Americans will have harmful consequences for patients, families, businesses and taxpayers.\u201d \nExperts interviewed by Healthline agreed that the White House\u2019s actions will drive up insurance premiums and cause insurance companies to drop out of ACA marketplaces. Advertisement Advertisement \nMary Ann Hart, an associate professor in the health administration graduate program at Regis College in Massachusetts, put it succinctly. \n\u201cI can\u2019t think of one positive thing [about these orders],\u201d she told Healthline. The insurance subsidies \nThe federal government paid $7 billion in cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments to insurance companies participating in the ACA marketplaces this past year. Advertisement \nThose payments were expected to reach at least $9 billion next year. \nThe payments cover more than 6 million consumers in the ACA marketplace. Advertisement Advertisement \nTrump said the payments are in essence a \u201cbailout\u201d to an insurance industry that\u2019s getting rich at the expense of taxpayers. \nHe also said the White House isn\u2019t legally authorized to make those payments, as it\u2019s Congress\u2019 responsibility. That point has been the subject of a legal battle for the past several years. \n\u201cThe insurance companies\u2026 made a fortune, that money was a subsidy and almost, you could say, a payoff for insurance companies,\u201d the president told reporters on Friday. \nTrump received support for his decision from the Citizens\u2019 Council for Health Freedom, an organization advocating for the complete repeal of Obamacare and returning the authority over healthcare services to the states. \n\u201c[The council] has been calling for the end of the unconstitutional CSR subsidies for many months and applauds the decision as a step in the right direction toward restoring health freedom for all Americans,\u201d the organization said in a statement . \nHowever, virtually every other health organization said the decision will have disastrous consequences. \nThe American Medical Association (AMA) said it was \u201cdeeply discouraged\u201d by the decision. \n\u201cThis most recent action by the administration creates still more uncertainty in the ACA marketplace just as the abbreviated open enrollment period is about to begin, further undermining the law and threatening access to meaningful health insurance coverage for millions of Americans. Our patients will ultimately pay the price,\u201d the AMA said in a statement . \nHart added the president\u2019s action will encourage insurance companies to leave the ACA marketplace next year as well as raise premiums. \n\u201cThe elimination of cost-sharing reductions is part of the Trump plan to unravel the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she told Healthline. \u201cIt will make health insurance unaffordable for low-income people who are unable to get insurance through employment or through Medicaid. It will weaken insurance markets by encouraging private insurers to exit the health insurance exchanges, reducing competition and consumer choice, and raising premiums in the remaining private plans in those markets.\u201d \nKurt Mosley, vice president of strategic alliances for Merritt Hawkins health consultants, agreed that insurance firms will drop out of the ACA system. \n\u201cIt would give insurance companies a legitimate reason to drop out of the state exchanges because it violates the subsidy agreement that they had when they entered the marketplaces,\u201d Mosley told Healthline. \nDr. Cameron Webb, a member of the Doctors for America board of directors, said the elimination of the subsidies will have an \u201cincredible impact.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s pulling the floor out from under the most vulnerable Americans,\u201d he told Healthline. \nChris Sloan, a senior manager at Avalere Health consultants, said the subsidy decision has serious consequences for insurance companies. \nHe explained that those companies won\u2019t get the payments for the final three months of this year. They\u2019ll have to absorb the losses. \n\u201cThe health plans are just going to have to eat it,\u201d Sloan told Healthline. \nIn addition, most firms have already locked in their ACA premiums for 2018. Some were able to include the possibility of the subsidy elimination in the premium adjustments they submitted to states this summer. \nHowever, none of them will be able to change those premiums next year unless they get special permission from the states. \nThe result, Sloan said, will be that many insurance firms will drop out of the ACA marketplace. \n\u201cThey just can\u2019t continue to eat those losses,\u201d he said. \nSloan added that even if the orders were withdrawn in the next few weeks, the decisions have created instability that could reverberate through next year. \n\u201cInstability in itself matters,\u201d he said. The executive orders \nThe experts also see some negative impacts coming from Trump\u2019s executive order. \nThe action has several components. \nFirst, it allows individuals and small businesses to form \u201cassociation health plans\u201d and purchase insurance policies across state lines. \nTrump said the plans will increase options for consumers and lower their healthcare costs. \n\u201cThis will create tremendous competition and transformative \u2014 in so many ways \u2014 change aimed at creating more and lower prices for millions of Americans,\u201d the president said in his Thursday remarks. \u201cBut the competition will be staggering. Insurance companies will be fighting to get every single person signed up, and you will be hopefully negotiating, negotiating, negotiating, and you\u2019ll get such low prices for such great care.\u201d \nMosley said there are some positives to the proposal. \nHe said it could help small businesses provide affordable healthcare to their workers. It could also increase the number of Americans with health insurance. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea if it lowers premiums and expands access,\u201d he said. \nHowever, Mosley and other experts see some problems with the setup. \nFor starters, insurance companies might have to deal with different healthcare rules from state to state. There\u2019s also the possibility that claims against a particular plan might exceed the money that plan has available to pay. \nHart noted that these plans aren\u2019t subject to the minimum standards for insurance set under the ACA. \nThe plans could, for example, prohibit people with preexisting conditions. Or they could charge higher premiums for people with chronic conditions. \nHart said these \u201cjunk insurance\u201d plans were around before the ACA, and they didn\u2019t always work well. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not a new idea. It\u2019s an old idea that is coming back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going back in time.\u201d \nDan Mendelson, president of Avalere Health, said the system could provide plans with an \u201cinvitation to cherry-pick\u201d states with the most lax regulations. \nThe state of Tennessee has a version of these association health plans. According to a report on Vox , things haven\u2019t gone all that well. \nAmong other things, Tennessee has some of the highest ACA premiums in the country. \nSome organizations see the same thing happening nationwide. \n\u201cThe executive order would allow junk plans to be sold to consumers without adequate protections, including coverage of essential health benefits such as prescription drugs and maternity care,\u201d Public Citizen said in a statement . \u201cAs a result, these plans could be sold more cheaply, and plans would target younger and healthier people.\u201d \n\"This is an all-out assault on the consumer protections gained under the Affordable Care Act, creating sub-par health care for some and higher costs for others,\u201d added the American Nurses Association in a statement . \u201cPatients could be sold insurance plans that do not cover essential health services, like contraception, mental health care, and addiction treatment; patients with pre-existing conditions may not be able to afford coverage.\u201d \nThe president\u2019s order also allows individuals to buy short-term limited duration insurance policies for up to a year. Those plans are limited to 90 days under Obamacare. \nTrump said on Thursday these policies will allow people who are between jobs or don\u2019t want to participate in the ACA marketplace to have health insurance at about a third of the cost of an Obamacare plan. \nIndeed, the average cost of ACA premiums in the final quarter of 2016 was $393 per month, compared to $124 for short-term policies. \nHowever, health experts point out that these policies also aren\u2019t required to meet minimum Obamacare standards. \n\u201cThat\u2019s the standards we want to have with insurers,\u201d said Webb, who served as a White House fellow from August 2016 to August 2017, advising both the Obama and Trump administrations on healthcare. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go back to the Wild West.\u201d \nWebb said people could buy these policies and then be bankrupted if a serious health condition arises during that year. \n\u201cYou have to be protected,\u201d he said. \nThe experts also note that these plans could draw away healthy, young individuals from the ACA marketplace. \nThis could cause premiums to rise in the marketplace as well as with employer-based health insurance plans. \n\u201cThis could raise premiums for most consumers,\u201d said Mendelson. \nThe American Cancer Society said the order threatens the healthcare of people fighting deadly diseases. \n\u201cExempting an entire set of health plans from covering essential health benefits like prescription drugs or specialty care and allowing expansion and renewability of bare-bones short-term plans will split the insurance market,\u201d the organization said in a statement . \u201cIf younger and healthier people leave the market, people with serious illnesses like cancer will be left facing higher and higher premiums with few, if any, insurance choices.\u201d \nAdvocates for people with HIV had similar concerns. \n\u201cThis order could undermine critical health insurance consumer protections in the small group market and lead to the erosion of these protections in the individual market depending on how it is implemented,\u201d said Dr. Melanie Thompson, chair of the HIV Medicine Association, in a statement. \u201cUnder these new options, some people living with HIV and others with chronic medical conditions would be unable to afford health insurance and the life-saving medications and healthcare it provides.\u201d \nThe final component of the executive order sets in motion plans to make HSAs more available to consumers. \nThe experts said these accounts have some positive attributes. \n\u201cHSAs are the way to go,\u201d said Mosley. \u201cAmong other things, they help patients be more responsible [with their healthcare costs].\u201d \nHowever, Hart warned about consumers relying on those accounts. \n\u201cHSAs can be useful,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they are not a panacea or a replacement for good health insurance.\u201d \nAll in all, experts aren\u2019t optimistic about the healthcare industry if Trump\u2019s actions aren\u2019t just a negotiating tactic with congressional Democrats and do indeed take hold next year. \n\u201cThey undermine Americans\u2019 faith in the marketplace,\u201d said Webb. \nMosley noted that the bottom line is still with doctors. \nHe noted that you can have any kind of insurance you want, but if your doctor doesn\u2019t accept it, then you aren\u2019t covered. \n\u201cDoctors always have the last say on this,\u201d Mosley said.

Written by Carolyn Abate on October 16, 2017 The death of a Japanese woman after she worked a huge amount of overtime has raised questions about the health problems associated with working too much. \nThe report may have shocked some American workers. \nIt was revealed earlier this month that a 31-year-old Japanese woman had died because she had worked too much. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe journalist had just two days off in the month leading up to her death in 2013. \nIt wasn\u2019t the first time a Japanese citizen has died from overwork. \nIn fact, the country has a special term to describe this phenomenon: \u201ckaroshi.\u201d Advertisement \nIn the United States, stories about people dying directly from overwork are rare. \nBut it happens, according to Brigid Schulte, founding director of The Good Life Initiative and author of \u201cOverwhelmed: Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cPeople need to understand how dangerous overwork is to our health,\u201d she told Healthline. \u201cIt\u2019s making us sick.\u201d \nHard work is the cornerstone of American values, she noted. \nIt\u2019s been that way since our Founding Fathers first got the notion to establish the United States. \nBut in 2017, it\u2019s also killing us. \nThe long work hours that many people log on a regular basis are associated with an excess of 120,000 deaths per year, Schulte said. Advertisement A variety of health issues \nThe health issues that arise from working too many hours are numerous. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, psychological disorders, suicide, cancers, ulcers, and impaired immune function are the top health issues associated with feeling overworked. \nA study in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine drew a direct correlation between the hours that people work in a week and the risk of heart attack. Advertisement \nPeople who worked 55 hours a week were 16 percent more likely to develop risk for heart attack when compared to those who worked 45 hours a week. People who put in a 65-hour workweek saw their risk increase by 33 percent. \nA 2014 study by the journal Psychosomatic Medicine said those with high job strain had a 45 percent higher chance of developing diabetes than those with low job strain. Advertisement Advertisement \nFeeling overworked can also wreak havoc on your mental health. Stress is correlated with 75 percent to 90 percent of medical visits, according to the American Institute of Stress . It\u2019s estimated to cost the U.S. economy approximately $600 billion annually. All work and no play \nSchulte contends that Americans live by the motto \u201cwork hard, play hard.\u201d But around 1980, the notion of \u201cwork hard\u201d started to take on a new meaning. Now we don\u2019t even play hard, she noted. \nToday, job sectors such as finance, law, and technology appear to demand that employees give their lives to their job. Advertisement \nWhat\u2019s more, studies show that working extra hours all the time doesn\u2019t really do much to boost a company\u2019s bottom line, Schulte noted. \nFor example, Japan is known for its long work days, but the country has one of the lowest productivity rates. Norway, which boasts an average workweek of 37.5 hours, has some of the highest productivity rates. The productivity in the United States is on par with France, which also has a workweek with less than 40 hours. Advertisement Advertisement \nShe said in countries such as Norway or Denmark, people who work late aren\u2019t viewed as dedicated. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite. \n\u201cIf you can\u2019t get your work done on time, you\u2019re viewed as inefficient,\u201d she said. Dedicating your life \nThe corporate world isn\u2019t the only place where employees feel pressure to work long hours, according to Rebecca Aced-Molina, a leadership coach. \nHer clients are women, usually in their early 30s, who have new positions of authority within the nonprofit sector. \nShe said most of her clients come to her because they already have stress and other serious health issues associated with the pressures of work. \nAced-Molina said the nature of the industry lends itself to the idea that people must give it their entire selves for work to be completed. \n\u201cTheir projects are underfunded, there\u2019s not a lot of regulation, expectations are all over the place,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no end.\u201d \nHer job is get these women to set boundaries. \nThis means simple steps, such as not bringing their laptop home at night, so their workload doesn\u2019t continue to consume their lives. \nBy letting go a bit, she added, they can do wonders for both their physical and mental health. \n\u201cI want them to remember that their suffering doesn\u2019t serve the world,\u201d Aced-Molina said. How to handle stress \nStress is something we all hear about, think about, talk about \u2014 especially when it comes to work. \nBut stress, according to Heidi Hanna, PhD, executive director of the American Institute of Stress, also serves a purpose. \n\u201cStress, pressure, tension all exist to help us adapt and grow stronger, and we need them to continue to evolve in a positive way,\u201d she told Healthline. \u201cStress is not the enemy, and we don\u2019t want it to go away. The key is building in adequate rest and recovery to balance out the stress in our lives, and keep it from becoming a chronic condition of overwhelm.\u201d \nShe said people can develop strategies when they feel overworked and stress starts to take hold. Working hard for a stretch of time is great, but make sure to give yourself time to recover. \n\u201cLike building up physical muscles, if you work out the same muscles day after day, you\u2019ll break them down and over train and find yourself having injuries along the way, until you just can\u2019t do it anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cThe brain is the same.\u201d \nTo help people cope with work-related stress overload, Hanna recommends three key steps: Make it habit to take breaks. Each hour, set aside 3\u20135 minutes to get up, walk around, listen to music, or get some fresh air. Find ways to make work mobile. Talk a walk when you take a call. Go visit a colleague at their desk instead of sending an email. Find humor. Create a folder where you keep images, videos, and other items you find funny. Turn to it throughout the day to help you ease your stress. Also, ask family members, especially kids, about a funny moment in their day. You\u2019ll start to see a more resilient mindset take shape.

Advertisement Advertisement \nThis so-called \u201cwater cremation process\u201d is gaining in popularity. \nIt offers people the option of having their remains dissolved in a hot chemical liquid bath. \nAdvocates say it\u2019s a more environmentally friendly option than burial or fire cremation. Advertisement \nA proposal to legalize the process \u2014 also known as biocremation, flameless cremation, or more specifically, alkaline hydrolysis \u2014 in California was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown on Sunday evening. \nThat makes California the 15th state to legalize \u201cwater cremation,\u201d according to Kemmis, executive director of the Cremation Association of North America. Advertisement Advertisement How water cremation works \nThe \u201cspa treatment\u201d involves placing the body on a tray in a large oven-like machine that\u2019s then filled with heated water and potassium hydroxide, or lye. \nThe solution speeds up the natural decomposition of the body, leaving behind only bones and any pacemakers, implants, or tooth fillings after 2 to 12 hours. \nThe bones can be dried, pulverized into a powder, and scattered or stored like ashes. \n\u201cAll biological material is gone,\u201d Kemmis told Healthline. \nShe explained that about 30 percent more remains are left behind than in fire cremation, where some tinier finger or ear bones are often incinerated. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a skeleton \u2014 with no ligaments or muscles,\u201d she said of water cremation. \nLike a traditional fire cremation, no DNA is left behind either. \nAnd, unlike a fire cremation, the carbon footprint is minimal. Advertisement The environmental factors \nBurning a dead body results in the release of the carbon dioxide stored in the body and in the fuel. \nIt also releases the mercury contained in tooth fillings, something water cremation doesn\u2019t do.

Advertisement \nBut increasing the energy efficiency of cremations could have significant impacts. \n\u201cTwenty-five years ago, the cremation level was around 15 to 20 percent,\u201d said Terry McHale, a Sacramento lawyer and legislative advocate of the California Funeral Directors Association. Advertisement Advertisement \nBut last year, he noted, 62 percent of the 200,000 Californians who died were cremated. \n\u201cThere\u2019s been a total shift in the way we deal with death and the disposition of our loved ones,\u201d McHale told Healthline. \u201cCremation clearly is the most popular option right now, and liquid cremation just provides a different option for those who want to do it.\u201d \nThe California legislation was proposed by state Assemblyman Todd Gloria, D-San Diego, after his office was approached by a company in his district, Qico , that manufacturers alkaline hydrolysis equipment. \nIt\u2019s the third time such legislation has been proposed in the state but the first time it\u2019s made it to the governor\u2019s desk. \nGloria\u2019s spokesman, Nick Serrano, said legislators had balked at what to do with the wastewater in past legislation. \nBut an alkaline hydrolysis facility that the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) uses to dispose of medical cadavers has proven there\u2019s a safe and sanitary solution by sending the water into tanks and transporting it for treatment, Serrano said. \nHe added that the newlaw requiresthe water to be taken to a facility where it\u2019s either turned into bioenergy or, if safe, disposed of in the sewage system after treatment. \n\u201cIt\u2019s about giving Californians another choice in how they dispose of remains,\u201d Serrano told Healthline. \nHe said Gloria\u2019s office hasn\u2019t heard much from constituents on the bill, \u201cbut it\u2019s necessary to think about this. All of us are going to die and we all need to make a choice about how we\u2019re going to be treated after death, and this is about giving Californians a choice for something that\u2019s more environmentally friendly than traditional cremation.\u201d \nCalifornia wouldn\u2019t be the first. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not a unicorn. It does exist in nature in other states,\u201d Serrano said. \nBut, according to Kemmis, only 5 out of the 15 states where the process is legal currently have operating facilities. They are Florida, Illinois, Minnesota, Maine, and Oregon. \nShe said her organization tracks cremation stats and only a fraction of a percent of cremations are currently water cremation \u2014 despite it typically costing the same or \u201ca little higher\u201d than traditional cremation. \n\u201cIt could be a chicken-and-egg dilemma,\u201d Kemmis said. \u201cThere won\u2019t be demand for it until it\u2019s widely available and it may not be widely available until there\u2019s sufficient demand.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019ve had maybe half a dozen inquires over the last year,\u201d Kemmis said. \u201cBut sometimes we have to tell them they\u2019ll have to go out of state.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matthew berger", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "terry mchale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mchale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barbara kemmis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kemmis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "serrano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "todd gloria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick serrano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gloria", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of california los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cremation association of north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california funeral directors association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sacramento", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illinois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T02:28:28.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce24c14696f76fdba5095df02a1c5df2ca4c7371", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StaZQuKO3z1oKBgsa1iGTqGyFm1DdXqI1Km8vbcgI9Wz28IEuByCSWYvS4FhqBLdsQIixE1RicidzLQ--", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Why Do People with Mental Health Illnesses Smoke so Much?", "title_full": "Why Do People with Mental Health Illnesses Smoke so Much?", "published": "2017-10-17T23:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.617, "main_image": "https://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/mental-health/1581-nicotine_poisoning-732x549-thumbnail.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 281, "comments": 0, "shares": 281}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 15}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ce24c14696f76fdba5095df02a1c5df2ca4c7371", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StaZQuKO3z1oKBgsa1iGTqGyFm1DdXqI1Km8vbcgI9Wz28IEuByCSWYvS4FhqBLdsQIixE1RicidzLQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Written Shawn Radcliffe", "published": "2017-10-17T23:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Do People with Mental Health Illnesses Smoke so Much?", "text": "Why Do People with Mental Health Illnesses Smoke so Much? Written by Shawn Radcliffe on October 17, 2017 People with mental illness smoke about a third of all cigarettes smoked in the United States. What can be done to help alleviate this problem? \nThe overall rate of cigarette smoking among adults has been falling steadily since the 1960s, but people with mental illnesses have been left behind. \nAbout 20 percent of American adults have a mental illness, but they smoke more than 30 percent of the cigarettes smoked by adults in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . Advertisement Advertisement \nSmoking rates are also higher among people with mental illness \u2014 36 percent \u2014 compared to about 21 percent in the general population. \nThis doesn\u2019t include people who only have a substance abuse or developmental disorder, so the rates could be higher. \nSmoking rates are also higher for certain mental illnesses. Some studies have found that more than 80 percent of people with schizophrenia smoke cigarettes while only 34 percent of those with phobias or fears do. Advertisement \nWhile some factors may make it harder for people with mental illness to quit smoking, a big part is getting them the treatment they need. \n\u201cThere are barriers for people with mental illness to access smoking cessation treatments, so I think we really have failed smokers with psychiatric disorders,\u201d Jennifer Tidey, PhD, a professor of psychiatry and human behavior and of behavioral and social sciences at Brown University, told Healthline. Advertisement Advertisement A long history \nIn popular culture, smoking and mental illness have long been intertwined, especially in movies and books depicting psychiatric hospitals. \nThere is some truth to this. \nSigmund Freud, the \u201cfather of psychoanalysis,\u201d was a heavy smoker , averaging 20 cigars a day. He smoked up until his death, even after 33 operations for cancer of the mouth and jaw. \nSome studies have also found that smoking rates among practicing and training psychiatrists are higher than for other medical specialties. Psychiatrists are also less likely to help patients quit smoking. \nHistorically, the culture of mental health facilities has even supported smoking by patients. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cIf you look back 20 years in the United States, cigarettes were handed out in inpatient units and sometimes given as rewards,\u201d Joelle Ferron, PhD, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Dartmouth Psychiatric Research Center, told Healthline. \nSome psychiatric hospitals requested free cigarettes from tobacco companies to hand out to long-term psychiatric patients. \nThe tobacco industry also reinforced the mistaken belief that people with mental illness can use tobacco to self-medicate their symptoms. Advertisement \nResearch , though, shows that the opposite is true \u2014 giving up tobacco can reduce depression, anxiety and stress, as well as improve mood and quality of life. \nThere are signs that the culture at mental health facilities is changing, but it still has a long way to go. Advertisement Advertisement \nAbout 90 percent of general hospitals have now gone smoke-free, but only 49 percent of mental health facilities have done so, according to a 2016 survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Can people with mental illness quit smoking? \nThe cultural link between smoking and mental illness is so strong that many clinicians once thought that people with mental illness didn\u2019t want to quit smoking or couldn\u2019t quit. \nThis is not true. Advertisement \n\u201cPeople with mental illness are able to quit smoking,\u201d said Ferron. \u201cThey just need a little more help sometimes.\u201d \nResearch shows that people with mental illness are just as interested in giving up smoking as the general population. Advertisement Advertisement \nThey are also able to quit successfully, although they may need longer and more intense treatments. \n\u201cThere are studies showing that when people with psychiatric disorders try to quit, they make quit attempts but relapse very quickly,\u201d said Tidey. \u201cAnd they have a harder time successfully quitting.\u201d \nThis can be more difficult because people with mental illness are particularly vulnerable. \nMany have fewer financial resources, more unstable living conditions and lack health insurance. \nEven \u201cquit lines\u201d \u2014 one of the most common tools for stopping smoking \u2014 may not work as well for people with mental illness. \n\u201cUnless we can modify the quit lines, they\u2019re not as effective for people with mental illness,\u201d said Ferron. \u201cThat\u2019s the same for most of the treatments. They need to be modified to be effective.\u201d \nShe said that smoking cessation programs need to be tailored to a person\u2019s mental illness. \nFor example, people with schizophrenia may have trouble learning . This can make it difficult for them to read written materials that are part of a smoking cessation program. \nFerron said that using more multimedia tools , including text-to-speech, can help people focus more on the content, not the reading. \n\u201cIt\u2019s another layer to decode what something says and then comprehend it,\u201d said Ferron. \u201cText-to-speech takes away the decoding, so all they have to do is focus on comprehension.\u201d \nThere are many myths surrounding mental illness and smoking. These can be dispelled by educating patients, doctors and the general public. \nBut a big part of helping people with mental illness quit smoking is to make them believe that they can. \n\u201cWhen so many people have told you during your whole life that you can\u2019t do so many different things, it\u2019s really hard to believe that you can do something so hard,\u201d said Ferron.

Advertisement Advertisement \nThe study , named \u201cAll of Us,\u201d is led by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). \nIts goal is to shepherd in a new era of healthcare with \u201cprecision medicine.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that personalizes diagnosis and treatment of disease by examining how biology, lifestyle, and environment come together to uniquely cause illness in each person. \nThe promise of revolutionizing medicine is what convinced Terri Shomenta Bailey to participate in the study. Advertisement \nBailey\u2019s best friend had recently passed away from cancer when she first learned about the study. \n\u201cMy best friend died of melanoma. It\u2019s a melanoma that Jimmy Carter had and he survived it, yet my best friend, who was only 52, passed away. Precision medicine can figure out why my best friend died and why someone else on the same drug survived,\u201d Bailey told Healthline. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cIf there was anything I could do, small or big to help researchers discover why some people recover from cancer and others don\u2019t, I wanted to contribute to that,\u201d she added. Data and diversity \nThe research hinges on recruiting a diverse cohort of people. \nScientists hope to gather data that they can use to investigate how individual differences \u2014 like genetics, behavior, race, ethnicity, age, geography, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status \u2014 influence the development of disease and response to treatment. \nA significant portion of the medical research that drives clinical decision-making today largely comes from Caucasian males. \nThe NIH has promoted gender, racial, and ethnic inclusivity since the 1990s. But biomedical research has been slow to catch up. Advertisement Advertisement \nEsteban Burchard, a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who\u2019s advising the \u201cAll of Us\u201d initiative, described why diversity is integral to medical care and scientific advancement. \n\u201cMedications work differently in various racial or ethnic groups,\u201d Burchard told Healthline. \u201cPlavix, the blockbuster heart drug, doesn\u2019t work in about 50 percent of Asians and 70 percent of Pacific Islanders. The most recent cholesterol-lowering drug in the market, it was first discovered based on a mutation observed in African Americans, but the drug works equally well in everyone.\u201d \n\u201cAll of Us\u201d researchers hope to do their part to reverse that precedent. Advertisement \nStephanie Devaney, deputy director of \u201cAll of Us,\u201d declared that engagement was \u201ca core part of our mission.\u201d \nSo far, the initiative has forged more than 50 partnerships with hospitals, universities, federally qualified health centers, local community groups, nonprofits, and blood banks across the country to act as intermediaries between the program and local communities. Advertisement Advertisement \nAt the University of Arizona, an \u201cAll of Us\u201d partner site located in Tuscon, efforts are under way to engage the local Hispanic and Latino population, tackling barriers that have historically led to under-participation by minority groups. \nThose barriers include inadequate access to clinics and hospitals, financial constraints, lack of access to information, limited comprehension about research, and cultural and linguistic differences. \n\u201cIt\u2019s an issue of health equity in not being able to convey information in a way that resonates with minority communities. It\u2019s essentially the same as not providing access,\u201d Usha Menon, the co-principal investigator at the University of Arizona, told Healthline. Advertisement Getting the word out \nResearch staff at the University of Arizona are working closely with community champions and opinion leaders to get the message out about the study. \n\u201cTestimonials are quite effective,\u201d said Menon. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe group also has bilingual and bicultural coordinators on hand to assist with study enrollment and procedures, in addition to providing materials in Spanish. \nAcross the nation, other groups, such as the Nashville-based organization FiftyForward, are helping to recruit older adults, while the San Francisco General Hospital Foundation is leading the effort to engage sexual and gender minorities. \nBailey, who was the sixth study participant in Arizona, described the process of participating \u201ceasy and painless.\u201d \nAfter initially signing up for the study, researchers called her in to complete a comprehensive health history, get basic measurements like weight and height, and collect blood and urine samples. \nOnce launched nationally, individuals will also be able to directly sign up online without going to a study center first. This mechanism is being piloted at the San Diego Blood Bank. \n\u201cFor people not immediately connected to a clinic, we\u2019re working with blood banks, Walgreens, Quest Diagnostics, and EMSI \u2014 an organization that goes to people\u2019s homes, like those who are homebound or elderly \u2014 for biospecimen collection,\u201d said Devaney. \nThough the \u201cAll of Us\u201d platform is currently only online, Devaney said they intend to develop a paper enrollment process and build partnerships with local libraries to mitigate the digital divide. Future plans \nEventually, participants will be able to access their health information online as researchers collect and analyze data in real time \u2014 a departure from traditional research norms. \n\u201cIt takes an average of 17 years before the person who provided research data will be impacted by it,\u201d said Menon. \u201cWith this program, enrollees will have access to their information, will be able to download it and share it with their primary care provider, and look and see what kind of testing is being done with what they provided.\u201d \n\u201cUltimately, we plan to return all types of data \u2014 genetic data, electronic health record data, survey data \u2014 and also embed an individual\u2019s information in their cohort so they can see how they compare,\u201d explained Devaney. \nFor Bailey, this is an added perk to participating. But she\u2019s intrinsically motivated by the incredible potential of this initiative to reshape medicine. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be more focused on why some people live and some people die. We want to do everything we can to be smarter than these diseases,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope this study does right by the American people and all ethnic backgrounds, helping everyone live longer and healthier lives.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "priya raja", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "terri shomenta bailey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usha menon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy carter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "esteban burchard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "menon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "devaney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burchard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie devaney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bailey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pacific islanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quest diagnostics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco general hospital foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego blood bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institutes of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of arizona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nih", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walgreens", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tuscon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T15:44:53.564+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e73b01e4411337fda1ba6b4aa4bf6af5e12807ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_UgqhTQdFusZOT9DGipfmRLhedv2DXSQ_a7PtPMJgorsi4fjjkjsOm2Nii4-", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "http://www.healthline.com/rss/diabetesmine", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Healthline RSS Feed", "title": "Getting Personal with Medtronic's Minimed 670G", "title_full": "Getting Personal with Medtronic's Minimed 670G", "published": "2017-10-18T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.healthline.com/resources/healthline/images/logo-lg.png", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 164, "comments": 0, "shares": 164}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e73b01e4411337fda1ba6b4aa4bf6af5e12807ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_UgqhTQdFusZOT9DGipfmRLhedv2DXSQ_a7PtPMJgorsi4fjjkjsOm2Nii4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Wil Dubois", "published": "2017-10-18T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Getting Personal with Medtronic's Minimed 670G", "text": "Email addresses will not be shared with 3rd parties.

Close \nToday, we welcome back Wil Dubois with the second part of his product review of the new Medtronic Minimed 670G, also known as the first Hybrid Closed Loop system ever approved worldwide. This advanced insulin pump-CGM combo received regulatory approval a year ago in September 2016 and has been slowly launching in the U.S. over the past several months. Wil offered his first impressions of the 670G earlier his summer, and has now been on the system long enough to share the Quality of Life impacts he's experienced. \nTest-Driving the Minimed 670G: Part Two \nAs I boxed up my Medtronic 670G at the end of my three-month trial, a wave of relief swept over me. This took me by surprise, as I\u2019ve always been a pump lover and had been chomping at the bit to try this new device -- the pinnacle of all that we tech-savvy T1s have been clamoring for -- since I'd first read about it. \nBut in the course of using it, I experienced a shift not only in how I felt about the 670G, but about the invasiveness of insulin pumps in general for the first time ever. \nTo dig into the story of what happened, we have to start at the very beginning with a refresher on the system basics. Medtronic 670G Basics \nOfficially known as a \"Hybrid Closed Loop\" because it only does some of the diabetes thinking for you and leaves the rest in the user's hands, the 670G is the first of its kind and is by most accounts an early generation of an Artificial Pancreas system. \nIt has three modes: Auto, Safe, and Manual. \nManual mode: In this mode, the 670G functions as pretty much a garden-variety pump, albeit a nice one. It uses basal rates set by the user and his or her medical team, has variable insulin-to-carb ratios and correction factors, allows for dual and square wave boli and temporary basal rates, and has a low suspend feature that can be used either at a threshold target or in predictive mode, in which the pump will suspend delivery in advance of predicted glucose low, based on CGM readings and insulin on board (IOB). \nVirtually none of these features exist in auto mode. \nAuto mode: In this \"automatic mode,\" the system functions completely independently of the user. It uses a mathematical algorithm to control all pump features, and the only two things that you can set are the insulin-to-carb ratio and the duration of insulin action. The rest of your destiny lies in the hands of the math and the Guardian CGM sensor. \nOne confusion that many people have about the system surrounds its basal delivery. Just erase basal rates from your memory banks, because the 670G doesn\u2019t use them. Instead, it uses \u201cmicro boluses,\u201d delivering variable splats of insulin every five minutes -- or sometimes, not delivering any insulin at all -- in response to feedback from the sensor. As there\u2019s no basal \u201crate,\u201d there can be no temp rates. The only control you have as a user is to temporarily set the default blood sugar target of the system to 150 mg/dL from the usual 120 mg/dL if you are more active than usual. \nSpeaking of blood sugar numbers, not only does the Auto mode seek to hold you at 120 mg/dL, it won\u2019t even allow corrections until you are over 150 mg/dL. And speaking of \u201callowing,\u201d one feature we are all used to that doesn\u2019t exist in Auto mode is the ability to override the pump when we know better. In Auto mode, the 670G won\u2019t permit adjustments. The only way to change the amount of insulin the pump wants to give you is to cancel a bolus and go back and lie to the pump, changing your carb count up or down. \nSo in Auto, the pump ignores set basal rates and correction factors. It also does not allow for square or dual wave boli. That said, the math driving the system isn\u2019t set in stone. It is an adaptive algorithm, meaning it \u201clearns\u201d and is driven by your most recent week or two of data. But there\u2019s nothing you can do to direct the lesson. It studies your CGM readings and it knows how much insulin it has delivered. All on its own. \nEven the user screen in Auto mode tells you almost nothing. It displays only a blue shield with your current sensor glucose number. In this way, the system harkens back to the original Guardian CGM of 2005. (In fairness, there is a button that can lead you to a status screen that displays your micro boli and trend info, but the quick trend look we are used to is not available to us.) \nSafe mode: This is the in-between mode that CDE Gary Scheiner jokingly called \u201ca sort of purgatory between Auto mode and Manual mode\u201d in his excellent detailed operational review of the pump. As the 670G system is fully dependent on the sensor, if things go south with said sensor, Auto mode is shut down and you are moved to this technological purgatory where the system delivers insulin based on its memory of what it usually does the time of day you\u2019ve had a failure. It will only do this for an hour and a half. If the problem with a sensor\u2014which could be as simple as a late calibration stick or as complicated as a complete signal loss\u2014isn\u2019t resolved, the pump then drops back into Manual mode and basal delivery resumes based on your settings, so it\u2019s important to have a good set of traditional settings in the pump, even though they won\u2019t be used by the system in Auto mode. \nOne frightening side note, however, is that when the pump drops back into Manual, the low suspend features are disabled, and have to be turned back on manually. I find this a huge safety issue. If the pump drops out of Auto in the middle of the night, its best protective suite of features is off the table. Rockin\u2019 the Buffet: The 670G at Its Best \nFor me, the 670G really shone when it came to meals. During the time I was on the pump, my post-meal excursions were few, far less extreme, and far shorter than I traditionally witness. Even though I had no dual or square wave boli to deploy, the fact that the pump could constantly add insulin following a meal to suppress glucose surges gave me amazing postprandial control. In fact, I was able to \u201csafely\u201d eat a wide variety of foods that I typically forswear. Pasta, at one time a guaranteed blood sugar disaster for me, became commonplace in my diet with no blood sugar penalty, which had a negative unintended consequence: I put on 20 pounds in three months. \nMeanwhile, another place the pump did a splendid job was in the control of overnight sugars, at least to its own definition of control (recall that it\u2019s happy if you are 150 mg/dL). Still, on the pump my morning numbers were consistently in that range, not something I can say about other therapies I\u2019ve used\u2014pumps or pens\u2014where I often saw a pretty wide range of dawn blood sugar readings. \nAnd there\u2019s still more good news: I had my A1C test just days after I the end of my 670G trial, and I saw an improvement on the system, although the number is still nothing to brag about: 7.0%. Still, given the system\u2019s targets, this was about as good as I expected. \nBut it wasn\u2019t paradise. In fact, there was more than one snake in the garden\u2026 Out of Control, Without Controls \nOddly, for me at least, the 670G was absolutely worst at the one thing it\u2019s supposed to be absolutely best at: Preventing lows. \nIn fact, its theoretical ability to improve safety from lows helped fast track the pump through the FDA . Wait\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t say theoretical. The pump\u2019s capability is well documented . It just didn\u2019t play out for me, as I suffered low blood sugars nearly every afternoon. The lows struck even if I took the time to enter a higher temporary target blood sugar. \nSo how could that possibly be? \nThe lows were well outside the active insulin range of my noon meals, so they had to be triggered by the micro boluses delivered in the early afternoon. I suspect that this is a problem unique to me, as my afternoon basal rates on every pump I\u2019ve even used are virtually nil. But still, I was surprised that the adaptive algorithm didn\u2019t, well, adapt to my needs. \nNot that it didn\u2019t try. As I began to coast low each afternoon, the pump would shut down the micro-splats of insulin (giving me a daily alarm that no insulin had been delivered for two and a half hours and requiring a fingerstick to keep working) but it was always too little, too late. By the end of the afternoon I\u2019d be scrapping 70 mg/dL. \nTo compensate, I took to under-bolusing lunches by entering falsely low carb counts\u2014remember, no overrides allowed\u2014so I\u2019d run artificially high in the early afternoon. Of course, then the system spent the afternoon throwing insulin at me (now giving me an alarm that the maximum Auto mode delivery had been pumping for four hours and requiring a fingerstick to keep working). \nIf I under-bloused enough, the micro boluses couldn\u2019t drive me down quite to a low by the end of the day, so it worked, but it was sloppy. And it was the first brick in a wall of distrust in the system, which is pretty much death for a relationship that requires a high level of trust to stick with. By the end of my trial, jittery about lows (I was having the most I\u2019ve had for years) I was frequently second-guessing the pump at all times of day, and found myself often canceling a bolus that looked \u201ctoo big\u201d and going back and entering a lower carb count. \nNeedless to say, my control got worse and worse as the trial went on. But my fear of lows overrode my common sense. \nSo what did my doc and my trainer think was causing this? Well, let me fill you in there\u2026 Training? What Training? \nGoing in to the trial, I made the decision NOT to monkey with the settings on my own. \nFirst, I wanted to report accurately on the typical experience for our readers; and second, I wasn\u2019t sure my knowledge of pumps would really be all that helpful with something so revolutionary. Put another way, I didn\u2019t want to put my foot in it, so I relied on the pump trainer. \nAs it turned out, I was the first real, live person my pump trainer started on the 670G. She was fully trained by Medtronic Corp HQ, of course, but had no field experience, nor did she have diabetes. We had one session to cover the basics, another a couple of weeks later to engage the Auto mode, and she met me for one follow-up at my doctor's office. She followed my data uploads\u2014when I could get the damn thing to upload (it gave me fits every time), and emailed recommended changes, which I followed. My IC ratios got frighteningly aggressive\u2014a type 2-like 1:9 for lunch up from my historic 1:15, but I was told this is a common experience with the system\u2019s approach to handling insulin. When I emailed her about the lows, she responded that she didn\u2019t see any that concerned her. \nSo what about my doc? Mine was the first prescription my endo wrote for a 670G. She had a short training on it as well, but I got the impression that it was more like an executive briefing. Rather than being a resource for me, she was eagerly looking forward to my thoughts on the device. \nSo I was largely on my own. Of course, to be fair, no one other than the folks involved in the clinical trials has any field experience with this device yet either\u2014a possible reason there\u2019s so much confusion about what it can and can\u2019t do. \nWhat about the Help Line? Were they a helpful resource? I did call Medtronic's Help Line, but only to get assistance with uploading the pump to CareLink. They were friendly enough, but the call dragged on for an hour and a half with the tech mainly having me repeatedly de-install and re-install Java. In the end I had to switch to a different computer, although they could never figure out why. This is typical of my past experiences with MedT's Help Line, so when things went south on me with the low blood sugars, I didn\u2019t call in again. \nIn hindsight, I think the reason why was that I was too worn out by the 670G system to think clearly, as it\u2019s the worst nag you can imagine. Wake Up and Talk to Me \nDuring my trial I was plagued with alarms, many of which I\u2019m yet to understand. I carefully read the phone book-sized manual and fed the sensor the required number of fingersticks, but other factors lurking deep within the algorithm apparently trigger the need for feedback. Way too frequently, at 2am, 3am, or 4am the pump would wake me up, demanding a fingerstick to continue operation. \nBy the end of the first month, I was feeling frazzled. \nBy the end of the second, I was exhausted. \nBy the end of the third month, I was wiped out. Decision Point \nAnd before I knew it, the trial period was up and I had to decide: Was I going to stay on the 670G? Well, from the start of this story you know I didn\u2019t. And it wasn\u2019t any one thing. Here was my thinking: To use a system that gives you so little control, you have to be able to trust it 100%, and I was never able to develop that level of trust. The acres of tape that held the sensor and transmitter in place gave me terrible rashes. Previously a pump lover, I developed a hatred for having something attached to me 24/7. I don\u2019t know why. Maybe because it disrupted my sleep so much that I began to project anger on it. \nBut on top of all of that, in deciding whether or not to purchase one for myself, I had to ask myself: What\u2019s in the pipeline? What will the next 4 years bring? Committing to a pump means committing to a relationship that lasts almost as long as the typical marriage. I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to make that kind of commitment. \nSo how\u2019d those hard-to-get sensors play out over my trial? Well, first off, I had no supply issues, as I received all three boxes for the trial from the get-go. I reported scary-good results with my first few, but after that I saw a drop in accuracy against the calibrations. \nStill, the sensor stability was good overall, especially in the 150-200 mg/dl range. For me anyway, they were less accurate at lower numbers, and most mornings the 670G\u2019s integrated CGM thought I was 15-20 points lower than the Bayer Contour fingersticks used to calibrate it. Playing around with the number of calibration fingersticks didn\u2019t change this trend, but still, other than the one event previously reported, I didn\u2019t have any readings that were wildly off. A Good Choice\u2026 for Others \nSo I'm back to insulin pens, for now. \nWhile I was happy to be rid of the 670G, with its alarms, its lows, its nasty tape, its emotionally painful uploads\u2014I was terribly bummed. I wanted it to work for me. And in many ways, it did. \nBut now that I\u2019ve caught up on my sleep, what do I think about the system in hindsight? I think that for anyone going on an insulin pump for the first time it would be foolish to choose any other pump. After all, the 670G has some amazing capabilities as an automated system, but it can also be used as a garden-variety pump, and a damn fine one. Given that, and given our increasingly paltry options , I think that if you are starting a pump for the first time, the 670G is a fine and very logical choice. \nBut what if you are currently pumping with a traditional pump, should you switch or should you wait? \nThat\u2019s the tough call. I suspect most people will do better on this system than on other pumps, especially if they can just \u201clet go\u201d and let the system run the show, but I don\u2019t think it will be the only game in town for long. So really, it comes down to how much you\u2019d rather gamble on the future compared to how much you need extra help today. \n\nEditor's Note: We thank you for sharing your honest opinion as always, Wil.

I Won\u2019t Let Anxiety Stop Me From Becoming A Mom Rather than being a slave to fear, I started looking into what I could do to make sure I\u2019m as equipped as possible when the time comes. 10/17/2017 07:28 pm ET Updated 2 days ago \nThis article was originally published on Healthline . Original illustration by Healthline \nI was officially diagnosed with anxiety disorder when I was 24. But the truth is, I think I\u2019ve had it from birth. Adults called me a \u201csensitive child\u201d because I was always afraid that something bad was going to happen. I hated change, loud noises, new people and anything remotely upsetting. One time, watching a vampire cartoon made me want to sleep with a thick scarf around my neck for an entire month. (It was summer.) \nAs an adult, anxiety has affected me in different, more aggressive ways . I\u2019ve suffered with palpitations, shortness of breath, blushing and shaking. Negative thoughts have circulated constantly through my head. \n\u201cYou\u2019re a loser.\u201d \n\u201cEverybody thinks you\u2019re stupid.\u201d \nMy way of dealing with it? Denial, and the stubborn determination to keep going. \nWhen I moved to London, I met my now husband within the first month. We\u2019d been together one year when I had my nervous breakdown. Years of pushing my body and brain to the brink finally caught up with me. \nI began to have panic attacks daily and lived off three hours of sleep a night. I was in pieces. It must\u2019ve been a lot for my husband to deal with, but he stood by me. He didn\u2019t always understand what I was going through, but he listened. \nThe doctor signed me off from work and prescribed me SSRI medication . Recovery was a long road, but with hard work and perseverance, I got to a good place. The possibility of motherhood \nFive years later, I\u2019m now married and reaching a stage in my life in which I\u2019m thinking about starting a family. This is an exciting new chapter, but I can\u2019t help but wonder\u2026 \n\u201cWill I pass it on to my children?\u201d \nThe thought has been troubling me for a while. I can bear anxiety and all the stuff that comes with it myself, but I\u2019m not sure I could watch a loved one go through it. How would I cope with the guilt that I\u2019d burdened them with this disorder? \nSo, I decided to take a look at the science. And, as usual, nothing is 100 percent conclusive. That being said, there\u2019s at least some evidence that anxiety can be an inherited disorder. \nI\u2019ve also read expert assessments on how the child\u2019s mind works \u2014 how a child will mimic how their parents respond to stressful situations, because they use their parents\u2019 behavior as a way of navigating the unknown. \nCopied behavior makes more sense to me, personally. We learn language from our parents and take social cues. Much of a child\u2019s early years are spent mimicking the behavior of others. Taking a realistic approach \nKnowing that it was possible that my anxiety could be inherited, or could at least have an effect on my children, I started questioning my own abilities. Would my anxiety interfere with being a good mother? Will I have to come off my medication? Could I function without it? So many questions! \nThe truth is, I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ll ever be able to answer them. But I can prepare. Rather than being a slave to fear, I started looking into what I could do to make sure I\u2019m as equipped as possible when the time comes. \n1. I will keep taking my medication \nI spoke to my doctor and the short answer is: Yes, I can stay on my medication while pregnant, as the dosage is 50 mg. This gave me peace of mind. It\u2019s also something my doctor can keep an eye on throughout pregnancy. Knowing that it was possible that my anxiety could be inherited, or could at least have an effect on my children, I started questioning my own abilities. \n2. I will research \nThere\u2019s a lot of information available online about copied behavior and how to avoid passing anxiety on to your children. I\u2019ll read everything and put as much as I can into practice. \n3. I will take care of myself \nFor example, stress management and taking time to recharge are important. Anxiety is worsened when a person burns themselves out, doesn\u2019t eat well, or get enough sleep (not easy when you\u2019re a mom)! \nTherefore, I\u2019ll make my own well-being a priority along with my child\u2019s. If I\u2019m fully recharged and happy, then I can give more to my child. \n4. I will listen to other parents \nMotherhood is really hard! I think that most women would agree to that. I\u2019m fortunate enough to have friends who are already moms and happy to share tips and tricks . So, I intend to soak up as much knowledge as I can. \nFor example, my friend\u2019s 6-year-old son recently asked her about terrorism. It\u2019s not the kind of conversation you want to have with a kid, but I suppose it\u2019s unavoidable in this day and age. \nMy friend said, \u201cI can\u2019t protect him from everything, but I also don\u2019t want him being afraid. So, I sat him down and explained that although most people are good, there are some bad people in the world, and they sometimes do evil things.\u201d I like this approach \u2014 it\u2019s honest but not traumatizing. (My dad preferred the traumatizing approach!) \n5. I will ask for help \nMy experience with mental illness is that you don\u2019t have to deal with it on your own. After finally learning my lesson, I know that I can ask for help from family and friends if I need it. \nBeing human is allowed.

Even if it is just your own, wouldn\u2019t that be worth it? 10/17/2017 07:14 pm ET Updated 3 days ago \nThis article was originally published on Healthline . Credit: Cathleen Meredith \nI am fat. I am the obesity epidemic everyone is talking about. I am also completely and unapologetically in love with myself. \nIf you\u2019re wondering how and where I developed this self-confidence, the answer is: dance. Specifically, dancing on camera. \nMy gushy, squishy, please-get-a-room self-love certainly slams me squarely in the minority. Yes, plus-size models are gracing the runway, more stores carry \u201cbig girl\u201d sizes, and body positivity is on the rise. And yet, DoSomething.org claims that approximately 91 percent of women are unhappy with their bodies. Ouch. Love from the start \nI\u2019ve been fat my entire life. But I could never subscribe to the self-loathing latte women drink every morning. I have never inherently hated myself, my life, or (gasp!) my body. Like most Americans, sometimes I eat healthy, and sometimes I don\u2019t. But unlike most Americans, I dance six days a week. \nI have tons of friends and a loving, supportive family. I love my job. I travel whenever I want. I have a healthy and happy relationship with a man who l ves my body, and yes, we have pretty amazing sex. Regularly. (Fact: Fat people have sex. Tell your friends.) \nBut this complete self-assured love that I have for myself is new. I never would have begun this love affair without dancing in front of a camera and putting it on YouTube for a full year. \nWhile I don\u2019t necessarily recommend that, I\u2019ll say this: Self-love takes work. It\u2019s a process that can take years. For a society whose priorities are often tied up in 30 seconds of fame, that may be a hard sale. But the truth is, it takes patience and hard work. I\u2019ve been fat my entire life. But I could never subscribe to the self-loathing latte women drink every morning. Dance like no one (or everyone) is watching \nAn easy life hack and a good place to begin: Start your morning with dance selfies. Seriously. Dance around like a total idiot, film it, then watch it. Yes, you will absolutely hate them. For a while, probably. Just like we all hated green smoothies years ago. \nBut at some point, there was a turn. And you started craving that earthy goodness. That\u2019s exactly what will happen here. Push past that inner Mean Girl who is telling you: \u201cStop. You look like a damn fool. This is disgusting.\u201d I can tell you from experience: At some point, there is a switch-up. \nOn the other side of it is appreciation. Elation. Exuberance. And love. \nYes, dancing with yourself works. And not because Billy Idol said so, or because Meredith and Cristina did it on \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d for years. Here are the three main reasons why. Apr 12, 2017 at 7:06am PDT \n1. Our bodies need movement \nWell, duh. You need to move for a number of health reasons . But you also need to get moving because you need the endorphins , the \u201cfeel good\u201d hormones that can help alleviate depression, reduce stress and anxiety, boost your self-esteem, and so much more. \nFor all its benefits, though, exercise can suck, and you might hate it \u2014 that\u2019s normal. For me, dance is different. I can go to a club or party and literally dance for hours without ever feeling those I hate my life feelings that exercise gives me. Every time I dance, yes \u2014 I feel tired, achy, and sweaty. But I also feel amazing. Dancing made movement fun . And fun is an imperative incentive when switching from a sedentary lifestyle to an active one. \n2. Our brains need new information Credit: Cathleen Meredith \nWatching dance selfies can actually re-teach our brains to stop seeing ourselves as a threat, hence allowing our bodies to work better. But don\u2019t just take it from me \u2014 listen to the experts on this one. \n\u201cLooking at ourselves and perceiving ourselves negatively affects our biochemistry, which directly affects our nervous system, which affects our efforts at weight loss, and ultimately our overall health,\u201d Stacy Berman , PhD in the field of psychoneuroimmunology explains. \nBasically, our flight or fight response perceives negative self-images as a threat, whether the threat is real or not. \n\u201cOne look in the mirror, and anything not related to survival shuts down,\u201d Berman says. \u201cDigestion, repair, metabolism. Why are we working out, eating right, and not losing weight? This is why.\u201d \nMind. Blown. \nBody positivity is not all feel-good, woo-woo. Our bodies actually need it, just like drinking water and eating our veggies. Shifting self-perceptions could start with a dance break and a smartphone. Watching yourself move is a great way to gain awareness of negative messages your brain is sending out. Once aware, we can begin to change those messages. \n3. Our society needs YOU \nParticularly for women, a huge problem with our bodies is perception. We\u2019re told to believe our different shapes, sizes and colors are wrong. Flawed. We can only change that narrative by becoming active voices against it. \nHave we ever considered we can fix our health crisis by seeing different shapes dancing, and bodies jiggling? That increasing visibility of all body types hiking, dating, laughing, and living can shift perceptions and create an environment for healthier living? \nI never thought that me dancing around with my friends on YouTube was something the world desperately needed. I was very wrong. Maybe you dancing on your Instagram feed might shift someone\u2019s perceptions, ideas, or their life. Even if it is just your own, wouldn\u2019t that be worth it? Takeaway \nA year after launching this insane social media experiment called FATGIRLSDANCE , we\u2019d gone viral, had thousands of followers, and inspired people worldwide to join us. All of that plus I\u2019d started the healthiest, most loving relationship I\u2019ve ever had. With myself. \nIf I could keep just one thing gained from this past year, unequivocally, I would choose that. Self-love has literally changed my entire life. And if you are a part of the 91 percent who are still unhappy with their bodies, I can tell you: It\u2019s waaay better over here. Join the 9 percent. There\u2019s dancing. And love. And tacos. \nAnd there should always be tacos. \nCathleen Meredith is the founder of Fat Girls Dance.

Here\u2019s why you should avoid tattoos on certain parts of your body. \nYou may have heard of tattoos in strange places. \nBut what about the eyeball? Advertisement Advertisement \nA 24-year-old model was left partially blind after having her sclera \u2014 the white part of the eye \u2014 tattooed. \nThe Canadian woman says she wanted the whites of her eyes to be purple. \nShe says her tattoo artist didn\u2019t dilute the ink and injected too much of it in her eye. This caused her eye to swell and for her to cry purple tears. Advertisement \nExperts say everyone should be able to see the inherent danger in this practice. \n\u201cThe sense of sight is so precious and important. Why would someone subject their eye to unnecessary procedures performed by a non-eye care professional?\u201d Dr. Colin A. McCannel, a professor of clinical ophthalmology and vitreoretinal surgeon at UCLA\u2019s Stein Eye Institute, told Healthline. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cAll procedures have risks,\u201d McCannel added. \u201cAnd in this kind of case \u2014 to have the tattooing done by someone who is a complete layperson with regard to the eye and its unique anatomy and challenges \u2014 is something I do not understand.\u201d \nIt\u2019s not just eye specialists who are baffled by the idea of tattooing the sclera. \nDr. Adam Friedman, a dermatologist from the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, said tattoo inks weren\u2019t intended for use in the eye. \n\u201cI am personally shocked someone would tattoo their sclera or conjunctiva. The anatomy of the eye is completely different from the skin, which is the intended target of the various tattoo pigments,\u201d he told Healthline. Other risky locations \nThe eye isn\u2019t the only sensitive place people are getting tattoos. Advertisement Advertisement \nIn 2014, Miley Cyrus showed off her inner lip tattoo. \nEarlier this year, Madonna posted a photo on Instagram that appeared to show a tattoo on a woman\u2019s pubic area. \nInner ear tattoos are also popular. Advertisement \n\u201cEars and genitals, while certainly delicate areas for several reasons, are certainly safer than directly into the eye,\u201d Friedman said. \nBut that doesn\u2019t mean these areas are the best place to get tattoos. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cWhen considering the ears or genitals, one has to consider that the skin is thinner for both than other areas on the body,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cEars are not highly vascular and are unexposed areas often forgotten when considering sun protection, so therefore, healing is often slower,\u201d he explained. \n\u201cGram-negative bacterial infections are known to occur on ears following procedures more so than other locations,\u201d Friedman added. \u201cConversely, the genitals are highly vascular and have no cartilaginous or bone support. Injury to underlying vessels is greater because of this \u2014 not to mention the thin nature of the skin.\u201d \nAnd although Cyrus is sporting an inner lip tattoo, the American Dental Association (ADA) says research into the safety of mouth or lip tattoos is limited. Advertisement \n\u201cThere are currently no tattoo-ink products or procedures that have been properly evaluated regarding their safety for use or application within the mouth,\u201d the ADA said in a statement to Healthline. Tattoos rising \nThe amount of people with tattoos in the United States is on the rise. Advertisement Advertisement \nA 2016 Harris Poll found that 3 in 10 Americans have at least one tattoo. That\u2019s up from 2 in 10 in 2012. \nThat same poll found that almost half of millennials surveyed say they have at least one tattoo, compared with just 13 percent of baby boomers. \n\u201cPeople have been trying to enhance various body parts since ancient Egyptian times,\u201d Dr. Michi Shinohara, associate professor of dermatology at the University of Washington, told Healthline. \nShe believes tattoos on the eyes and genital areas are best avoided. \n\u201cGenitals are an area of the body which already carries a higher microorganism load, and so is at higher risk of infection than other parts of the skin,\u201d she said. \nDr. Mary Jane Minkin is a clinical professor in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at the Yale School of Medicine. \nIn her 35 years of private practice, she\u2019s never seen a tattoo in the pubic region. She also wouldn\u2019t recommend it. \n\u201cFirst of all, there is always a risk of infections anywhere, and infections in the genital region can be quite painful. And do remember there are tons of bacteria in the area,\u201d she told Healthline. \u201cAlso\u2026 there are many nerve endings in the genital region. One condition that we deal with is vulvodynia, a common pelvic complaint of pain in the vulvar area\u2026 why introduce another potential cause of pain?\u201d \nMinkin argues there are areas of the body that would be \u201ca lot less potentially problematic\u201d for a tattoo. \nBut the case of the 24-year-old model shows that despite the risks, some people are still likely to continue with tattoos in sensitive places. \n\u201cIf someone is determined to get a tattoo in a sensitive area, they should go to an experienced, licensed tattoo artist who demonstrates that they have experience tattooing these areas of the body,\u201d Shinohara said. \nAs for tattooing the eye, McCannel says it\u2019s an absolute \u201cno-go\u201d zone. \n\u201cDon\u2019t mess with your eyes. It is arguably the most precious sense we have and usually lasts us to our last breath. Don\u2019t risk it,\u201d McCannel said.

Advertisement Advertisement \nDabbing uses highly potent marijuana concentrates that are vaporized on a special dabbing rig, similar to a glass water pipe. \nHowever, unlike a traditional pipe, dabbing rigs use a small heated surface, called a nail, typically made of glass, metal, or ceramic. \nThe user applies the marijuana concentrate, or dab, to the nail, releasing vapors that they inhale. Advertisement \nMarijuana concentrates are often extracted using butane, resulting in a final product called butane hash oil (BHO). \nBHO goes by a variety of names, typically based on its consistency: wax, oil, shatter, and butter (or budder). Advertisement \nAccording to recent survey data , users seek out BHO for a \u201ccleaner,\u201d more concentrated high. \nIt\u2019s also viewed by some as being easier on the lungs than smoking marijuana. \nThis form of consumption is new, only becoming popular in the past few years. \nOn account of this, scientific data on BHO consumption is limited. Terpenes and toxins \nNew research from Portland State University has now identified that dabbing vapor contains known carcinogenic substances, including methacrolein and benzene . Advertisement Advertisement \nMore specifically, scientists identified that terpenes, a class of organic compounds found in marijuana, are responsible for the resulting carcinogens when smoked or vaporized. \nTerpenes commonly occur in plant resins. They give marijuana plants their wide variety of aromas and fragrances. \nTerpenes are used in essential oils and cosmetics, and serve as flavoring additives for electronic cigarette and vaporizer products. Advertisement \n\u201cTerpenes are believed by many to be harmless flavorants because they are natural products,\u201d Robert Strongin, a study author and professor of organic chemistry at Portland State, told Healthline. \u201cWhen heated as part of a cannabis concentrate formulation via certain methods of dabbing, they can degrade to produce toxins.\u201d \nWhile the discovery of the relationship between terpenes and carcinogens may be a new development, others say that finding benzene and other toxic substances in BHO should be expected. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cIt has long been known that the combustion of marijuana (or tobacco) produces benzene, acrolein, and scores of other noxious compounds,\u201d said Dale Gieringer, PhD, director of the California National Organization for the Reformation of Marijuana Laws (NORML). \n\u201cIn short, some of the toxins in regular smoked marijuana may also be produced by dabbing,\u201d he told Healthline. Smoke vs. vapor \nStudies exist comparing the carcinogenic effects of cannabis and tobacco , but there have yet to be any that compare smoking and dabbing. Advertisement \nGieringer notes that like with tobacco, there are differences in composition between marijuana smoke and vapor. \nMarijuana that\u2019s smoked contains cellulose and other carbon compounds not found in marijuana concentrates. Advertisement \n\u201cTherefore, one might reasonably posit that smoking poses greater hazards than dabbing,\u201d he said. \nArguments for the safety of vaporizers and e-cigarettes often bring up vaporization versus combustion. \nVaporization occurs at lower temperatures than combustion, resulting in the formation of fewer toxic compounds when inhaled. \nHowever, dabbing presents a problem in that there must be proper temperature control of the nail to vaporize the BHO and not burn it. \nAppropriate vaporizing temperature can vary, depending on the makeup of the BHO and the user\u2019s preference, but it\u2019s typically around 572\u02daF to 662\u02daF (300\u02daC to 350\u02daC), according to the researchers. \nUncontrolled heating can result in the temperature of the nail being well above that recommended range. \nWhile some electronic dabbing rigs do exist, the more common method is to use a culinary torch to heat the nail, which results in inconsistent and imprecise temperatures when dabbing. \nControlling temperature is \u201ccritical\u201d to limiting exposure to carcinogens, said Strongin. \n\u201cHotter temperatures afford more toxins,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what our work has shown so far.

Scientists are hoping this latest immunotherapy will help keep patients from developing cancer again. \nResearchers are hoping that they\u2019ll soon break ground in a new medical frontier. \nVaccines that can stop cancer. Advertisement Advertisement \nCurrently, the only vaccine designed to prevent cancer is the HPV vaccine . \nHowever, that shot protects against the human papillomavirus that leads to cervical cancer, not the cancer itself. \nBut a new study taking place at sites across the United States, including Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, is researching if a vaccine can be used to prime the immune system to fight cancer cells from developing into a tumor. Advertisement \nThe research is part of the growing field of medicine called immunotherapy. In this field, doctors attempt to harness the immune system in a variety of ways to fight cancer. \nLast summer, the first gene-therapy immunotherapy treatment was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Advertisement \nThat drug, called Kymriah, reengineers the immune cells to fight a certain kind of leukemia. Looking for help from the cancer cell \nIn this trial, researchers are studying if a vaccine can help women who have already undergone treatment for nonmetastatic breast cancer and are in remission. \nThe trial is currently in the phase II stage. In this stage, researchers look for signs of the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness. \nThe team is focused on targeting a specific protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). According to the Mayo Clinic, HER2 \u201cpromotes the growth of cancer cells.\u201d \nAbout 1 in 5 women with breast cancer are designated as having HER2-positive breast cancer . That means they have high levels of this protein in their cancer cells. Advertisement Advertisement \nDoctors already use drugs \u2014 including one immunotherapy drug called Herceptin \u2014 that target these proteins by blocking specific receptors on the tumor. \nBut as many as 60 to 70 percent of women with breast cancer have moderate levels of HER2. \nEven though they\u2019re not considered to have HER2-positive breast cancer, scientists have been looking to see if HER2 treatment could help them as well. Advertisement \nDr. Amy Tiersten, the lead investigator of the study at Mount Sinai and a professor of medicine, hematology, and medical oncology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said they hope to find a way to help more women by combining Herceptin treatment and a vaccine derived from part of the HER2 protein. \n\u201cThere are many, many vaccine trials going on. It\u2019s part of the revolution of immunotherapy,\u201d she told Healthline. \u201cVaccines are a little bit different, but they\u2019re part of the same idea.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nIn this trial, women get both Herceptin and a new vaccine that\u2019s derived from the HER2/neu peptide E75. This peptide is a piece of the HER2 protein that can help cancer cells grow. \nThe hope is that this peptide will encourage the immune system to look for and fight microscopic cancer cells before they can develop into a large tumor. \n\u201cOnly 20 percent of [breast cancer] patients are HER2 positive,\u201d Tiersten said. So, getting HER2 therapy to work for \u201ca much larger group of patients would be a huge\u201d advantage. Advertisement \nSome women are getting a placebo instead of a vaccine. This is so researchers can determine whether or not there\u2019s benefits in getting the inoculation. \nIf the researchers find that the vaccine works, it could mean people who would\u2019ve had a reoccurrence of cancer remain fully cancer-free, or cancer-free for a longer period of time. Advertisement Advertisement \nTiersten points out this is just one part of a growing immunotherapy field that\u2019s already changing how doctors and patients battle cancer. \nOther drugs called \u201ccheckpoint inhibitors\u201d \u2014 which take \u201cthe brakes\u201d off the immune system \u2014 have already been approved to treat some cancers, such as lung cancer. \nNow with the vaccine trial, Tiersten and her patients hope to prove that manipulating the immune system to fight cancer with a vaccine will save lives. \nTiersten and her team will do this by \u201cvaccinating patients with a very small amount of a protein that\u2019s expressed on these cells, and then allowing the patient\u2019s own immune system to find any microscopic cells that the chemotherapy or other therapies may have missed, and thereby reduce the risk of occurrence,\u201d she said. The patients who sign up \nThe trial will include about 300 patients. \nIt\u2019s ongoing and scheduled to end in 2020. \nIt\u2019s not yet clear if the vaccine will be successful enough that patients outside of the trial could get the vaccine in the future. \nHowever, one of Tiersten\u2019s patients said that she knew immediately she wanted to be a part of the study. \nNorma, a lawyer in New York City, wasn\u2019t worried about taking part in an experimental trial after receiving a diagnosis of stage 3 breast cancer last year. \n\u201c For me, it was never even an option or question if I would do it,\u201d she told Healthline. \nNorma, who didn\u2019t wish to have her last name used, said she was determined to do everything she could to stay cancer-free, in part because of her 10-year-old son. \n\u201cI really wanted to have the opportunity to take this drug and to be part of this trial,\u201d Norma, 49, said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re fighting and fighting with everything you have... you got to do everything you can.\u201d \nLouise Mimicopoulos, a senior vice president of merchandising and accessories at Ralph Lauren, is in remission after receiving a diagnosis of stage 3 breast cancer. \nShe wanted to be a part of the study to help other women in the future. \n\u201cSomewhere I can help someone else down the road,\u201d she said. \u201cIt had nothing to do with myself. It really was to hopefully help someone else.\u201d \nOther immunotherapy experimental treatments have sometimes resulted in dangerous side effects with the immune system attacking important systems in the body. But Tiersten said the only side effects they\u2019ve seen so far in this study is some redness and irritation around the site where the shots were administered. \nBoth Norma and Mimicopoulos said they had some irritation from the vaccine. How breakthroughs have helped patients \nDr. Melissa Fana, chief of breast surgery at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, New York, said the trial shows how far the medical field has come in understanding and treating breast cancer. \n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised at the ongoing trial, or even that it may be possibly promising,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a breakthrough in breast cancer understanding, which is guiding treatment in the last decade.\u201d \nFana said doctors now understand much more about the biology of the tumor. Knowing this is key in treating it effectively. \nIn the past, she said, doctors thought the cancer\u2019s size and the aggressiveness of treatment \u2014 including surgeries like radical mastectomies \u2014 determined the patient\u2019s outcome. \nFana explained that new research has shown some small tumors should be dealt with aggressively and with chemotherapy. Other larger tumors may be slow-growing. They can be effectively treated with other less invasive treatments. \nAs a result of this research, doctors have been able to target different kinds of breast cancer with different drugs that are more effective and often have less side effects for the patient. \n\u201cCancer is an ugly word. It\u2019s intimidating and scary, but what it is essentially is an abnormal cell, a cell that\u2019s lost its internal clock,\u201d Fana said. \u201c[If we can start learning] how we can make it sensitive to therapy\u2026 then we are more effective at treating the breast cancer.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mimicopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa fana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy tiersten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tiersten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph lauren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louise mimicopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fana", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mayo clinic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icahn school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount sinai hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bay shore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount sinai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southside hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kymriah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T10:21:23.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb53ade474a2e21ff9d5820175564c28cac74009", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StabGvKE6Qo4nSFPh9b6vKWL5JjbTPKECwqRX0rPl2J.iibdjFqSvdq_svKvlJ1C3ctLJxD2TwKl11m07Zu3p9rccnt0R.nWzxU4h2lZYeRUB8g--", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "What If Insurance Companies Stopped Covering Opioid Prescriptions?", "title_full": "What If Insurance Companies Stopped Covering Opioid Prescriptions?", "published": "2017-10-19T00:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.811, "main_image": "https://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/3124-white_pills-766x415-thumbnail.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 11, "comments": 0, "shares": 11}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb53ade474a2e21ff9d5820175564c28cac74009", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StabGvKE6Qo4nSFPh9b6vKWL5JjbTPKECwqRX0rPl2J.iibdjFqSvdq_svKvlJ1C3ctLJxD2TwKl11m07Zu3p9rccnt0R.nWzxU4h2lZYeRUB8g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Written Bob Curley", "published": "2017-10-19T00:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "What If Insurance Companies Stopped Covering Opioid Prescriptions?", "text": "What If Insurance Companies Stopped Covering Opioid Prescriptions? Written by Bob Curley on October 18, 2017 Cigna Health has announced it will no longer cover costs for OxyContin, saying it\u2019s part of the company\u2019s effort to reduce the opioid epidemic. \nThere might be a new way to fight the opioid epidemic. \nEncourage drug manufacturers to stop promoting the use of some prescription painkillers. In particular, those with higher dosage levels.   \nCigna Health Insurance has taken a step in that direction. At least with one drug. \nThe health insurer announced earlier this month that it will no longer cover most prescriptions for the opioid painkiller OxyContin . \nInstead, it\u2019ll switch to Collegium Pharmaceutical\u2019s Xtampza ER . It\u2019s another oxycodone-derived drug with safeguards against potential abuse. Advertisement \nCigna said it has signed a deal with Collegium intended to encourage physicians to prescribe lower doses of Xtampza ER. \n\u201cCigna is intentionally aligning with stakeholders \u2014 including doctors, national and local organizations, and drug manufacturers \u2014 who share our mission to reduce the inappropriate and unnecessary overuse of opioids,\u201d Karen Eldred, a Cigna spokesperson, told Healthline.   \nLast year, Cigna announced a goal of reducing its customers\u2019 opioid use by 25 percent in three years. \n\u201cOur focus is on helping customers get the most value from their medications \u2014 this means obtaining effective pain relief while also guarding against opioid misuse,\u201d Jon Maesner, PharmD, Cigna\u2019s chief pharmacy officer, said in a press release . No longer a \u2018preferred drug\u2019 \nOxyContin will be dropped from Cigna\u2019s list of preferred drugs as of Jan. 1. \nPatients who\u2019ve already started taking the drug for hospice care or cancer treatment will still be able to continue taking OxyContin throughout 2018. \n\u201cAs with other medications that are not on covered drug lists, Cigna will consider approving coverage for OxyContin if a customer\u2019s doctor feels that treatment using OxyContin is medically necessary,\u201d Cigna said in the press release.   most cases, OxyContin can be taken less frequently than Xtampza. However, OxyContin's stronger formulation makes it more likely to be misused, experts told CNN . \nFor example, crushing or melting some extended-release pills can be one day\u2019s worth of dosage in just one pill. \nCigna officials say Xtampza ER is formulated to resist attempts to cut, crush, or chew the pills to obtain a higher, immediate dose of oxycodone. Advertisement \n\u201cUnder the terms of the contract, Collegium is financially accountable if the average daily dosage strengths of Xtampza ER prescribed for Cigna customers exceed a specific threshold,\u201d Cigna stated. \u201cIf the threshold is exceeded, Collegium will reduce the cost of the medication for many of Cigna\u2019s benefit plans.\u201d \nCigna believes that linking financial terms to dosage metrics will help prevent overprescribing, Eldred explained.   \n\u201cWhile drug companies don\u2019t control prescriptions, they can help influence patient and doctor conversations by educating people about their medications,\u201d said Maesner. \nIn a statement last week, Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of OxyContin, said that \u201cCigna\u2019s decision limits the tools prescribers can use to help address the opioid crisis as both products are formulated with properties designed to deter abuse. Unfortunately, this decision appears to be more about pharmaceutical rebates.\u201d A different approach \nDr. Andrew Kolodny, director of opioid policy research at the Heller School of Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, said that Cigna\u2019s approach with Xtampza ER runs contrary to common industry practices. Advertisement \n\u201cTypically, the higher the dose, the more the company makes,\u201d Kolodny told Healthline. \nKolodny has called for the   (FDA) to ban all ultra-high-dose opioid drugs.   \nKolodny said that getting doctors to prescribe lower doses of oxycodone-based medication \u201cwould be helpful\u201d in reducing the risk of opioid dependence. \nDr. Michael Lowenstein, medical director of the rapid opioid-detoxification program called the Waismann Method , said that Collegium could use enticements like \u201ccopay cards.\u201d \nThese would be used to reduce or eliminate the amount that patients have to pay out of pocket for Xtampza ER. This could encourage physicians to prescribe the lower-dose drug. \nExperts point out that while legal opioids like OxyContin and Xtampza ER can be a gateway to addiction, the reformulations made in recent years make it less likely that they\u2019ll be directly misused. \nHowever, long-term users of these legal pharmaceuticals can become dependent on them. Some slide into severe addiction and turn to the illicit market for other opioid drugs, including heroin. Part of a trend \nLowenstein   Cigna\u2019s new approach to opioid-drug management is reflective of a general trend among pain management specialists to prescribe lower doses of opioid drugs to patients. \nWhen OxyContin first came on the market, for example, it wasn\u2019t uncommon to see patients get prescriptions for 80 mg of the drug to be taken three times daily, he said. \nNow, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) generally recommends that the daily dose of opioids not exceed 90 morphine milligram equivalents (MME). This works out to about 60 mg of oxycodone total in a day. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t get in as much trouble with 20 milligram [pills] of oxycodone as you can with 80 milligram,\u201d said Lowenstein. \u201cThere\u2019s less abuse potential.\u201d \nStacey E. Grant, PharmD, director of clinical consult services at axialHealthcare, commended Cigna for recognizing \u201cthe inherent risks of providing extensive coverage for opioids\u201d while \u201calso taking steps to curb the epidemic facing tens of millions of Americans.\u201d \nHowever, Grant told Healthline, \u201cWe believe that the potential short-term negative consequences of removing a prescription therapy from patients\u2019 care plans outweigh the long-term benefits of mitigating opioid misuse.\u201d \nAddressing health insurers, Grant added: \u201cWhile a prescription drug like OxyContin may lead to opioid use disorder, the best possible measure to take would be to cover more addiction treatment options while working closely with physicians to prevent more patients from suffering from or being at risk of opioid use disorder.\u201d FEEDBACK:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob curley", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "karen eldred", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maesner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael lowenstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lowenstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eldred", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolodny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stacey e. grant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jon maesner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew kolodny", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandeis university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "advertisement advertisement  cigna health insurance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "purdue pharma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heller school of social policy and management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cigna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cigna health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "collegium pharmaceutical", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T16:26:00.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df95bb4ba6cb7d4a1d75b97d60ebd4fbd7fad1ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_UgqhRt9aXSEtRPkkcP0JGBb.NFBMIFC0EUZL9Er.PDXCEDxs1kWYqwjnxdD0yjQmP8EiO6ofHusMKbs.86eUWv1yph3Q58Z82weLg--", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "http://www.healthline.com/rss/diabetesmine", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Healthline RSS Feed", "title": "What Your Health Insurance Company Won't Tell You", "title_full": "What Your Health Insurance Company Won't Tell You", "published": "2017-10-19T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.healthline.com/resources/healthline/images/logo-lg.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 53, "comments": 0, "shares": 53}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "df95bb4ba6cb7d4a1d75b97d60ebd4fbd7fad1ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_UgqhRt9aXSEtRPkkcP0JGBb.NFBMIFC0EUZL9Er.PDXCEDxs1kWYqwjnxdD0yjQmP8EiO6ofHusMKbs.86eUWv1yph3Q58Z82weLg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mike Hoskins", "published": "2017-10-19T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "What Your Health Insurance Company Won't Tell You", "text": "Email   \nDealing with insurance coverage is of course one of the biggest headaches of living with a chronic illness like diabetes. These days, it's even more nerve-wracking with all the political back-and-forth about healthcare policy , leaving folks with \"pre-existing conditions\" unsure how our coverage will be affected. \nWith the nationwide open enrollment period about to begin for many employer-based insurance policies, and the unfortunately shorter 'Obamacare' enrollment period only lasting until Dec. 15, this is a key time for many of us to make insurance decisions. And it's no picnic trying to review options, we know. \nTo offer some assistance, we compiled the following list of tips on how to get satisfaction from your insurance company -- things they often don't tell you but are important to know when dealing with them. This list was originally published a few years ago following the second annual MasterLab advocacy training event featuring some key D-advocates with insider knowledge of \"payers\" (a telling name for health insurance companies). \nHere's the 2017 update on what may help if you're a PWD navigating coverage issues: \nTips for Swaying Your Health Insurance Company \nSearch online. Sounds like a no-brainer, but you can often find insurance companies' medical policies online for a specific drug, device, or therapy just by Googling it. Look for language outlining the criteria they use to determine whether or not you\u2019re eligible and covered. \nAs a non-doctor, of course you won't have access to the \u201cphysician\u2019s only\u201d portal on your payer's website, so using Google, just type in your payer's name (Aetna, BCBS Virginia, etc.), the name of the treatment category (subcutaneous insulin infusion, insulin pump, continuous glucose monitor, SGLT-2, etc.) and the words \"medical policy.\" See what pops up. We found that you'll usually hit the specific policy within the first page of results. \nAsk Three Times, Demand a Supervisor . When you have an important question, chances are you\u2019ll call the insurance company at least three times and get three different answers \u2013 sometimes even from the same person. Often, payers have different levels of records access for various people in their customer service and other departments. So the rep you're talking with may not just be dumb or elusive; he or she might not be able to see all the notes and different screens in your file. Be assertive, and insist on going up the chain of authority to speak with someone who has access to all the relevant info and decision-making power you\u2019re in need of. \nPublicize It. Not getting the answers or service you believe you should? Use social media to voice your gripes. Most of the insurers and distributors have Twitter accounts (for example @ BlueShieldCA ), so Google their Twitter handle and then post some notes about your experience. You may be surprised how quickly that gets attention, pushing your case through from the payer's customer service department to their marketing and even executive levels sometimes. Don\u2019t be afraid to write directly to the head honchos, including the CMO or CEO. That can also get prompt attention. \nProve It. Know going in that you\u2019ll have to show proof of A, B, and C. If you test 8 times a day and need that many test strips per month, you\u2019d better have BG testing logs or downloaded data showing that. You want a CGM (continuous glucose monitor)? Then be sure you have a history of your highs and lows to demonstrate the need for this expensive device. Make sure you work with your doctor so that all the paperwork is in place in advance of your request. This also helps in an appeal, in case you try to get a decision reversed based on the payer\u2019s own stated criteria. \nTrack Your Doctor's Notes. It\u2019s important to get access to your doctor's notes as part of your arsenal of proof, as these days, insurers are often asking patients to provide documentation showing that they actually go to their doctor regularly. The mentality is: \u201cWhy should we give you an expensive device if you\u2019re not even seeing your physician regularly?\u201d Be sure to have your doctor take copious notes on any low blood sugar episodes you experience, because this can also help show a future need for obtaining or maintaining the D-device you want. Yes, you do have diabetes! Believe it or not, you may even have to provide evidence of this basic notion, which you can only do by keeping track of those doctor visits, diabetes data logs, and in the case of type 1, a C-Peptide test showing that you aren\u2019t producing insulin or maintaining \u201cnon-diabetes\u201d blood sugar levels. \nFind a Health Advocate. Insurance companies often employ their own specialized \"health advocates\" whose job it is to walk through your file and advocate for you (example: Blue Cross of Michigan ). It never hurts to have more people at bat for you, especially someone who works on the inside of the company you're lobbying! So be sure to ask about your payer's Health Advocate services. \nAppeal! Insurance companies love to dish out claim denials, because they know that's a huge deterrent. They expect that most folks will simply accept the denial and either skip the treatment or pay out-of-pocket. But the federal Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2011 estimated that 39-59% of appeals resulted in the insurer reversing its original coverage denial. Those are pretty good odds! If you decide to appeal, be sure your doctor(s) are engaged in the process with you -- as insurance companies expect to deal mostly with our doctors during an appeal process, rather than patients directly. \u201cPeer to Peer\u201d Review \u2013 Within a specific time window during the appeal process, your physician can request a peer review, meaning they can call in and speak to a fellow physician at the insurance company to discuss medical necessity. Treatment Exceptions \u2013 If the issue you're facing is that your treatment is no longer on the formulary list for your pharmacy, employer, or insurance plan, you have similar recourse. Your physician can appeal for a \"continuity of therapy\" exception, which can apply to an out-of-network doctor you want to see as well. If you do try the covered alternative (like a generic drug) and you have a negative reaction, you may have a stronger case for continuity of therapy. Tell Your Story \u2013 Personal accounts do make a difference, especially if provided by your doctor. Write up a letter explaining why it's so important for you to test many more times a day than the typical 3 strips per day they want to cover. Or explain, from a quality of life standpoint, why the insurer should be paying for a brand-name drug instead of a generic or different medication, ideally with your doctor's agreement that the alternative is not \u201cmedically equivalent\u201d as the insurance company likes to think. If the issue is a CGM, describe how glucose lows and/or hypoglycemia unawareness affect your health and well-being. \nWe found this great \"health insurance hack\" graphic posted on Facebook by a registered nurse.

As government programs, these payers have certain elements of their practices codified into law. It's critically important that people with chronic health conditions take note of what Medicare and Medicaid (governed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services -- or CMS) cover. This is key not just because we are living healthfully into our golden years and will eventually be in their jurisdiction, but also because CMS sets the benchmark for what private payers will be doing in the future. As Medicare goes, so go the private payers. \nOther Resources \nStep-By-Step Guidance: We are thrilled to see others in the Diabetes Online Community focusing on these systematic issues, particularly our friends at the diaTribe Foundation who recently published a Step-by-Step guide for comparing health insurance plans, and for those Making the Switch to Medicare . Be sure to check them out! \nNon-Medical Switching: More attention is going toward the huge issue of soc-called \"Non-Medical Switching,\" i.e. when an insurance company switches the covered brand of medication or treatment without consent from you or your doctor because they prefer a different company's product (for financial reasons). This may mean you have to pay a higher co-pay amount or even the full cost out-of-pocket for the now \"non-preferred\" brand. This is happening more often on the diabetes medication and D-device front, something many of us have endured through the years with test strip coverage. \nThankfully there are growing resources out there to help those in the D-Community push for a \" Prescriber Prevails \" focus so that this decision-making remains between physicians and patients, and not insurers or cost-focused third parties. A new initiative spearheaded by the non-profit, industry-sponsored Diabetes Policy Collaborative made up of many D-orgs and industry folk (the ' Mine included) is working to address this issue at both the state and national levels -- see this online video and resource just recently launched in October 2017. \nNo Insurance? Clearly, everything above is aimed at those with insurance coverage. But we can't forget about all those living without insurance . That's as many as 3% of PWDs using insulin and a whopping 7% of the American population, and it's likely going to increase as we see more healthcare policy changes nationwide. Resources must be shared and these stories must be told more broadly, to help those facing this no insurance reality. See this great personal testimonial with links to sources for specific supplies, and this JDRF Financial Assistance flyer for starters. \n\nSo that's what's on our list of things to keep in mind when dealing with insurance companies. \nOK, D-Peeps: What do you think of these tips, and what mght you add?

However, some claim it interferes with the absorption of certain nutrients, such as iron. \nAs a result, some people htave been advised to avoid coffee and caffeine. \nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about how coffee and caffeine affect iron absorption. Advertisement Coffee and Caffeine Can Inhibit Iron Absorption \nSeveral studies have found that coffee and other caffeinated drinks can reduce iron absorption. \nOne study found that drinking a cup of coffee with a hamburger meal reduced iron absorption by 39%. Drinking tea, a known inhibitor of iron absorption, with the same meal reduced iron absorption by a whopping 64% ( 3 ). \nAnother study found that drinking a cup of instant coffee with a bread meal reduced iron absorption by 60\u201390% ( 4 ). \nWhat\u2019s more, the stronger the coffee or tea, the less iron absorbed ( 3 ). \nHowever, caffeine alone does not seem to be the main substance interfering with iron absorption. \nIn fact, one study found that caffeine itself only binds to about 6% of the iron from a meal. Given that this is a relatively small amount, other factors must affect iron absorption ( 5 ). \nFurthermore, regular coffee consumption may also have an effect on iron storage levels. \nA large study found that among elderly people, each weekly cup of coffee was associated with a 1% lower level of ferritin, a protein that indicates iron storage levels ( 6 ). \nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that the effects of coffee and caffeine on iron absorption seem to depend on when you drink your coffee. For example, drinking coffee one hour before a meal had no effect on iron absorption ( 7 ). Summary: Drinking coffee and other caffeinated beverages with a meal is associated with a 39\u201390% reduction in iron absorption. However, caffeine itself only binds a small amount of iron. Advertisement Other Substances Affect Iron Absorption \nCaffeine is not the only substance known to interfere with iron absorption. \nThe polyphenols found in coffee and tea are thought to be major inhibitors of iron absorption. \nThese include chlorogenic acid, which is found mainly in coffee, cocoa and some herbs. Also, tannins found in black tea and coffee inhibit iron absorption ( 4 , 8 ). \nThese compounds bind with iron during digestion, making it more difficult to absorb ( 9 , 10 ). \nTheir effect on iron absorption is dose-dependent, meaning that iron absorption decreases as the polyphenol content of the food or beverage increases ( 9 , 11 ). \nIn one study, drinking beverages containing 20\u201350 mg of polyphenols per serving reduced iron absorption from a bread meal by 50\u201370%. Meanwhile, beverages containing 100\u2013400 mg of polyphenols per serving reduced iron absorption by 60\u201390% ( 4 ). \nAnother study found that consuming 5 mg of tannins inhibited iron absorption by 20%, while 25 mg of tannins reduced it by 67% and 100 mg by 88% ( 9 ). Summary: The polyphenols in coffee and tea inhibit iron absorption by up to 90%. The more polyphenols you consume, the more they may inhibit absorption. Advertisement The Type of Meal Affects Iron Absorption \nIron absorption is complex and affected by many dietary factors. \nEvidence suggests that the type of food you eat has a greater influence on iron absorption than the effect of drinking coffee or caffeinated drinks. \nCertain types of foods enhance iron absorption, while others inhibit it. The type of iron you consume is also important. \nIron is present in food in two forms \u2014 heme and non-heme iron. \nNon-heme iron, which is found mainly in plant-based foods , is relatively unstable and affected by many dietary factors. Only 2\u201320% of non-heme iron is absorbed ( 10 ). \nIn contrast, heme iron, which is found only in animal tissues (meat, poultry and seafood) has a much higher absorption rate of 15\u201335%. This is because it is absorbed intact and not influenced by other dietary factors ( 12 ). \nThus, coffee and caffeinated drinks are more likely to inhibit the absorption of non-heme iron from plant-based foods but have very little effect on heme iron from animal foods. \nIn addition, including animal protein, vitamin C and copper in meals can enhance non-heme iron absorption and reduce the negative effects of coffee and caffeinated drinks on iron absorption ( 13 ). \nAs a result, your food choices and the type of iron you consume will determine the effect of coffee and caffeinated drinks on iron absorption. Summary: Many dietary factors influence iron absorption. Coffee and caffeinated products can inhibit absorption of non-heme iron found in plant-based foods. However, they have little effect on heme iron found in animal tissues. Advertisement Should You Reduce Your Coffee and Caffeine Intake? \nSeveral studies show that coffee and caffeine are not associated with iron deficiency in healthy people with no risk of iron deficiency ( 14 , 15 , 16 ). \nMany people get enough iron from the food they eat. Regularly getting an adequate amount of vitamin C and heme iron from meat, poultry and seafood can help overcome iron inhibition from drinking coffee and tea ( 17 , 18 ). \nHowever, this may not be the case when polyphenols are consumed at very high levels ( 17 ). \nFor those at risk of iron deficiency , high consumption of coffee and tea may not be the best idea ( 19 ). \nGroups at risk include women of childbearing age, infants and young children, people with a poor or restrictive diet, such as vegetarians, and people with certain medical conditions like inflammatory bowel disease. \nYet, it may not be necessary for these groups to completely cut out coffee and caffeine. \nInstead, people at risk are advised to follow these helpful tips ( 11 , 14 , 18 ): Drink coffee or tea between meals Wait at least one hour after eating before drinking coffee or tea Increase heme iron intake through meat, poultry or seafood Increase vitamin C intake at mealtimes Eat iron-fortified foods Eat foods high in calcium and high-fiber foods like whole grains separately from iron-rich foods. \nThis will help limit the effects that coffee and caffeinated drinks have on iron absorption. Summary: Healthy people at a low risk of iron deficiency should not need to limit coffee and caffeine. However, those at risk of iron deficiency are advised to avoid coffee and caffeine at mealtimes and wait at least one hour after a meal before consumption.

Written by Dan Gray on October 18, 2017 A new report criticizes the FDA for its food inspection protocol. However, the agency is just starting to implement new food safety procedures. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the federal agency tasked with, among other things, protecting food safety. \nThe agency does this through inspecting and regulating the facilities where food is produced. Advertisement Advertisement \nBut a new report from the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services identifies some red flags in the FDA\u2019s inspection protocol. \nThe review points out that the FDA \u201cconsistently failed to conduct timely follow-up inspections\u201d after a violation was first identified. \nIt also notes that the overall number of food facilities inspected by the FDA has decreased. Advertisement \nThe criticism comes even as a new program intended to take a more proactive approach to food safety is rolled out. \nThe FDA\u2019s Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), which is intended to prevent problems before they arise, is in the early stages of its implementation. Advertisement \nEvery year , 48 million people in the United States get sick with a foodborne illness. \nOf this number, 128,000 people are hospitalized and 3,000 die. \nFor facilities that produce food, containing the risk of foodborne illness can be a serious challenge. \n\u201cListeria is a very serious foodborne pathogen and is responsible for more deaths, percentage-wise, than just about any other pathogen,\u201d Robert E. Brackett, PhD, professor of food science and nutrition at the Illinois Institute of Technology, told Healthline. \u201cIn terms of numbers, though, salmonella is a much greater hazard. There are millions of cases of that every year.\u201d \nBrackett points out that the risks vary depending on the type of food a facility is producing. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cIf a facility is making, say, canned beans, the presence of listeria is not really going to constitute a hazard because the product is canned,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, the fact that there\u2019s listeria there shows that they are not doing a great job in sanitation because it shouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d \nOne of the challenges involved in preventing listeria outbreaks is that the pathogen is an environmental contaminant. \nThat means it can come back into a facility from outside sources, even after the facility is thoroughly sanitized. Advertisement \n\u201cIt takes a lot of aggressive cleaning and sanitizing to keep listeria at bay, and the area where it\u2019s going to be the most concern is with ready-to-eat foods like produce or cheeses. Those have been the main sources of illness for listeria,\u201d said Brackett. Early days for the program \nThe FSMA, signed into law in 2011, is designed to take a proactive, rather than a reactive, approach to the FDA\u2019s food safety recommendations. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cIt was a big change in the way that the FDA regulates food,\u201d said Brackett. \u201cIn the past, and this is sort of by tradition as well as by statutory limits, it was very reactive. It would wait until something happened before they would actually go in and do something. What the FSMA did is it made things more preventive, and that\u2019s the whole theme of that law and all of the regulations that came out of it.\u201d \nBrackett said one of the most notable changes the FSMA brings is the information that FDA inspectors will have access to. \n\u201cThe number one tool is record access, which they never had before,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they don\u2019t have to pop into a facility. They can actually go through the company\u2019s files and see if they have been doing things properly, and that\u2019s going to be a very powerful tool for them.\u201d Advertisement \nIn addition to record access, the FSMA also expects companies to conduct a hazard analysis and produce a written food safety plan that identifies potential hazards in the foods they produce as well as a plan to prevent these hazards and thorough documentation. \n\u201cNow, inspectors can actually go in and look through these records, see if they have a food safety plan, see if they identified any hazards, and how they\u2019re going to deal with it in the future,\u201d said Brackett. \u201cThey\u2019re on notice that it\u2019s their job that their operations are using good manufacturing practices and standards of care that are expected of them.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement Different times for implementation \nThe fact that the FSMA has been on the books for six years doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. \nCompliance for food companies was staggered depending on their size, and the first compliance period, for larger companies, only went into effect in 2016. \nThis means that the full effects of the FSMA won\u2019t likely become apparent for some time. \n\u201cThey did the survey between 2010 and 2015 and the important point is that the law was not implemented for food companies until 2016,\u201d said Brackett. \u201cThe FDA during that time was not sitting idle but doing what they call \u2018educating while regulating.\u2019 They were in the plants telling these companies what is going to be expected of them so they could give them information that would help them comply.\u201d \nThe Office of Inspector General report notes that the FDA is on track to meet the time frames for the initial cycle of FSMA. \nIt also makes several recommendations, including calling on the FDA to improve how it allocates its resources, improve its timeliness, and conduct prompt follow-up inspections. \nFDA officials agree with these recommendations. \nLauren Sucher, press officer for the agency, provided this statement to Healthline: \n\u201cThe FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), signed into law in 2011, changed our approach to food safety from one of reaction to one of prevention.

Written by Elizabeth Pratt on October 18, 2017 Researchers say studies show the vitamin supplement can reduce the risk of asthma attack by 50 percent. Here\u2019s why. \nBritish researchers say they have found a way to cut in half the risk of asthma attacks that require hospitalization. \nThe answer is vitamin D. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe researchers from Queen Mary University of London concluded that taking oral vitamin D supplements in addition to standard asthma medication resulted in a 50 percent reduction in the risk of experiencing at least one asthma attack that required a visit to the emergency room. \nTaking the vitamin supplement also led to a 30 percent reduction in the number of asthma attacks that required treatment with steroid tablets or injections. \n\u201cVitamin D can boost immune responses to viruses that trigger asthma attacks, while simultaneously dampening down harmful inflammatory responses,\u201d Adrian Martineau, PhD, a clinical professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University and a lead researcher on the study, told Healthline. Advertisement A serious ailment \nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 24 million people in the United States have asthma. \nAbout 8 percent of American adults and 8 percent of children under 18 have from the condition. Advertisement Advertisement \nAn estimated 2 million visits to the emergency room result in a primary diagnosis of asthma. \nIn 2014, asthma led to 3,651 deaths in the United States. Globally, asthma accounts for 400,000 deaths annually. \nDeath from asthma typically occurs during a period of acute worsening of asthma symptoms. \n\u201cIn a true asthma flare or attack, the airways become filled with mucus and the muscles contract. They can become plugged with mucus, cutting off all airflow, and ultimately may result in death if not treated,\u201d Tonya Winders, president and chief executive officer of the Allergy and Asthma Network, told Healthline. Help from vitamin D \nResearchers hope use of vitamin D in addition to regular asthma medications will improve the quality of life for those living with asthma. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cThis is yet another example of a growing body of data to suggest vitamin D supplements may help reduce asthma flares resulting in uncontrolled symptoms and significant impact of patients\u2019 lives,\u201d Winders said. \nAccording to researchers, the impact from vitamin D is equivalent in size to that achieved through expensive antibody therapies. \n\u201cThe fact that vitamin D is inexpensive and safe means that it is potentially a highly cost-effective intervention,\u201d Martineau said. Advertisement \nVitamin D can also be gained through sun exposure, though Martineau notes this carries a risk of skin cancer that supplements do not. \nAdditionally, depending on where you live in the world, sun exposure may not have sufficient ultraviolet B rays all year long to produce vitamin D in the skin. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe benefits of taking vitamin D supplements extend beyond asthma. \n\u201cIn a nutshell, benefits for bone health [prevention of rickets, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia] and muscle health [prevention of falls] are pretty well accepted and noncontroversial. There is a strong body of evidence now that vitamin D supplementation can reduce risk of colds and flu, particularly in people who have low vitamin D levels to start,\u201d Martineau said. Taking a look at severe asthma \nHowever, more work needs to be done for groups that were underrepresented in this study, such as children and adults with severe asthma. Advertisement \nMore trials are ongoing, and within five years Martineau anticipates there will be more data. \n\u201cI would welcome additional data in severe asthma, where the burden is so high\u2026 Based on vitamin D\u2019s safety record, it would be interesting to see its effects in children with asthma,\u201d Winders said. Advertisement Advertisement \nBut the research only shows a benefit of vitamin D use in preventing asthma attacks, not in everyday symptoms. \n\u201cAround 50 percent of patients with asthma don\u2019t suffer such attacks but are bothered by day-to-day symptoms. We have not shown a benefit of vitamin D on day-to-day asthma control,\u201d Martineau said. \nThe number of asthma patients with uncontrolled symptoms is significant. \n\u201c[The disease in] over 50 percent of all asthma patients [is] not well-controlled, which results in symptoms like coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath. In fact, in a recent survey we found that over 80 percent of patients limited simple activities like household chores and exercise at least once per week due to asthma,\u201d Winders said. \nMartineau says there is enough evidence that would justify testing for vitamin D deficiency in asthma patients. \n\u201cI think the evidence is strong enough now to suggest that testing for vitamin D deficiency in people who have asthma attacks and treating it where it is found is likely to have a benefit in terms of reduced risk of colds and flu and reduced risk of asthma attack,\u201d he said.

Manufacturers hope they can overtake e-cigarettes. \nA new tobacco product that\u2019s already popular overseas could overtake e-cigarettes in the United States. \nNew research from San Diego State University predicts that \u201cheat-not-burn\u201d tobacco products could soon be flooding American markets. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe authors warn that policymakers, anti-tobacco advocates, and the healthcare community need to be prepared for action when the products arrive. \nHeat-not-burn tobacco products are the latest iteration of electronic smoking. \nUnlike e-cigarettes and vaporizers, they don\u2019t rely on a nicotine-infused liquid (\u201ce-juice\u201d). Advertisement \nInstead, they use actual tobacco that\u2019s heated to roughly 570\u00b0F (299\u00b0C) using a battery-powered heating element. \nThe tobacco is kept below the temperature of combustion, creating an inhalable aerosol. Advertisement Advertisement \nHeat-not-burn products are currently unavailable in the United States. \nThey are for sale in a series of test markets in Europe and Asia. The most robust market is in Japan, where they\u2019ve been available since 2014. Product under study in the U.S. \nAn evaluation of Philip Morris International\u2019s IQOS, a heat-not-burn technology, is currently under way by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. \nHowever, the product must undergo rigorous review because it\u2019s being brought to market as a \u201c modified risk tobacco product .\u201d \nModified risk tobacco product (MRTP) is a designation given by the FDA that refers to \u201ctobacco products that are sold or distributed for use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease associated with commercially marketed tobacco products.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nTo achieve this designation, an applicant must demonstrate that the product has the ability to \u201csignificantly reduce harm\u201d and disease related to tobacco. \nIt must also benefit overall health on a population level, accounting for individuals who don\u2019t use tobacco products. \nWhether or not the IQOS and other heat-not-burn products can meet this designation remains to be seen. Advertisement \nThe FDA will make their ruling on the product within the next two months . \nIf approved, the IQOS would be the first device to carry an MRTP designation. Advertisement Searching for answers \nCurrently, there\u2019s a lack of information on heat-not-burn tobacco products. \nThe study authors note that there are less than 30 studies in the medical literature on these devices. \nOn account of this, they turned to nontraditional data, including Google search information to analyze growing interest in the product. Advertisement \n\u201c[Google searches] are probably a stronger indicator of interest than if you just asked on a survey,\u201d John Ayers, a lead study author and a research professor at San Diego State, told Healthline. \u201cHere we\u2019re observing people seeking out information on the product, potentially trying to buy the product.\u201d \nAyers said looking at this kind of data before has previously been able to predict the rise of e-cigarettes, as well as other things such as movie and album sales. Advertisement Advertisement \nWhat they\u2019ve seen so far of heat-not-burn tobacco products gives every indication that they could be a phenomenon, dwarfing even e-cigarettes. \nAccording to the study, there are now about 6 to 7 million \u201cheat-not-burn\u201d Google searches in Japan each month. Two years ago, almost no one was searching for them online. \n\u201cThat growth rate eclipses anything else we\u2019ve ever seen for any other tobacco product, including electronic cigarettes,\u201d said Ayers. \nResearchers said that given these trends, the potential for massive growth both in the United States and around the globe is likely. Why the product is popular \nThe appeal of the product is manifold. \nIt offers a novel new form of nicotine consumption that could be of interest to e-cigarette smokers. \nIt also offers a distinct \u201cthroat-hit,\u201d a physical sensation of smoking cigarettes, that\u2019s sometimes lacking in other vaporizers or e-cigarette models. \nHowever, the health implications of heat-not-burn products are still not well understood. \n\u201cThere are all these public health questions like \u2018Can it be a cessation device?\u2019 We don\u2019t know,\u201d said Ayers. \u201cWhat are the harms of it? What are the harms of being exposed to the vapor? We don\u2019t know that.\u201d \nE-cigarettes, which have already been on the market for years, are still problematic. \nResearchers have yet to reach a conclusion on their overall effects on public health. \nWhile recent studies indicate that e-cigarettes are most likely a healthier option than traditional smoking, not all experts agree. \nThe role of e-cigarettes as potential cessation devices is still debated. \nThe allure of e-cigarettes for teens, especially on account of sweet, fruit, and candy flavored vaping liquids also remains particularly contentious . A \u2018call to action\u2019 \nInstead of trying to answer the myriad of health questions surrounding heat-not-burn tobacco, Ayers instead says his study is \u201ca call to action.\u201d \n\u201cLet's start studying it now and creating infrastructure to respond now,\u201d said Ayers. \u201cIf we don\u2019t, then Phillip Morris is going to be setting the agenda when it comes to this product.\u201d \nAdvocacy groups in the United States do seem to be aware of the potentially imminent arrival of heat-not-burn tobacco. \nErika Sward, a spokesperson for the American Lung Association, told Healthline that they\u2019ve been following the development of these products since they came on the market in Japan. \n\u201cWe assumed it was a matter of time before Philip Morris International would want to introduce the product into the U.S.,\u201d she said. \nWhile Sward wouldn\u2019t give a direct comment on the potential of the device (for harm or good), owing to a lack of research thus far, she says that they\u2019re following the FDA review closely. \n\u201cWe look forward to a very thorough review of the data that we have, that the public has, as well as FDA doing a very careful review of how this product may impact the public health and whether or not ultimately it is appropriate to allow the product to be sold here in the states,\u201d said Sward.

Eat More Bananas Written by Jim Pietrangelo on October 19, 2017 New research indicates that food rich in potassium can reduce the chances of vascular calcification and aortic stiffness. \nBanana lovers\u2026 rejoice. \nThat also goes for lovers of avocado, cantaloupe, pumpkin, lentil, and other potassium-rich foods. Advertisement Advertisement \nNew research is raising the possibility that doctors may one day be able to help patients avoid some heart disease by analyzing their potassium levels. \nResearchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) recently concluded a study involving mice that draws a correlation between reduced dietary potassium and the formation of vascular calcification and aortic stiffness. \nAortic stiffness, commonly known as \u201chardening of the arteries,\u201d is predictive of heart disease in humans. Advertisement \nIn their study, researchers found increased levels of aortic stiffness in mice fed a reduced-potassium diet compared to mice fed normal amounts of potassium. \nFurther experimentation found that reduced potassium appears to encourage the expression of certain gene markers. Advertisement Advertisement \nThese, in turn, promote calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells by transforming them into bone-like cells. \nThe researchers concluded that, at least in the mouse model, reduced dietary potassium actually promotes elevated aortic stiffness. \nConversely, a potassium-rich diet seems to lessen vascular calcification and aortic stiffness. \n\u201cThe findings have important translational potential since they demonstrate the benefit of adequate potassium supplementation on prevention of vascular calcification in atherosclerosis-prone mice, and the adverse effect of low potassium intake,\u201d Dr. Paul Sanders, professor of nephrology in the UAB Department of Medicine and a study co-author, said in a press statement. Why we need potassium \nDr. Morton Tavel , clinical professor emeritus of medicine (cardiology) at the Indiana University School of Medicine, writes: Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cPotassium is a dietary mineral necessary for many bodily functions. It plays an important role in holding blood pressure down, working in opposition to sodium.\u201d \n\u201cPotassium is also needed for normal muscle growth,\u201d Tavel adds, \u201cand for nervous system and brain function. In addition to reducing blood pressure, potassium seems to work by protecting blood vessels from damage and excessive thickening.\u201d \nHealthline spoke about the UAB study, and about potassium\u2019s effects on the heart in general, with Dr. Sean P. Heffron , cardiologist and instructor of medicine at NYU Langone Health in New York. Advertisement \n\u201cCertainly, anything that is a new mechanism that potentially has a role in atherosclerosis in humans is very interesting to me, both as a clinician and a researcher,\u201d Heffron said. \n\u201c[This study] is a testament to one of the components of a vegetable-intense, healthy-oil diet like the Mediterranean diet,\u201d he added. \u201cIt shows one aspect of why that is repeatedly shown to have cardiovascular benefit. And we need to get people to adhere more to diets like that; to eat more fruits and vegetables.\u201d Advertisement No \u201cmagic bullets\u201d \nSome physicians do worry, however, about those who subscribe to the \u201c magic bullet \u201d theory. \nDr. Robert S. Greenfield , medical director of non-invasive cardiology and cardiac rehabilitation at MemorialCare Heart & Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in California, commented on this very issue. \n\u201cThere\u2019s really no one magic bullet,\u201d Greenfield told Healthline. \u201cYou know, vascular and heart problems, it\u2019s more complicated than that. There are a whole variety of things that contribute to either health or disease, and taking one particular component out is not going to change the course of disease.\u201d Advertisement \n\u201cWhen it comes to potassium, I kind of worry a little bit about people trying to take too much,\u201d said Greenfield. \u201cYou know, there are a lot of people walking around, especially middle-age people, that may have minor kidney problems that don\u2019t even register on a lab test, and they may not handle potassium sufficiently, and you certainly don\u2019t want to take too much.\u201d \nHeffron picked up on this point.

Because it could be dangerous.\u201d Supplements vs. healthy foods \nThere is little debate about the role of supplements versus eating healthy foods as a way to fulfill your daily potassium requirements. \nGreenfield said, \u201cIt seems that the minerals, vitamins, and nutrients inside pills and supplements don\u2019t seem to be as valuable as when they\u2019re in the natural state.\u201d \nHeffron agrees that it certainly is possible that you can get all the potassium you need from eating healthy. \n\u201cIf you eat a great diet, you don\u2019t need supplements,\u201d he said. \nHowever, as a caveat, he noted, \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s a minority of the people that do eat an adequate diet.\u201d \nBarring a healthy diet, supplements may serve as a reasonable alternate source of potassium. Some potassium rich foods \nTavel supplied Healthline with a list of some foods that he writes, \u201ccan satisfy your needs as well as your eating pleasure.\u201d \nSome of those, along with their potassium content, are as follows: sweet potatoes: 694 milligrams (mg) each fresh tomatoes: 664 mg per 1/4 cup fresh beets: 644 mg per 1/2 cup white beans: 600 mg per 1/2 cup \nAlso high on the list of potassium-rich foods are: yogurt ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim pietrangelo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "greenfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean p. heffron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heffron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morton tavel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tavel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert s. greenfield", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nyu langone health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana university school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "memorialcare heart & vascular institute at orange coast memorial medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uab department of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mediterranean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-20T10:31:51.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "455f132621821c8d84db9098f971f514de6764c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StabGvKE6Qo4nSJBqEJNhXleWCJ0Puk7Ekd1gJGuNUy_RLmDmrPHxapJ88ckKg2gGHlxK2BU6U9Gfzg--", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Why You Should 'Eat Like a Horse' at Breakfast", "title_full": "Why You Should 'Eat Like a Horse' at Breakfast", "published": "2017-10-18T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.026, "main_image": "https://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/2075-Front_Load_Calories_Big_Breakfast-766x415-thumbnail.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 17, "comments": 0, "shares": 17}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "455f132621821c8d84db9098f971f514de6764c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StabGvKE6Qo4nSJBqEJNhXleWCJ0Puk7Ekd1gJGuNUy_RLmDmrPHxapJ88ckKg2gGHlxK2BU6U9Gfzg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Written Roberta Alexander", "published": "2017-10-18T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why You Should 'Eat Like a Horse' at Breakfast", "text": "Why You Should 'Eat Like a Horse' at Breakfast Written by Roberta Alexander on October 18, 2017 Researchers say people who skimp on breakfast raise their risk for a variety of cardiovascular health problems. \nFor years, everyone from doctors to dieticians has been preaching the benefits of eating a hearty breakfast. \nNow, a study out of Spain adds a protein boost to that advice. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe findings from the Progression and Early Detection of Atherosclerosis study (PESA) was published this month in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC). \nThe research was led by the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC) in partnership with Banco Santander How the research was conducted \nMore than 4,000 middle-aged office workers of both genders were involved in the study. Advertisement \nThe researchers monitored the participants over a six-year period to note the prevalence and progression of latent subclinical atherosclerotic lesions. \nThe term \u201csubclinical atherosclerosis\u201d is used to describe atherosclerotic plaques, the fatty deposits in the walls of arteries that first appear at a young age. Advertisement Advertisement \nIn early phases, they produce no symptoms. \nThe researchers concluded that people who skimped on protein at breakfast developed, on average, twice the number of atherosclerotic lesions as those who ate a high-energy breakfast. \nThese researchers looked for associations with molecular markers and environmental factors, including dietary habits, physical activity, biorhythms, psychosocial characteristics, and exposure to environmental pollutants. \nThree distinct breakfast patterns and the presence of atherosclerotic plaques in asymptomatic individuals were observed. \nTwenty percent of study participants regularly ate a high-energy breakfast, providing more than 20 percent of the recommended calorie intake. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe largest proportion, 70 percent, ate a low-energy breakfast (between 5 percent and 20 percent of daily calorie intake) and 3 percent either skipped breakfast or ate less than 5 percent of their daily calorie intake. Individuals in this last category spent less than five minutes on breakfast, consuming only coffee or fruit juice, if they ate anything. \nResearchers said the results suggest that skipping breakfast is also an indicator of more generally unhealthy lifestyle habits, associated with a higher prevalence of generalized atherosclerosis. \nThe CNIC research team also found that this group tended to have more generally unhealthy eating habits and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. Advertisement Eat like a horse in the morning \nThe findings didn\u2019t surprise Dr. Ragavendra Baliga, a cardiologist who is a professor of internal medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. \n\u201cThe findings of this study [the PESA study] and the more recent findings of the PURE study in the Lancet [in August] encourages me to continue what I have recommended for years to my patients. That is, \u2018Eat like a horse for breakfast, a puppy for lunch, and a bird for dinner,\u2019\u201d he told Healthline. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cThe trends of skipping breakfast by an estimated 20 percent to 30 percent of adults mirrors the increase in obesity and the accompanying cardio-metabolic derangements including hardening of arteries noted in this study,\u201d Baliga explained. \nBaliga follows his own advice. \n\u201cIn addition to having a heavy breakfast, I encourage that my patients avoid carbs at night since carbs is a \u2018fuel food\u2019 and at night we sleep so we need less carbs. I encourage them to have more protein and vegetables at night.\u201d Advertisement \nOne result: \u201cI myself have lost 10 pounds in the last 18 months by reducing carb intake in the evening,\u201d Baliga said. What\u2019s best to eat? \nThe question then arises: What to eat? Advertisement Advertisement \nMara Weber, MS, RD, LD, a clinical dietitian at The Ohio State University\u2019s Richard M. Ross Heart Hospital, is full of ideas on that topic. \n\u201cBecause fasting puts stress on the body, breaking your nightly fast when you wake is key,\u201d Weber told Healthline. \u201cFueling your body with the right kinds of food is essential to help set yourself up for a successful day.\u201d \n\u201cA cup of coffee and a donut might provide you with adequate calories, but they won\u2019t provide you with the right fuel you need to sustain you until lunchtime,\u201d she said. \nHer suggestions fit right in with the results of the Spanish study. \n\u201cAim to eat about 25 percent of your daily calorie intake at breakfast so you\u2019re not starving by noon,\u201d Weber said. \u201cThe important thing to keep in mind is that foods should be a good blend of high protein, fiber, and some carbohydrates.\u201d In a hurry? \n\u201cPlanning ahead of time is key,\u201d Weber said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have it on hand, you\u2019re likely to grab something that just doesn\u2019t cut it or skip it entirely.

Written by Heather Cruickshank on October 19, 2017 The ACLU has filed a lawsuit against federal restrictions that limit access to the drug mifepristone to doctor\u2019s offices, hospitals, and clinics. \nAre federal rules that limit access to \u201cmedical abortion\u201d justified? \nAccording to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the answer is no. Advertisement Advertisement \nEarlier this month, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), challenging regulations that restrict access to the drug mifepristone. \nMifepristone is marketed in the United States under the brand name Mifeprex. \nIt can be administered in combination with the drug misoprostol to induce miscarriage. Advertisement \nThe FDA has determined that the procedure provides a safe and effective way for patients to end a pregnancy in the first 10 weeks. \nIt offers an alternative to those who cannot access or prefer not to undergo so-called \u201csurgical abortion,\u201d a procedure in which miscarriage is induced through mechanical means. Advertisement Advertisement \nUnder current FDA rules , prescriptions for Mifeprex cannot be filled at retail pharmacies. \nInstead, the \u201cabortion pill\u201d can only be dispensed in doctor\u2019s offices, clinics, and hospitals by providers that have undergone a special certification process. \nThe ACLU states that these requirements are \u201cmedically unnecessary\u201d and \u201cburdensome.\u201d \nMany healthcare professionals and researchers agree. \nIn an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine in February, members of the Mifeprex REMS Study Group called for the FDA rules to be withdrawn. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cMifeprex is extremely safe to use. Serious complications occur in only 0.01% to 0.3% of cases. The rates vary a bit by study and by complication type, but all are very, very low,\u201d Kelly Cleland , MPA, MPH, research specialist in the Office of Population Research (OPR) at Princeton University and member of the Mifeprex REMS Study Group, told Healthline. \n\u201cThe fact that these restrictions are still in place is based on political, not medical, reasoning,\u201d she added . Low risk of serious side effects \nTo enhance drug safety, the FDA has the power to impose a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), or a set of restrictions on how a drug can be dispensed and administered. Advertisement \n\u201cIt\u2019s intended for drugs that have serious potential risks, particularly if used by the wrong people or in the wrong dose or without the proper supervision by a clinician. But mifepristone doesn\u2019t fit that profile. It\u2019s not actually a dangerous drug,\u201d Dr. Elizabeth Raymond , senior medical associate at Gynuity Health Projects and member of the Mifeprex REMS Study Group, told Healthline. \nAmong the millions of Americans that have used Mifeprex, only 19 deaths associated with the drug have been reported. Advertisement Advertisement \nIn fact, the use of Mifeprex poses much lower risk of death than pregnancy itself does. \nNonfatal serious side effects are also rare and usually treatable. \nWhen it comes to addressing the low risk of serious side effects, Raymond told Healthline that the FDA restrictions on Mifeprex are unlikely to help. Advertisement \n\u201cOne of the key REMS provisions is that the drug must be dispensed to the patient in a clinic, hospital, or doctor\u2019s office. But it doesn\u2019t say that it must be taken there. So women can take it and ingest it at home,\u201d Raymond said. \n\u201cIf a woman were to have a complication, it wouldn\u2019t occur until quite some time after, when she\u2019s at home,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo from that perspective, the REMS just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement Restrictions pose barrier to access \nThe FDA restrictions on Mifeprex make it harder for patients to access medical abortion and limit the ability of clinicians to provide it. \n\u201cI think the biggest impact is for women who live in rural areas or areas without abortion clinics nearby. These areas often also have laws that place multiple barriers in the way of accessing abortion, such as waiting periods, so the burdens and hurdles compound for those who need to travel long distances to get abortion care,\u201d Cleland said. \n\u201cIf a healthcare provider can call in a prescription for Mifeprex so that the woman can pick it up at a pharmacy near her, it reduces the burdens of time, expense, needing to take extra time off from work, needing to find additional child care, etcetera. These burdens are incredibly significant for many women,\u201d she added. \nOne of the plaintiffs in the ACLU\u2019s case is Dr. Graham Chelius, a physician who works on the island of Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands, where there are no surgical abortion providers. \nWhile Chelius is willing to provide medical abortion, he cannot stock Mifeprex at the hospital where he works due to the objections of some colleagues. \nAs a result, patients must fly to another island to access abortion care. \nIn some cases, patients might try to access mifepristone and misoprostol outside the U.S. healthcare system entirely. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a variety of evidence that women in the United States are interested in abortion outside the healthcare system. For example, there are lots of Google searches coming from America looking for that option, and there are actually foreign websites that will sell abortion drugs in the United States,\u201d Raymond told Healthline. \nIn a study published online last week, Raymond and colleagues ordered 22 products from 18 online vendors of abortion pills and received 20 by mail. \nAfter sending those products to a laboratory for testing, they found that all of the pills labeled as mifepristone contained the correct amount of that drug. \nThe misoprostol pills also contained misoprostol, although not always at the labeled dose. \nThe investigators reported some challenges in the ordering process, including a potential lack of security in the transfer of financial information. \n\u201cGoogle searches, the proliferation of these websites, and survey data show that some women are doing this,\u201d Raymond said. \u201cAnd to me, what that means is that we need to improve access to abortion in our healthcare system.\u201d FEEDBACK:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "heather cruickshank", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "chelius", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raymond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graham chelius", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly cleland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elizabeth raymond", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "princeton university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american civil liberties union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aclu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "office of population research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england journal of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mifeprex rems study group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gynuity health projects", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mpa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kauai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaiian islands", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-20T14:39:40.042+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66e79b286d244c63f23950d4a62f79bbb2069bed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StabGvKE6Qo4nSF_BHxnAflf5xDFaVemx8sJxBNZy8DB5scEUa0yEtUPARTzrGtmCQ4XetGwRjF9T3g--", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Why We Crave Anything with Pumpkin Spice in It", "title_full": "Why We Crave Anything with Pumpkin Spice in It", "published": "2017-10-19T23:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.172, "main_image": "https://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/topic_centers/Food-Nutrition/3167-pumpkin_spice_latte-766x415-thumbnail.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 71, "comments": 0, "shares": 71}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66e79b286d244c63f23950d4a62f79bbb2069bed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7w42cw6H4StabGvKE6Qo4nSF_BHxnAflf5xDFaVemx8sJxBNZy8DB5scEUa0yEtUPARTzrGtmCQ4XetGwRjF9T3g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Written Kimberly Holland", "published": "2017-10-19T23:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why We Crave Anything with Pumpkin Spice in It", "text": "Why We Crave Anything with Pumpkin Spice in It Written by Kimberly Holland on October 19, 2017 Experts say pumpkin spice seasoning involves some \u201cincredible chemistry\u201d that can produce a nostalgic aroma as well as a comfortable feeling. \nYou can order a pumpkin spice latte just about any way you want. \nWith skim milk, soy milk, almond milk, or more. Advertisement \nYou can order it iced or extra hot. \nYou can order it with whipped cream or without. \nBut no matter how you order it, each glass also comes served up with a heaping dose of feel-good nostalgia.

Then, I remember that I don\u2019t actually like the super sweet taste.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nThe pumpkin-spiced craze is about 15 years old and has seen an acceleration in popularity since its earliest days. \nIn 2003, Starbucks introduced their famous PSL, which now has its own verified Instagram and Twitter accounts. \n\u201cNobody knew back then what it would grow to be,\u201d said Peter Dukes, the Starbucks product manager who led the development of the pumpkin spice latte, in a statement before the 2017 pumpkin spice latte return. \"It\u2019s taken on a life of its own.\u201d \nBefore the coffeehouse conglomerate introduced their famous fall concoction, the seasonal scent was primarily used for candles and home fragrances. \nNow, however, pumpkin spice flavorings are in almost every type of food you could imagine, from Cheerios to Oreos , pancake mixes , and protein bars . Advertisement Advertisement \nIf you think this pumpkin spiced insanity is a prime example of marketing done well, you might be correct. \nBut there\u2019s also some science to explain why we\u2019re all lining up around the corner the day Starbucks drops their first cup of PSL. The science of pumpkin spice \nPumpkin spice mixes are typically a combination of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and clove or allspice, said Dr. Kantha Shelke, a food science communicator with the Institute of Food Technologists and an adjunct faculty member at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. Advertisement \n\u201cSpices alone do not create the \u2018pumpkin spice latte\u2019 magic,\u201d Shelke told Healthline. \u201cThe popular and almost addictive taste and aroma develops only when these spices are cooked or baked with pumpkin, cream, butter, and sugar. It is this flavor combination that companies have replicated in the popular pumpkin spice latte using extracts and flavors. Pumpkin spice products don\u2019t contain pumpkin or even just these spices. There is some incredible chemistry behind it.\u201d \nThere\u2019s also the emotional aspect of it, Shelke said. Advertisement Advertisement \nCompanies know people pay for comfort and nostalgia in food, and they\u2019re more than happy to deliver it in the form of pumpkin spiced goods. \n\u201cThe human brain is adept at identifying aromas quickly in terms of when they were last encountered. In Western culture, the aroma of a baking pumpkin pie immediately transports people to all the warm and friendly times associated with pumpkin pie \u2014 holiday gatherings, families, celebrations, treats, sweets, things that childhood memories are made of,\u201d Shelke explained. \nKristen Hovet, a Vancouver-based science journalist and yoga instructor, said the addictive nature of pumpkin spice also goes to a biological reaction we have when we eat these foods. Advertisement \nHovet learned during yoga teacher training, including some courses on Ayurveda (a holistic healing approach), that pumpkin-spiced products come with many healthful ingredients. \n\u201cThese four main pumpkin spice ingredients [cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves] all have warming properties and increase circulation,\u201d Hovet told Healthline. \u201cThis is perfect for cooler or cold weather, when our circulation slows down. A reduced flow of oxygen can make you feel tired and lethargic, but after having a pumpkin spice latte or another pumpkin-spice flavored food or beverage, our blood vessels expand and we feel warmer and more energized.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nIt\u2019s this pleasure sensation, as well as the memories the flavors evoke, that have us reaching for every pumpkin-spiced food we can find, Shelke says. \n\u201cSeasonality helps. The warmth of the mixture is an ideal comfort during cooler weather,\u201d Shelke said. \u201cBeing warm and happier \u2014 and therefore, nicer and more giving \u2014 especially during the holidays makes pumpkin spice as effective as juniper and pine in fireplaces in changing our frame of mind and soothing us. Optimized spirits can be uplifting and foster a feeling of wellness, and this can make people crave it repeatedly.\u201d \nThat, and sometimes these foods really are just plain tasty. Pumpkin spice without the latte \nIf you don\u2019t have the five bucks to offer the green apron-clad baristas, that\u2019s OK. \nHovet offers a few ideas for enjoying the benefits of the spices without shelling out major cash. \n\u201cI am celiac and love putting pumpkin spice into gluten-free oatmeal on cold mornings,\u201d she said. \u201cAnother favorite is pumpkin spice cookies made with brown rice flour and canned pumpkin.\u201d \nNot a fan of the pumpkin spice combination, but enjoy the spicy comfort in warm beverages? You\u2019re in luck. \nSeveral other foods and spice combinations offer the same feel-good benefits and they\u2019re equally flavorful. \n\u201c Chai would be very similar in that it is black tea often mixed with the main ingredients of pumpkin spice plus cardamom,\u201d Hovet said. \u201c Cardamom , in addition to having warming properties itself, is excellent for relieving gas and bloating. You can see that many of these blends share certain commonalities. They are warming, increase circulation, and aid digestion.\u201d \nShelke adds that the mixture of spices for Middle Eastern baklava and the cinnamon-nutmeg mix in rice puddings evoke many of the same intense emotions as pumpkin spice. \n\u201cThe caramelizing notes of burning sugar can be soothing for many, for it reminds them of childhood days and mom baking cookies,\u201d Shelke added. \u201cWhen sugar is heated, it forms a vast number of aromatic compounds that can transport people through a range of experiences beyond cookies.\u201d FEEDBACK: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kimberly holland", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joanna wheeler johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kantha shelke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hovet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter dukes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristen hovet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shelke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea henshaw", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "johns hopkins university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute of food technologists", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "starbucks", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mississippi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-20T17:33:49.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c329c6398551d7e834484a21dd340d70b179b6fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_UgqhV9G6AqPG86rZJ1mSwBHyyUqMGFmWBlGX9VfUZkoJMo1oyHTInJ1r96bAUUAJW1bqQ--", "site_full": "www.healthline.com", "site": "healthline.com", "site_section": "http://www.healthline.com/rss/diabetesmine", "site_categories": ["nutrition", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Healthline RSS Feed", "title": "My Diabetes UnConference Experience 2017", "title_full": "My Diabetes UnConference Experience 2017", "published": "2017-10-20T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.healthline.com/resources/healthline/images/logo-lg.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 13, "comments": 1, "shares": 13}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c329c6398551d7e834484a21dd340d70b179b6fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqm1uPV1KLMecn9RihFp7wbyOrJe6tP0kGgr8q_UgqhV9G6AqPG86rZJ1mSwBHyyUqMGFmWBlGX9VfUZkoJMo1oyHTInJ1r96bAUUAJW1bqQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mike Hoskins", "published": "2017-10-20T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "My Diabetes UnConference Experience 2017", "text": "My Diabetes UnConference Experience 2017 My Diabetes UnConference Experience 2017 Written by Mike Hoskins | Published on October 20, 2017 Email   \nThe fifth Diabetes UnConference took place in Alexandria, VA, very recently in early October. This was my third time attending this unique, \"unscripted\" gathering of adults with diabetes, where every participant is considered an expert and can ask or respond to questions and learn from peers in a safe setting where there is no judgment or wrong answer. \nThere are so many diabetes events these days it's tough to keep track, and they often blur together. But not the UnConference, organized by the non-profit Diabetes Collective led by powerhouse D-advocate, longtime type 1 and good friend Christel Aprigliano . Rather than bringing a sense of \"been there, done that,\" I find this event serves as a way to connect and expand the diabetes tribe and re-energize. \nYou may wonder what makes a conference \"Un\" ? The idea is to forgo the traditional conference format in favor of a free-flowing atmosphere that \"allows participants to create and moderate the agenda, allowing for a wide variety of topics and viewpoints that might never be covered in a traditional conference... using various sharing methods that focus on drawing out responses from all attendees so those in the room can learn from each other in a peer-to-peer environment.\" \nIn other words, \"no topics have been predetermined, no keynote speakers have been invited, no panels have been arranged. Instead, the event lives and dies by the participation of its attendees.\" \nNote that the Diabetes UnConference is an intimate event, but some newsworthy items still always emerge -- I'll cover that shortly. One big piece of news is the announcement that this UnConference will skip 2018; the organizers have decided it's time to take a break to evaluate how the event should proceed. Bummer, given how helpful it's been to so many in just the few short years this conference series has existed. Diabetes UnConf + Diabetes Sisters \nFor the first time, this Fall's UnConference was held jointly with the annual Diabetes Sisters Weekend for Women event. Attendees could sign up for specific sessions for either event, and/or visit joint general sessions for both groups, and the receptions and gatherings were open to all. \nAmong the 50+ UnConference attendees were many first-timers, and a handful of \"PLUs\" or people who love us (though my wife Suzi didn't attend this round - see her thoughts after the Sept. 2016 UnConference ). For the Diabetes Sisters event, we're told 92 women registered and that included a total of 17 PLUs/partners from both events; this also included the 25 women who arrived early to attend the D-Sisters' third annual Leadership Institute that trains and educates the leaders of their local, in-person PODS support groups across the country. \nAs always, what happens at the D-UnConf... stays there. People are encouraged to discuss all manner of personal challenges and experiences, from intimacy to workplace issues to family struggles and so on. So attendees are asked to not tweet or post from sessions, or to share others' stories without first getting their express permission -- because it's their story to share, not yours. Seriously, a full social media blackout is called for; laptops are not allowed, and use of phones for texting or calls is discouraged -- although exceptions are of course made for using phone-based diabetes tech. #DOC News \nWhat I can share are some exciting items we heard about that are actually public news. \nDr. Oz and Diabetes: Diabetes Sisters member and PODS leader Anne Dalin from New Jersey will be featured on an episode of the Doctor Oz Show scheduled to air Nov. 3! She'll be discussing her experiences living with both diabetes and heart disease. We're told she'll be mentioning the non-profit Sisters group specifically, regarding the peer support and education it offers her that helps improve her life. While we've certainly rolled our eyes over the Dr. Oz Show some times in the past, but the sheer publicity of this is exciting. It will certainly showcase a serious issue along with a great group doing incredible work to help women with diabetes. \nPeer Support at the IDF World Congress: It's great to hear news that peer support within the Diabetes Community, particularly in the context of what exists at these Diabetes Sisters and UnConference events -- will be getting more attention at the upcoming International Diabetes Federation World Congress set for early December in Abu Dhabi (the UAB in Middle East). These two organizations will be jointly presenting and moderating a poster on Dec. 6 at 11:30 am local time there. The focus is \" Peer Support and Education to Better Thrive with Diabetes ,\" and it will include survey results from past conference attendees showing the benefits of face-to-face peer support rather than just online interactions. The trio of D-peeps presenting includes UnConference leader Christel Aprigliano, Diabetes Sisters leader Anna Norton, and facilitator Nicole Bereolos. While peer support is getting more play at healthcare conferences of late, this is the first time anything like this is being presented at IDF's World Congress. Way to go, D-Team! My UnConference Experience \nI've attended an UnConference once a year since the inaugural Las Vegas event in March 2015, followed by the first East Coast edition held in Atlantic City in September 2016, and now Alexandria in October 2017. \nEach time, the UnConference seems to be exactly what I need when I need it -- filling my heart and mind with so much happiness and \"You Can Do This\" spirit. As always, one of the most fascinating parts for me is seeing the newbies who raise their hands to say they've never been to anything like this before, but how much they really needed to be there! \nSince the agenda is shaped by those participating, it takes whatever direction it needs to in the moment, with the facilitators guiding the discussions. With smaller numbers this time, I found it to be an even more personal and intimate conversation covering all kinds of emotional and D-management topics -- from tips and tricks and the tech and treatments we use, to how we talk to each other and loved ones, and concerns over choice and access and growing older with diabetes on board. \nI shared some details about my own life struggles lately, and enjoyed countless conversations with new peeps and catching up with familiar friends on everything from D-life, to work, colonial America history and genealogy, craft beers and current news topics. \nPersonally, it was great meeting others who use Afrezza inhaled insulin and talking tips and tricks that work for each of us. Another topic that got me worked up was talking about how choice can often be taken away from us, whether as an access or affordability issue , or more emotionally tolling like the limitations we sometimes face making choices for ourselves because of diabetes. As I near my 40th birthday and move into my 34th year with T1D, the topic of growing older and becoming a burden -- whether complications are a part of the picture or not -- also becomes ever closer to my heart, so to speak. \nOverall: So many hugs, laughs, tears, seriousness, sarcasm, and humor. \nNone of this would happen without the support of corporate sponsors, an issue that brings up a lot of varying views and emotions these days given all the access and affordability issues our D-Community is confronting across the board. Personally, I appreciate the industry sponsors helping to make this happen. \nWhen I've looked around the rooms at each UnConference I have attended, and talked to others attendees, the appreciation is unmistakable: these gatherings give them a boost of needed energy, and of \"me too\" camaraderie that is irreplaceable. Diabetes well-being has improved, mental health has been salvaged and some have shared that lives have been saved by the friendships made during UnConferences. \nMy own heart and mind needed this bolus of peer support recently too, as I've been experiencing recurring diabetes burnout and even have been questioning whether it's time to move on to a less visible way of wearing diabetes on my sleeve. The UnConference in Alexandria quashed some of my concerns and proved (once again) why this is all so important. The people in the room were grateful and energized. And yes, we missed many friends who couldn't make it despite so much wanting to be there. \nHere's to looking forward the return of the Diabetes UnConference in 2019. And in the meantime... here's to continuing that peer support in whatever ways humanly possible across our D-Community.

Please try again later. Close \nHey, All -- if you've got questions about life with diabetes, then you've come to the right place! That would be our weekly diabetes advice column, Ask D'Mine , hosted by veteran type 1 and diabetes author W il Dubois . \nToday, Wil is digging into a somewhat awkward question that people without diabetes sometimes ask about intimacy. The answer is pretty clear any way you look at it, but here's how Wil would respond in a style all his own... \n{ Got your own questions? Email us at } \n\nRay, type 3 from Louisiana, asks: If you have oral sex with someone who has diabetes, can you get it also? \nWil@Ask D\u2019Mine answers: Boy, am I ever glad you asked me instead of your potential partner in this sexcapade. Because had you asked her or him, I suspect that you\u2019d be having sex by yourself tonight. \nSo here\u2019s the deal: You cannot get diabetes from someone else. Period. Despite what you might have read about the \u201c diabetes epidemic ,\u201d diabetes is not a contagious disease. You simply can\u2019t catch diabetes. At all. It\u2019s not possible. It doesn\u2019t work that way. Diabetes is genetic. If you do get it, you were born with it. To be super clear about this: You can\u2019t get diabetes by breathing the same air we do. You can\u2019t get diabetes by shaking the hand of a person with diabetes. You can\u2019t get diabetes by sharing a fork with someone who has diabetes. You can\u2019t get diabetes by sitting on a toilet seat that someone with diabetes used. You can\u2019t get diabetes if one of us sneezes on you, although that would be rude. You can\u2019t get diabetes from a blood transfusion that uses our blood. You can\u2019t get diabetes by kissing someone who has diabetes . Even a l ng French kiss. \nAnd you can\u2019t get diabetes by having sex of any kind with someone who has diabetes. Not through oral sex, not through intercourse, not through anal sex. You know, I\u2019m often asked by PWDs if there are any upsides to having diabetes, and I usually draw a blank at this question. But, now, here it is: We have a chronic illness we can\u2019t pass on to our sex partners! Yay! Party naked with the PWDs! \nOK, so how do people get diabetes, and why are our numbers increasing ? How can there be an epidemic of a disease that can\u2019t be spread from person to person? Those questions aren\u2019t as simple as they sound, but here goes. The most common kind of diabetes is called type 2, and it\u2019s a disease of insulin resistance . You are either born with the genes for it or you aren\u2019t, and the disease is \u201cactivated\u201d by a combination of factors, with age and weight being two of the most notable. A lot more people carry the type 2 genes than previously realized, because our global diabetes numbers have spiked hand-in-hand with a global obesity crisis , that itself was triggered by widespread shifts in eating patterns. \nAdditionally, in the Developing World, diabetes numbers have increased as we\u2019ve made progress in beating back deaths from communicable diseases like malaria and tuberculosis. Simply put, people in many countries are now living long enough to develop diabetes, which they hadn\u2019t been before. Meanwhile, the more rare type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, is on the rise as well , and the reasons for that are unclear, partly because the root cause of the disease itself is still not well understood. Personally, I think there are more type 1s because we are now living long enough to pass our genes on. Before the advent of insulin, all type 1s died, most as children. \nSo there you are. The numbers are growing due to complex far-reaching changes in global society, but diabetes still comes from within. It\u2019s not spread person-to-person like the flu or pneumonic plague. So I hope that clears that up. \nBut back to oral sex again before we go: I\u2019d be remiss in my duty as a retired public health worker if I didn\u2019t point out that while you can\u2019t get diabetes from oral sex, there are plenty of other things you can \u201ccatch\u201d from it. While oral sex is by far the safest type of sex, at least when it comes to having unprotected sex with strangers, it\u2019s still possible to get a variety of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) from oral sex. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control the following STDs can be passed on from oral sex: chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Herpes, HIV, HPV, Syphilis, and Trichomoniasis. The Feds have a nice little foreplay-inducing chart on that page that lists every kind of oral sex imaginable (and then some) and lists the associated risks of each kind of oral sex for each type of STD. I noticed that the chart also indicates which combinations of oral sex and disease transmission have been well-studied, and which ones have not. \nMost have not been well-studied. \nFor instance, to quote the Feds: \u201cGetting oral sex on the anus from a partner with chlamydia in the throat might result in getting chlamydia in the rectum.\u201d I\u2019ll bet most of us didn\u2019t know that before getting out of bed this morning. But as I said, this is one of those statements on the website that\u2019s \u201cnot well-studied.\u201d \nSo, really, how risky is oral sex? The fact is we simply don\u2019t know. And why is that? Simple: Most people who engage in oral sex also engage in other types of sex, making it impossible to sort out the STD risk from oral sex alone. About the only STD studied well when it comes to oral sex is HIV, and we know from those studies that oral sex is much less likely to spread the virus than vaginal or anal sex; but is the same true for other STDs\u2014some of which are viral and some of which are bacterial? \nWe just don\u2019t know. \nBut for perspective, recent stats show that each year there are a little over two million cases of STDs in an adult population of 126 million or so. That gives you an overall risk of STD exposure at 1.5%, although naturally your social demographic and lifestyle may make that much higher or much lower. So, in general, the chance of getting an STD is low in the first place, and probably much lower from engaging in oral sex. \nOf course, condoms (and dental dams when appropriate) can lower the risk of STD transmission with oral sex, just as they do with intercourse; and on the flip side, the more partners you have, the greater your risk is. So too is patronizing sex professionals, rather than having oral sex with the girl or boy next door. \nThe safest bet, of course, is to be in a long-term exclusive sexual relationship with a single partner, where both partners have tested \u201cclean,\u201d which is a recipe pretty much guaranteed to be STD-free. But how realistic is that? The latest \u201cinfidelity\u201d stats show that around a third of married folks cheat on their spouses, with men leading the numbers, but plenty of women step out on their hubs, too. \nWhile many find those numbers depressing, at least we can sleep well at night (after oral sex) knowing that no amount of sex or infidelity will give anyone diabetes. \nThis is not a medical advice column. We are PWDs freely and openly sharing the wisdom of our collected experiences \u2014 our been-there-done-that knowledge from the trenches. But we are not MDs, RNs, NPs, PAs, CDEs, or partridges in pear trees. Bottom line: we are only a small part of your total prescription. You still need the professional advice, treatment, and care of a licensed medical professional. Disclaimer : Content created by the Diabetes Mine team. For more details click here.
