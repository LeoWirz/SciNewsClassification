Roughly 100 of them were known as \u201cproducers\u201d, sexual predators who film children being raped and share the videos in online forums. \nAll this caught the attention of investigators worldwide. In Brisbane, Paul Griffiths read everything the two men had written about themselves. He sighed: two computer security specialists. \n\u00abWe\u2019ll never figure out who these guys are,\u00bb he told colleagues. \nThat didn\u2019t stop him, though. \nWarHead and CrazyMonk knew their place atop the dark hierarchy of child abusers was vulnerable. \nIn private exchanges with other members of the forum, Faulkner wrote that he knew what fate awaited him. Much later, in an email to VG, he expresses similar stoicism. \n\u2013 You can\u2019t exist within these communities without knowing that you are under heavy scrutiny by law enforcement. The higher you get in the communities, the more you know that you are being watched. We took a great many steps to counteract these measures, which worked for the most part, he writes. January 4th, 2017 Oslo \u2013 Norge Einar Otto Stangvik. Photo: Krister S\u00f8rb\u00f8, VG \nVG\u2019s computer expert, Einar Otto Stangvik, was also monitoring Faulkner\u2019s dark website. Using a computer system he programmed in the autumn of 2016, he was able to download, index and analyse all public messages posted on Childs Play. \nAs Christmas approached, Stangvik tried a variety of methods to see if it was possible to identify the men in the forum. \nIndeed it was. Several members were identified: Norwegians, Swedes and a Dane. \nBut the website itself, and the two people behind it, seemed untraceable. \nOn the evening of 4 January 2017, Stangvik tried a new tactic. Instead of analysing the text on the forum itself, he peeked under the hood at the \u201cengine\u201d running the website \u2013 its software. \nHe found weaknesses. If asked the right question, the server could reveal its own IP address . \nThe right question was asked, and the server replied. It was located in Sydney and owned by the Digital Pacific web-hosting company. \nSuch information may seem mundane, but it was a sensational discovery. \nFew others had ever managed to track the location of a major hidden service on the dark web. It took Stangvik just a few hours to do the near impossible. January 23rd, 2017 Sydney \u2013 Australia Andrew Koloadin. Photo: Tore Kristiansen, VG \nIt\u2019s Monday, January 23rd, and VG is in Sydney visiting the offices of web host Digital Pacific. The company\u2019s founder, Andrew Koloadin, listens carefully to what VG has to say. One of his servers is hosting Childs Play. VG wants to know who runs the website. We want to find the people behind it. \n\u2013 I\u2019m as interested as you in clearing this up. We won\u2019t turn off the server and we won\u2019t do anything to compromise your work, Koloadin says. \nAs a provider of web-hosting services, he is not legally responsible for what is stored on the servers he leases out. That responsibility lies with the individual lessee. But Koloadin wants to do what he can to make the site disappear, and for WarHead to be caught. \nA few keystrokes later, we have an answer: the server is leased by Task Force Argos in Brisbane. \nTaken aback, Koloadin runs his hand through his hair. \n\u2013 Storing material like this on our servers completely violates our terms. I wish the police had talked with us about this, but I understand why they didn\u2019t. It\u2019s a secret operation. \n\u2013 How do you feel about police storing sexual abuse material on your servers? \n\u2013 The abusers are smart and know to set up different systems to avoid the police. So the police have to be just as smart, as they obviously are here. But I don\u2019t like them doing it behind our backs. January 24th, 2017 Brisbane \u2013 Australia Brisbane. Photo: Tore Kristiansen, VG \nThe next day in Brisbane. We have contacted Task Force Argos. They have agreed to talk with us. They don\u2019t know about what yet. Ten minutes ago, the two investigators walked down the street from their headquarters, ties flapping in the wind. \n\u2013 We have a very good working relationship with the Norwegian and Swedish Police. Let's talk and eat at the same time. Today is really busy, says Jonathan Rouse, head of the unit. Jon Rouse. Photo: Tore Kristiansen, VG \n\u2013 We know you are the ones running the site. We know you've been running it for months, VG\u2019s journalist says, once inside. \nRouse goes rigid on his barstool and stares back. \n\u2013 So from the outset, I'm not going to tell you anything as this is an on-going operation. \nThe music continues to play, but the mood has changed. \n\u2013 We have one goal and that is to stop the sexual abuse of children. We will do whatever we can within our legislative authority to achieve that. So what is it that you want? \n\u2013 We want to know what you\u2019re doing, VG\u2019s journalist continues. \nRouse gives us a hard look: \n\u2013 I want to know what you know and I want to know how you found out, maybe we are the administrators of a server. But I will not talk. \n\u2013 I will not talk about ongoing operations. You are a journalist and will write a story. We are police officers and want to prevent children from being raped. So we have different goals with our work. \nRouse suggests that VG must have done something illegal to uncover the operation. \n\u2013 Under Australian law, what you\u2019ve done is the same as hacking. The police are allowed to hack to reveal criminal activity, but not you. So you have to be aware that what you have done can potentially have consequences. \nLater, the police officers will decide to answer questions from VG. How Stangvik exposed Childs Play \nIP addresses and physical server locations are inherently difficult to find on the Tor network. So how did VG\u2019s computer expert get the forum to disclose this information? 1. Profile picture upload The forum allowed users to upload a profile picture. This picture could also be fetched from a user-supplied URL. 2. The leak This is where the information leak occurs. Configured for optimal security, the forum\u2019s software and/or server would fetch the remote profile picture via Tor. Childs Play did not \u2013 all traffic to external sites originated from the server\u2019s real IP. 3. The IP address is exposed By telling the forum to fetch a picture from a server Stangvik controlled, he could see in his server logs that the originating IP was with a hosting provider in Sydney \u2013 Digital Pacific. Stangvik went on to confirm that outgoing DNS requests originated from the same provider, and that the forum\u2019s software also loaded images included in forum post previews from the same IP. 4. A proxy, VPN or Tor Exit? The next question was whether the IP belonged to a Tor Exit Node, a VPN or a proxy server. An IP can hide just about anything. How could he confirm that this was the forum\u2019s location, rather than just a node in a chain of redirects? Stangvik applied three improvised techniques: 5. Timing between the servers He rented a virtual server with Digital Pacific \u2013 the same place as where the suspected IP was located. He then updated the profile picture URL to point to this server. Upon receiving an incoming profile picture request, Stangvik\u2019s server would respond with a redirect to another URL on the same virtual server. Repeating this redirection process several time, Stangvik was able to isolate and measure the roundtrip-time between the two servers. The measurements yielded very low times, consistent with a forum server in close vicinity of his rented server. 6. Measuring intermediate nodes Stangvik also paid attention to so-called \u00abTime To Live\u00bb values on the incoming data packets. These provide some insight into how many intermediate parties are involved from the sender to the recipient. In this case, the values indicated that there were at most one intermediate \u2013 a typical result if the servers were located in the same room. 7. Measuring packet size The final test started to get advanced: Measuring MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) and packet fragmentation.\nEach packet in a computer network has a maximum transmission size, based on which intermediates it passes through. Each encapsulating technology, such as VPNs, can result in the total packet size increasing beyond the maximum size, and local networks usually have larger maximum sizes than the \u201ctubes\u201d found on the internet. If the maximum size is surpassed, the packet will be broken into multiple fragments. \nBy crafting long profile picture URLs, and setting specific packet flags, in the redirects returned by his custom web server software, he could see that the MTU was consistent with that of high-speed local area network traffic, and also ruled out VPN configurations. Read More October 2016 The forum is moved \nIn October 2016, WarHead\u2019s abuse website was moved to the server in Sydney. That was six months after he set it up. \nHow did it happen? \nIn May 2016 Griffiths, the Australian police investigator, received a message from the police in a European country: they had arrested a person who turned out to be one of the moderators of the Giftbox Exchange \u2013 the website that Falte, the American, operated. Would Task Force Argos be interested in taking over the European moderator\u2019s account and go undercover as him? \nThe task force was interested. It is one of the few police units in the world adept at imitating sexual predators on the dark web using false identities. Paul Griffiths. Photo: Tore Kristiansen, VG \nOperation Artemis begins. Griffiths and Task Force Argos had a clear goal: take over the site. Let it rot from within while task force members monitor all communication between participants. Identify perpetrators and victims. Make arrests. \n\u2013 Once you have control of the site, you can do whatever you want. Then you can move it wherever you want in the world. That\u2019s how the internet works, says Griffiths. \nThe man whose identity Task Force Argos had assumed was just a moderator. Unlike the owner, CrazyMonk, the moderator had no power to move or alter the website. So for now the task force could only observe. \nIn recent decades Task Force Argos has collaborated with a number of police entities to combat sexual abuse of children. Several times a year, investigators from a variety of countries meet to review operations and investigations. At other times they are a just a phone call away. They know they can trust each other and get assistance, often from the other side of the world. \nWhen another country\u2019s investigators found the IP address of the Giftbox Exchange, they sent it to Argos. \nThe police contacted the hosting provider housing Giftbox. At that time, they could have seized control of the server and all its data on visitors. But that would have driven the top people underground, and that\u2019s who the police were after. They chose to do nothing other than monitor the site through a backdoor in the server. \nWhile Argos was looking for a way to take over Giftbox, Childs Play appeared on the dark web. Evidence analysed by the police, including messages written by WarHead and CuriousVendetta, suggested that they were from the same country. \nMaybe even the same person. \n\u2013 A great deal of solid intelligence indicated that one of the Giftbox leaders also ran Childs Play. We assumed there was a link between the two sites, says Griffiths. \nFollow the money! For other criminal networks, following the money is a key to tracking down the leaders. \nBut in child abuse networks, there is much less money in circulation. The images themselves are the currency. All the same, it costs money to have a website hosted on a server. In this case, payment was rendered in Bitcoin, a virtual currency. \nHomeland Security Investigations, an investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, began searching for whoever was behind the payment. It was easier than expected. In short, the person nicknamed CrazyMonk had registered that particular Bitcoin wallet to his personal email address. \nThe address pointed to a 27-year-old Tennessean who had lived all his life at home with his parents in a house half an hour from Nashville: \nPatrick Falte. \nCuriousVendetta was harder to find. Of Giftbox\u2019s two leaders, he was the technical expert. However, in the summer of 2016, he hits a snag with some program code. He tries to fix the code, but it doesn\u2019t work and he ends up seeking help online. \nHe takes a screenshot of the code, uploads it to a web forum for programmers and asks for advice. \nIt\u2019s a mistake that leads to his downfall. \nOn the open web, Google sees all. When a Homeland Security investigator saw that Giftbox had a technical problem, he thought: If I had this problem, I would ask for help online. Using search engines, investigators found what they believed was CuriousVendetta\u2019s question. The screenshot of the code \u2013 a seemingly innocent image of text \u2013 was stored on a Russian server used almost exclusively for sexual abuse pictures. \nIt had to be him. \nThe man who posted the question was in his mid-20s and from North Bay, Ontario: \nBenjamin Faulkner. \nThe effort to close in on the two men began. How could police arrest them before they could destroy evidence? Quietly, the lives of the two men were examined. Would it be possible to install a camera in their homes or workplaces? Could the police break in and install keyloggers on the men\u2019s computers to monitor their every keystroke? \nAll ideas were rejected. If the men felt even a hint of suspicion, they could quickly delete the site and all its data about themselves and tens of thousands of members. The suspects had to be apprehended before they could alert others. \nDuring the investigation, the police made a noteworthy find: Falte and Faulkner knew each other. Not just online. Also in real life. \n\u2013 We knew they had a habit of meeting up. We just didn\u2019t know why. WarHead had been in the United States four or five times earlier, and we assumed that he and CrazyMonk met all those times. They probably met for the first time in 2015, says Griffiths. \nThe investigators decided to watch and wait. \n\u2013 At some time or another, WarHead is going to cross the border into the United States. When they meet, we\u2019ll grab them, Griffiths recalls the investigators deciding. \nThat was in July 2016. August came and went. Faulkner and Falte travelled nowhere. \nSeptember ebbed out, and still nothing. \nVG, too, decided to wait. In January 2017 we discovered that the server in Sydney concealed a major new operation led by Task Force Argos, in cooperation with several other countries. \nOnly now, more than nine months later, have we chosen to publish. \n\u2013 After the meeting with Griffiths and Rouse, we understood that the journalists had discovered an ongoing police operation. Although it was stunning news and obviously of public interest, we decided to hold off publishing what we knew. The situation was unclear. We needed more information before deciding what could be published. In a worst-case scenario, VG could have damaged the investigation and endangered innocent people, says VG Editor-in-Chief Gard Steiro. September 30th, 2016 \nOn Friday, September 30th, 2016 , alerts went off in Boston, Toronto and Brisbane. \nFaulkner had crossed the border from Canada into the United States. \nUntil the day before, he had been highly active on Childs Play. It was the last time the forum would hear from him for a long time. The clock on his computer read 11:46 p.m. when he logged in as WarHead and wrote a short thank-you note to a member who had posted a film showing an assault on a 10-year-old girl: \u00abThank you for her! I didn't realize you had more of her up, how did this go under my radar?!\u00bb. \nThen he left. He drove from the apartment at the edge of Toronto, across the national border into the state of New York, then south to northern Virginia. \nAs WarHead crossed the border into the United States, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection sent a report to Homeland Security Investigations. From there, word passed to Canada and Australia: Faulkner has crossed the border. \nIn Australia, Griffith got the message on Friday afternoon, local time. The next few days were critical. Would the operation succeed? \nHomeland Security Investigations checked the location of CrazyMonk\u2019s car. Several weeks earlier, investigators had put a tracking device on it. Since then the car had barely left the Nashville area. Suddenly it was on the move. \nCrazyMonk was 200 kilometres from home, heading north-east. \nFor months, Homeland Security Investigations, Argos and Toronto had been waiting for this. \nThe two men were going to meet. October 1st, 2016 Manassas \u2013 USA \nSaturday. The men checked into a hotel in Virginia. In the evening, they went to a house and stayed late. Court documents reviewed by VG describe Homeland Security agents watching both cars at the house late Saturday night. \nSunday morning the two left the hotel, each carrying a bag, and stayed at another house. \nAt 6:30 a.m. on Monday they awoke as armed U.S. police broke down the entrance door. \nFaulkner was far from home. Had he been captured in Canada, the punishment would be far milder. Now? Pressed into a corner by the agents ransacking the house, he was given a clear choice: Tell us everything and you might get out of prison before you die. \nWithin minutes, he spilled it all: usernames, passwords and encryption keys. \n\u2013 He could hardly wait to talk,\u201d says Griffiths. \u201cOn the web, they sound tough and talk about how they\u2019re ready if the cops come, and about how they have taken every possible measure to keep us from accessing the material. But when a police officer kicked the door off its hinges, pointed a weapon at him and ordered him to lie on the floor, it became clear to this Canadian that he was a long way from home. \nGriffiths gives a quick chuckle. \nIn Australia, the clock was ticking towards 9 p.m. Everything Homeland Security got out of Faulkner and Falte was sent straight to Argos, which immediately tested the passwords. Were they correct? Messages flew between the United States and Australia. Should the numbers be typed in as letters or digits? Had they cracked the website? \nWhat happened next would have major consequences. \nAmidst all the other information Faulkner coughed up while still sitting in bed during the police raid were the passwords for Childs Play. \nIn one swoop, Homeland Security had arrested the ringleaders and administrators of not just one but two of the biggest child exploitation sites on the dark web. \nEverything the two men had with them was studied in detail: memory cards, computers, passwords, usernames, keys. The police knew time was short. \nIf WarHead and CrazyMonk were absent for too long from the sites they ran, paranoid members would flee and the police work would have been in vain. \nAmong the messages sent to Australia that morning, one was special. It said the agents had found images of a small child being abused. \nThe pictures had been taken Saturday evening. \nThen came a follow-up: \u00abDid everyone get the previous message?\u00bb. \nGriffiths sat at home alone, working with the passwords, when he saw the message. \n\u2013 What could I say? There was no one to say it to. I just had to keep working, he says. \nPolice found 30 pictures and three videos. They showed a four-year-old girl and what she had been subjected to in the house that Faulkner and Falte visited. In one of the pictures, Faulkner\u2019s hand was identified. \nThe drive from Nashville takes more than 10 hours. That would have given Falte ample time to reflect on what he was heading to do. \nHe drove across the Smoky Mountains, through lush forests where the trees were aflame with autumn colours. He kept driving. Did he ever stop to consider whether it was right to rape a four-year-old girl? Regardless, he pressed on towards the house in Virginia. \nAs did Faulkner, all the way from Toronto. \nOn the dark web, they divided between them a kingdom of like-minded people who admired them and strove to curry their favour. \nThe supplicants included a man with access to the four-year-old girl. According to a police report, it was he who filmed the assaults. The pictures showed that at least one of the three men raped the girl that Saturday in September 2016. September 9th, 2017 American prison \nThe phone line crackles as the man who provided the four-year-old girl to Faulkner and Falte talks to VG from the prison, where he has been for almost a year. Imprisoned man. \n\u2013 There isn\u2019t much privacy here in the prison, so there\u2019s not much I can say on the phone, he says, and continues: \n\u2013 I\u2019m not going to lie. It was I who contacted CrazyMonk first. \nVG has data showing that this man had visited several of the biggest child abuse websites. He had posted abuse pictures and asked other members for help in finding more. \nFor him, getting to talk to CrazyMonk, the head of the website, was a big deal. A famous man. To make contact, he showed Falte pictures of the child. That\u2019s how it started. \nA few weeks later, Falte arrived at his home. Under questioning, according to court documents, Falte said that during his first visit in 2015 he raped the child \u201cuntil the minor complained\u201d. \nThat was the first of a five visits to the small house in Virginia. Just after New Year\u2019s Falte came back, this time with Faulkner. \nIn interviews with VG , the police say they don\u2019t know why WarHead and CrazyMonk decided to meet, though they had a lot of information about the men. \nAfter the police found the server where the site was stored, in July, they monitored all communications, including private messages between the administrators. The police kept tabs on where they travelled in Virginia, where they spent nights, and which houses they visited. \nNo one suspected a child was about to be raped. \n\u2013 But we definitely wondered why they wanted to meet. That question hung over our heads, says Rouse, in Australia. \n\u2013 Some of these men wanted so desperately something beyond just the confirmation they get online. They want to meet people like themselves, if only for a beer, says Griffiths. \n\u2013 Why weren\u2019t they arrested before the assault occurred? \n\u2013 We had no idea that was going to happen. They never mentioned anything about it in the messages we saw about meeting, says Griffiths. \nThe man who filmed the abuse of the child confirms that was the case. The plans to meet were made in an encrypted chat program, he tells VG. \nPolice had access to these chats only after obtaining all the passwords from CrazyMonk and WarHead. \nFaulkner and Falte say the same in an email to VG from prison in the United States. \n\u2013 We made sure specifically not to talk about specifics anywhere other than Tox [encrypted chat], and burner phones with dummy burner phone numbers, they write. \nThey were surprised at how much the agents managed to find during the search. \n\u2013 I was completely confident that they had very little on both of us in terms of evidence that they could use in court, writes Faulkner. \n\u2013 Our machines were fully encrypted, we ran everything in Virtual Machines (VMs), all our removable media was free of anything implicating. They did not know anything about what was going on in Virginia. ANNONSE \nIn a purely investigative sense , the arrests were a success. Task Force Argos assumed control of all of Faulkner and Falte\u2019s usernames and passwords. \nTask Force Argos became WarHead, but nobody outside the team knew. \nGriffiths and his colleagues worked frenetically to learn all about Faulkner\u2019s online persona so as to assume his identity without anyone catching on. \nThat took longer than some Childs Play members liked. Previously, WarHead had been a frequent presence on the site, often posting messages several times a day. Now he was silent. \u00abDid anybody hear from WarHead within the last 7 days? I'm waiting for a pm from him. Nothing happens.\u00bb , a nervous member wrote, using an abbreviation for \u201cpersonal message\u201d.\n\u00abStrange, her disappearing and this forum going slower and slower ,\u00bb, wrote another. Like most forum members, he used the pronoun \u201cshe\u201d, though the vast majority were men. \nSomething had to be done. If the forum did not hear from WarHead soon, members would sense he\u2019d been arrested. They might then begin deleting their own tracks. That must not be allowed to happen. \nOnline crime has no borders. That\u2019s a problem, but in this case Argos and its partners turned it to their advantage. \nIt is VG\u2019s understanding that when WarHead surrendered access to Childs Play and Giftbox each forum was stored on servers in separate European countries. Police, lawyers and the suspects themselves refuse to say which. \nPolice in Australia and the European country saw obvious benefits to having the Australian police, rather than a European force, running the site. \nAustralian laws give the police unusually broad powers to monitor suspicious activities online. \n\u2013 During a so-called \u201ccontrolled operation\u201d we get permission from a judge to act in ways that normally would have been considered illegal. We are given the right to commit certain criminal actions and we are exempted from prosecution because we are investigating specific crimes, explains Griffiths. \nAt a meeting this spring in The Hague of the some of the world\u2019s leading investigators of internet-related abuse, Griffiths told of a case in which he hacked into someone\u2019s account on a web forum. \n\u2013 I looked around the room and knew that none of the other investigators had permission to do the same. Technically, it wasn\u2019t difficult. But legally they would not have been allowed, says Griffiths. \nHe thinks that\u2019s a problem. \n\u2013 It means they lose the opportunity to identify some of the worst offenders on the internet, he says. \n\u2013 If they had the options we have, I\u2019m sure they would catch people they can\u2019t get today. But it must be done properly, within a given framework. For it to work you have to have certain abilities and controls in place. I feel we have that. \nWith permission from the European police partner, Task Force Argos logged on to the server, took over the \u201cChilds Play\u201d site, copied it and moved it to a server in Sydney, as VG discovered in January. \nExperts consulted by VG say the transfer was comparable to the way the United States once flew terrorism suspects to countries with lax human rights records for questioning. Jon Wessel-Aas Photo: Gorm Kallestad / NTB scanpix \n\u2013 The logic seems to be the same in this case, says Jon Wessel-Aas, a Norwegian lawyer and specialist in privacy and human rights. \n\u2013 It is worrying if the police \u201coutsource\u201d investigations to a country where police have freer rein, at least if it\u2019s done intentionally and systematically. But the legal picture is unclear. \nCross-border investigations are demanding, both legally and ethically. \n\u2013 In the absence of sound regulations, the police in countries with the fewest legal protections can end up with responsibility for an investigation, Wessel-Aas says. October 6th, 2016 \nOn Thursday, October 6th, 2016, \nFour days after the arrest, \u201cWarHead\u201d was back on Childs Play: \u00abPhew, what a month that was!. A month of my life that I won\u2019t get back. Although technically most of the really screwed up shit happened in October, not September, hence my late foray into this month\u00bb \nThen he reprimanded his subordinates: \u00abSorry again about the late arrival but I did ask the Staff team to step in and cover for me in my enforced absences.\u00bb \nHe, WarHead, was no longer Faulkner, but Paul Griffiths of Task Force Argos. \nThus began the undercover phase of Operation Artemis. \nWithin four days of the Canadian\u2019s arrest, Griffith had examined every message WarHead had written. He studied WarHead\u2019s writing style, including the typographical errors he was prone to. He knew the snippets of background history he had revealed online. \nHe did this during the day. Nights were spent in telephone conferences with colleagues in Europe and the United States. \nIt was inevitably 2 a.m. in Brisbane when everyone else was available to talk. \nGoing undercover online takes more than grammar and personal history. To write like WarHead, Griffiths had to be WarHead. It was a mental effort that he and his task force colleagues disliked. \n\u2013 When you\u2019re trying to be someone who has written a lot online, who a lot of people know and whose way of writing and expression they recognize, you can\u2019t just show up and use a completely different vocabulary. You have to study the punctuation he uses, as well as the smileys and other characters. \nNot even that guarantees success. \n\u2013 You need to understand how he feels. It\u2019s destructive. Really difficult. I have been working in this field for 22 years. Seeing pictures has no effect on me anymore. But to sit online and talk like one of these guys ... Every time I\u2019ve done it, I feel like I have to take a shower afterwards. Paul Griffiths. Photo: Tore Kristiansen / VG \nGriffiths \u2013 friends call him \u00abGriff\u00bb \u2013 is considered a leading expert on identifying victims and perpetrators based on images. \nHe has been identifying victims of abuse for 22 years. If one person has abused another, and it was filmed, he most probably has seen it. \n\u2013 My main motivation is to identify the children and get them out of their horrible situation. That\u2019s how I manage to work with it. \n\u2013 I also have a touch of Asperger\u2019s. At least, that\u2019s what my wife says. She says I have no empathy, says Griffiths with a short laugh. \n\u2013 That makes it easier to stay in the job. \nIt also helps that he has a photographic memory, remembering everything as pictures. Even when sifting through millions of pictures, he knows which ones he has seen before, including where and when. \n\u2013 We have good databases, but I generally find things faster than them. \nFive years ago he saw a picture. It was a picture of a naked man. Griffiths knew immediately that he had identified one of the internet\u2019s most ruthless and notorious abusers: Falko. \nThe man in the photo had a feature that Griff recognized from child exploitation films that Falko had shared online. No one had managed to identify him or the victims, because he was careful never to show his face during the abuses he committed. \nBut \u201cGriff\u201d recognized a mark on the man\u2019s penis. \nThat led to Falko\u2019s arrest and lengthy prison term in Kazakhstan. Now he is on the run, after a spectacular escape that involved throwing himself out of a courtroom window and breaking both legs, then escaping from the hospital. But it was \u201cGriff\u201d who found him. \u00abWe are, I can assure you, as safe as we have always been, and I hope we will always continue to be so,\u00bb \nGriffiths wrote in the guise of WarHead. \nMembers believed him. \nFor nearly a year, Task Force Argos would harvest information about the members on the website. \nHaving complete control of the site meant they could see everything that went on there. By reading private messages, deleted messages and email addresses and passwords they could build a profile of the members. They could also add bits of code to the program that controlled the site, enabling them to find members\u2019 IP addresses. They tried a variety of techniques to identify Childs Play members, but decline to discuss them with VG. \n\u2013 If this was war, do you think the general would let you into central command? We do not want to tell these people how we work, and I really hope you don\u2019t either. You won\u2019t get our operating methods, says Rouse. \n\u2013 We\u2019re trying to do something that has never been done before. So in a way you write your own \u2013 I won\u2019t say \u2018rules\u2019 \u2013 but you write your own script. We use techniques that have never been applied before, and we don\u2019t always know how to prepare ourselves for the results, adds Griffiths. \nAs a sort of anthropologist of the dark, Griffiths learned the culture of this online community of exploiters: what should not be posted on the main site (torture videos); what could be shared in a small, trusted group (torture videos); who among the members were popular and in favour and who were not. \nAccessing private messages between members turned up a surprise for Griffiths. Several of them knew the police were now running the site. \n\u2013 A substantial number knew exactly what had happened. They had exposed us as police and saw through the smokescreen we had put up around WarHead. They knew it was us, but didn\u2019t tell anyone. Those who exposed us talked to each other but didn\u2019t warn anyone else. \nGriffiths tried to write as few posts as possible, but there was one that the Australian police could not escape: WarHead\u2019s monthly status update. \nThe understanding between WarHead and forum members was that a missing a status update would signal that the site had been taken over by others. That is why the messages were so important, and had to be written in the same style as always, \nUnder Faulkner\u2019s rules, each status update had to end with a sexual assault picture. \n\u2013 The assumption was the police couldn\u2019t share such images, making it impossible for us to run the site, says Griffiths, who is originally British. \n\u2013 In Britain, we couldn\u2019t have done this. But when you\u2019ve worked in this field a long time it becomes obvious what needs to be done and why. Doing this gives us a chance to identify those who commit new assaults. Most of them have probably already seen the photos we share. \nOn January 3rd, 2017 , Task Force Argos published WarHead\u2019s monthly update. In it, they wrote about the work WarHead had been doing on the forum, ostensibly to make it more secure for members. \nThe message was concluded with: \u00abI hope that some of you were able to give a special present to the little ones in your lives, and spend some time with them. It\u2019s a great time of year to snuggle up near a fire, and make some memories.\u00bb \nHe ended the update message, as required, with two child abuse images. \n\u2013 Could this message be seen as encouraging sexual abuse? VG ask. \n\u2013 Well, there\u2019s no ... I mean, you know, says Griffiths. \n\u2013 Things can be read between the lines, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we\u2019re encouraging anything. We may have talked about sexual abuse in a number of different forums and platforms, but we would never encourage abuse. \n\u2013 Sharing any such image is an abuse of that child. However, it is something we can justify as being for the greater good and to prevent ongoing abuse of children. \n\u2013 How do you think the children in the pictures feel about your sharing pictures of them? \nHe pauses for a second. \n\u2013 I hope they understand that we are trying to catch as many offenders as possible. Carissa Byrne Hessick. Photo: Einar Otto Stangvik, VG \nCarissa Byrne Hessick, a professor of law at the University of North Carolina, questions Griffith\u2019s argument. She is one of the world\u2019s leading legal experts on investigating such abuse. \n\u2013 It sounds like the police tell one story about how damaging the images are when others share them, and another story when the police share them. \n\u2013 That\u2019s a kind of hypocrisy I really don\u2019t like. But this sheds light on the argument that any and all sharing of such an image is abuse. If the police say they\u2019re only sharing images that have been shared before, it means the police do not think all sharing is harmful, says Hessick. \nShe expresses concern upon learning that the police themselves did share child sexual abuse images. \n\u2013 I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s wrong for them to commit criminal acts during undercover operations. My concern is not about them breaking the law. My concern is whether we get enough information about the balance in what they do. \n\u2013 If the site is used to facilitate the actual abuse of children and the police continue to run it, I question their ability to strike a balance, she adds. \nGriffiths claims they do seek balance: \n\u2013 There is definitely a balance between what we want to achieve and how we go about it, he says. \n\u2013 Eventually we get to the point where it isn\u2019t worth running the forum any more. But as long as we\u2019re identifying victims, producers and abusers, we will keep running it. \nHe tells of a previous operation in which investigators ran \u201cThe Love Zone\u201d website for just a few months. Griffiths claims they identified more than 80 children. \n\u2013 You can ask them if our running the forum was worth it, he says. \n\u2013 Isn\u2019t there a risk that people downloading such images will develop into abusers? \n\u2013 Abusers are abusers. People who have a desire to abuse children will abuse children no matter what, Rouse says. September 1st, 2017 New York \nOn September 1st, VG makes contact with a woman in New York. Images of abuses against her daughter have been shared thousands of times \u2013 and now on Childs Play as well, under administration by Task Force Argos. \nShe starts to cry, then pulls herself together. \n\u2013 They might argue in the long term it will be beneficial to my daughter because it will help them capture other pedophiles. But just sending her image to one offender can turn into it being in the hands of hundreds or thousands of others, hurting her more, not helping her, says the mother. \nHer lawyer, James Marsh, takes a more positive view of the police using such images. He represents numerous children who feature in the most widely shared exploitation images. \n\u2013 Several of my clients would have welcomed police use of their images in the battle to track down abusers. They know how skilled these men are at hiding and understand what it takes to catch them, Marsh says. \nHe nevertheless understands the mother\u2019s reaction. The pictures of her daughter had been less extensively distributed than many others, so each new share carried more significance. \n\u2013 I agree with her that the police should compensate the victims, but not with money. If victims could be consulted along the way, it would give them a sense of control. Control is exactly what they were deprived of during the assaults, says Marsh. Help us finance investigative journalism: VG+ subscription \nSeveral participants in Operation Artemis refused to be interviewed or identified, including the investigator who monitored the Scandinavian sub-forum as well as other European partners in the operation. \nHomeland Security Investigations agents declined interviews as well, saying that the legal cases against WarHead and CrazyMonk were still in progress. \n\u2013 There is a lot we can\u2019t say about this operation, especially not what our partners did, says Rouse. \nSome of his own Australian investigators disapproved of VG being given information. \n\u2013 Several of my international colleagues know you are here and talking with us today. They are not very happy about what your colleague did to expose us. We have done a lot of good work together and I want it to continue. So you can\u2019t use my name, says one of them. \nHe is, however, willing to talk about his work an undercover agent. \n\u2013Anyone who says they haven\u2019t cried in this job is lying. You give a part of yourself the job, and that part becomes a friend of those you\u2019re investigating. When we were done with one of our recent operations, it felt like I had locked up all my friends. \nApart from Griffiths, this was the agent who most often went undercover as WarHead. All the website\u2019s members followed every word he wrote. Successfully imitating an abuser online has its challenges. \n\u2013 It\u2019s as if you force yourself to have a split personality, and you download this other person into a part of your brain and hand over that part of your brain to him. It\u2019s hard. Childs Play statistics Number of posts per day Accumulating number of posts with pictures* * Each post can contain multiple images / videos \nActivity on Childs Play was high during the time the police ran it. \nIn January, when VG first wrote about Childs Play, the site had 427,000 registered accounts. Through September of this year, more than a million accounts had been registered. \nOn 25 October 2016, two weeks after Argos took over the site, an unidentified user created a discussion thread featuring images of an eight-year-old girl being raped. \nBy August of this year, the post had been viewed 770,617 times \u2013 all while the police were running the website. September 13th, 2017 Childs Play shuts down \nWednesday, September 13th: After running the site for 11 months, Task Force Argos finally shuts down Childs Play without fanfare. \nIn a few keystrokes, the forum vanishes from the dark web. \nIf you managed to find the old web address, you would simply be informed there is nothing there. Childs Play is gone. \nNow the work of sending cases to police around the world is underway. A dozen countries are already involved in the investigation of the site\u2019s members. Griffiths has a list of between 60 and 90 people from around the world who are his main targets. \nAnother country\u2019s police are believed to have a list of nearly 900 people they think should be arrested. Some have been already, with more to come. \nCanadian police say they have identified and saved \u201ca dozen\u201d children and referred some 100 cases to other countries. Task Force Argos The Argos Task Force itself declined to provide numbers to VG. \n\u2013 The media tends to use such figures as \u201cweapons\u201d against us and our colleagues around the world, and we don\u2019t want that, Griffiths tells VG. \nAlso uncertain is the total number of children identified and rescued. \nProfessor Hessick wonders about the missing numbers. \n\u2013If they conduct investigation without even checking if the people have been arrested, it\u2019s hard for Argos to argue that such police operations are necessary. I worry the police apparently think they don\u2019t need to justify an operation like this, she says. \nThe FBI ran a similar operation in 2015, and the numbers weren\u2019t released for two years. According to the FBI, 870 people were arrested or convicted as a result of the operation, and 259 children were rescued or identified. \nIn the pursuit of child abusers, the police seem to have found a highly effective method: don\u2019t leave the market to the predators. Run the sites themselves. \n\u2013 Our job is to make sure we play at the same level as the abusers. If we don\u2019t, they will always be one step ahead, says Jon Rouse. September 15th, 2017 Richmond, Virginia \nOn Friday, September 15th, two 27-year-old men faced a judge in a Richmond, Virginia, courtroom. The prosecutor had demanded a sentence of 50 years in prison. The defendants\u2019 own lawyers said 30 years would be more appropriate. \nThe judge didn\u2019t agree with either side, and sentenced both 27-year-olds to life in prison. \nNeither will ever be released. Not because they, as CrazyMonk and WarHead, had run the internet\u2019s largest abuse forums, but because as Benjamin Faulkner and Patrick Falte they had raped a four-year-old girl. \nIn Tennessee, prosecutors are preparing to try the men accused of running \u00abThe GiftBox Exchange\u00bb. \nIn an email to VG from prison, Falte and Faulkner say they will fight their case in court. \n\u2013 We would love to talk more about GBE, CPlay, and some other sites, but we cannot get into that until after the Tennessee trail. Saying all that, we may have been involved at every level, for years, starting from the basic user to moderating, administrating, owning and creating, several sites, chatrooms, and services, Falte and Faulkner write, using initials for Giftbox Exchange and Childs Play. \nThey later add that they will appeal the life sentence ruled in Virginia. \nTheir lawyers have not answered VG\u2019s inquiries. \nThere will probably never be a trial focused on Childs Play, the site that Task Force Argos ran for almost a year. Faulkner has been sentenced in any case to spend the rest of his life in prison. \nPublished: October 7th, 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

It was the largest child sexual abuse forum on the dark web. No other undercover operation against abuse sites on the dark web has lasted as long. The police themselves shared abuse images on the website as part of their undercover operation. In January 2017, VG discovered the site was stored on a server in Sydney. That led to VG\u2019s uncovering of the police operation. On 3 October 2016, the site\u2019s two ringleaders were arrested in the United States. They surrendered passwords that allowed Australia\u2019s Task Force Argos police unit to assume operation of the site. On 13 September 2017, Task Force Argos shut down the website. \nAn Australian police operation revealed by VG on Saturday is \u00aba clear violation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, even though the police\u2019s intention is to prevent new offenses in the long run,\u00bb says Ivar Stokkereit, a legal adviser to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund in Norway (UNICEF). VG reported that Australian police have secretly operated the world\u2019s largest online child sexual abuse forum for 11 months. By pretending to be the forum\u2019s original administrators, the Task Force Argos police unit appears to have collected extensive information on abusers and paedophiles in a number of countries. The police themselves shared images of child abuse on the website as part of their undercover operation. On 13 September they closed the site. \nRead more about: The downloaders \u2013 Clear violation of UN convention UNICEF, the world\u2019s largest children\u2019s support organization, views the tactic employed by Australia\u2019s police as a breach of children\u2019s rights. \u2013 If police operation of the website means that pictures are being spread and new abuse is taking place, it\u2019s a clear violation the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, even though the police\u2019s intention is to prevent new offenses in the long run, says UNICEFs Norwegian legal adviser Ivar Stokkereit. He noted that the case involves children that the state and the police have a special responsibility to protect. \u2013 We would advise against the police using children as an investigative tool to expose abusers, and we encourage the police to use other methods to expose the perpetrators without having new acts of abuse take place, Stokkereit says. \nURGES CAUTION: Unicef Norway legal adviser Ivar Stokkereit, advises police against using vulnerable children as a tool in undercover operations. Foto: UNICEF The UN children\u2019s convention makes it clear that children must not be put at risk of abuse, according to UNICEF\u2019s legal adviser. No exception is provided for actions intended to prevent new offenses in the long term. \u2013 Unacceptable under human rights law \nLARGE INFRINGEMENT: \u2013 It\u2019s totally unacceptable for the police to spread child abuse images to catch paedophiles, says Patricia Kaatee of Amnesty International. Foto: Amnesty Amnesty International agrees with UNICEF. \u2013 This is a disproportionately large infringement of children\u2019s rights, says Patricia Kaatee, a political adviser for the human rights organization. Combating paedophile networks is important, commendable work, she says, but police tactics in clandestine operations must not violate international human rights. \u2013 It\u2019s possible to limit the rights of a group if that is necessary to achieve a legitimate goal and does not involve a disproportionately large infringement, Kaatee tells VG. \u2013 In our view, if the police try to expose a paedophile network by actively sharing images of abuse, it would disproportionately impact the rights of children already subjected to serious violations of their basic human rights. \nUN Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 19: \n1. States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child. 2. Such protective measures should, as appropriate, include effective procedures for the establishment of social programmes to provide necessary support for the child and for those who have the care of the child, as well as for other forms of prevention and for identification, reporting, referral, investigation, treatment and follow-up of instances of child maltreatment described heretofore, and, as appropriate, for judicial involvement. According to Amnesty International, there is a big difference between monitoring a network and actively sharing abuse pictures. It claims the Australian police operation contravened Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and Article 3 of International Labour Organization Convention No. 182. \u2013 It is unacceptable from a human rights perspective to violate a child\u2019s rights on grounds that the violation protects another child. The police therefore should not actively share photos that show children being subjected to sexual abuse, even if the reason is to protect other children from sexual abuse. And nobody knows whether the police\u2019s forwarding of pictures could lead to additional acts of abuse, says Kaatee. This map shows: 95, 000 downloaders of child abuse pictures \u2013 A good initiative The international organization ECPAT (End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes) sees the matter differently. Its view is that Task Force Argos took a proactive approach to stopping sexual exploitation of children. \u2013 ECPAT welcomes any proactive approaches to ending the terrible crime of the sexual exploitation of children , says Damien Keane, ECPAT\u2019s international communications director. \u2013Task Force Argos is globally recognized as a leader in this area. Any law enforcement operation of this nature must be victim focused. And the benefit of catching offenders must be carefully considered with the long-term interests of victims. Keane says commenting on the ethics of the Australian police method is difficult without knowing all the operational details. \u2013 However, the potential benefit of carrying out an operation like this is significant. Every offender caught could mean multiple future victims protected from abuse. The identification of registered users could lead to the capture of more offenders in the future. And the operation will have led to the capture and seizure of multiple series of abuse images \u2013 which could contribute to recognizing, locating and hopefully rescuing the unidentified child victims portrayed in the material, Keane says. ECPAT serves as an adviser to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). VG also sought comment from Save the Children International, but the organization declined to comment. \u2013 Using it for good Jon Rouse, head of Task Force Argos, has been informed of the reactions from Unicef and Amnesty, but has not given any direct response to these. However, in earlier interviews with VG he has told about their decision to publish child abuse images. \u2013 We are not producing child exploitation material. We are taking it, and under curtain rules, we are using it for good. I can\u2019t fix what happened to the child in that picture, but I can use that fact that the picture has been circulating the globe for the last 10-15 years for some good: To stop the further abuse of a child, Rouse says. \nHARD DECISION: Detective inspector Jon Rouse, head of Task Force Argos at Queensland police.

While noting with approval that the police avoid using images never before shared, she said the Australian task force\u2019s use of previously shared images sheds light on the argument that \u00abany and all sharing\u00bb of such pictures equates to abuse. \u2013 It sounds like the police tell one story about how damaging the images are when others share them, and another story when the police share them. That\u2019s a kind of hypocrisy I really don\u2019t like. \nConsequences of violating the Rights of The Child convention \n1. A state is in violation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child if it fails to fulfil its obligations under the convention, including implementation of the convention\u2019s provisions. In this case, the state has a responsibility to ensure that children are not subjected to abuse as described in Article 19 of the Convention. Moreover, the convention\u2019s Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography prohibits any presentation, production, distribution, transmission or offering of child pornography. The state\u2019s responsibility for protecting children means it must ensure that no one, including the police, is permitted to use methods that violate the convention. \n2. Violation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child has no direct consequences for the state. However, violation of the convention may be cause for a lawsuit against the state, either by children who have been directly affected by the violation (children subjected to abuse, etc.) or by groups of children seeking judicial review of state actions in relation to the convention. For states that have ratified the Third Optional Protocol to the convention, children may also report rights violations to the UN Children\u2019s Committee, which then determines whether the states in question have fulfilled their obligations. Source: UNICEF Inger Marie Sunde, a researcher at the Norwegian Police University College, endorses the view that the operation violated children\u2019s rights. \u2013 You must not use children as a means of catching criminals. Under human rights law, children have a right to avoid publicity. But if the sharing is done in a context where it\u2019s important to revealing the identity of abusers, I think these are defensible violations, Sunde says. But she emphasizes that the police cannot charge people with downloading the images that Task Force Argos itself shared. \u2013 That would be the same as provocation, which is not permissible.

Only when VG identified the man was he arrested. Denne saken handler om: \nOne of them boasted about abuse he had committed and planned to commit. Nevertheless, neither the Norwegian police nor the Australian police knew about him. \nOnly when VG managed to identify the man was he arrested. \nWhen VG began examining child sexual abuse sites on the dark web last December, no one involved realized that the largest such site \u2013 \u00abChilds Play\u00bb \u2013 was being operated by the Australian police. That fact emerged a couple of months later, and was revealed to the world on Saturday. \nThis is the case: For 11 months \u2013 from October 2016 to September 2017 \u2013 Australian police ran the Childs Play website. It was the largest child sexual abuse forum on the dark web. No other undercover operation against abuse sites on the dark web has lasted as long. The police themselves shared abuse images on the website as part of their undercover operation. In January 2017, VG discovered the site was stored on a server in Sydney. That led to VG\u2019s uncovering of the police operation. On 3 October 2016, the site\u2019s two ringleaders were arrested in the United States. They surrendered passwords that allowed Australia\u2019s Task Force Argos police unit to assume operation of the site. On 13 September 2017, Task Force Argos shut down the website. \nShared advice on abuse \nAs part of their investigation into abuse sites, VG\u2019s journalists attempted to identify several Norwegian and Nordic members active on Childs Play. A resident of western Norway in his 20s quickly drew attention to himself. \nOn Monday, 12 September 2016, he posted on the website that he would be committing an abusive act on a child in his own family later that week. Three days later, he wrote a new post claiming the act had taken place. \n\u00abOne thing is very important,\u00bb he wrote. \u00abAlways motivate the children. \u2026 Do it right and you will [be able to experience such abuse again].\u00bb \nThe website where this occurred was on an encrypted part of the internet called the dark web, making it almost impossible to identify participants. To remain anonymous, more and more abusers and paedophiles using pseudonyms have been congregating in this part of the internet. In theory the system is failsafe. \nBut only in theory. How he was identified \nOn 5 December 2016, the same team that one year earlier identified downloaders of child abuse pictures , startet working on identifying people on this website on the dark web. \nVG\u2019s journalists managed to identify the Norwegian man by comparing information he had provided about himself on the forum with information available on the open internet. \nIt turned out he had used the same username on Skype, a chat programme, that he used in the abuse forum. \nIt took VG\u2019s journalists only a few minutes to link the username on the dark web to the Skype username. A couple of hours were then required to collect additional information confirming it was the same person. \nThe man had previously worked in a kindergarten. \nOn 9 December, VG notified the police. Norwegian news staffs rarely turn over unpublished material, but this time VG chose to send written documentation to the local police. \nRead: This map shows 95,000 downloaders of child abuse pictures \n\u2013 Anyone who contacts us can be certain that VG does not cooperate with the authorities, says VG Editor-in-Chief Gard Steiro: \n\u2013 Our job is to be critical of the police. The exception is when lives or health are at risk. In this case we possessed information about possible ongoing abuse of a specific minor. Our concern was not to start an investigation but to make sure the child was seen to. It was obviously a correct decision. \nARRESTED THE MAN: Police head quarters of Norway\u2019s M\u00f8re og Romsdal police district, in \u00c5lesund. Foto: Maria Fagervoll , VG Did not notify Norwegian police On Wednesday, 18 January 2017, the man was arrested at his home in western Norway. The following day he was remanded in custody for four weeks, accused of sexual assault against a child as well as \u201cactivities on websites/networks for paedophiles\u201d, according to the remand order. Under questioning by the police, he partially acknowledged the allegations. At the time of the Norwegian\u2019s arrest, the Australian police unit Task Force Argos had been operating the abuse website for three months. The site\u2019s Nordic-language sub-forum was monitored by a police officer with Nordic-language skills who collaborated with Task Force Argos. However, several messages to the young man as well as his own posts about the abuse he committed were written in English. It is VG\u2019s understanding that neither the Nordic-language investigator nor Task Force Argos notified Norwegian police about the abuse in question. \u2013 I can\u2019t comment on every individual case, says Task Force Argos investigator Paul Griffiths of Brisbane, Australia. \u2013 But what I can say is that there are probably hundreds of Childs Play members who we know have access to children, and are potentially producing material with those children. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can identify who they all are, he continues. Serious case \nPolice prosecutor Julie Ulstein of Norway\u2019s M\u00f8re og Romsdal police district tells VG that the investigation of the Norwegian man is still underway but is nearing an end. \n\u2013 No indictment has been brought yet, but we see it as a serious matter, she says. \nSERIOUS CASE: Police prosecutor Julie Ulstein of Norway\u2019s M\u00f8re og Romsdal police district. Foto: Maria Fagervoll , VG \u2013 What do you think about the fact that nobody involved in this international operation contacted you about the abuse the man wrote about? \u2013 It\u2019s hard to comment on it, since we haven\u2019t been in contact with them. I don\u2019t know what all was considered by the Australian police, and what the basis was for those considerations, Ulstein says. \nWhen Norway\u2019s National Criminal Investigation Service, known as Kripos, is asked whether it has received investigative material or information about Norwegians from the Australian operation, the reply is: \n\u00abAt this time, we do not wish to confirm or deny whether we have received information from the action mentioned. Nor therefore do we wish to embark on answering the follow-up questions.\u00bb \nThe accused Norwegian\u2019s lawyer, Erling Flisnes, declined to comment on the case. Grete Opshaug, counsel for the child involved, was informed of VG\u2019s article but did not wish not comment for now.

Denne saken handler om: 2200 22 00 00 00 \nLast weekend VG documented an undercover police operation targeting the largest child exploitation sites on the dark web , where anonymity reigns. Investigators from Australia, the United States, Canada and European countries cooperated to locate and take over the two sites. \nThe original operators of the sites had stored them on servers in a European country, but that country\u2019s police allowed Australia\u2019s Task Force Argos to move the website to Australia. The legal framework in Australia made it easier to keep the site\u2019s abuse forum running as part of a clandestine police operation. \u2013 Some countries can\u2019t do nearly what we can do, legislatively. Their legislation prohibits posting and hosting the site. Hosting a board is a fairly serious criminal violation, Jon Rouse, head of Task Force Argos explains: \u2013 So if your legislation doesn\u2019t allow you to do that, what do you do? You just have to delete the board, but why would you want to do that? It will just pop up again, if you don\u2019t do something about it. If you are going to do these operations, you have to follow it all the way through. You have to make sure you destroy the website, and in the process identify as many of the criminals and victims as you can, Rouse says. \nSEARCH AND DESTROY: \u2013 If you are going to do these operations, you have to follow it all the way through, says Jon Rouse, head of Task Force Argos in Queensland, Australia.

That is the very definition of jurisdiction shopping, says Sheptycki, an expert on transnational crime and policing. \nHe sees that as a problem. \u2013 By moving evidence-collection across national borders, the police become the ones deciding what punishment the accused should get. That is not their job. In our democratic system there is a division of power. Punishment is determined by the courts, not the police, Sheptycki tells VG, and adds: \nThis is the case: For 11 months \u2013 from October 2016 to September 2017 \u2013 Australian police ran the Childs Play website. It was the largest child sexual abuse forum on the dark web. No other undercover operation against abuse sites on the dark web has lasted as long. The police themselves shared abuse images on the website as part of their undercover operation. In January 2017, VG discovered the site was stored on a server in Sydney. That led to VG\u2019s uncovering of the police operation. On 3 October 2016, the site\u2019s two ringleaders were arrested in the United States. They surrendered passwords that allowed Australia\u2019s Task Force Argos police unit to assume operation of the site. On 13 September 2017, Task Force Argos shut down the website. \u2013 This is something the police have done for years, especially in drug cases. And criminals do the same thing. They try to place their websites in countries where the laws make it easy to hide. When criminal activity crosses national borders, it\u2019s natural that the police look for tools they have to do the same. \u2013 Outsourcing Norwegian lawyer Jon Wessel-Aas, an expert on privacy and human rights, also considers the practice troubling. \u2013 In the absence of sound regulations, the police in countries with the fewest legal protections can end up with responsibility for an investigation, he says. \nHe cites the example of U.S. terrorism interrogations \u00aboutsourced\u00bb to countries with lax human rights records during the George W. Bush administration, saying: \n\u2013 The logic seems to be the same in this case. \nInternational law does not govern cross-border police operations, so each police agency works within the legal framework of its own country. \n\u2013 Much of this is not very well regulated, and that\u2019s a concern. If the politicians believe there is a reason why we limit what the police can do, then it\u2019s hard to understand how this type of police work can be outsourcedm, says Wessel-Aas. \nSheptycki believes the police have a choice. But if they are going to shop for the most favourable legal jurisdiction, they must do so consistently. \n\u2013 Child abusers are an easy enemy \u2013 nobody wants to stand up for their rights. In cases like this, it looks as if the police are doing the only right thing. But why don\u2019t they use the same methods against people committing fraud on Wall Street and laundering money in the Caribbean? Sheptycki asks. International cooperation needed to secure evidence \nOn a daily basis Norway\u2019s National Criminal Investigation Service, or Kripos, receives information from foreign law enforcement agencies about Norwegians who may have committed criminal acts. \n\u2013 Generally speaking, good international cooperation is often what\u2019s needed to discover and solve criminal cases, including child abuse cases, and to secure evidence, says Laila S\u00f8ndrol, head of Kripos\u2019s sexual crimes section. \nAccording to Kripos, it is inevitable that some countries have expertise, capacity or legislation allowing them to obtain evidence others cannot. \n\u2013 When authorities abroad investigate cases on their own initiative and share information from the investigation with Norway, Kripos presumes the information was obtained using legal methods in the country where it was obtained.

Denne saken handler om: Mats Zuccarello \nPenguins viste fra start at de ikke hadde planer om \u00e5 by p\u00e5 en lett match. Phil Kessel lurte pucken forbi Rangers\u2019 svenske m\u00e5lvakt Henrik Lundquist kun etter 43 sekunder.

David Desharnais satte inn lagets f\u00f8rste m\u00e5l etter seks minutter, etterfulgt av Pavel Buchnevich med assist fra Zuccarello et halvannet minutt senere. \nLike etter, p\u00e5 minuttet, s\u00f8rget J.T Miller for at Rangers tok over ledelsen med stillingen 3\u20132. Ti minutter senere utlignet Penguins\u2019 Patric Hornqvist. \nSpenningen fortsatte i tredje og siste periode.

Rangers har s\u00e5 langt i sesongen tapt fem av seks kamper, og om Penguins stakk av med seieren i kveldens kamp, hadde det f\u00f8rt til New York-lagets d\u00e5rligste sesongstart p\u00e5 57 \u00e5r.
