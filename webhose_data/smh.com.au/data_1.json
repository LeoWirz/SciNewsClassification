SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Switching jerseys: Matt Moylan and James Maloney could be part of a player swap deal to get Moylan to Cronulla. Photo: NRL Imagery/ Grant Trouville \nFairfax Media understands the Panthers are reluctant to agree to a release unless it is on their terms and won't contemplate letting Moylan out of the next four years of his contract without something in return. \nThat something is Maloney \u2013 an experienced playmaker they believe will be the ideal sounding board for teenager Nathan Cleary in his development. \nAs revealed by Fairfax Media last week, the Panthers have also suggested they would be open to a compensation deal, putting a $250,000 transfer fee on each of his four contracted seasons as an option for any potential release. \nMoylan, who a fortnight ago asked to be released from the captaincy responsibilities at Penrith, has also attracted interest from the Tigers and former coach Ivan Cleary. Advertisement \nThe joint-venture club want Moylan to fill the void left by James Tedesco's defection to the Sydney Roosters. However, their hopes of landing his signature are severely dented by Moylan's aspirations to make the permanent move into the No.6 jersey \u2013 a position that will be filled by Josh Reynolds at the Tigers next year. \nThe Tigers, who have Tuimoala Lolohea as their fullback option at this point, are believed to have offered a deal worth $2.5 million over three seasons. You will now receive updates from League HQ Newsletter League HQ Newsletter \nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox. By submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy . \nKey to negotiations for Cronulla is Moylan's relationship with childhood friend Andrew Fifita. Moylan and his brother, whom he is living with, have a strong connection with the Fifita family and share a special bond having grown up together in Sydney's west. \nPenrith's preference is to keep Moylan at the club, but the noise surrounding the 26-year-old's unhappiness at the club won't go away despite him showing renewed enthusiasm over the past few weeks. \nFormer player agent Wayne Beavis still represents Panthers general manager Phil Gould and Sharks coach Shane Flanagan, and only this year gave up Maloney as his client after deciding against another year as an accredited NRL player manager. \nInterestingly, Beavis has offloaded most of his player clients to Allan Gainey, the same manager who represents Moylan and signed off on a five-year deal with the Panthers just last year. \nThe anterior cruciate ligament injury to rookie Tyrone May in Penrith's last game of the season has complicated things, with Penrith reluctant to start 2018 without a proven five-eighth. \nBoth May and fullback Dylan Edwards are on minimum wage contracts and will be upgraded soon. However, that may create salary cap restrictions in 2019 given most of the Panthers' big name players are locked up on long-term deals. \nPenrith are also preparing for a huge battle to keep halfback Cleary at the club beyond the end of 2019, aware of the appeal of playing under his father at the Tigers when his contract expires at the Panthers. \nMoylan is expected to attend the club's presentation night at Panthers Leagues Club on Wednesday night, with his future expected to be the elephant in the room. \nDespite reaching the second week of the finals, Penrith have no players in Australia's 24-man World Cup squad. \nTrent Merrin and Reagan Campbell-Gillard were considered, but Merrin was deemed unavailable through injury and Campbell-Gillard was beaten to a position by Storm premiership-winning prop Jordan McLean. \nJosh Mansour was the other Panthers player under consideration but Kangaroos coach Mal Meninga has only put him on standby for Darius Boyd, who has to pass a medical test on his injured hamstring on Thursday to play in the tournament. \nMansour is expected to make himself unavailable for selection for Lebanon if he misses out on Australian selection.

He has described the Las Vegas slaughter as an act of pure evil. That may be so, but it was also an act of utter banality. We have been here before. List Your Business Here \nAn angry American man shot dead innocents en masse and then turned a gun on himself. \nOnly the details differ. The shooter in this case is older than usual and the toll of dead and wounded higher. The video from the scene suggests that on this occasion the murderer might have used a fully automatic weapon rather than a semi. \nWe don't yet know if the guns were legally acquired, but what is staggering - to those outside the United States at least - is that they may well have been. \nTwo gun store owners have already come forward to say that they sold weapons to Stephen Paddock and that he passed all the appropriate background checks. \nPolice have now confirmed that when they broke into the hotel room from which Paddock fired into the crowd they found an arsenal of 19 weapons. \nGiven that Paddock was in Nevada, an old west state with historically liberal gun laws, if those weapons were shotguns, handguns and rifles, Paddock would have been able to purchase them without either permit or license. He also would have been able to legally acquire the high capacity magazines that have proved their utility in previous mass killings. \nIn Nevada, as in around 30 other US states, it is legal not only to own military-style semi-automatic rifles such as the AR-15 derivatives that have proven so enduringly so popular among mass killers, but also machine guns. \nConsidered \"Class III\" weapons, machine guns fall under the National Firearms Act, a relic of the days when FBI agents battled Al Capone's gangsters who were armed with automatic weapons. If Paddock wanted a Class III permit he would have had to undergo a background check and pay a fee. \nThen again, says Richard Feldman, a leading American gun law consultant and lobbyist, he might simply have had a semi-automatic converted, a process that only takes a couple of hours in a well equipped workshop. \nFeldman is a staunch Second Amendment man, even though he was fired years ago by the NRA for backing Bill Clinton's efforts to have handguns sold with trigger locks. \nLike everyone else I have spoken with in the US since this most recent shooting, Feldman does not believe gun laws will change significantly as a result of this latest atrocity. \nPro-gun legislation already making its way through Congress, such as moves to have silencers legalised, might stall for a time, Feldman says, but don't expect to see national bans or buybacks, regulation or restriction. \nIn a month, he says, the only people who will care about gun laws will be gun owners. People who don't own guns will have moved on to other issues. This is why the extremists keep winning this debate. The NRA can gather up five million people to vote and donate on a single issue. The vast majority who disagree with them have other things on their minds. \nThe response to this shooting is already playing out according to the established script. Politicians are offering thoughts and prayers, gun control advocates are making their case. The NRA is silent, the arms manufacturers are enjoying a rise in their stock prices and pro-gun social media is awash with \"false flag\" conspiracy theories. \nIf the piles of dead children in Sandy Hook didn't provoke change, this won't, says one angry old friend on the phone. \n\"All those people died for no goddamn reason, and nothing is going to come of it.\" \nIt is hard not to agree with him too. \nSince Sandy Hook there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings in America. At least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 have been wounded.

List Your Business Here \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and senior representatives from Shell, GLNG Operations and Australia Pacific LNG formally signed off on the deal on Tuesday in Canberra, following a joint warning from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Energy Market Operator of an expected gas shortfall of 54 petajoules in 2018 and 48 petajoules in 2019. \nTo avoid the forecast shortage in 2018, which would have put further upward pressure on already high gas prices, the federal government and the companies last week reached an in-principle agreement to supply additional gas to the market in 2018. \nA deal was struck to ensure the extra gas needed in 2019 would be supplied by the companies, on \"reasonable terms\". \n\"We hope that through the Heads of Agreement, indeed we can find a path forward to make sure that the domestic market is serviced and that indeed there is enough available gas for the market, which we stand behind and are committed to deliver,\" Mr Turnbull said. \nShell Australia's country chair Zoe Yujnovich praised the constructive dialogue with the government after \"some difficult and tense moments\". \nAustralia Pacific LNG chief executive Warwick King said the agreement today will resolve concerns. \n\"Looking ahead it is absolutely vital that Australia adopts a whole of market solution to resolve new gas supply, including reforms to improve the Australian domestic gas market and the responsible development of additional gas resources near to the demand centres of Sydney and Melbourne,\" Mr King added. \nIndustry welcomed the announcement, but remained cautious. \n\"There are two big questions from here,\" Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said. \n\"Will we make the most of this opportunity to secure the market for the longer term, including by reforming State gas moratoria? And will prices fall to export parity quickly? Contract prices offered to gas users appear to have fallen from the highs of early 2017, but remain well above historic levels. Energy users will be looking for further falls as more uncontracted gas is offered locally.\" \nLabor resources spokesman Jason Clare said the real test for Mr Turnbull was whether the deal with gas companies would halve the price of gas, from $20 to $10 gigajoule, as the Prime Minister had suggested was possible in April. \n\"Six months later he still hasn't delivered. Companies today are still being offered contracts of $15, $16, $17 or $18 a gigajoule,\" Mr Clare said. \nThe Energy Users Association of Australia agreed, with a spokeswoman telling Fairfax Media \"the big issue is at what price will they offer this gas\". \n\"The EUAA looks forward to playing a key and active role to support the ACCC's monitoring role of gas prices offered to our members. This will be the true measure of the effectiveness of the gas companies' commitments.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "james massola", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cole latimer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zoe yujnovich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "innes willox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason clare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "illawarra mercury gas", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "australian industry group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "euaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "energy users association of australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fairfax media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glng operations and australia pacific lng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shell australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia pacific lng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warwick king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian competition and consumer commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian energy market operator", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:27:49.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "989b8506ec6ab6ee854e5f5250dd8a1957c1fed8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xdxqueju7.e5kyhL2c6h9QsZgxTBtuNcUR5O_BGrkld2qgMcUaeF0b5RUo.hLPOR_ohpmBcCdFOHRlBr3XVyfLaRSgZayex_07qNTxHvHOaasPOxOerENkipbm6s_CMcAsw--", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Harper's long road back from horror blow | Illawarra Mercury", "title_full": "Harper's long road back from horror blow | Illawarra Mercury", "published": "2017-10-03T11:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.56, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "989b8506ec6ab6ee854e5f5250dd8a1957c1fed8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xdxqueju7.e5kyhL2c6h9QsZgxTBtuNcUR5O_BGrkld2qgMcUaeF0b5RUo.hLPOR_ohpmBcCdFOHRlBr3XVyfLaRSgZayex_07qNTxHvHOaasPOxOerENkipbm6s_CMcAsw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Daniel Cherny", "published": "2017-10-03T11:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Harper's long road back from horror blow | Illawarra Mercury", "text": "Harper's long road back from horror blow Daniel Cherny 3 Oct 2017, 7:05 p.m. Cricket was an irrelevance.

List Your Business Here \nThe wicketkeeper remembers very little about the day it occurred. A bit about the morning, but nothing after the incident. \nIt took the diminutive gloveman more than a week to take a look at what had happened. It was day two of a Sheffield Shield game at Adelaide Oval in February, and South Australian batsman Jake Lehmann looked to whip a ball through the leg side from spinner Jon Holland, inadvertently striking Harper's head with his bat. Harper was wearing a helmet, but was down for the count. \nIt was a moment that altered the next two months of the 20-year-old's life. He spent three weeks in an Adelaide hospital. One teammate who visited him in hospital described the scene as \"scary,\" with Harper - looking white - \"just lying in the bed with drips and tubes in him\". \nHarper's description of the experience is equally disturbing. \"I can remember not sleeping, getting woken up every half an hour in pain,\" he said. \n\"Pain shooting straight through your eyes, straight through the back of your head. Just could not even get close to feeling well in the back of the head. That translated down through your body, because you just lost all motion and sense through your body.\" \nSam's father Bryan - a teacher at Forrest Hill College - ventured to Adelaide to be with his son, having been told by the school's principal, the father of Sam's girlfriend, to take as much leave as he needed. \n\"There was a couple of weeks there where there was a nurse sitting there 24-7 right through the night sleeping,\" Sam said. \n\"For the initial two weeks, the pain in my head, the chances of going to sleep were impossible. Probably in that time, the actual game of cricket became pretty irrelevant. You just take for granted how you enjoy health every day.\" \nEventually Bryan encouraged his son to watch what had happened. \"That was a probably a big thing for dad. I'd been in hospital for a week or two, and things were starting to get a little bit more positive, and dad said 'probably a good thing if you actually watch the footage, watch it and see what happens, see what everyone's talking about.' \n\"It was actually a little bit confronting to watch at first but I was pretty happy to watch it and move on.\" \nBack in Melbourne, Harper turned his attention to recovery. He visited an Epworth clinic for eight weeks, practising mental and physical exercises. There were throwdowns with former Victorian coach Greg Shipperd, and trips to the park, painful at first as he readjusted to light. \n\"I knew that when I went outside I was going to feel crap, but the more I did it, the more I exposed my brain to it, the more I told myself, 'This is normal' then eventually became what I was used to again.\" \nHe always had faith that he would come good, having been told that by doctors. \"But it's one thing to hear it. But when you're experiencing not walking and talking properly, you can hear whatever you want, but unless you actually get back walking and talking .., 99.9 per cent of me believed that, but there's always that little 1 per cent that's going, what happens if this actually doesn't get any better?\" \nSam got back though. He's playing for Victoria in the JLT one-day series, and having missed last summer's Shield triumph is keen to get his hands on some silverware. \nHe can't speak highly enough of the support of both Cricket Victoria and the SACA. Last month he caught up with Lehmann, which in Harper's mind put an end to an unfortunate chapter . \nHe won't be changing his game either. \"I made sure before pre-season started I got in the machines and faced bouncers, I pretty much just eradicated that within the first couple of weeks,\" he said. \n\"To be honest, because it was such a freak accident, I wasn't really going to change the way I was going to bat, and it wasn't going to change the way I was going to keep.\" \nBut there are changes he is happy with - the introduction of concussion substitutes and the decision to allow replacement fielders to keep. It is especially pertinent given the controversy which followed Harper's injury, when the Redbacks denied Victoria's request for Harper to be replaced.

Power companies cut supply to people on life support Paula Conboy at the Mellbourne Economic Forum in Melbourne CBD today. Picture by Wayne Taylor 18th September 2017. List Your Business Here \nPower companies that cut electricity to people on life support, in breach of supply rules, have been handed fines of $20,000 for each incident. \nThe Australian Energy Regulator (AER) on Tuesday slapped Energex and TasNetworks with fines after they breached the National Energy Retail Rules, and potentially put lives at risk. \nTasNetworks was fined $60,000 and Energex $40,000, after they both failed to give a minimum of four days notice to people registered as having life support equipment in their homes. \nThis is not the first time incidents such as these have occurred. Ausgrid alone has received more than $100,000 in fines for six breaches of its life support protection obligations over the last 12 months. \nEndeavour Energy, Ergon Energy, and ActewAGL have also been fined within the last year for the same offence. \nResidential and small business energy users' representative group Energy Consumers Australia welcomed the announcement and backed the penalty. \n\"The AER's action today sends a strong signal to the sector about the need to ensure they have systems in place to support customers who rely on life support equipment,\" an ECA spokesman said. \nEnergex cut power twice to Queensland customers, while TasNetworks cut power to three Tasmanian customers requiring life support; each company received a $20,000 fine per infringement. \nThe first incident saw TasNetworks cut the power to a customer on life support on December, 2016 for around 45 minutes. The second incident occurred in February this year with the cut lasting nearly five hours. The most recent incident happened in April, with power lost for approximately 31 minutes. \n\"These events are regrettable and TasNetworks is working on ensuing these types of incidents are minimised,\" a TasNetworks spokesman said. \n\"In all cases four days' notice is required for a planned outage and, with respect to the three breaches, TasNetworks failed to provide the required notice period. \nEnergex's incidents occurred in September and October last year but outage times were not provided for either event. \nAn AER spokesman confirmed that no one died as a result of the power outages. \nThe AER stated that the life support customers had no effective prior warning of the planned interruption to their electricity. \n\"Protecting customers requiring life support equipment is an ongoing priority for the AER,\" AER chairman Paula Conboy said. \n\"It is imperative that these customers receive advanced notice of any planned interruption to their energy supply, so they can make alternative plans. This reduces any risk of harm occurring or more serious consequences for those customers.\" \nIt is understood that if the companies failed to pay the fines then the AER could bring court proceedings for the imposition of a penalty along with other orders to address any breaches.

List Your Business Here \nThe insurer on Tuesday said it was lifting its allowance for large disaster claims for the year to $US1.75 billion ($2.24 billion) , which will take a $US600 million ($767.42 million) bite out of its pre-tax earnings. \nIt is now tipped to make a second half loss, dragging full-year profits to a fraction of last year's figure, after the run of disasters exceeded its budget for such events. \nCompounding a recent run of disappointments, analysts predicted QBE may also halt its share buyback, and there could be another profit downgrade on the agenda next year when Pat Regan takes over as chief executive. \nAlthough the whole US insurance market has been exposed to recent hurricanes, the downgrade may come as a further blow to investor confidence in QBE - already battered in recent months after a damaging downgrade to its emerging markets business and soft profit guidance in August. \n\"They've got issues with emerging markets, and now they've got this as well,\" Bell Potter analyst TS Lim said. \"It's going to be tough for them to get out of the dog house.\" \nShaw Stockbroking analyst David Spotswood slashed his estimates for this year's profit to $US115 million, which is more than 80 per cent below the $US844 million QBE posted last year. He said QBE's update also implied conditions in the insurer's core business had worsened, and he downgraded earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019. \n\"They are going into losses in the second half,\" said Mr Spotswood, who has a \"sell\" rating on the stock. \n\"The issue will be is it a one-off for the P&L [profit and loss] and the balance sheet for this year.\" \nQBE makes about a third of its revenue in the US, and the downgrade is expected to deal a hefty blow to the profitability of underwriting across the group. \nIts combined operating ratio - losses as a share of premium revenue - would blow out to 100 to 102 per cent, indicating no or negative profits from underwriting, it said. \nQBE shares fell 3.5 per cent, to $9.82. \nUnveiling the downgrade on Tuesday, QBE said it expected 2016 to be \"the costliest year in the history of the global insurance industry,\" due mainly to disastrous hurricanes in North America. \n\"Cyclone Debbie in Australia earlier this year, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria which impacted the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean and Florida as well as the earthquakes in Mexico have all impacted QBE's businesses,\" QBE said. \nRegal Funds Management portfolio manager Omkar Joshi said that although the hit was a one-off, it was unlikely to be the end of the bad news for QBE, as Mr Regan would probably downgrade expectations after starting as CEO next year. \n\"There is probably going to need to be a re-base of FY18 expectations at some stage,\" Mr Joshi said. \nHe predicted QBE would not complete its entire $1 billion share buyback it announced in February, but may still pay a dividend for the full-year because of the one-off nature of the earnings hit. \n\"After today's announcement, capital starts to become more of an issue again,\" Mr Joshi said. \nQBE chief executive John Neal, who last month announced he would leave the insurer , said catastrophes in the past month had caused \"tragic loss of life and substantial and widespread property and infrastructure damage\". \n\"Our thoughts are with those affected by these devastating events including our customers, business partners and employees,\" Mr Neal said. \nWhile the hit to profits is substantial, there is also an expectation that insurance premiums could rise after the disasters, after they were depressed in recent years by low claim numbers and ultra low global interest rates. \n\"While it is too early to speculate how much reinsurance and primary insurance pricing will rise as a result of recent catastrophe experience, QBE is well placed to benefit from price rises with much of our reinsurance programs already purchased for 2018.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

time on Thursday, retired accountant Stephen Paddock checked into room 32135 of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. \nHis arrival would not have surprised anybody. \nA high-stakes gambler and regular concert-goer, who recently boasted of a $US250,000 poker windfall, Paddock booked a double-room suite overlooking the main stage for the Route 91 Harvest festival, a three-day country music festival starting on Friday. \nOver the next four days, police said, he wheeled more than 10 suitcases into the room carrying 22 guns, including two on tripods and two converted into fully automatic machine guns. In his car, parked with the hotel valet, he had several kilograms of ammonium nitrate, a fertiliser used to make explosives. \nAbout an hour away at his home in Mesquite, where he lived with his Australian-Filipino girlfriend Marilou Danley in an over-55s cul-de-sac community, he had a further 19 guns, several thousand rounds of ammunition and another explosive, tenorite. \nAll were legally obtained, many from two Nevada gun dealers that performed background checks. \nAt about 10.08pm and for reasons that remain unclear to authorities, his family and perhaps even Danley, he used a hammer to smash open two windows at either end of his suite and methodically began to fire at the crowd on the famous Las Vegas Boulevard 450 metres away. \nSome of the 22,000-strong crowd thought it was firecrackers or sound issues but singer Jason Aldean, onto his last song in a 30-minute set, stopped playing and ran from the stage. Screaming rang out and people ducked for cover or ran towards the festival's major entry, directly in the line of fire. \nFor 15 excruciating minutes more than 10,000 bullets peppered the crowd from above, killing 59 and injuring 527. There were small breaks, presumably when Paddock was reloading, then more. \n\"I saw people plugging bullet holes with their fingers,\" concert-goer Russell Bleck said, adding that crowds trying to escape were trapped by festival fencing. \n\"People would run one way and then you'd hit a dead end. It was just a kill box. No one could run and scatter. I saw bodies everywhere.\" \nSeventy-two minutes after the first shot was fired, hotel security guards - who narrowed the threat after guests between levels 29 to 32 reported glass smashing - accompanied a SWAT team who burst through the door. It's believed Paddock turned the gun on himself at that moment. \nAs the famously neon-lit strip fell ghostly quiet on Tuesday, the White House refused to talk about gun policy in a country that has suffered its worst two shootings in less than two years. \n\"Our unity cannot be shattered by evil, our bonds cannot be broken by violence and though we feel such great anger at the senseless murder of our fellow citizens, it is our love that defines us today and always will forever,\" US President Donald Trump said. \nMore than 24 hours after the shooting, authorities still had no indication of a motive. Paddock was a high-stakes gambler well-known in the casinos of Nevada who was twice divorced, held a pilot's licence, owned multiple properties, had no criminal record except for a minor traffic citation and hadn't worked full time in 30 years. \nIn recent weeks, he made several mandatory reports of casino winnings over $US10,000 and authorities are looking into whether he had made large losses too, McClatchy reported. \nFilipino-born Danley, 62, was a keen gambler too, listing her former job as a high-stakes casino hostess at Reno's Atlantis Casino. On Facebook, she said she \"lived life to the fullest\" and she posted photos from Vegas gambling tournaments, including a stay at Mandalay Bay in 2014. \nShe was in Tokyo at the time of the shooting and will be interviewed on her return, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said. He stressed that they believe Paddock acted alone. \n\"We have no idea what his belief system was. I can't get into the mind of a psychopath,\" he said. \nMs Danley lived in Queensland until about 2003 when she moved to Nevada with her husband of 22 years, Geary Danley, with whom she has a daughter and granddaughter. They divorced in 2013. \nAnother of Mr Danley's daughters, Diedre Pierson, said they had never heard of their stepmother's new partner. \n\"She is kind, she is gentle, she's just extremely nice ... never would we ever in our lives think that she would in any way be affiliated with this ever,\" she said. \nWhile she was known around Mesquite as a friendly woman who liked Zumba classes, her boyfriend was remarkable only for his extreme tendency to keep to himself. \n\"He was weird,\" former neighbour Diane McKay told the New York Times . \"It was like living next to nothing ... You can at least be grumpy, something. He was just nothing.\" \nIn Florida, his brother, Eric, said the news was like \"an asteroid falling out of the sky\". \nHe said his brother was not religious, political or even opinionated and, as far as he knew, owned a couple of handguns that he'd never touched. He liked Taco Bell, country music, cruises and playing $100 hands on video poker. \n\"He is a guy who lives in a house in Mesquite, who drove down and gambled in Las Vegas. He did stuff, ate burritos,\" he said. \"He doesn't even have parking tickets ... If he had killed my kids I couldn't be more dumbfounded. I mean, it doesn't ... There's nothing.\" \nTheir father, Benjamin Paddock, was a convicted bank robber who was on the FBI's Most Wanted list in 1969 and described as a suicidal psychopath. However, Eric Paddock said the brothers never met him. \nHeartbreaking stories emerged on Tuesday of the carnage and confusion. Among the victims was 29-year-old Tennessee nurse Sonny Melton, who was shot in the back as he tried to shield his wife, Heather. \nA festival bartender, Heather Gooze, said she held the hand of a stranger later identified as Canadian Jordan McIldoon, 23, as he died on a piece of security fence used as a stretcher. His girlfriend was in lock-down in the Tropicana Hotel and his mother called his phone during the mayhem. \n\"She told me his childhood nickname is Blimpy because he was a blimp when he was little, that he's covered in tattoos, that he loves life and he loves his girlfriend,\" Ms Gooze told Canadian radio . \nRetired soldier Tony Burditus, who had just bought a van to travel around America with his wife Denise, held his partner of 32 years in his arms just two hours after she'd posted a photo of them smiling happily in front of the Route 91 main stage. \nSeveral Australians were caught up in the incident but three major hospitals were not aware of any Australian victims on Tuesday. \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the shooting was a reminder there was no place for \"set and forget\" in national security.

Trailer: The Deuce \nBased around Times Square in New York, The Deuce explores pioneering moments in the sex industry. \nThe Deuce is patient. Halfway through an eight-episode first season about the legalisation and growth of pornography in 1970s America, there are only hints of the industry that will soon signal vast economic and social change. What's apparent is a succession of vivid characters, distinctive but never merely sharp outlines, whose conversations and actions slowly but steadily reveal their inner lives. HBO's new drama is grounded by terrific, immersive writing. SHARE Standout: Maggie Gyllenhaal plays a sex worker and aspiring filmmaker in The Deuce. Photo: Supplied \nThat's to be expected when the creators are David Simon, who put together television's finest series, The Wire , and George Pelecanos, the crime novelist who became part of the same show's writing staff. The Wire used the Baltimore drug trade and its policing to diagnose American society's ills; here the cogs in the machine are sex workers, their pimps, and those who work the adjacent infrastructure that's part of life around a decidedly bleak Times Square. \n\"One ticket, one ride,\" a prostitute named Candy (Maggie Gyllenhaal) tells an overexcited client who thinks he didn't get value for money. As in The Wire, economic realities dictate the power structure that everyone has to work under. The difference is that The Deuce , which has a balance of women behind the camera and in the writers' room, is particularly attuned to its female characters. The street walkers compare notes, share opinions, and reveal themselves in ways that aren't simply defined by their professions. Advertisement \n\"Y'all need to keep your lady business to yourself,\" complains one pimp, when discussion at a communal breakfast joint after a night's work turns to dealing with their periods, and The Deuce is frank about these women's bodies \u2013 and how they're used as means of production and earning \u2013 in unexpected and often telling ways.   \nGiven the problems HBO has had with sexual violence in its flagship series Game of Thrones , a show about the sex trade could have been a disaster. There is a lot of sex here, sometimes as a sidenote barely in frame because the characters are inured to seeing it, but the prevailing aesthetic is neither glamorous nor prurient \u2013 the bodies that are often focused on are those of the clients, turning you back to the clash of motives that underpins these narratives.

A council in Melbourne's leafy east has done an about-face on its controversial decision to slap an eleventh-hour heritage overlay on a $10 million property up for sale. Aa On Monday evening, Stonnington councillors unanimously voted against pursuing interim and permanent heritage protection orders for the sprawling residence at 9 Haverbrack Avenue in Malvern, paving the way for a future demolition. It comes six weeks after the council attracted heavy criticism for issuing a last-ditch heritage protection just 48 hours before the property was due to go to auction. It subsequently passed in without a single bid. Industry sources estimated a heritage order could have wiped up to $2 million off the value of the property, set on a 1485-square-metre block in one of the city's most prestigious pockets. The draft heritage citation, issued in late August, caught the property's owners by surprise because they had not been informed their house was being assessed by heritage consultants. The owners, a couple who had lived and raised four daughters in the home over a 25 year period, attended the council meeting on Monday evening. \"They are relieved and very appreciative of the fair hearing they got at the Stonnington meeting,\" said Rob Vickers-Willis , the Marshall White agent handling the property's sale. Related: Iconic site remains paddock after demolition The house ??? a 1930s single-storey building with brick walls and a low-slung roof ??? was first gazetted for heritage assessment sometime after June by Bryce Raworth, a heritage consultancy firm hired by the council. It remains unclear exactly why the property recently came up for heritage assessment. The firm concluded the building was architecturally significant as a \"substantially intact example of the Prairie School style influenced by the work of Walter Burley Griffin\". \"The house is one of a series of early designs by architect JFW Ballantyne, who is recognised for his important role in disseminating Griffin's ideas,\" the heritage consultants noted. In response, the home's owners sought independent heritage advice from another consultancy firm, Lovell Chen. Lovell Chen found the house was \"of some interest historically\" but it did not meet the requirements for a permanent heritage order, partly because it had been altered. \"Its minor role within the body of Griffin influenced work is reflected in the fact that the house has not previously been identified for a heritage control,\" Lovell Chen found. Following the council's decision, a selling campaign will resume in the coming days. The property is scheduled to be auctioned at 6pm on Thursday, November 2 with an estimated selling range between $9.1 million and $10 million. No planning permit would be needed for future demolition. Mr Vickers-Willis said it was a magnificent new home site for one or two dwellings. \"It's really regarded as one of the best positions in Melbourne,\" he said. \"There is a number of parties that have shown previous interest that have been waiting for the outcome and thus an auction has been rescheduled.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "allison worrall", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jfw ballantyne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lovell chen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryce raworth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vickers-willis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob vickers-willis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "griffin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marshall white", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stonnington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walter burley griffin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "council", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "melbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haverbrack avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stonnington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malvern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:26:55.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7098abf545cfed25dbe5003371813e781eb7ca79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xdyWTvqPamte.wAssey3WLzzk0nnSV0HXLwQWValZh3DD7xnz0AS6vQBJA7YD9YVbAr7Ii5FpSgoQrLewMLsY6GVoEIgQJdaQnoaTXoD8MV9.qusxiPhyOaz.Sg35zli_QjTQl63qwyCSUAuKY4hkULVKF8NORiI20GKnZwHPR27C_T2p3pYCOkBdHyjO0hTDLw--", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.queenslandcountrylife.com.au/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Queensland Country Life - News", "title": "We're 'a bit too comfortable' with world's most liveable city ranking", "title_full": "We're 'a bit too comfortable' with world's most liveable city ranking", "published": "2017-10-03T11:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7098abf545cfed25dbe5003371813e781eb7ca79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xdyWTvqPamte.wAssey3WLzzk0nnSV0HXLwQWValZh3DD7xnz0AS6vQBJA7YD9YVbAr7Ii5FpSgoQrLewMLsY6GVoEIgQJdaQnoaTXoD8MV9.qusxiPhyOaz.Sg35zli_QjTQl63qwyCSUAuKY4hkULVKF8NORiI20GKnZwHPR27C_T2p3pYCOkBdHyjO0hTDLw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mary O'Brien", "published": "2017-10-03T11:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "We're 'a bit too comfortable' with world's most liveable city ranking", "text": "We're 'a bit too comfortable' with world's most liveable city ranking Mary O'Brien Aa Melburnians are obsessed with holding onto our top spot as the most liveable city in the world, says a famous Dutch architect. Melburnians are obsessed with holding onto our top spot as the most liveable city in the world, says a famous Dutch architect. Aa \"Sometimes it feels like Melbourne is a bit too comfortable with its top ranking,\" says David Gianotten of international firm OMA. He says we need to concentrate more seriously on our planning and less on the city's ranking in The Economist survey, which Melbourne has topped for seven years in a row. \"There's some denial going on that the society is rapidly changing but the image of Melbourne can't change - but if its image doesn't change its ranking will also not stay.\" Speaking at the opening of MPavilion, Melbourne's pop-up summer events space, which Gianotten helped design, he urged planners to think about how people use and move through the city and how the digital world interacts with the city. He said he hoped MPavilion would encourage debate about planning, architecture and issues such as transforming the city for older people and for children. \"We intend this pavilion will be a tool for you to discuss the future of your city,\" said the 2000 Pritzker Prize winner Rem Koolhaas, the founder of OMA (Office for Metropolitan Architecture), who was back in Australia for the first time in 40 years. This year's MPavilion in the Queen Victoria Gardens, opposite the Arts Centre, is the fourth summer pavilion, which will host a free four-month program of talks and events. It was officially opened on Monday by MPavilion founder Naomi Milgrom, Melbourne lord mayor Robert Doyle and MPavilion architects Gianotten and Koolhaas. \"Rem and David's profound vision and insight has resulted in an extraordinary pavilion for Melbourne,\" Milgrom said. Gianotten said it was difficult for architects and city planners to reach a broader audience, but the transformation and development of the city was an issue that affected everybody. Talking about Melbourne, he said he particularly liked the city's laneways, which made it interesting and unique. The Dutch architectural firm is working on buildings in Melbourne, Sydney and on the New Museum for WA. The temporary MPavilion structure is the firm's first completed project in Australia. The structure was inspired by amphitheatres, has two tiered grandstands and a floating roof. Last year 90,000 people visited the pavilion and this year it's expected more than 100,000 visitors will come.

Factories and company headquarters on one side (plenty of the big players, including Toyota, have a presence here), and apartments on the other. It looks unappealing on a map - appearing stuck between Ferntree Gully Road, the Monash Freeway and aforementioned Blackburn Road. It's surrounded by Monash University. /**/ But take a left-hand turn down Samada Street and you're far from the madding crowd. Suddenly you're in simple, satisfying suburbia. One comprised of mostly one storey, blonde brick flat homes from the 1950s. The roads, the few that there are, trick you into courts and dead ends. There's not a shopping centre to speak of in this little urban oasis. People head out to nearby Pinewood in Mount Waverley, or Brandon Park in Wheelers Hill. There's not much to speak of at all, really, until you spot the old-school row of connected shops next to the Notting Hill Neighbourhood House. Could this be the Notting Hill we're looking for? Is this where we'll find the bookshop where goofy bookstore owner William Thacker (Hugh Grant) meets actress Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) and love happens? Hmm. No bookshop here, yet. Many are familiar with Notting Hill, London (and the 1999 movie) but this is Notting Hill, Melbourne, 19km south east of the CBD. Yes, down Samada Street, then right at Westerfield Drive, and, in a little shopping strip without a bookshop, is Inchmeal. \"Gorgeous new cafe in an unexpected area,\" reads one review. The row was built in the 1950s to house a milk bar, butcher, small supermarket, green grocer, hairdresser and chemist. All that remains is a sunburnt milk bar, and, in the former chemist, Inchmeal.

The upshot being you'd freeze on it in winter and it would stick to your sweaty legs in summer. While, thankfully, vinyl is no longer an option when it comes to selecting upholstery, other options are greater than ever, with a plethora of colours and textures available from a multitude of companies. Before you even start thinking about who is going to be making your upholstery, the first choice comes down to whether you'll be using fabric or leather? Both materials have their pros and cons and their lovers and haters. \"I definitely like fabric, it's softer than leather and warmer,\" says Greg Natale, of Greg Natale Design . \"It also offers a lot more in the way of texture.\" Natale sticks with a neutral or plain fabric for his sofas and makes it pop with cushions and rugs. \"I tend to opt for black; it goes with everything. I also use a lot of velvet. It adds luxe and it's soft and quite sexy. At home, I have a white velvet sofa, while the office sofa is charcoal-grey velvet.\" Interior designer Meryl Hare, of Hare and Klein, agrees with Natale and says she tends to choose fabric because it works well with Australia's climate. Hare's go-to fabric is natural linen. \"Linen is a beautiful fabric for a sofa; it provides a lot of texture,\" she says. \"In saying that, I still use leather where it is appropriate, such as a study, or den ... and I always use natural leather colours such as tan.

A man's home is supposed to be his castle, but rising house prices are pushing the dream of even having a simple house with four walls and a roof out of reach for many. Aa With Sydney's median house price now at about $1.18 million and Melbourne's median at about $866,000, according to Domain Group's latest house price report , it may be cheaper for you to just buy an actual castle instead. While $1 million might not get you very far in Australia's biggest cities, if you leave our shores behind you could actually buy something fit for a king. Admittedly, with such a budget you're going to be starting out with an entry-level castle, probably in a need of a lot of work, but it still beats forking out $1.6 million for a small derelict terrace with collapsed ceilings and floors. Here are eight properties you can buy right now. 1. A castle on a Scottish island. Price: From $640,000 Photo: Savills Built in 1750 for the chief of a Scottish clan, this epic Georgian castle will have you feeling like the king of the Isle of Coll off the west coast of Scotland. Breachacha Castle offers stunning views of the small island's white sandy beaches and beautiful turquoise waters and if you're lucky you may even see some of the basking sharks, whales and dolphins that are known to pass by. Related: England's tiniest castle for sale Apart from the stunning natural scenery on offer, the castle has six bedrooms, three of which have ensuites, two bathrooms, a sitting room and kitchen. The side wings and pavilions are currently derelict shells, one of which is used as a workshop and store. So if you've got the cash to splash, there's room to expand. 2. A 19th century chateau in France. Price: From $950,000 Photo: Moulin OK, so this isn't quite a traditional castle, but it looks like one. And if mountain scenery is your thing, this eight-bedroom abode in a spa town in the south of France could be more your style. The estate has almost 2000 square metres of private gardens and offers 360-degree views of the neighbouring countryside. There is also plenty of living space thanks to the eight bedrooms, five bathrooms, a library, dining room and a lounge with an open fireplace to curl up by in winter time. 3. A medieval style home in France. Price: $740,000 Photo: Moulin For something a little less maintenance you could head to the north of France where you'll find this recently renovated 19th century home . While it's not technically a castle, this five-bedroom, five-bathroom medieval style home - complete with towers - will still have you feeling like you've stepped back in time. After entering through the grand lobby with marble floors you'll find the manor is filled with beautiful woodwork from the 18th century, stained glass and stone, wooden and marble flooring. The home - which offers 300 square metres of living space at the heart of a small town centre - also has a billiard room, office, dining room, basement and attic. 4. An apartment in a renovated castle in Germany. Price: From $140,000 Photo: Immobilien Moving across to Germany, a budget of $1 million will be more than enough to buy into a renovated baroque castle about a one-hour commute from Berlin. Three two-bedroom apartments, ranging from 92 to 133 square metres, are currently for sale in this castle located in a national park. Priced from about $140,000 you could buy all three and still have cash to spare. Apart from having access to the 100-hectare castle park, you'll also be able to use the large festival hall, communal castle kitchen, fireplace room, the sauna room with a jacuzzi and relaxation room. 5. The Herrenhaus in Germany. Price: From $740,000 Photo: Immobilien If you don't like the idea of sharing your castle, there is also this striking 27-room property up for grabs further south in Germany. The manor offers about 830 square metres of living spaces and sits alongside a former summer house, in a 16,000-square-metre park. Unfortunately though, having been built in 1906, the home is in need of a little tender loving care. While initial reconstruction work has already been carried out, and the home has been reconnected to gas, power and water, there's still a long way to go. Still, if you (and your bank account) are up for the challenge, it has a lot of potential. 6. A double castle in Germany. Price: From $530,000 Photo: Immobilien Another fixer-upper, this historic Burganlage is the real deal with everything from a moat and former defensive walls, to a gatehouse and horse boxes. As cool as it is, it's currently uninhabitable. Parts of the home date back to 13th century, and in are need of some serious work. If you've got the cash to splash on it, you'll nab about 650 square metres of living space and set on 2440-square-metre grounds. 7. A 16th century castle in Scotland. Price: $210,000 Photo: Savills Sure it might not have a roof or be in a liveable condition, but Knockhall Castle makes up for it with a beautiful site and interesting history. Believed to have been built for a lord in 1565, the castle once hosted James VI, was overtaken by an Earl and later badly damaged in a fire. The current owner's family has held it for hundreds of years. The castle is located in the picturesque coastal village of Newburgh, which is about a half hour drive from the city of Aberdeen. The owner has recently stabilised the site, which is being advertised as blank canvas with the potential to become a spectacular family home or business. 8. A chateau in Italy. Price: From $674,000. Photo: Moulin This yet to be finished chateau has a restored tower from the 17th century at its centre. The home has the potential for five bedrooms and five bathrooms and sits on 3000 square metres of countryside in the Italian region of Le Marche. The top of the tower would be the perfect spot to relax and take in the views of the surrounding valley and hills, after a day of renovating.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "earl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james vi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coll", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "savills built", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knockhall castle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "savills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "domain group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "le marche", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burganlage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:27:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "040ba28300b17d4c918c14a271e1bb41a2ccbb2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xdyWTvqPamte.wAssey3WLzzk0nnSV0HXLwQWValZh3DDETSQkNbaa._3OCocQnQQwaJrqzi37Zu2AhIv1u4f_Q8SsbaenlvZUD2wUqdl24cRi8UJfsDFKxLoQg4TLomst0ilTMT_2eSABONljAr8G4M-", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.queenslandcountrylife.com.au/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Queensland Country Life - News", "title": "When can Australians afford to grow up?", "title_full": "When can Australians afford to grow up?", "published": "2017-10-03T07:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/1c6705c3-728d-48eb-94b2-9a54f47ce0cc.jpg/r0_342_729_754_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "040ba28300b17d4c918c14a271e1bb41a2ccbb2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xdyWTvqPamte.wAssey3WLzzk0nnSV0HXLwQWValZh3DDETSQkNbaa._3OCocQnQQwaJrqzi37Zu2AhIv1u4f_Q8SsbaenlvZUD2wUqdl24cRi8UJfsDFKxLoQg4TLomst0ilTMT_2eSABONljAr8G4M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Andrew P.

You've read dozens of pieces about how today's self-centred young folks are squandering their savings on travel and mobile phones and cafe brunches before being insufferably entitled and not using the post or destroying bricks and mortar retail, or whatever is the latest bugbear of a middle-aged columnist annoyed at someone young having the temerity to complain about housing affordability. And while all the research suggests the Millennials are no worse than any other similarly demonised previous generation (and lest one think bitching about The Kids is a new phenomenon, note that one writer chastised young people for their \"???bad manners, contempt for authority, disrespect to elders, and a love for chatter in place of exercise\", circa 300 BC ) there's one little wrinkle in the current housing market which suggests that in the particular case of young people not growing up, the relationship between cause and effect might be true - but reversed. More specifically: how the hell is a young person meant to learn to be an independent adult when it's economically impossible for them to actually be an independent adult in 2017? The unaffordability of housing - to buy and to rent - is delaying people being able to strike out on their own. And that's a problem because nothing makes one grow the hell up like being responsible for one's own laundry, electricity, and toilet paper. For me, I think the moment I truly turned from child to man was when I first used my own hard-earned money to buy socks. It was a revelatory moment in which I realised that I would be earning a living in order to spend it almost entirely on stuff which wasn't remotely fun, thereby firing up a resentment which simmers to this very day. Not only are people staying in the family home for longer, those that have moved out are moving back in with their parents at a greater rate - particularly if they are seeking to save a deposit, since paying simultaneous rent makes that impossible for any but the best paid or most relentlessly thrifty. Take Sydney as the most expensive example. The average weekly salary in the state is $1177.70.

SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Founder of Stockspot, Chris Brycki, says despite improvements, the banks and AMP could do more to migrate their customers to their lower- fee super funds Photo: Christopher Pearce \nA candidate fat cat fund is one that underperforms it peers over the past one, three and five years to June 30, 2017. \nTo qualify as a fat cat, it has to also underperform its peers by more than 10 percentage points over five years. \nChris Brycki, Stockspot founder and author of the report, says there are 521 fat cat super and managed funds, and two thirds are managed by the big banks and AMP. \nThat's down from last year, when the big banks and AMP accounted for three-quarters of the fat cat funds, he says. Advertisement \nAs well at the fat cat funds, Stockspot identifies the \"fit cat\" funds - those that perform more than 10 percentage points better than peers over five years. \nThe big banks and AMP, the \"retail\" funds, do have a number of super funds and managed funds that feature in the ranks of the fit cat funds.

Chris Brycki, Stockspot founder \nThere is also a question mark over the the accuracy of some industry fund's reporting of their costs and fees, which do better in the report than retail funds. \n\"It appears many industry super funds don't fully disclose all costs and fees,\" Brycki says. \nHe says when the super fund reporting standards change in 2018 he suspects some industry funds with low advertised fees will report significantly higher fees. Spaceship slashes fees \nIn a separate move, Spaceship, the tech-stock heavy super funds targeting the \"internet generation\" has slashed its fees following criticism. \nSpaceship is not included in the Stockspot report as its track record is much less than the required five years. \nBrycki has recently criticised the fund for its flashy marketing and celebrity endorsers which, he says, distracts people from the underlying financial product being sold and its high fees. \nSpaceship was charging 1.6 per cent a year for its flagship GrowthX option. It has now cut that to 0.99 per cent. \nThe option has been rebalanced to include a 50 per cent allocation to technology investments, up from 30 per cent. \nSpaceship has also launched an index fund, called the Spaceship Global Index Fund, with an annual fee of 0.65 per cent. \nIndex investing is cheaper than using active managers who charge higher fees with the promise to outperform the market market in which they invest over time. \nSpaceship has also formed an advisory board made up of Sarah Goodman, previously with the Australian Prudential and Regulatory Authority, Paul Dortkamp, an independent director of Ellerston Global Capital and Jodie Baker, the managing partner at management consultants Blackhall & Pearl. \nPaul Bennetts, Spaceship chief executive and founder, says: \"The formation of this board underlines our commitment to best-in-class governance and risk management, and to making sure our members benefit from the wisdom of some of the most experienced names in the industry.\" More Articles", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sarah goodman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brycki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris brycki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher pearce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stockspot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jodie baker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul dortkamp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul bennetts", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ellerston global capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fairfax media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "regulatory authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blackhall & pearl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prudential", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nab", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "stockspot", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:30:02.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f38a8f20f0eb0b1e5f57c362a598f23b98463dcc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd6So0QrRW.upx8c5yJAXpT7mb5fBez_.Wr_JqQj5QLhf_kgdh6UdWpwL1E3a_e7xXb18jLGPqwUHtasqOyZwovKk6rx8qIlv0fkDjuzZBqXeLZoVsCQCnHg6FM6NlNOH15dNoyPzWFIvIsc9c3RTqyrhVdjqKHoU4w--", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "http://feeds.smh.com.au/rssheadlines/top.xml#", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sydney Morning Herald RSS News Headlines", "title": "Miners leave themselves open to corruption, report finds", "title_full": "Miners leave themselves open to corruption, report finds", "published": "2017-10-04T03:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/s/k/z/f/8/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gythoa.png/1507029342074.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 915, "comments": 0, "shares": 915}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f38a8f20f0eb0b1e5f57c362a598f23b98463dcc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd6So0QrRW.upx8c5yJAXpT7mb5fBez_.Wr_JqQj5QLhf_kgdh6UdWpwL1E3a_e7xXb18jLGPqwUHtasqOyZwovKk6rx8qIlv0fkDjuzZBqXeLZoVsCQCnHg6FM6NlNOH15dNoyPzWFIvIsc9c3RTqyrhVdjqKHoU4w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adele Ferguson", "published": "2017-10-04T03:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Miners leave themselves open to corruption, report finds", "text": "twitter TWEET More \nUS President Donald Trump described it as \"draining the swamp\", a political promise he made to rid business and politics of deep-seated bribery and corruption. \nIt could equally be applied to Australia, which has had its fair share of scandals and political capture in the past few years. SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Western Australia and Queensland have been flagged as having key weaknesses in the mining approval and infrastructure project process, which is making them susceptible to corruption. Photo: Brendon Thorne \nBut understanding where the risks lie can be a useful first step in tackling the problem. \nFollowing a string of mining scandals, Australia's biggest mining states Western Australia and Queensland \u2013 which together mine more than $100 billion of minerals a year - have been flagged as having key weaknesses in the mining approval and infrastructure project process, which is making them susceptible to corruption. \nA report compiled by Transparency International Australia (TIA), Corruption Risks: Mining Approvals in Australia, to be released on Wednesday, shines a light on the process of awarding mining projects \u2013 from exploration licences, mining leases to the approvals regime \u2013 that identifies the vulnerabilities and ascribes a score to the relative risks. \nThe project included interviewing 47 experts from government, industry, academia and consultancies, reviewing the various acts and regulations and studying court cases and relevant published research. Advertisement \nThe report identified a number of \"high risk\" areas, including light touch due diligence into the applicant and its principals and inadequate research into the beneficial ownership of the applying company. \nThe risk of corruption is compounded by the fact that companies aren't required to declare their track record and compliance and environmental record with jurisdictions outside Australia. It means companies with environmental breaches in countries outside of Australia can operate large mining projects in Australia. And they do. \"This can be of significant concern when large mining projects are operating in areas where there are risks of impacts to ecology, biodiversity or water resource,\" it warns.

Political donations \nIt highlighted Indian mining giant Adani, citing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Carmichael coalmine, where Adani stated it \"has not been subject to any proceedings under a commonwealth, state or territory law for the protection of the environment or the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources\". \nTransparency International Australia says in the report there was evidence that Adani failed to comply with laws and environmental permits in India. \"An investigation in December 2010 by officials from the Indian Ministry of Environment Protection and Forests into the Mundra Port and Special Economic Zone (Mundra SEZ) operated by Adani Ports found destruction of mangroves, creek systems and natural seawater flow by reclamation, and development of a township, airport and hospital without the proper environmental approvals.\" \nWith such blatant gaps in the system, it makes it easier for industry influence and political capture by mining companies. Not surprising, the way approvals are granted for large mining infrastructure projects in WA and Queensland scored \"high\" in terms of a vulnerability to political capture. \nThe report also highlights the impact of political donations, including the paucity of regulation, the role of lobbyists and the revolving door of staff between government and industry. This all leaves projects susceptible to corruption. \nThe 'revolving doors' and 'culture of mateship' could enable inappropriate influence to occur in the approval of State Agreements in Western Australia, and Coordinated Projects in Queensland. Serena Lillywhite \nTo put it into perspective, in the past decade mining companies have made disclosed donations of $16.6 million to major political parties. But the real figures would be much higher given the \"systemic loopholes\" and opaqueness of the political donation system. \nAccording to the report, of 538 lobbyists registered by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, 191 were former government representatives. \n\"The 'revolving doors' and 'culture of mateship' could enable inappropriate influence to occur in the approval of state agreements in Western Australia, and co-ordinated projects in Queensland,\" TIA's chief executive Serena Lillywhite said. \nFormer senior ministers from both parties have ended up heading peak lobby groups for the resources industry. \nThe report also raises the issue of transparency and accountability in large mining infrastructure project approvals and the amount of power granted to politicians. \n\"The research revealed that ministers or senior government representatives have considerable discretionary powers to make approvals and recommendations. This raises considerable concern as, when there is also a risk of industry influence, and opportunities for companies and their directors with a poor business record to operate in each state, the risk of corruption is significantly increased,\" the report says. \nPutting the spotlight on the various cracks in the system of awarding mining licences and projects will hopefully move the country a step closer to draining some of the swamp.

Photo: Rob Carew \nA heatwave last month smashed many records across eastern Australia with more than half the NSW stations with more than 20 years of data registering their hottest September day, the Bureau of Meteorology said. \nUnder a high carbon emissions scenario, 50-degree days could arrive \"as early as the 2040s\", Dr Lewis said, adding that even with a concerted reduction in pollution, those temperatures could be reached by about 2060. SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Temperatures in the shade can be hot, but those in the sun, such as Bondi Beach in November 2015, weren't far off 60 degrees, according to heat cameras. Photo: Nick Moir \nDr King said hospitals, electricity systems and infrastructure would all struggle during such heat spikes. \n\"For summer heat extremes in the future, there probably aren't any winners,\" Dr King said. Reefs at risk \nAlong with other Australian regions which could see 50-degree days, the researchers also examined the temperature increases in the Coral Sea. \nEven with less variability than land, oceans are also seeing significant warming. For temperature-sensitive coral reefs, the past few years of ocean heatwaves has triggered mass bleaching including on the Great Barrier Reef. \nThe researchers estimated autumn extremes of 0.3-0.8 degrees above the devastating 2016 record in the Coral Sea with the lower target of the Paris accord. At the 2 degrees warming goal, the Coral Sea will warm 0.6-1.2 degrees above the 2016 extreme. \nDr Lewis said the recent bleaching had \"really smashed the reef\", killing as much as half the Great Barrier Reef corals. \n\"If that's occurring now and we have additional warming on top of that - which will lead to an increase in seasonal temperatures - then that's a real worry for whether we'll have a reef at all, she said. 'Startling speed' \nDr King was also a co-author of a separate paper out recently in Environmental Research Letters that examined the impact on Europe if global temperatures reached that 2-degree upper limit agreed at Paris. \nThe paper found a heatwave of the scale of 2003 which killed 70,000 Europeans rapidly becomes more likely as the planet warms. \n\"What is startling is the speed of the change,\" Dr King said. \"At 2 degrees, events like the 2003 heatwave could become so commonplace that they occur every second year.\" \nWhile trends in regional seasonal rainfall levels are less clear, a warming world is likely to make single-day extreme rainfall events more likely. In Britain's case, a repeat of the July 2007 severe flooding would be 70 per cent more likely at 2-degrees warming compared with current conditions, he said. Heatwaves by degrees \nIn a third recent paper by Australian-based researchers, published last week in Scientific Reports , Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick found the number of additional heatwave days will rise significantly depending on whether global warming is contained to 1.5 or 2 degrees, or beyond. \nThe research indicated heatwave days \u2013 based on a sequence of at least three consecutive days in the warmest 10 per cent for that date \u2013 will jump by an extra 14.8-28.2 per year for each degree of warming. \nThe heatwaves themselves will be 3.4-17.5 days longer per degree of global warming, with peak intensity of 1.2 to 1.9 degrees. \nIn the worst affected regions, such as parts of the tropics, summers will become a season-long heatwave, with large impacts on human health, productivity and ecosystems \u2013 even if warming can be kept to a global average of 2 degrees. 'Really awful' \nDr Perkins-Kirkpatrick, who is a research fellow at the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of NSW, said some of the biggest increases in heatwaves will occur in poor nations who burn relatively little fossil fuels. \n\"It makes it really awful,\" she said. \"They haven't done anything to deserve this, but these are the ones who are going to suffer the most.\" \nWhile rating only \"Buckley's chance\" of keeping warming to that 1.5-degree lower Paris goal, Dr Perkins-Kirkpatrick said the science indicates emissions to be limited as much as possible. \n\"The impacts are going to be bad and we're not going to stop it,\" she said. \"But it's never too late to try to change what we're doing.\" \nSee the interactive map below, showing projected impacts with each degree of warming for different parts of the world.

I wonder what the shareholders would think of Westpac actions in such circumstances. I make the point, this is post the world financial crisis,\" he says. \nStill Goullet's web of companies were barely afloat, so what to do? Get a credit card, of course. \n\"Hence, the idea to utilise AMEX to obtain short-term relief for the company. That is an amazing phrase, when you think about it.\" \nThe first charge on the AMEX was not to sort out wages but to settle a $25,000 debt on Goullet's Mercedes. \nGoullet, the judge went on, then used the corporate AMEX to purchase boat motors from America \"to continue the entitled lifestyle of himself and his [girlfriend]\". \nAdd to that a $9000 family holiday at Hayman Island. \nNext on the menu was a mortgage from the ANZ for a Porsche using forged documents. \nGoullet described a company to the bank that was turning over $4 million a year, pumping out a profit of almost $800,000, and a backer, Schulz, in rude financial health. \n\"Both of such corporate and individual financial documents being false, none of them were apparently ever independently checked by ANZ,\" the Judge says. \nHe also got ANZ to spring for a forklift. \nWhen Schulz complained that Westpac wouldn't lend him money for property, Goullet switched Schulz out as guarantor on Westpac's $1 million and installed an employee instead. \nThis employee had, in the words of the judge, \"no assets, or personal trading history\" yet Westpac happily signed it over \u2013 but not before one of its staff inspected an accursed machine at the centre of the enterprise. \n\"In what is an absolutely remarkable photo ... there is the representative in the exhibit photo, smiling and looking at the machine,\" the Judge says. \nThe employee was soon bankrupted and their \"business\" liquidated, with Westpac never recouping its money. The machine in the picture was \"valued as essentially being worthless\". \n\"Again, no doubt Westpac shareholders would be outraged to find the bank involved in such intemperate financial dealing and being so easily duped by Mr Goullet.\" \nBy early 2012, Schulz had enough. He came to Melbourne, fired Goullet and called in the police. Goullet to the end showed little remorse, according to the judge, and was sentenced to four years' jail. Bock again \nThe revolving door at McGrath real estate swings both ways with the return of Stephen Bock, who has joined its company-owned sales team on Sydney's northern beaches, specialising in the beachy suburbs of Manly, Fairlight, Balgowlah, Balgowlah Heights and Forestville. \nBock brings with him more than 18 years of sales experience and has sold close to $1 billion in real estate over his career. He returns to McGrath, having previously worked at the company's Manly office ten years ago. \nGiven house prices are slowing, he will be able to use his skills as a mountaineer to help face any peaks and troughs. \nBock was the 61st Australian to summit Mount Everest and is currently pursuing the 'Explorers Grand Slam' \u2013 climbing the highest peak on each continent and travelling to both the North and South Pole. \nBusinessDay", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:30:03.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af8778e0abd6662d5095ade1affdf18c98cf5157", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd6ZM_.qTa3yqPB96G8qGXGxeoWxG2kzdL_QhYhZVPqmjdHkEnXLVfNXWxGR9dQlY6TexQHv4Rzl12_B9gOqY_LSkgulzWPsc2tJ5Vle.wcUGvlLS_nZqncO.H0K3Nn0f91N8otkIZCpWrgExnf7mo.g-", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "http://feeds.smh.com.au/rssheadlines/top.xml#", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sydney Morning Herald RSS News Headlines", "title": "What Richmond and the Storm can teach business", "title_full": "What Richmond and the Storm can teach business", "published": "2017-10-04T03:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/y/s/e/0/n/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gyt519.png/1507013824457.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 13, "comments": 0, "shares": 13}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 12}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af8778e0abd6662d5095ade1affdf18c98cf5157", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd6ZM_.qTa3yqPB96G8qGXGxeoWxG2kzdL_QhYhZVPqmjdHkEnXLVfNXWxGR9dQlY6TexQHv4Rzl12_B9gOqY_LSkgulzWPsc2tJ5Vle.wcUGvlLS_nZqncO.H0K3Nn0f91N8otkIZCpWrgExnf7mo.g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tony Featherstone", "published": "2017-10-04T03:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "What Richmond and the Storm can teach business", "text": "twitter TWEET More \nThe Richmond Football Club and Melbourne Storm are more than grand final winners in their respective codes. They are also exceptional case studies from which business can learn. \nRichmond orchestrated a textbook turnaround that seemed impossible a year ago. Melbourne Storm has been consistently strong for a decade \u2013 a feat beyond most large companies. Both organisations excel in leadership, culture and stakeholder connections.

The noted academic, Harvard's Rosabeth Moss Kanter, has researched how great clubs build and maintain winning cultures \u2013 and what business can learn from high-performance sporting organisations. Her work should be mandatory reading for emerging managers. \nImagine if Australia had 16 large banks trying to smash each other every week (and how consumers would benefit).

The club has as close a relationship with its fan base as any in rugby league. Photo: AAP \nRichmond and Melbourne Storm have much in common as case studies. Here are five things business can learn from their success (add your views by replying to this blog): 1. Continuity \nSometimes the hardest thing to do in business is nothing. When performance wanes, stakeholders demand change and weak-willed organisations lose their nerve. Boards and executive teams become revolving doors and continuity suffers. Advertisement \nRichmond, to its great credit, held its nerve against a rival board faction last year. The club backed a coach (Damien Hardwick) under pressure. It stood up to critics. How many large listed companies these days stand by top talent when things go wrong? You will now receive updates from My Small Business Newsletter My Small Business Newsletter \nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox. By submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy . \nMelbourne Storm typifies continuity. A longstanding master coach in Craig Bellamy. Three great players in Cameron Smith, Cooper Cronk and Billy Slater, who have shaped the club's culture and values. An organisation \"front office\" that has been remarkably stable this decade. \nThe lesson for emerging ventures: find your A team and lock them in. Build the venture around them and help top talent develop. Cherish continuity. Nothing stalls venture momentum more than frequent leadership changes and managers who lose their nerve. 2. Connections \nAmid the Melbourne Storm celebrations, I noticed star playmaker Cooper Cronk embracing a rookie colleague. There's nothing unusual about players hugging each other after a grand final, but the deep connection between the Storm's old and young talent was obvious. \nConnection was a key word in Richmond's turnaround. The club reportedly worked hard in the off-season to help players better connect with each other and the coaching group. Richmond looked like a club playing for each other, its fans and history. \nToo many companies are full of staff who hate each other. Connections are severed and organisation culture suffers. Does star older talent in your organisation go out of its way to mentor young people? Is there a genuine culture of staff celebrating each other's wins? \nThe lesson for emerging ventures: find a compelling narrative that extends beyond making money. \nThe lesson for business: work hard to nourish connections across the organisation. The firm's culture will never flourish if staff feel disconnected from each other. 3. Conviction \nGreat organisations have a cause. Richmond's this year was to turnaround a disappointing 2016 season and break a 37-year premiership drought. The Melbourne Storm's recurring cause is to break into an AFL-dominated market and win over a sports-mad city. \nIn some ways, the Storm reminds me of an unknown start-up venture fighting for every inch of its market. Yes, the Storm is almost two decades old and much better known these days. I remember the early days when the club was almost irrelevant in Melbourne. \nOrganisation cause goes together with continuity and connections. The same leadership team encourages greater connections across the organisation and more buy-in to the cause. They turn the cause into a story that galvanises staff and brings out their best. \nWhat is your employer's cause? Do you believe in it? Does the cause motivate you to work harder in your role? Do you feel good about your organisation and your role? \nThe lesson for emerging ventures: find a compelling narrative that extends beyond making money. Communicate it constantly to staff. Support the cause with actions, not statements, and when it does not always suit the organisation. Staff who believe in a cause perform best. 4. Community \nHaving watched sport for over four decades, I cannot recall an Australian club with a more passionate fan base then Richmond. (As a Manly/Hawthorn fan, that's hard to write.) The Tiger Army set the gold standard in fan support in September. Take a bow, Richmond supporters. \nThe Melbourne Storm fan base also deserves great credit. I recall watching occasional Storm games at the old Olympic Park Stadium when crowds were tiny. Even then, there was a diehard core of Storm fans who backed a team with an uncertain future. \nAlmost 29,000 people, many wearing purple jerseys, cheered the Storm in the semi-final against the Brisbane Broncos, the largest crowd in the club's history. I believe that was the night when the Storm emerged as one of Melbourne's great sporting clubs \u2013 a journey almost 20 years in the making. \nThe resurgence in the Tiger Army and expanding Melbourne Storm fan base are no accident. Both clubs know and respect their customers. The Storm has as close a relationship with its fan base as any rugby league club. \nHow close is your organisation to its customers? Does it go out of its way to engage them, exceed their expectation and delight them? How much access do loyal customers have to the company? Do customers \"cheer\" your organisation and promote it to friends? \nThe lesson for new ventures: go on the journey with customers. Make them feel like they are part of something bigger than the everyday business. Granted, no company can engender the same community passion as a sporting club, but most do not even try. 5. Credibility \nRichmond and Melbourne Storm possess a rare quality: authentic leadership. Their coaches are passionate, competitive and clearly excellent people managers. Both seem to be themselves in interviews and games, unlike many coaches who seem defensive or formulaic. \nHardwick's self-awareness is a leadership lesson. He recognised he needed to change and get back to what he enjoyed after a poor 2016 season. In newspaper reports, he was honest and humble about his failings last year, showed a willingness to improve and rare openness. Hardwick's connection with Richmond players was obvious. \nStorm coach Craig Bellamy is about as real as it gets in NRL coaching. His crankiness and euphoria in the coaches' box during games is legendary. Players want to play for him, and it is no surprise that many former Storm players refer to Bellamy as a father figure. \nNor is it a surprise that several Storm coaching assistants have gone on to bigger roles at rival clubs, and starred, with Bellamy's blessing. It's always a great sign when organisations have a culture of encouraging top leadership to take on higher roles elsewhere. \nDoes your organisation have authentic leadership? Do you believe in the CEO and want to do your best from them? Or do the organisation's leaders seem stage managed, unable to connect with all types of staff on a personal and professional level? \nThe lesson for entrepreneurs: be yourself. Change when you must. Admit your failings and learn from them. Find a balance between connecting with staff and making tough decisions. Staff respond best to real leaders, not corporate robots who seem inhumane. \nFollow MySmallBusiness on Twitter , Facebook and LinkedIn .

Photo: Louise Kennerley \n\"Breaches of academic integrity have broad implications,\" Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency chief executive Anthony McClaran\u200b said. \nHe said cheating put the reputation of Australia's higher education system at risk, and could endanger employers and the integrity of qualifications. \nA recent survey by University of South Australia associate professor Tracey Bretag\u200b \u2013 who helped create the guidelines \u2013 found that 6 per cent of Australian students engaged in cheating. \nThe survey also revealed that 68 per cent of academics had encountered what they suspected was cheating. Advertisement \nMr McClaran said cheating had become increasingly sophisticated. \nHe said \"well organised\" contract cheating websites were subcontracting out essays, and returning work, sometimes up to a postgraduate level, in a short period of time.   \n\"Advances in information technology are enabling more clever and sophisticated ways of offering cheating services,\" Mr McClaran said. \n\"They are more widespread, more easily accessible, the cost ... seems to be coming down and it is leading to increased incidents.\" \nOther forms of cheating are also a concern. Students are using digital \"cheating\" watches to store data that is retrieved during exams and buying $600 hidden earpieces with Bluetooth connectivity. \nThe prevalence of contract cheating at Australian universities was brought into sharp focus during the MyMaster scandal uncovered by Fairfax Media. \nStudents paid up to $1000 for an assignment using the MyMaster company. But students engaged in contract cheating can pay as little as $50 for an assignment, with some advertising on sharing economy platform Airtasker . \nThe regulator's new guidelines highlight best practice, which includes barring students' from commercial cheat sites while on campus, and sending them a counter-message when they try to access the sites. \n\"They should receive a message such as: 'This site has been blocked because it is not a legitimate learning service', along with a link to the higher education provider's academic integrity resources,\" the document said. \nIt also recommends compulsory academic integrity training for students, and professional development for staff to help them identify contract cheating. \nIt says contract cheating is difficult to detect because it cannot be picked up through text-matching software like standard plagiarism. \nHigher education providers are also being urged to use the data they collect to identify contract cheating \"hot spots\" in faculties, courses and among certain assessments. \nThis would ensure that \"resources can be allocated in areas most prone to contract cheating\". \nThe regulator also recommended that universities consider publishing de-identified data about cheating investigations, which could be available to students and staff on its intranet. \nA similar initiative already takes place at Griffith University, which regularly publishes public data on breaches of academic integrity and disciplinary decisions. \nThe guide acknowledges that no type of assessment is immune to contract cheating. \nBut Dr Bretag's research found that reflections, oral defences of written work, assignments that relate to students' personal experience and supervised in-class assessments were less likely to be outsourced. \nThe work builds on new higher education standards, which came into effect at the start of the year. \nUniversities Australia chief executive Belinda Robinson said the new guide would help universities stamp out contract cheating. \nShe sent a strong message to students who were contemplating cheating. \n\"You will get caught and it will ruin your future prospects,\" she said. \n\"Is it worth the risk to your reputation, your qualifications and your future employment?\" Advertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

advertising to encourage NSW motorists to use the E10 ethanol blend, despite warnings that a state government scheme that forces petrol stations to sell the biofuel increases prices. \nDocuments

per cent of all petrol sold. SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Even though the campaign was launched in May, not one retailer has met a requirement that E10 must account for at least 60 per cent of all petrol sold. \nOn January 1, the NSW government introduced new rules that force a wider range of petrol stations to sell E10. \nIn an embarrassing twist, in April the federal Productivity Commission recommended axing the so-called ethanol mandate scheme because it increases petrol prices and reduces competition. \nBut the following month the government launched an advertising campaign, E10 Fuel for Thought, which it says was designed to dispel \"myths\" about E10 and encourage its use.

The business is divided into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). \nIn Australia, Amazon files under the banner of Amazon Web Services. It effectively treats Australia as a marketing operation. Advertisement \nIts 2016 accounts state so: \"Revenue of the company represents fees received or receivable for support services provided to external third parties and to related companies. Support services include marketing, training and professional services ...\" \nWhile Amazon made a loss, it did pay some tax in Australia. Amazon Web Services financial accounts show it earned $124 million in \"revenue\" in 2016 (compared with $31.7 million in the period April 22 to December 31, 2015, cited in the accounts). A breakdown of 2016 revenue from operating activities shows $7.5 million for external training and professional services and $117 million for inter-company support services. \nAmazon Web Services' final income tax expense was $2.67 millon, much of which is due to $3.4 million worth of share-based compensation, which is likely not tax deductible. It also has a $42.2 million current loan from a related party, but no information is provided. Could it be from the same Lux subsidiary? \nThe low city in Luxembourg City. Amazon has used the low-tax nation to reduce its tax bills. Photo: NYT Luxembourg loan \nAmazon also files accounts locally under \"Amazon Corporate Services\", which provides data-hosting services to Amazon Web Services. \nThe company has previously stated that \"Amazon Corporate Services Pty Ltd does not represent revenue from customers using AWS services, in Australia or any other region\". \nWhat we don't know yet is how, once Amazon start seriously selling here in Australia, it will be booked. Will it end up in tax havens? \nOnce again these accounts show hundreds of millions of dollars of related party transactions with subsidiaries offshore. \nIn 2016 the company received an inter-company loan from its Luxembourg company Amazon Europe Core Sarl for $146.4 million. It was classified as non-current as it is payable in April 2023. This followed an earlier inter-company loan from Amazon Overseas Holdings of $US149.6 million in 2015, which was repaid in 2016. \nAmazon did not respond to questions from Fairfax Media by deadline. Red flag alert \n\"The fact that it is from a Lux Amazon subsidiary is a definitely a red flag,\" says UTS Business School associate professor Roman Lanis. \n\"The corporate structure in Australia raises red flags and is similar to the other US tech/energy companies which we know have been accused/convicted of avoiding tax here. \n\"What we don't know is how will things change or what they will do when they start earning billions in revenue in Australia \u2013 that is, when they start selling their products here.\" \nAmazon is going to start selling to Australian consumers, but will it pay enough tax locally? Photo: Dhiraj Singh \nRevenue for Amazon Corporate Services was $317.5 million (up from $237 million for 2015, $147.2 million for 2014, $69.4 million for 2013). Profit was $39.8 million (up from $11.7 million for 2015). Its income tax expense was $13.1 million ($2.3 million for 2015). This resulted in net income of $26.7 million (loss of $13.9 million for 2015). Massive related party deals \nA breakdown of Amazon Corporate Services accounts shows massive related party service fees ($335.7 million in 2016, $247.7 million in 2015). \nIts accounts state: \"Data and support service fee revenue of the company represents fees received or receivable for services provided to a related company. Services include data, marketing, and other support services for Amazon Web Services, a company incorporated in the United States.\" \nData service fee revenue from related companies totalled $293 million in 2016, support service fee revenue from related companies was $18.3 million and rental income from related companies was $6.5 million in 2016. \nAmazon's 2016 annual report states \"as of December 31, 2016, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $US8.6 billion, which included undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the US of $US2.8 billion\". \n\"We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized (sic) to reduce our US taxable income.\" As of December 31, 2016, Amazon had about about $US608 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. \nAmazon has faced court battles overseas. Earlier this year it won a $US1.5 billion transfer pricing dispute in a US court. Global tax fights \nShould Amazon use its Luxembourg subsiduary to reduce its local taxes, and should the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) then try to pursue the company, a tough battle awaits. \nOn March 23 the US Tax Court ruled in favour of Amazon in a transfer pricing dispute, saying it was legal for the internet giant to channel its European sales through its low-tax Luxembourg subsidiary in 2005 and 2006, rather than America. Had it lost, Amazon could have faced a tax bill as high as $US1.5 billion and lower profits for future years. \nAmazon has also come under fire for halving the amount of UK corporation tax it paid last year while more than doubling turnover during the same period. Accounts filed by Amazon UK Services show the company was billed just \u00a37.4 million ($12.6 million) for 2016 compared with \u00a315.8 million in 2015. \nOnce a series of deductions had been added, Amazon UK Services actually received a \u00a31.3 million credit from the British authorities. \nFollow Nassim Khadem on Facebook and Twitter .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amazo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jeff bezos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nassim khadem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roman lanis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lux", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amazon.com", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ap amazon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amazon web services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhiraj singh  revenue for amazon corporate services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon overseas holdings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyt luxembourg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon europe core sarl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian taxation office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon corporate services pty ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fairfax media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "business am newsletter business am newsletter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lux amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us tax court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon corporate services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon uk services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uts business school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luxembourg city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luxembourg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delaware", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:30:06.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b367b8785f8b1bbf42e319a86115d6a777f0388c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd6ZM_.qTa3yqPB96G8qGXGwspjCgfCpMMgAz2TNCFeBO1UU8T8S0Y4UjhleuaB0CXsUoTZ7ljKQ.xR2Tw6uEhDEj.uiHFbRBdFORd6TpYFIBL4WProzQsvsdREkPiK.23_BB_lMopA7X0B7m6F7ps_GxTAfZIeyNDqGPn7hx1C1z.95ANkqFvqE-", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "http://feeds.smh.com.au/rssheadlines/top.xml#", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sydney Morning Herald RSS News Headlines", "title": "Seven things I've learnt building my $10 million business The Healthy Mummy", "title_full": "Seven things I've learnt building my $10 million business The Healthy Mummy", "published": "2017-10-04T03:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/y/m/n/r/p/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gytk2e.png/1507012149214.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 27, "comments": 0, "shares": 27}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b367b8785f8b1bbf42e319a86115d6a777f0388c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd6ZM_.qTa3yqPB96G8qGXGwspjCgfCpMMgAz2TNCFeBO1UU8T8S0Y4UjhleuaB0CXsUoTZ7ljKQ.xR2Tw6uEhDEj.uiHFbRBdFORd6TpYFIBL4WProzQsvsdREkPiK.23_BB_lMopA7X0B7m6F7ps_GxTAfZIeyNDqGPn7hx1C1z.95ANkqFvqE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rhian Allen", "published": "2017-10-04T03:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Seven things I've learnt building my $10 million business The Healthy Mummy", "text": "Seven things I've learnt building my $10 million business The Healthy Mummy Rhian Allen twitter TWEET More \nRhian Allen started digital content program The Healthy Mummy seven years ago.

Family first \nAlways put your family first. For me, my kids and family always come first. \nThe business is crazy. The stress can be madness. But I never want that to impact on them. My husband works full -time on the business too and we both ensure that our kids come first. SHARE Richard Whiteoak of Whiteoak Capital, one of The Healthy Mummy's investors, with founder Rhian Allen. Photo: Cole Bennetts \nWe don't have full-time nannies and instead we are there for school drop-offs and pick-ups. We are there for play dates. We are there for them. \nThis means we end up having less time for ourselves and have to work late most nights, and we are always tired, but it is the sacrifice we make so that the growth of the business doesn't affect them. And as we both are on and in the business full-time together we are able to make this work. Advertisement 2. Never ever be scared to try \nNever ever be scared to try and don't be scared of failure. I try new things all the time. Most of the time they work but sometimes they don't \u2013 but that's OK \u2013 I learn from every stumble and if you don't try you will never know.

Don't think your ideas are the best. For me, my community and customer are No.1. \nWhatever they say, I listen to as they are my business' shareholders. Their opinions count and I listen to everything they say \u2013 positive and negative \u2013 and I am forever grateful to hear their voice and it helps me to ensure we deliver on what they want and need at a price they can afford. 4. Continue to evolve \nNever stand still. The world today moves so fast and you need to evolve to keep up. Customers have a high expectation and they want the best service for the best price. Never stop coming up with ideas and evolving. 5. Surround yourself with an amazing team \nWithout an amazing team you cannot grow and you cannot service your customers. I have an incredible team and the business employs more than 150 women and mums over the country. I try my best to create a really good working environment where people enjoy their roles. \nI strongly believe that we work to live not the other way around and my aim is to always nurture a team environment that is hard-working but also where everyone knows that family time and time out is good. \nThe key thing to remember is that success doesn't happen overnight \u2013 it takes consistency \u2013 day in day out, over many years. 6. Out of your comfort zone is a good place to be \nOne of the biggest challenges and rewards of starting your own business is the enormous amount of obstacles to climb. It can be very scary to start your own business. But the more you push yourself out of your comfort zone the more you will be rewarded. And the key thing to remember is that success doesn't happen overnight \u2013 it takes consistency \u2013 day in day out, over many years. \nI remember when I first was asked to go on TV I was like \"OMG I can't do that\". Now I go on live TV shows every month. It is all about pushing yourself and now I love going on and spreading The Healthy Mummy message. 7 Confidence is key \nYou must believe in yourself and what your business is. I always believed in my business. I believed in what I was doing. I could clearly see that there was a real need to support and help mums with a balanced approach to health and weight loss and the hardest thing was starting out all on my own and climbing what seemed to be Mount Everest. \nBut I never gave up \u2013 I just kept doing what I believed in and I never faltered. I live this brand. It is my life. I embody it every day. I love the brand. I am the busy mum. And every day I want to keep delivering the best possible service, products and support to every mum around the world in an affordable way and I am driven to do that every day I wake up. \nFollow MySmallBusiness on Twitter , Facebook and LinkedIn .

There is, of course, no credible evidence \u2013 none at all of any \"issues\" with Kaspersky programs, which is perhaps why the man himself is highly energised, trying to prove there are no back doors allowing anyone to tamper with programs. \nIt's always difficult, however, to prove that something doesn't exist. Perhaps it also has something to do with the fact that Kaspersky revealed the details of the Stuxnet attack, whereby the US and Israel successfully crippled Iran's nuclear industry, the first known, deliberate, state-on-state cyber assault.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet says that, despite a continual risk assessments, it's determined no problems exist with the software.

The reasoning seems to go that, because the Kremlin campaigned to disrupt last year's US presidential election, anyone Russian should be punished. The fact that Facebook and Twitter actually distributed the false information seems completely irrelevant as far as the US Department of Homeland Security is concerned. Facebook and Twitter, of course, are American. Kaspersky is not. \nWhich leds me to investigate the company's Australian arm. Was this, similarly, a supposed hotbed of Russian hackers? After all, the general manager is Anastasia Rae, which sounds kind of Russian \u2013 until you realise she was once a little Greek-Australian girl at Coburg Primary School in Melbourne. She knows her business depends on reputation. When the loss from a targeted attack can run to millions of dollars, Rae knows there's more to be made from good products than facilitating the flow of false news on the internet. \n(I should probably declare that my daughters' names are Anastasia and Eugenia, so I may be a Russian spy, too. Fortunately, Fairfax pay me munificently, ensuring my reporting is as pure as the driven snow.) \nBut the problem with throwing mud is that some inevitably sticks. \nIn this case, confusion is being created between two very different things: a deliberate electronic assault is compared to the outcome of very natural processes, like people sharing news and emailing one another. \nLast week, the (Australian) Department of Human Services hosted an electronic war game between teams from rival departments. Over five days, different agencies simulated a series of calculated attacks, trying to penetrate government infrastructure. It was an imaginative experiment. Organiser Narelle Devine deserves praise: she's trying to build the government's capacity to deal with such threats, because this can't be achieved when departments wreathe themselves in secrecy. Recently, for example, it was inadvertently revealed that a foreign government had penetrated critical (and supposedly protected) secret networks at PM&C; the hackers had used a backdoor from another insecure department. Secrecy over episodes like this doesn't make us safer; it simply means we have no idea about our vulnerabilities. This is what a deliberate attack looks like: exploration, penetration and then the insertion of a virus designed to attack, hide or monitor. \nWhat happened in the US election is very different. The fault had nothing to do with Kaspersky's software and everything to do with the loose, freewheeling and ultimately hollow nature of so-called \"social\" media. \nGenuine communities don't spend their time fostering lies and conspiracies. That's not the case with the new media. It makes money out of eyeballs and everyone knows these are attracted by sensation. I even find myself doing it, looking at the latest palpably incorrect instalments to flit through the ether, vanishing before they can be caught and the rubbish shredded. \nThat's what editors do. They're paid to check things and ensure they're correct. \nBut this costs money and slows things down, which is exactly why the technical whiz kids stress that they stand for \"free speech\". Sure it's free, which is why it's worth exactly what you pay for it: nothing. The danger is that it sounds plausible, fosters distrust and creates division \u2013 the very opposite of what a \"social\" network is meant to do. \nKaspersky has some good ideas about how to tackle this problem. He suggests creating different zones for the internet, depending on the level of security (and accuracy) required.

For example, I, as an ordained Uniting Church minister, will not be able to marry same-sex couples even if the civil law changes, unless my church also chooses to change its policy, which it has no compulsion to do. Related Articles John Howard: Safeguards needed now in same-sex marriage vote \nCurrently, to be married in an Anglican church, at least one of the couple to be married must be a baptised Christian. \nTo be married in the Roman Catholic Church, neither partner can be previously married and divorced. Even when no-fault divorce was introduced in secular law in 1975, the Catholic Church continued to uphold its own view regarding divorce. This remains the case. Advertisement \nThe Greek Orthodox Church usually requires the couple to be baptised in the Orthodox tradition, but occasionally allows one of the pair to be of another Christian denomination as long as they were not baptised by a female minister . \nSimilarly, some synagogues require both parties to show proof they are Jewish, while others might allow an interfaith marriage. SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link While nothing will have to change for the church and therefore there is nothing to fear from a change to civil law, religious organisations are faced with a new opportunity should civil law change. \nApart from official church polity, clergy are also permitted to exercise their own discretion when it comes to marriage. Hence, if one thinks the couple is too young, not prepared, has rushed into the decision, or suspects any kind of abuse, they can refuse to marry them or require them to undergo counselling or something similar beforehand. \nSuch discretion is protected by the religious freedoms granted to clergy. \nRecently we witnessed the case of a Victorian Presbyterian minister who refused to marry a couple because of their views on marriage equality. While I disagree with the decision of the clergyman in question, he is free to refuse on these grounds. \nHis protection under Australian law is assured \u2013 a fact supported by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who said : \"Churches are entitled to marry or not marry whom they please. That is part of religious freedom.\" \nAustralian civil marriage laws have changed several times in the last 120 years, and each time religious organisations have been free to conduct marriages according to their traditions. \nWhile nothing will have to change for the church and therefore there is nothing to fear from a change to civil law, religious organisations are faced with a new opportunity should civil law change. It is an invitation to revisit their marriage policies and consider whether or not they want to extend their respective religious marriages to same-sex couples. \nAfter same-sex marriage was legalised in the US, two Christian churches did exactly that. In 2015 the Episcopal Church\u2019s General Assembly gave permission for clergy to officiate over same-sex weddings at the discretion of the regional bishop and according to their own conscience. \nNo clergyperson was forced to do so \u2013 the change in policy was permissive rather than prescriptive. \nThat same year, the US Presbyterian Church also amended its marriage policy to affirm that marriage is a \u201cunique commitment between two people, traditionally a man and a woman, to love and support each other for the rest of their lives\u201d. The policy gives permission for Presbyterian clergy to marry same-sex couples but clearly states that no clergyperson could be compelled to perform same-sex marriages. \nConcerns over religious freedom cannot be dismissed too lightly, but neither should they be overstated. The dynamics described above are different when is comes to individuals working in the secular space or organisations such as religious private schools. \nWhat is clear, however, is that no one can compel any official church leader in Australia to perform marriages against its own policy, and no church will be forced to change its current marriage policy, rituals or doctrines. \nI hope, however, that some churches might embrace the possibility of extending the blessings of a Christian marriage to all committed couples. \nThis article was originally published on The Conversation .

Moylan and his brother, whom he is living with, have a strong connection with the Fifita family and share a special bond having grown up together in Sydney's west. \nPenrith's preference is to keep Moylan at the club, but the noise surrounding the 26-year-old's unhappiness at the club won't go away despite him showing renewed enthusiasm over the past few weeks. \nFormer player agent Wayne Beavis still represents Panthers general manager Phil Gould and Sharks coach Shane Flanagan, and only this year gave up Maloney as his client after deciding against another year as an accredited NRL player manager. \nInterestingly, Beavis has offloaded most of his player clients to Allan Gainey, the same manager who represents Moylan and signed off on a five-year deal with the Panthers just last year. \nThe anterior cruciate ligament injury to rookie Tyrone May in Penrith's last game of the season has complicated things, with Penrith reluctant to start 2018 without a proven five-eighth. \nBoth May and fullback Dylan Edwards are on minimum wage contracts and will be upgraded soon. However, that may create salary cap restrictions in 2019 given most of the Panthers' big name players are locked up on long-term deals. \nPenrith are also preparing for a huge battle to keep halfback Cleary at the club beyond the end of 2019, aware of the appeal of playing under his father at the Tigers when his contract expires at the Panthers. \nMoylan is expected to attend the club's presentation night at Panthers Leagues Club on Wednesday night, with his future expected to be the elephant in the room. \nDespite reaching the second week of the finals, Penrith have no players in Australia's 24-man World Cup squad. \nTrent Merrin and Reagan Campbell-Gillard were considered, but Merrin was deemed unavailable through injury and Campbell-Gillard was beaten to a position by Storm premiership-winning prop Jordan McLean. \nJosh Mansour was the other Panthers player under consideration but Kangaroos coach Mal Meninga has only put him on standby for Darius Boyd, who has to pass a medical test on his injured hamstring on Thursday to play in the tournament. \nMansour is expected to make himself unavailable for selection for Lebanon if he misses out on Australian selection.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:21:31.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "17d61598740be5c5de99be185499fd15bf345710", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd5xZ9ENCxhIMdJPjPHmKtC8ou_RBoJvGhuOqlFB8UKrMhP2TZdc5p7iWHHcZwLWh8c70OeWIzeui5P.kSSeN3O_dM2CUlZrp4cxsoCTJX82YhQJnwO6gTMOicElmFNAonw--", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.watoday.com.au/rssheadlines/politics/article/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WAToday RSS News Headlines", "title": "US expels 15 Cuban diplomats from embassy in Washington", "title_full": "US expels 15 Cuban diplomats from embassy in Washington", "published": "2017-10-04T02:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.watoday.com.au/content/dam/images/g/y/t/r/6/4/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gytr60.png/1507043967174.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "17d61598740be5c5de99be185499fd15bf345710", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd5xZ9ENCxhIMdJPjPHmKtC8ou_RBoJvGhuOqlFB8UKrMhP2TZdc5p7iWHHcZwLWh8c70OeWIzeui5P.kSSeN3O_dM2CUlZrp4cxsoCTJX82YhQJnwO6gTMOicElmFNAonw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T02:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "US expels 15 Cuban diplomats from embassy in Washington", "text": "US expels 15 Cuban diplomats from embassy in Washington Matt Spetalnick and Sarah Marsh twitter TWEET More \nWashington: The Trump administration has ordered the expulsion of 15 Cuban diplomats from Washington as the diplomatic \"sonar attacks mystery\" drags on unresolved. \nIt comes after the US pulled more than half of its own embassy staff out of Havana last week, and drew an angry protest from the Cuban government.

But I think what's shocked me most is how familiar this all feels,\" he told Channel Ten viewers on Tuesday. \n\"This will happen again. It always does and it always happens the same way and it goes like this: First you have a shooting; you have the chaos; you have a police response to neutralise the situation. And inevitably, you have the world's attention turn to the shooter. \n\"Here we have a man with no criminal record, no ties to religious or terror groups and as far as his family knows no mental health issues and no military or weapons training. \n\"And yet, he was a man capable of pulling off a military-grade attack on US soil.\" A wounded person is walked in on a wheelbarrow as Las Vegas police respond during the shooting.

And this will happen again.\" \nHe said instead of gun reform, the mere talk sends gun-loving Americans flocking to stores so gun sales rise in the US, with the biggest manufacturers \"American Outdoor Brands, which used to be called Smith & Wesson, and Sturm, Ruger and company [surging] nearly four per cent since last night's shooting.\" \n\"Over the last 50 years, per capita, the number of guns in America has doubled, from one for every two people, to one for every one person,\" he said. \n\"There are now more than 300 million guns in the USA.\" As Las Vegas mourns, the cycle begins - this will happen again. #TheProjectTV | Written by Waleed Aly & Tom Whitty ( @twhittyer ) pic.twitter.com/5xEuok97SZ \u2014 The Project (@theprojecttv) October 3, 2017 \nAly said US gunmakers produced almost 11 million guns following the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre. \n\"And so with Americans out today, buying more guns than they were yesterday, what's the NRA got to say? Nothing... because that's what they do every time. After 49 people were gunned down in the Orlando [nightclub shooting] in 2016, the last deadliest mass shooting in US history, they took two days to respond. \n\"And tomorrow, or the next day, they'll be back at what they always do: lobbying politicians to make sure that absolutely nothing changes. \n\"That's because the NRA spends more than $3 million every year just on lobbying politicians ... Last year, the NRA reportedly spent $30.3 million dollars in support of Donald Trump.\" \nEarlier today, the White House dismissed talk of gun reform from Hillary Clinton and other political opponents, with press secretary Sarah Huckabee saying: \"Today is a day for consoling of survivors and mourning those we lost.

List Your Business Here \nThe latest annual report on 'fat cat' superannuation and managed funds by online investment platform, Stockspot, shows an 18 per cent fall in the number of poor-value funds from last year. \nHowever, funds owned by the big banks and AMP continue to dominate the ranks of the fat cats with high fees and poor performance; though NAB has fallen out of the top-five owners of the worst-value funds this year. \nA candidate fat cat fund is one that underperforms it peers over the past one, three and five years to June 30, 2017. \nTo qualify as a fat cat, it has to also underperform its peers by more than 10 percentage points over five years. \nChris Brycki, Stockspot founder and author of the report, says there are 521 fat cat super and managed funds, and two thirds are managed by the big banks and AMP. Founder of Stockspot, Chris Brycki, says despite improvements, the banks and AMP could do more to migrate their customers to their lower- fee super funds Photo: Christopher Pearce \nThat's down from last year, when the big banks and AMP accounted for three-quarters of the fat cat funds, he says. \nAs well at the fat cat funds, Stockspot identifies the \"fit cat\" funds - those that perform more than 10 percentage points better than peers over five years. \nThe big banks and AMP, the \"retail\" funds, do have a number of super funds and managed funds that feature in the ranks of the fit cat funds. \nBrycki says the big banks and AMP have a number of \"legacy\" funds. \nThey are often closed to new members, but still have a lot of money in them, he says. \n\"Their newer funds tend to have lower fees but they could be doing more to migrate people across from their older, higher-fee funds,\" he says. \nRetail funds have pointed out that many of their customers receive fee discounts and so pay lower fees than the disclosed fees that are used in comparisons. \nThere is also a question mark over the the accuracy of some industry fund's reporting of their costs and fees, which do better in the report than retail funds. \n\"It appears many industry super funds don't fully disclose all costs and fees,\" Brycki says. \nHe says when the super fund reporting standards change in 2018 he suspects some industry funds with low advertised fees will report significantly higher fees. Spaceship slashes fees \nIn a separate move, Spaceship, the tech-stock heavy super funds targeting the \"internet generation\" has slashed its fees following criticism. \nSpaceship is not included in the Stockspot report as its track record is much less than the required five years. \nBrycki has recently criticised the fund for its flashy marketing and celebrity endorsers which, he says, distracts people from the underlying financial product being sold and its high fees. \nSpaceship was charging 1.6 per cent a year for its flagship GrowthX option. It has now cut that to 0.99 per cent. \nThe option has been rebalanced to include a 50 per cent allocation to technology investments, up from 30 per cent. \nSpaceship has also launched an index fund, called the Spaceship Global Index Fund, with an annual fee of 0.65 per cent. \nIndex investing is cheaper than using active managers who charge higher fees with the promise to outperform the market market in which they invest over time. \nSpaceship has also formed an advisory board made up of Sarah Goodman, previously with the Australian Prudential and Regulatory Authority, Paul Dortkamp, an independent director of Ellerston Global Capital and Jodie Baker, the managing partner at management consultants Blackhall & Pearl. \nPaul Bennetts, Spaceship chief executive and founder, says: \"The formation of this board underlines our commitment to best-in-class governance and risk management, and to making sure our members benefit from the wisdom of some of the most experienced names in the industry.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sarah goodman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brycki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris brycki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stockspot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jodie baker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul dortkamp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul bennetts", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ellerston global capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "regulatory authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blackhall & pearl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prudential", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nab", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:51:49.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c3c2abb859f28d825090b0cf5398525a1f253006", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd7cEojXSXV3gMKfSMpMjbdl88fI5iN4KAnRLZZRWDx.HMyuo22GbVMJI_T5F2GGuynopTvVJe8DwGuEmL1tQEXDE_8bpVLSfFxTL92KPJ8_Y", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "CEO pay is obscene but it's not the real issue | The Daily Advertiser", "title_full": "CEO pay is obscene but it's not the real issue | The Daily Advertiser", "published": "2017-10-03T05:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c3c2abb859f28d825090b0cf5398525a1f253006", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd7cEojXSXV3gMKfSMpMjbdl88fI5iN4KAnRLZZRWDx.HMyuo22GbVMJI_T5F2GGuynopTvVJe8DwGuEmL1tQEXDE_8bpVLSfFxTL92KPJ8_Y", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Phillips", "published": "2017-10-03T05:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "CEO pay is obscene but it's not the real issue | The Daily Advertiser", "text": "CEO pay is obscene but it's not the real issue Scott Phillips 3 Oct 2017, 1:04 p.m. Yes the pay is obscene, but don't be distracted. \nYes the pay is obscene, but don't be distracted. List Your Business Here \nAccording to some estimates, US chief executives earn somewhere around 400 times the salary of the average worker in their companies. Four hundred times. \nFew people would begrudge successful business people a little extra for the hard work and effort to get to - and stay at - the top. But that's more than just a little extra. \nBy comparison, the average Japanese chief executive earns around 50 times the average worker's pay, and the British 180 times. The ABC recently reported that among an Australian sample, chief executives received between 15 times and 100 times the average employee's pay packet. \nIt's a brave person who argues that any chief executive could objectively be worth up to 400 times what they pay their employees, no matter who that manager is. \nAnd that's the problem - these things aren't objective. There's a very nice little self-reinforcing process that sees compensation consultants paid for giving advice to boards as to how much executives should be paid. \nThey do it by comparing the salaries of similar chief executives - whose pay was set by comparing them to similar chief executives ??? and so on. \nIt's the corporate version of keeping up with the Joneses - and shareholders are footing the bill. \nThose numbers blow out even further, though, when you add short and long-term bonuses to the mix - which often dwarf a corporate boss' regular salary. \nIt's obscene, and should be changed. But, it's a sideshow, and here's why. \nYes, those at the top of the tree are paid a comparative fortune. And they often receive bonuses on top of that for cutting costs, including laying off staff. \nBut on a per share basis, those salaries are almost always close to a rounding error. That is, when amortised across the company's owners, even if pay was cut in half, shareholder returns wouldn't improve by any noticeable amount. \nFor example, CBA's outgoing boss, Ian Narev???, earned $5.5 million in the last financial year, down from $12.3 million in 2016. \nThat's a fraction of 1 percent of the company's $130 billion market capitalisation. And it's still a fraction of 1 percent, compared with the company's recently announced $10 billion profit. \nNarev could have worked for $1, and shareholder returns wouldn't have improved perceptibly. \nThe problem, then, isn't that being paid too much impacts shareholder returns in the year the salary is paid. Ideological concerns aside, paying Narev (or most other ASX-listed company chief executives) less won't move the dial. \nInstead, we should look to incentives. While Narev's $5.5 million doesn't mean anything financially to CBA shareholders, you can bet the fall from $12.3 million the year before was keenly felt by Narev. The reverse, for chief executives who did receive big bonuses, is almost certainly true. \nThere are a couple of nice aphorisms that, together, highlight the real problem: \"Whose bread I eat, his song I sing\" and \"What gets measured, gets done\" summarise the challenge neatly. \nWhen you offer a corporate executive a lotto-winning-equivalent amount of money for achieving certain objectives, you'd better believe it focuses the mind, and drives certain behaviour (and if any chief executive tells you it doesn't, then suggest they give the bonus back. I'll bet they don't). \nBut bonuses are paid on notoriously short-term results - usually a single year's performance, sometimes three. And the metrics used? Company profits and share price gains. \nSo let me give you an analogy. If I'm being remunerated on managing your car's financial performance over the short term, it's easy to manage. I won't bother getting it serviced. I won't replace the tyres, even though the tread is getting low, and I'll put cheap fuel in it. Then, I'll show you how much money I \"saved\" on car maintenance and you'll give me a bonus. \nThen, I'll sell it for you, being a little economical with the truth when talking to the buyer, and showing him how little it costs to run. Impressed, he'll pay me more, sending the car's price up. Bingo, a higher sale price, and another bonus for me. \nOf course, the costs aren't sustainable, and the car was overpriced ??? but I don't care: I've received my bonus and I'm off to greener pastures. The car is someone else's problem now. \nChief executives are objectively paid too much money. There is a real issue of social equality at play. \nBut even when it comes to a purely financial transaction, the system is broken. The simplest fix - though chief executives the world over would complain bitterly - is to pay bonuses to chief executives based on the company results over the following five years. \nThat way, they're incentivised to set a company up for long-term success - not just put lipstick on a pig. \nScott Phillips is the Motley Fool 's director of research.

The planned 275-metre casino, hotel and apartment tower at Barangaroo will not cast a shadow across the Sydney Opera House that would have spoiled countless tourist photographs. \n\"Fortunately for us, the silhouette of that tower is not going to be an issue,\" Croker said. \"But if there was a tower proposed further to the north, it could be an issue because then you'd have a finger sticking up through the profile of the Opera House shells.\" \nCroker is concerned about any intrusion - upraised finger from a casino or otherwise - that would affect one of the world's great buildings, a World Heritage listed performing arts centre that attracts more than 8 million visitors and hosts 2000 performances a year. \nHe has written a new conservation management plan that details how the Opera House can be maintained and, when required, upgraded to fit the vision of brilliant Danish architect Jorn Utzon. \nIt sets out guidelines following Utzon's principles on everything from development around Sydney Harbour and major modifications to the building and surrounding areas right down to appropriate furniture, humidity control, lighting and housekeeping standards. \n\"The House is in very good order,\" Croker said. \"But there are some functional things which are not working as well as maybe they could. It's those issues we're trying to address in the conservation management plan.\" \nThe fourth plan in the building's history, titled Respecting The Vision , reveals a list of items considered \"visually intrusive\" that management is progressively eliminating. \nThey include the marquee on the northern boardwalk, acrylic panels on guard rails, picket fencing between the major halls, bitumen paving and flagpoles on the forecourt, carpet cladding on interior columns, maritime signs on the seawall and even a green history plaque. \nBecause Utzon wanted the peninsula to be \"a man-made landscape ... free of trees and flowerbeds/planters\", potted plants are out. \nThe report recommends replacing inappropriate chrome and black bar stools in the foyers with a more elegant design, possibly in bronze. \nAnd to preserve the striking impact of the Opera House's white-tiled sails, nothing else on the peninsula should be the same colour, even umbrellas, signs and temporary railings. \n\"Consider a smile, exposing a set of normal white teeth, where one tooth has been replaced with a very white one,\" Utzon once wrote. \"The original teeth will seem dull by comparison ... The shells lose some of their apparent whiteness when surrounded with materials that are whiter than themselves.\" \nThe report is so detailed that it declares door numbering should be in \"the original Helvetica medium typeface\" and new signage should be \"Neue Helvetica\". \nPossibly controversially, it recommends management reconsider allowing patrons to take drinks into venues other than the Utzon Room and the Studio because of the risk of damage to carpets, upholstery and finishings. \nThe report is released as the Opera House is part-way through $273 million worth of improvements, including an upgrade for the Joan Sutherland Theatre, which re-opens on New Year's Eve, and a new ballet rehearsal room. \nOpera House chief executive Louise Herron said work was \"100 per cent on track\" and had been carried out in accordance with the conservation management plan even before it had been finalised. \n\"It's a wonderful guide as we embark on these renewal works,\" she said. \nHerron described the Opera House as \"a masterpiece of human creative genius\" that was not just a passive building. \n\"It's not the Taj Mahal or the Eiffel Tower or the Pyramids,\" she said. \"It's a living, breathing performing arts centre. It was set up to be an active building. \n\"So [the question is] how do we marry its status as a passive marvellous icon with its active status as a performing arts centre without in any way stifling the creativity for which it was created.\" \nHerron said the plan would be followed when 80 new bollards were installed to boost security, replacing existing concrete blocks. Needless to say, they will not be white.

List Your Business Here \nThe Deuce is patient. Halfway through an eight-episode first season about the legalisation and growth of pornography in 1970s America, there are only hints of the industry that will soon signal vast economic and social change. What's apparent is a succession of vivid characters, distinctive but never merely sharp outlines, whose conversations and actions slowly but steadily reveal their inner lives. HBO's new drama is grounded by terrific, immersive writing. \nThat's to be expected when the creators are David Simon, who put together television's finest series, The Wire , and George Pelecanos, the crime novelist who became part of the same show's writing staff. The Wire used the Baltimore drug trade and its policing to diagnose American society's ills; here the cogs in the machine are sex workers, their pimps, and those who work the adjacent infrastructure that's part of life around a decidedly bleak Times Square. \n\"One ticket, one ride,\" a prostitute named Candy (Maggie Gyllenhaal) tells an overexcited client who thinks he didn't get value for money. As in The Wire, economic realities dictate the power structure that everyone has to work under. The difference is that The Deuce , which has a balance of women behind the camera and in the writers' room, is particularly attuned to its female characters. The street walkers compare notes, share opinions, and reveal themselves in ways that aren't simply defined by their professions. \n\"Y'all need to keep your lady business to yourself,\" complains one pimp, when discussion at a communal breakfast joint after a night's work turns to dealing with their periods, and The Deuce is frank about these women's bodies - and how they're used as means of production and earning - in unexpected and often telling ways. \nGiven the problems HBO has had with sexual violence in its flagship series Game of Thrones , a show about the sex trade could have been a disaster. There is a lot of sex here, sometimes as a sidenote barely in frame because the characters are inured to seeing it, but the prevailing aesthetic is neither glamorous nor prurient - the bodies that are often focused on are those of the clients, turning you back to the clash of motives that underpins these narratives. \nIt's a woman, university-dropout-turned-bartender Abby (Margarita Levieva), who asks one of the street walkers, Darlene (Dominque Fishback), why she chooses to work as she does in the service of a pimp, and like the show itself she doesn't have a simple answer. It illustrates the vagaries and flaws of human nature, whether through moments of solicitude or instances of brutality, but never tries to apply definitive answers. \nThe storytelling is strong enough to transcend the period setting. There's no affection applied to 1971 (although based on the garbage strewn and sometimes lawless blocks the setting could be 1671), and instead of nostalgia there's an acknowledgment that earlier times weren't innocent, they were fixed. Everything in this economy, legitimate or not, is marked by payoffs and skims. \nJames Franco plays twins, Vincent and Frankie Martino, respectively a skilled publican fronting for the mafia and an ebullient (if rarely ahead) gambler. While that allows Franco to work opposite his favourite actor, The Deuce never gets pinned down on the sibling's relationship. Frankie is a marginal presence, while Vincent's joint, the Hi-Hat, is a kind of ground zero for the neighbourhood where different classes and groups meet and drink; the most damage is done by drunken off-duty cops brawling. \nThe standout performance is from Gyllenhaal. With this and The Honourable Woman, it's proof that actresses often find substantial roles in television but not the movies. Shifting between Candy, who works in a blonde wig, and the off-duty Eileen, Gyllenhaal presents a woman whose independence - she has neither a pimp, nor the custody of her child - has taken her to the very edge. \nHer out, after a \"sunlighting\" session (where a nocturnal prostitute shoots a porn scene during daylight hours), is the adult movie business, which is both illegal and makeshift. \"I wanna learn how to make movies,\" Eileen tells a former director (David Krumholtz). That sense of discovery, allied with ambition, is a driving force in The Deuce . The show may be full of grimy joints and grim realities, but it also offers renewal and change. \nWHAT: The Deuce WHEN: 11am and 8.30pm, Mondays, on Showcase ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vincent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darlene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david simon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominque fishback", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gyllenhaal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david krumholtz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maggie gyllenhaal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankie martino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george pelecanos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margarita levieva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james franco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eileen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hbo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "baltimore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:52:07.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc3e90cb0f2b5f8a1e7b00d19cd000b56ad05252", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd3WmKQAKO8NBMkvaUBO6gi4uIkahD3PtENx8JbBIYMtQi.dqZX1jgL74Oyw96kVHPtXhoaul0Pfkk1HF52wpUM6UD1L8a7y45_ymbsjKkQeFJzhuO85alv0wD8_Zy0_rn_szXrGnqCwTGP0t5z6ZScJW9WE4_Imm9Wh6Y0.BMz4O", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "50-degree days possible for Sydney, Melbourne: research | The Daily Advertiser", "title_full": "50-degree days possible for Sydney, Melbourne: research | The Daily Advertiser", "published": "2017-10-03T12:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.017, "main_image": "http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/0c632f1e-48e1-4711-a3a5-3afb20df16c0.jpg/r0_67_729_479_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1891, "comments": 0, "shares": 1891}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dc3e90cb0f2b5f8a1e7b00d19cd000b56ad05252", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd3WmKQAKO8NBMkvaUBO6gi4uIkahD3PtENx8JbBIYMtQi.dqZX1jgL74Oyw96kVHPtXhoaul0Pfkk1HF52wpUM6UD1L8a7y45_ymbsjKkQeFJzhuO85alv0wD8_Zy0_rn_szXrGnqCwTGP0t5z6ZScJW9WE4_Imm9Wh6Y0.BMz4O", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Peter Hannam", "published": "2017-10-03T12:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "50-degree days possible for Sydney, Melbourne: research | The Daily Advertiser", "text": "List Your Business Here \nSydney and Melbourne can expect summer days when the mercury climbs to 50 degrees within a couple of decades if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, new research has found. \nThe study, led by Sophie Lewis at the Australian National University, analysed new models being prepared for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to examine the difference between a 1.5- and 2-degree warming limit compared with pre-industrial times. \nAt the upper end of the range - which would amount to a 1.1-degree rise from current global warming levels - NSW's record extremes would increase 3.8 degrees compared with existing records. Those in Victoria would rise by 2.3 degrees, the simulations showed. \nFor Sydney and Melbourne, populations could swelter in 50-degree weather even if the 2-degree global warming limit agreed in the 2015 Paris accord were achieved, according to the research co-authored by Andrew King from Melbourne University and published Wednesday in Geophysical Research Letters . \nThe current records for the two cities are 45.8 degrees for Sydney, set on January 18, 2013, and 46.4 degrees for Melbourne on Black Saturday, 7 February, 2009. Such hot days increase the risks of bushfires. \n\"If we warm average temperatures, we shift the whole distribution of temperatures, and we see a really large percentage increase in the extremes,\" Dr Lewis told Fairfax Media. \n\"What seems like a small increase in average temperatures, say 1 degree, can lead to a two- or three-fold acceleration in the severity of the extremes.\" Records smashed \nTemperature records are being broken frequently in Australia, with hot records 12 times more likely to be set than cold ones since 2000, Drs Lewis and King reported in a 2015 paper . \nA heatwave last month smashed many records across eastern Australia with more than half the NSW stations with more than 20 years of data registering their hottest September day, the Bureau of Meteorology said. \nUnder a high carbon emissions scenario, 50-degree days could arrive \"as early as the 2040s\", Dr Lewis said, adding that even with a concerted reduction in pollution, those temperatures could be reached by about 2060. \nDr King said hospitals, electricity systems and infrastructure would all struggle during such heat spikes. \n\"For summer heat extremes in the future, there probably aren't any winners,\" Dr King said. Reefs at risk \nAlong with other Australian regions which could see 50-degree days, the researchers also examined the temperature increases in the Coral Sea. \nEven with less variability than land, oceans are also seeing significant warming. For temperature-sensitive coral reefs, the past few years of ocean heatwaves has triggered mass bleaching including on the Great Barrier Reef. \nThe researchers estimated autumn extremes of 0.3-0.8 degrees above the devastating 2016 record in the Coral Sea with the lower target of the Paris accord. At the 2 degrees warming goal, the Coral Sea will warm 0.6-1.2 degrees above the 2016 extreme. \nDr Lewis said the recent bleaching had \"really smashed the reef\", killing as much as half the Great Barrier Reef corals. \n\"If that's occurring now and we have additional warming on top of that - which will lead to an increase in seasonal temperatures - then that's a real worry for whether we'll have a reef at all, she said. 'Startling speed' \nDr King was also a co-author of a separate paper out recently in Environmental Research Letters that examined the impact on Europe if global temperatures reached that 2-degree upper limit agreed at Paris. \nThe paper found a heatwave of the scale of 2003 which killed 70,000 Europeans rapidly becomes more likely as the planet warms. \n\"What is startling is the speed of the change,\" Dr King said. \"At 2 degrees, events like the 2003 heatwave could become so commonplace that they occur every second year.\" \nWhile trends in regional seasonal rainfall levels are less clear, a warming world is likely to make single-day extreme rainfall events more likely. In Britain's case, a repeat of the July 2007 severe flooding would be 70 per cent more likely at 2-degrees warming compared with current conditions, he said. Heatwaves by degrees \nIn a third recent paper by Australian-based researchers, published last week in Scientific Reports , Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick found the number of additional heatwave days will rise significantly depending on whether global warming is contained to 1.5 or 2 degrees, or beyond. \nThe research indicated heatwave days - based on a sequence of at least three consecutive days in the warmest 10 per cent for that date - will jump by an extra 14.8-28.2 per year for each degree of warming. \nThe heatwaves themselves will be 3.4-17.5 days longer per degree of global warming, with peak intensity of 1.2 to 1.9 degrees. \nIn the worst affected regions, such as parts of the tropics, summers will become a season-long heatwave, with large impacts on human health, productivity and ecosystems - even if warming can be kept to a global average of 2 degrees. 'Really awful' \nDr Perkins-Kirkpatrick, who is a research fellow at the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of NSW, said some of the biggest increases in heatwaves will occur in poor nations who burn relatively little fossil fuels. \n\"It makes it really awful,\" she said. \"They haven't done anything to deserve this, but these are the ones who are going to suffer the most.\" \nWhile rating only \"Buckley's chance\" of keeping warming to that 1.5-degree lower Paris goal, Dr Perkins-Kirkpatrick said the science indicates emissions to be limited as much as possible. \n\"The impacts are going to be bad and we're not going to stop it,\" she said. \"But it's never too late to try to change what we're doing.\" \nSee the interactive map below, showing projected impacts with each degree of warming for different parts of the world.

List Your Business Here \nAs universities grapple with a rise in contract cheating - which involves students outsourcing assessments - Australia's higher education watchdog has unveiled new guidelines to tackle the issue. \n\"Breaches of academic integrity have broad implications,\" Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency chief executive Anthony McClaran??? said. \nHe said cheating put the reputation of Australia's higher education system at risk, and could endanger employers and the integrity of qualifications. \nA recent survey by University of South Australia associate professor Tracey Bretag??? - who helped create the guidelines - found that 6 per cent of Australian students engaged in cheating. \nThe survey also revealed that 68 per cent of academics had encountered what they suspected was cheating. \nMr McClaran said cheating had become increasingly sophisticated. \nHe said \"well organised\" contract cheating websites were subcontracting out essays, and returning work, sometimes up to a postgraduate level, in a short period of time. \n\"Advances in information technology are enabling more clever and sophisticated ways of offering cheating services,\" Mr McClaran said. \n\"They are more widespread, more easily accessible, the cost ... seems to be coming down and it is leading to increased incidents.\" \nOther forms of cheating are also a concern. Students are using digital \"cheating\" watches to store data that is retrieved during exams and buying $600 hidden earpieces with Bluetooth connectivity. \nThe prevalence of contract cheating at Australian universities was brought into sharp focus during the MyMaster scandal uncovered by Fairfax Media. \nStudents paid up to $1000 for an assignment using the MyMaster company. But students engaged in contract cheating can pay as little as $50 for an assignment, with some advertising on sharing economy platform Airtasker . \nThe regulator's new guidelines highlight best practice, which includes barring students' from commercial cheat sites while on campus, and sending them a counter-message when they try to access the sites. \n\"They should receive a message such as: 'This site has been blocked because it is not a legitimate learning service', along with a link to the higher education provider's academic integrity resources,\" the document said. \nIt also recommends compulsory academic integrity training for students, and professional development for staff to help them identify contract cheating. \nIt says contract cheating is difficult to detect because it cannot be picked up through text-matching software like standard plagiarism. \nHigher education providers are also being urged to use the data they collect to identify contract cheating \"hot spots\" in faculties, courses and among certain assessments. \nThis would ensure that \"resources can be allocated in areas most prone to contract cheating\". \nThe regulator also recommended that universities consider publishing de-identified data about cheating investigations, which could be available to students and staff on its intranet. \nA similar initiative already takes place at Griffith University, which regularly publishes public data on breaches of academic integrity and disciplinary decisions. \nThe guide acknowledges that no type of assessment is immune to contract cheating. \nBut Dr Bretag's research found that reflections, oral defences of written work, assignments that relate to students' personal experience and supervised in-class assessments were less likely to be outsourced. \nThe work builds on new higher education standards, which came into effect at the start of the year. \nUniversities Australia chief executive Belinda Robinson said the new guide would help universities stamp out contract cheating. \nShe sent a strong message to students who were contemplating cheating. \n\"You will get caught and it will ruin your future prospects,\" she said. \n\"Is it worth the risk to your reputation, your qualifications and your future employment?\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "henrietta cook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bretag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tracey bretag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony mcclaran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcclaran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belinda robinson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fairfax media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of south australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tertiary education quality and standards agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "griffith university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eyre peninsula tribune move", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:03:33.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3946e28d53677f5d74892ed9317268a6754b3e65", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd6So0QrRW.upsxVNBwQqu0AMOd_JA1lU4Wfao0Bbr_wwQNaURHMd5N98PnejwrT6uutY.X.ZvN87Uxw8uVfpzbZXqglDEo3q9b8cCWZ7LnfJz4E2Fcuy9x.GNDM3wriA1Q--", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Office leasing markets in boomtime sweet spots", "title_full": "Office leasing markets in boomtime sweet spots", "published": "2017-10-03T16:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.016, "main_image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/y/t/c/9/7/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.gyt802.png/1507005352410.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 7}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3946e28d53677f5d74892ed9317268a6754b3e65", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd6So0QrRW.upsxVNBwQqu0AMOd_JA1lU4Wfao0Bbr_wwQNaURHMd5N98PnejwrT6uutY.X.ZvN87Uxw8uVfpzbZXqglDEo3q9b8cCWZ7LnfJz4E2Fcuy9x.GNDM3wriA1Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Carolyn Cummins", "published": "2017-10-03T16:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Office leasing markets in boomtime sweet spots", "text": "An offshore private investor has bought the heritage-listed 332 Kent Street office building for $25 million. Photo: Supplied \nInvestors have bought $67 million worth of office assets in key Sydney and Melbourne locations in the past week, as they get a foothold into the booming leasing markets. \nAn offshore investor has paid $25 million for the heritage-listed office tower at 332 Kent Street, Sydney, while the Hong Kong conglomerate, Glorious Sun, has paid $42 million for an eight-storey tower at 324 St Kilda Road, Melbourne. \nTim Grosmann and Graeme Russell of Savills Australia sold the Kent Street property, on behalf of Yachtsman Warwick Sherman and another private investor. The building sold on a 3.99 per cent yield, and a rate of nearly $16,000 per square metre. \nAccording to agents, competition among private buyers and institutions is very strong, given office vacancy along the eastern seaboard is at record low levels. \nCushman & Wakefield's third-quarter data reveals that in Sydney vacancy has continued to decline, with the premium rate compressing 300 basis points to 9.5 per cent, while A grade is at its lowest rate since mid-2008 of 3.6 per cent. \nSydney's prime gross effective rents sit at $916 a square metre, a rise of 6.9 per cent year-on-year.

It's happened again this week following Sunday's attack at a Las Vegas concert. \nFollowing deadly mass shootings in the United States, US gun stocks rise. List Your Business Here \nIt happened in December 2015 when two assailants killed 14 people and wounded 22 others in a shooting in San Bernardino. \nIt happened again in June 2016 when 49 people were killed and 58 injured in Orlando, Florida, after a gunman stormed into a packed gay nightclub. \nAnd it's happened again this week following Sunday's attack at a Las Vegas concert - the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history - which has so far taken at least 59 lives and injured more than 500 people. \nSince the election of US President Donald Trump - who made upholding the right to bear arms a central plank of his 2016 election campaign - fire-arm company stocks have been sluggish. \nBut following Sunday's attack, shares of US gunmakers jumped more than 3 per cent. By Monday, firearm manufacturing company Sturm, Ruger & Co, climbed 3.5 per cent. Smith & Wesson parent American Outdoor Brands, which makes and sells pistols, revolvers and rifles, finished up more than 3 per cent. And Vista Outdoor, which sells firearms and ammunition, was up almost 3 per cent. \nGary Kaltbaum, president of investment firm Kaltbaum Capital Management, said the rise in gun stocks is both due to the perception that gun controls could tighten and restrict the availability of weapons, as well as a belief that gun buying will pick up as Americans look to \"protect\" themselves. \nThe pain of the attack is also being felt at MGM Resorts International. MGM Resorts is owner of the Mandalay Bay resort, where the gunman, Stephen Paddock, 64, was staying and its shares fell almost 6 per cent following the attack. \nThe gunman who unleashed hundreds of rounds of gunfire on a crowd of concertgoers in Las Vegas attached what is called a bump-stock to two of his weapons, in effect converting semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic ones. Photo: AP \nPaddock, who opened fire on spectators at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, was reportedly able to take a series of firearms past security and up to his room at 32nd floor, where he was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. \nMGM's chairman and chief executive, Jim Murren said in a statement that the company was \"cooperating with law enforcement and taking actions to support the victims and their families, our guests and employees\". \nHeadquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, MGM also owns other properties in the iconic Las Vegas strip including Bellagio, ARIA, Vdara, MGM Grand, Delano Las Vegas, The Mirage, Monte Carlo, New-York New-York, Luxor, Excalibur, and Circus Circus. \nDrapes billow out of broken windows at the Mandalay Bay resort and casino Monday, Oct. 2, 2017, on the Las Vegas Strip following a deadly shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas. Photo: AP \nInstinet analyst Harry Curtis, said in a note to investors that the company was likely to see elevated cancellations over the next several weeks or months and higher security costs, but recommended investors hold onto the stock. \nShares of other casino operators also fell on Monday after the massacre. Wynn Resorts dropped almost 2 per cent. Caesars Entertainment Corporation pulled back 0.2 per cent. Las Vegas Sands also dipped before closing slightly higher on Monday. \nTourism to Las Vegas hit an all-time high of 42.9 million guests last year, a 1.5 per cent increase from 2015. Apart from the obvious detrimental tourism implications, the massacre has raised questions about hotel security and whether tougher measures are now needed. \n-with Bloomberg \nFollow Nassim Khadem on Facebook and Twitter .

an Australian first, a feasibility study into a seawater-pumped hydro project in South Australia's Spencer Gulf has found it could generate up to 225 megawatts of renewable energy, with a storage capacity of 1770 megawatt hours - more than 13 times the capacity of Tesla's South Australian battery system, 200 kilometres away. \nPumped hydro is being touted as the nation's most viable and powerful potential renewable energy source, with more than 22,000 possible pump storage sites already identified . \nAs this potential becomes increasingly apparent the focus is shifting from freshwater sources to utilising Australia's coastline for power. \nHowever, costs are higher compared to freshwater pumped hydro systems, with estimated capital costs forecast at about $2.1 million per megawatt of installed capacity., with operating costs of between $11 million and $12 million per year. Initial estimates forecast the power plant at Cultana in the Spencer Gulf would cost $477 million to build, and have a potential operational life of up to 30 years. \nThe study found the plant could go from standstill to full output within 90 seconds on a single unit, and to full load on the entire station within 150 seconds. \nFederal Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said the report was encouraging for further work on saltwater pumped hydro. \n\"The study shows that the Cultana project is technically feasible, can address the market need for energy firming to facilitate the growth of renewable energy in South Australia and is economically viable under a range of plausible scenarios,\" he said. \nThe study was carried out by a consortium comprising EnergyAustralia, Arup and the Melbourne Energy Institute, and funded in part by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA). \nIt investigated the use of seawater-pumped hydro due to the lack of freshwater sources in South Australia. \n\"The sewater-pumped hydro storage technology could be deployed widely across Australia,\" the ARENA report stated, \"especially where freshwater resources are limited, to support the growing share of renewable energy in the generation mix.\" \n\"A major advantage of seawater-pumped hydro energy storage is an abundant water supply in arid and semi-arid regions and no need for a lower reservoir.\" \nUnlike freshwater-pumped hydro energy systems, such as the Snowy Hydro, seawater systems have historically faced the issue of corrosion, operating in marine environments, and 'biofouling', which can limit the in-flows of water. \nCurrently, there has only been one operational seawater-pumped hydro plant in the world, the 30 megawatt Yanbaru Power Station, on Okinawa Island in Japan. It ran from 1999, after four years of testing, until it was decommissioned in 2016.

She is due back later this week. \nThe network also said that Paddock had reported 16 gambling wins of $10,000 in the two weeks before the shooting. Federal law in the US requires individuals to report casino winnings of more than $10,000 in a day. \nA picture has emerged of a gambling-obsessed retiree who was oddly stand-offish to friends and family but had made large amounts of wealth which he pumped back into poker hands, a small collection of investment properties, boat cruises, concerts, two airplanes and regular trips to Las Vegas. \nDanley was a keen gambler too, posting photos from Vegas gambling tournaments, including a stay at Mandalay Bay in 2014. \nAfter divorcing her husband of 22 years, she met Paddock in around 2014 and was known in their over-55s community in Mesquite, Nevada, as a friendly woman who liked Zumba classes. \nPaddock was described as a regular gambler, bordering on addict, in a 2012 civil case that he launched against the Cosmopolitan Casino, according to NBC News. He tried to sue the casino after he slipped on the floor and injured himself. However, CCTV showed that he either purposely slipped or fell out of his sandal and the case was dismissed. \nHis large financial transactions made in recent weeks - possibly $10,000 a day - suggest he was placing huge bets in the lead up to the massacre. It raises questions about whether he was also making huge losses.

In late September, two United Nations officials sent a strongly worded letter to the French government, denouncing the \"many restrictions to fundamental liberties\" that passing the law would entail. SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link A demonstrator holds a paper which reads, \"liberty, fragile\", during a protest against the state of emergency in Paris in September.

All of these occurred under the state of emergency. \nThe principal effect of Macron's new law, critics said, will likely be to enshrine in French law de facto discrimination against French Muslims, the country's largest minority. SHARE Investigative police officers work at a body outside Marseille 's main train station. Photo: AP \nAccording to data gathered by the Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF), a large advocacy organisation committed to fighting discrimination, earlier forms of the same security provisions have affected the Muslim community disproportionately. \nSince the imposition of the state of emergency in November 2015, authorities have carried out more than 4000 warrantless searches of French homes and placed more than 700 people under house arrest. \nAccording to the CCIF data, roughly 100 of those put under house arrest were Muslims, who account for an estimated 7 to 9 percent of the French population. The French government does not keep official statistics on race, religion or ethnicity. \n\"What was problematic and exceptional will now become problematic and normal,\" CCIF director Marwan Muhammad said in an interview. \nFor some legal experts, Macron's new law recalls a dark chapter in France's colonial past. \n\"This is the first time since the age of de Gaulle that French law will enshrine a provision that will de facto target French minorities,\" said Patrick Weil, a French constitutional scholar and a leading historian of French immigration. \nCharles de Gaulle headed a provisional post-war government from 1944 to 1946 and served as president of France from 1959 to 1969. \n\"It really is the most regressive attack on minorities since 1944, when de Gaulle abolished the Code de l'indig\u00e9nat,\" he said, referring to France's infamous colonial system of justice, originally from the late 19th century, which created an inferior legal status for subjects in North Africa, West Africa and Southeast Asia. \nFurthermore, the emergency powers that Macron has now enshrined into law were created in that colonial context. \nThey were first adopted in 1955, when the French government sought a fast means of enacting \"sharp, severe repercussions against Algerians\" to prevent unrest across the Mediterranean, said Benjamin Stora, a leading expert on France's colonial Algerian history. \nDuring the Algerian war that followed in the late 1950s and early 1960s, these same emergency powers figured in some of the most violent episodes in modern French history. \nIn what was dubbed the Paris massacre of October 1961, French police killed at least 200 Algerian protesters gathered at the Seine River - nominally for violating a curfew the emergency laws. The French government acknowledged the episode only in 1998, and the full number of victims remains unknown. \n\"The French today? They don't know that history,\" Stora said. He noted, however, that many of the terrorists implicated in recent attacks come from families that arrived in France as a result of decolonisation. \nAccording to Muhammad, the anti-discrimination activist, many French Muslims are well aware of the history of these special powers and see their official enshrinement in French law as a sign from the government that Muslims here matter less than other citizens. \n\"There is no coming back from this,\" he said. \nLate Tuesday afternoon, the new anti-terrorism law passed in the lower house of the French parliament with 415 of 577 total votes.

But 27 years after East and West Germany became one state, the optimism about their union has all but died. \nLess than two weeks ago, the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, won nearly 100 seats in Parliament on the back of strong support in eastern Germany. In the state of Saxony, the party - often blamed for inciting hatred and defending Nazi crimes - even came in first. SHARE Visitors walk along the former GDR border wall in Moedlareuth, Germany. Photo: AP \nNow, a new survey confirms what many in both the East and West of the country have long suspected: Germany still isn't truly unified, at least when it comes to the worldviews of its citizens. Only half the country agrees that Germans are a \"mostly unified people,\" and scepticism of German unity is especially prevalent in the states that once constituted the communist German Democratic Republic. \nEven as younger generations appear more optimistic about unity - 65 per cent of German youths 14 to 21 said they felt that the country had mostly grown together - attitudes are changing slowly, if at all. The percentage of people who agreed in the latest survey that Germans are mostly unified remained the same as it was 7 years ago. Related Articles What is the AfD, Alternative for Germany party? \nThe survey comes as divisions between western Germany and the formerly communist East are starting to crystallise more clearly again, reversing a decade in which reunification was mostly celebrated as a success. Die Welt am Sonntag , a centre-right German newspaper, led its front page Sunday with the headline: \"We have to talk about the East (but really). The results of the election show: We have sugarcoated the problems.\" \nThat provocative assertion appears to be shared across the political spectrum in many parts of western Germany. Eastern Germany still lags behind the western parts of the country in terms of its economic performance and unemployment rates, despite continuous financial assistance since reunification.

Amazon Web Services financial accounts show it earned $124 million in \"revenue\" in 2016 (compared with $31.7 million in the period April 22 to December 31, 2015, cited in the accounts). A breakdown of 2016 revenue from operating activities shows $7.5 million for external training and professional services and $117 million for inter-company support services. \nAmazon Web Services' final income tax expense was $2.67 millon, much of which is due to $3.4 million worth of share-based compensation, which is likely not tax deductible. It also has a $42.2 million current loan from a related party, but no information is provided. Could it be from the same Lux subsidiary? \nThe low city in Luxembourg City. Amazon has used the low-tax nation to reduce its tax bills. Photo: NYT Luxembourg loan \nAmazon also files accounts locally under \"Amazon Corporate Services\", which provides data-hosting services to Amazon Web Services. \nThe company has previously stated that \"Amazon Corporate Services Pty Ltd does not represent revenue from customers using AWS services, in Australia or any other region\". \nWhat we don't know yet is how, once Amazon start seriously selling here in Australia, it will be booked. Will it end up in tax havens? \nOnce again these accounts show hundreds of millions of dollars of related party transactions with subsidiaries offshore. \nIn 2016 the company received an inter-company loan from its Luxembourg company Amazon Europe Core Sarl for $146.4 million. It was classified as non-current as it is payable in April 2023. This followed an earlier inter-company loan from Amazon Overseas Holdings of $US149.6 million in 2015, which was repaid in 2016. \nAmazon did not respond to questions from Fairfax Media by deadline. Red flag alert \n\"The fact that it is from a Lux Amazon subsidiary is a definitely a red flag,\" says UTS Business School associate professor Roman Lanis. \n\"The corporate structure in Australia raises red flags and is similar to the other US tech/energy companies which we know have been accused/convicted of avoiding tax here. \n\"What we don't know is how will things change or what they will do when they start earning billions in revenue in Australia \u2013 that is, when they start selling their products here.\" \nAmazon is going to start selling to Australian consumers, but will it pay enough tax locally? Photo: Dhiraj Singh \nRevenue for Amazon Corporate Services was $317.5 million (up from $237 million for 2015, $147.2 million for 2014, $69.4 million for 2013). Profit was $39.8 million (up from $11.7 million for 2015). Its income tax expense was $13.1 million ($2.3 million for 2015). This resulted in net income of $26.7 million (loss of $13.9 million for 2015). Massive related party deals \nA breakdown of Amazon Corporate Services accounts shows massive related party service fees ($335.7 million in 2016, $247.7 million in 2015). \nIts accounts state: \"Data and support service fee revenue of the company represents fees received or receivable for services provided to a related company. Services include data, marketing, and other support services for Amazon Web Services, a company incorporated in the United States.\" \nData service fee revenue from related companies totalled $293 million in 2016, support service fee revenue from related companies was $18.3 million and rental income from related companies was $6.5 million in 2016. \nAmazon's 2016 annual report states \"as of December 31, 2016, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $US8.6 billion, which included undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the US of $US2.8 billion\". \n\"We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized (sic) to reduce our US taxable income.\" As of December 31, 2016, Amazon had about about $US608 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. \nAmazon has faced court battles overseas. Earlier this year it won a $US1.5 billion transfer pricing dispute in a US court. Global tax fights \nShould Amazon use its Luxembourg subsiduary to reduce its local taxes, and should the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) then try to pursue the company, a tough battle awaits. \nOn March 23 the US Tax Court ruled in favour of Amazon in a transfer pricing dispute, saying it was legal for the internet giant to channel its European sales through its low-tax Luxembourg subsidiary in 2005 and 2006, rather than America. Had it lost, Amazon could have faced a tax bill as high as $US1.5 billion and lower profits for future years. \nAmazon has also come under fire for halving the amount of UK corporation tax it paid last year while more than doubling turnover during the same period. Accounts filed by Amazon UK Services show the company was billed just \u00a37.4 million ($12.6 million) for 2016 compared with \u00a315.8 million in 2015. \nOnce a series of deductions had been added, Amazon UK Services actually received a \u00a31.3 million credit from the British authorities. \nFollow Nassim Khadem on Facebook and Twitter .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amazo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jeff bezos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nassim khadem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roman lanis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lux", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amazon.com", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ap amazon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amazon web services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhiraj singh  revenue for amazon corporate services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon overseas holdings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyt luxembourg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon europe core sarl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian taxation office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon corporate services pty ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fairfax media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "business am newsletter business am newsletter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lux amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us tax court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon corporate services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon uk services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uts business school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luxembourg city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luxembourg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delaware", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T23:02:09.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d15a508a5db383d3cae73391d17b09e7affbe2c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd5xZ9ENCxhIM035Mi5DgCFo8j0SyRUVDgD4wki5f17xkGZ3K77.pXgRbuRcZoMIXUrYREck6VQmUER1CYSYJFjShOl7R4SJTrx17_j.p0FXuD9i5pfSHye5U.DeofRVvRw--", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "http://feeds.smh.com.au/rssheadlines/top.xml#", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sydney Morning Herald RSS News Headlines", "title": "Catalan independence vote slammed by Spain's King Felipe", "title_full": "Catalan independence vote slammed by Spain's King Felipe", "published": "2017-10-04T09:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/y/t/r/r/n/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gytrrb.png/1507059989641.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 62, "comments": 0, "shares": 62}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d15a508a5db383d3cae73391d17b09e7affbe2c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd5xZ9ENCxhIM035Mi5DgCFo8j0SyRUVDgD4wki5f17xkGZ3K77.pXgRbuRcZoMIXUrYREck6VQmUER1CYSYJFjShOl7R4SJTrx17_j.p0FXuD9i5pfSHye5U.DeofRVvRw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T09:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Catalan independence vote slammed by Spain's King Felipe", "text": "Spain's King Felipe said that Catalan authorities have deliberately bent the law with \"irresponsible conduct\".

Conan O'Brien was devastated to realise how many times he's had to talk about mass shootings. Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers urged Congress to take action on gun control. Jimmy Fallon stayed true to his entertainment-first roots and had Miley Cyrus and Adam Sandler open the show with Dido's \"No Freedom.\" \n\"What's been particularly heartbreaking is other than the lives lost is how I feel like people are becoming more accustomed to this type of news, every single time,\" Noah said. \n\"I almost know how it's going to play out.

So, what, then, are we willing to do to combat \"pure evil?\" The answer can't be nothing. It can't. \nBritish-born James Corden said \"I come from a place where we don't have shootings at this frequency\", and added \"gun violence should not be a staple of American life\". \n\"I heard today a commentator on the news explaining that there is no real way to prevent lone wolf mass shootings like this. And forgive me, because I'm just a foreigner here and some of you feel I have no place to say this: But how does every other developed country do a better job of preventing these attacks? We can't be surprised that gun crime will always occur where there is such wide availability of guns. \n\"I saw a quote from Robert Kennedy that stayed with me today.

Global equities were generally in the green with some broad indices joining the charge led by US markets with record highs of their own. Meanwhile, volatility measures across asset class are going the way of the VIX \u2013 which is doing its best to normalise an extreme level below 10. While not all activity measures for risk-oriented asset classes (shares, commodities, rates, emerging market, FX, etc) are pushing nor even matching their lows for the year set a few months back, we are once again sinking into ever deeper levels complacency. It is hard for those in the financial industry or even individuals to yield to caution on valuations while market prices continue to inch higher. Yet, regardless of our risk tolerance or assessment how much more return can be squeezed out, remember that the more divergent value to price, the more disorderly the eventual reconciliation. \n1. Wall Street: In New York, equity markets were once again winning the adulation of the crowds with fresh record highs for headlines, but pace eased back. Looking across the major benchmark indexes, the Dow 30 rose 0.4% to 22,642; the S&P 500 advanced 0.2% to 2,535; and Nasdaq climbed 0.2% to 6,531. Even the broadest Russell 2000 hit a fresh record of 1,512 on an eight consecutive trading day advance to mark the most persistent pace since November 25th. Yet, looking behind these numbers, we find a VIX five days below 10 (28 days this year below the extreme threshold), an average true range from the SPX that is the lowest since January 2013 and volume that is nothing less than anemic. This speculative reach can surely persist, but it will also remain very exposed to unfavorable 'surprises'. \n2. RBA: The unchanged rate and policy statement by the RBA had something for everyone. However, the statement was not enough to fully satisfy those thinking that Philip Lowe would bring the RBA in the same hawkish line of thought as we've recently heard from the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England. The highlight of the statement was the view that a strong Aussie Dollar remained an impediment for the Bank's inflation target. The dovish comment quickly sent AUD/USD to the lowest level in a week at 0.7786 but was quickly bought up from these levels. While keeping the rate set at 1.5% since mid-2016, the trade-weighted AUD has risen nearly 12%, and the strength was the focus of the RBA. Forward-looking indicators of the AU economy are still encouraging such as the \"solid\" employment growth on the horizon and the gradually declining unemployment rate. However, as seen globally, the pickup in hiring has yet to left wages or reduce the burdensome household debt figures that are seen weighing on banks growth prospects. \n3. Dollar traders keep a close eye on Yellen: Last week, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen delivered a shock to the market when she offered up surprisingly non-neutral commentary on monetary policy. Otherwise very practiced at offering up a balanced view and good at sidestepping leading questions on policy and markets, Yellen purposely remarked that the central bank should also be mindful about moving too slowly to normalise monetary policy. Those remarks led to a substantially rally \u2013 but still tentative \u2013 rally from the Dollar. Nearly a week forward, progress has been made for the Greenback, but the recovery effort is still clearly nascent. It would be quite shocking were she to follow up with another unexpectedly pointed remark \u2013 unless it is corrective in nature \u2013 but traders should never write off the mere 'unlikely' or simply 'unexpected'. \n4. A global growth update via PMIs: The popular PMI and other sector-measure surveys that we see updated on a monthly basis are good proxies for GDP for most countries. Given their timeliness, they can offer a very useful fundamental clue into an otherwise slow-to-update quarterly figure from a government. Through Wednesday's session, we are looking at service and composite activity updates from Asia to Europe to the US. The CBA's PMI (competing with trade and retail sales figures due later) hit a 7-month low at the last update. Japan's figures have softened over the past four to six months. Most of the Eurozone figures are final readings, but Italy's figures are new and have generally sported a strong recovery trend while the UK's readings have softened again amid Brexit concerns. The United States' ISM report is perhaps the most important of these figures as the service sector accounts for nearly 75 percent of the world's largest economy's output. It is projected by economists to pass unchanged at 55.1 \n5. Australia dollar: Since accelerating higher against the USD mid-year, the Aussie will continue to look for support near 0.78. The overnight low on the perceived RBA jawboning after unchanged rates and the comment that the AUD strength is putting downward pressure on prices at 0.7786 was quickly rejected. Since the sharp run-up in July that aligned with the base-metals rally, 0.7800 has been a level that traders feel AUD/USD should not be sold further. The recent drop in the price of AUD/USD from above 0.8100 on September 20 to the current levels some 3% lower has been driven by the still-in-doubt resurgence of the US Dollar. By erasing early losses, 0.7800 can be looked to as steady support on the pair, and once China comes back online after the holiday, a bid in base metals may further support a continuation of AUD strength. Advertisement \n6. ASX: With a field of green behind it through the preceding market sessions, the ASX is set to open Wednesday higher \u2013 though with a relatively modest 0.3 percent tracking. A bounce would be welcome after the 0.5 percent slide through Tuesday's close. It has now been 97 trading days that the benchmark index has held to a very clear range which is unique among all major equity indexes across the globe. \n7. Commodities: The price of gold continues to fall back to earth as the US Dollar finds buyers who believe the Fed is going to keep their word on rate hikes in the coming years. Gold continues to hold near seven-week lows, and trading volume has been subdued with China celebrating their national holiday. The positive sentiment in global indices is also acting to suppress price in gold as Wall Street, SPX 500, and the Nasdaq also traded to intraday records on this week. The combination of risk-seeking sentiment and s strong dollar helped to push gold spot below the 100-DMA ($US 1,273) for the first time since July 20. Aluminum was able to snap a three-day losing streak on the LME on the drop in stockpiles on the LME helping to provide support for the fundamental bullish view. \n8.

The gaudy numbers mask serious flaws in the country's economic model . \nFirst and most obviously, the Australian economy is still far too dependent on \"houses and holes.\" During part of the typical business cycle, national income and prosperity are driven by exports of commodities -- primarily iron ore, liquefied natural gas and coal -- that come out of holes in the ground. At other times, low interest rates and easy credit boost house prices, propping up economic activity. These two forces have combined with one of the highest population growth rates in the developed world (around 1.5 per cent annually, driven mostly by immigration) to prop up headline growth.

Going by measures such as price-to-rent or price-to-disposable income, Australia's property market looks substantially overvalued. \nMeanwhile, GDP per capita has been largely stagnant since 2008. Australia's manufacturing industry, once a significant employer and an important part of the economy, has increasingly been hollowed out. The country's cost structure is high. Improvements in productivity have, as elsewhere, been lacklustre. Infrastructure is aging and unable to cope with the demands of a rising population, especially in major cities. Australia stands at 21st place in the 2017 Global Competitiveness Report. It ranks 15th in the World Bank's ease of doing business list.

Australia's total non-financial debt is over 250 per cent of GDP, up around 50 per cent since 2010. Household debt is currently over 120 per cent of GDP, among the highest proportions in the world. The ratio of household debt to income has nearly quintupled since the 1980s, reaching an all-time high of 194 per cent. Advertisement \nStagnant real incomes have contributed to the problem, as have high home prices and the associated mortgage debt. Despite record-low interest rates, around 12 per cent of income is now devoted to servicing all this debt. That's a third more than in 1989-90, when interest rates neared 20 per cent.

That figure ignores borrowing by state governments, which adds around 10 per cent to government debt levels. It also ignores contingent liabilities, such as implicit government guarantees. These relate primarily to Australia's large banking system, which accounts for over 200 per cent of GDP. In 2008, the government was forced to guarantee bank deposits and borrowing to ensure liquidity. In addition, governments implicitly bear a portion of the risk of private-public partnerships used to finance essential infrastructure and services, which can't be allowed to fail.

Budget deficits reflect an eroding tax base and an aging population, which is driving up health, aged care and retirement expenditures. \nThe high debt levels increase the risk of a banking crisis, which could be sparked by rising losses on real estate loans. Australia's especially vulnerable because of its dependence on foreign capital; foreign net debt tops 50 per cent of GDP, much of it borrowed by banks to cover the shortfall between loans and domestic deposits.

That compares with a 10.5 per cent increase in Sydney and a 12.1 per cent rise in Melbourne. \nBut Mr Lawless said an oversupply of apartments could have investors treading cautiously. \nIn September, the Reserve Bank of Australia said Brisbane was still at risk of a potential for an oversupply of apartments which would drag property prices lower. \nRBA assistant governor Luci Ellis then said second-hand apartments will likely fall in price as tenants move into newly built homes because they are nicer and rent is still low.

Its business is built on its mining services arms \u2013 processing, site operations and, increasingly, logistics. \nBut it also partners with mining companies to develop new assets , with a view to securing more services work and an equity stake in the new project which it would then sell once the operation is up and running. \nThat has in more recent times included lithium. Mineral Resources owns the Wodgina mine in the state's Pilbara region and a 43.1 per cent stake in the Mount Marion lithium mine in the state's south. \nMineral Resources shares closed at $16.94 on Tuesday, a far cry from the 90\u00a2 mark the company listed on the ASX at back in July 2006. \nOutside of Mineral Resources, Ellison is best known for having made what was then the most expensive purchase of an Australian house when he paid $57.5 million to fellow Rich Lister Angela Bennett for her Mosman Park riverside mansion in Perth in 2009. He also owns several other properties in Perth, and in nearby beachside locations. \nElliso n also holds several share investments.

But, he added, he \"sees no quick fixes either\". \n\"Both sides are radically opposed, and tensions could rise in the coming days if a declaration of independence is proclaimed.\" \nHe believes that Catalan separation could continue to weigh on the country's sharemarket. \"A combination of a minority government and the Catalan independence push might prevent Spain from making much-needed reforms, hence we remain shy of Spanish equities,\" he said. \nWhile there's been a bit of downward reaction for Spanish equities, the euro is little moved and the spread between Spanish and German bunds - often a signal of stress - remains average, Legg Mason affiliate Brandywine Global portfolio manager Richard Lawrence noted. \nThe movement within asset markets, or the lack of it, illustrates current market thinking on Spain \u2013 that it's a local rather than a national issue. \n\"We believe this particular issue in Spain is more about national identity than populism\u2014the struggle between Catalonia and Madrid has spanned centuries,\" Mr Lawrence said.

There is also the risk that buying could ramp up in the warmer spring weather or once a government has been formed Auckland.

Here's Satyajit Das: \nAustralia's record of 26 years without a recession flatters to deceive. The gaudy numbers mask serious flaws in the country's economic model . \nFirst and most obviously, the Australian economy is still far too dependent on \"houses and holes\". During part of the typical business cycle, national income and prosperity are driven by exports of commodities -- primarily iron ore, liquefied natural gas and coal -- that come out of holes in the ground. At other times, low interest rates and easy credit boost house prices, propping up economic activity. These two forces have combined with one of the highest population growth rates in the developed world (around 1.5 per cent annually, driven mostly by immigration) to prop up headline growth. \nYet a significant portion of housing activity is speculative . Going by measures such as price-to-rent or price-to-disposable income, Australia's property market looks substantially overvalued . \nMeanwhile, GDP per capita has been largely stagnant since 2008. Australia's manufacturing industry, once a significant employer and an important part of the economy, has increasingly been hollowed out. The country's cost structure is high. Improvements in productivity have, as elsewhere, been lacklustre. Infrastructure is aging and unable to cope with the demands of a rising population, especially in major cities. Australia stands at 21st place in the 2017 Global Competitiveness Report. It ranks 15th in the World Bank's ease of doing business list. \nAttempts to diversify the economy have had mixed results. Tourism and service exports , mainly of education and health services, have expanded significantly. But they're nowhere near replacing the revenues brought in by mineral exports.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "patrick commins", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sarah turner", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fink", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter braig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry fink", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark lennihan  good", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janet yellen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "asx", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "collection house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nz anz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bell potter trading", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaccord \u200bcommonwealth bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conservative party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ford motor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general motors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fairfax media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "redhill education", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pmi september fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "a2 milk co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aspen group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman apn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blackrock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs cml group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:41:58.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc667ad3845793767cbe2ebc153cc012de97d777", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xdz.dLOkmQLAqpAqKIg3dZgRmrMLMBQ4kpaPpwHRwSufqIf30CG3kNmQd0MMjb8DbGZwfIxlgoYucN2bEpGz8W2.fu._aU9ilfX0oJrGZPH0Xj5F7wbQvVKMq1kn_jfa4nossLD6Pa.gjM18QHl0Br8JOH9S7yfBrt_QqBIljQvp4", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "http://feeds.smh.com.au/rssheadlines/top.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sydney Morning Herald RSS News Headlines", "title": "WhatsApp lets paedophiles, gangsters operate beyond the law, UK says", "title_full": "WhatsApp lets paedophiles, gangsters operate beyond the law, UK says", "published": "2017-10-04T12:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/w/c/i/q/5/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gytsx2.png/1507069240597.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 22, "comments": 0, "shares": 22}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc667ad3845793767cbe2ebc153cc012de97d777", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xdz.dLOkmQLAqpAqKIg3dZgRmrMLMBQ4kpaPpwHRwSufqIf30CG3kNmQd0MMjb8DbGZwfIxlgoYucN2bEpGz8W2.fu._aU9ilfX0oJrGZPH0Xj5F7wbQvVKMq1kn_jfa4nossLD6Pa.gjM18QHl0Br8JOH9S7yfBrt_QqBIljQvp4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Guy Faulconbridge", "published": "2017-10-04T12:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "WhatsApp lets paedophiles, gangsters operate beyond the law, UK says", "text": "WhatsApp lets paedophiles, gangsters operate beyond the law, UK says Guy Faulconbridge twitter TWEET More \nBritain said WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption communication services allowed paedophiles and organised crime groups to operate beyond the reach of the law and called on the messaging service to move faster to help governments catch offenders. \nAfter four militant attacks in Britain that killed 36 people this year, senior ministers have stepped up demands over the past six months to make internet companies do more to suppress extremist content and allow access to encrypted communications.

SHARE British Prime Minister Theresa May in the House of Commons on Monday. Photo: PA \n\"I do not accept it is right that companies should allow them and other criminals to operate beyond the reach of law enforcement,\" Rudd said. \"We must require the industry to move faster and more aggressively. They have the resources and there must be greater urgency.\" \nWhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, and similar services let users communicate with pictures, video and text, using \"end-to-end\" encryption that can be read only with a key held on the user's device. Without access to the devices, security services cannot read the messages. \nRudd also called on technology giants such as Facebook , Google, Microsoft and Twitter to go further and faster to counter extremist material. \nThe industry argues that encryption is vital to protecting the wealth of personal information that electronic devices collect about individuals and for securing everything from banking and shopping to government records. They say they need to balance demands by law enforcement with privacy protections. \n\"Child exploitation has absolutely no place on our service, which is why we work with law enforcement to identify these accounts and block them,\" the WhatsApp spokeswoman said. \nBritain's MI5 security service has said it needs access to encrypted communications to foil attacks. In the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has pushed for full access to encrypted communications and devices, but Congress has so far refused. \nThe issues are hotly debated even among security officials. Jonathan Evans, who ran Britain's MI5 spy service from 2007 until 2013, said that while encryption did make attacks harder to stop, it also helped to prevent criminals and even foreign governments from hacking private data. \nSecurity Minister Ben Wallace, who oversees British counter-terrorism and communications data legislation, said he was disturbed to see that end-to-end encryption services prevented security services from tracking criminal messaging. \n\"We see on a daily basis that this end-to-end encryption protects paedophiles, it protects organised crime too, but it is very disturbing in my job when I know that we know two paedophiles are talking and we think they are doing something about snatching a child but we don't know and we can't get into these communications,\" Wallace said. \n\"There are other ways I can't talk about which we think they can help us more without necessarily entering into end-to-end encryption.

The Premier announced the NSW Government will introduce new laws to keep potential terrorists in jail. (AAP Image/Dan Himbrechts) NO ARCHIVING Privacy advocates have lashed a proposal by the Turnbull government that would see state and territory leaders hand over the identities of millions of Australian drivers in a bid to toughen national security laws. NSW and Victoria became the first two states to give in-principle support for the use of the technology ahead of the Council of Australian Government meeting in Canberra on Thursday. The backing of the country's two most populous states opens the door to changes that would allow authorities to identify any Australian with a driver's licence in seconds using facial recognition scanners in public spaces. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull confirmed on Wednesday the technology could soon be used in areas such a shopping malls, airports and other crowded areas. \"It is hard to see how this would comply with international law,\" said Adam Molnar, a lecturer in criminology at Deakin University. \"It is mass undifferentiated surveillance that can be used regardless of innocence and no participation in a criminal activity.\" Mr Molnar, a member of the Australian privacy foundation, said the proposal did not allow for consent from people to hand over their biometric information when they were in public. \"There is no opt-out for this, so in a criminal justice context, this breaks down the conventional notion of a probable cause for stop and search powers,\" he said. \"There has been a long standing clause for law enforcement that they have to have a probable cause to conduct a search. This runs dangerously close if not over that line.\" Mr Turnbull said he was \"determined to keep Australians safe,\" after announcing a suite of other new national security proposals on Wednesday, including detaining terrorism suspects for 14 days without charge, and new laws that would make it an offence to possess \"instructional terrorist material\" and make terrorism hoaxes.

Graffiti has appeared overnight, proclaiming, \"We are not Spanish.\" \nCrowds have marched past gawking tourists, singing, \"I am, I am, I am Spanish.\" SHARE Link Two Spaniards wearing a Spanish flag and a Catalan independence flag, walk along the street in Barcelona. Photo: AP \nOne thing that unites them is that they have very little idea what an independent Catalonia would look like. Would it be readmitted to the European Union? Would it use a new currency? Would trade plummet? Would they be separated from their family members in Spain? \nIn the turbulence over Sunday's referendum, there had been surprisingly little public debate about the practical effect of declaring independence. Spain's heavy-handed response made the referendum into a battle over the right to vote, an issue over which there is far greater consensus in Catalonia. Related Articles War of words follows Spain's separatist vote \nNow that pro-independence Catalans have voted, those who stayed home are asking: What just happened? And what happens now? \nIn interviews across Barcelona this week, many expressed confidence that the fuzzy details of statehood could be worked out. But an equal number were apprehensive, even alarmed, at the plunge toward independence the referendum set in motion. Advertisement \n\"Explain it to me: If I stay here, would there be advantages or disadvantages?\" asked Loli Risco, 59. \"They are not explaining anything.

SHARE A man shouts while holding up a scarf reading 'Catalunya' during a pro-independence demonstration . Photo: Bloomberg \nCatalan leaders declared that 90 percent of voters supported separation, a result that made it clear that almost the only people motivated to vote were the ones who wanted independence. \nYet, like Risco and her daughter, more than half of Catalonia's eligible voters did not vote or brave the police who used truncheons and rubber bullets to enforce the central government's order to stop a referendum it considered illegal. SHARE A man with the Catalan flag painted on his face attends a demonstration downtown Barcelona, Spain.

SHARE Anti Catalan independence demonstrators carry a Spanish flag as they march in Barcelona, Spain. Photo: AP \n\"They didn't vote. They had the chance. They shouldn't complain now,\" Aguro said. \nEconomists generally agree that Catalonia would be economically viable as an independent country, but they differ on the impact on jobs, barriers to trade and the spending needs of the new state. \nThe separatist government would have to negotiate thorny issues with Spain, such as how to apportion Spain's debt, now equivalent to just over 100 per cent of its gross domestic product. \nXavier Sala-i-Martin, an economist and professor at Columbia University who has spearheaded the separatist drive, contends that a unilateral departure of Catalonia could leave Spain solely responsible for its debt. \nCatalan's separatist government, which published a \"white book\" outlining plans for an independent state in 2014, said Catalonia would assume a portion of the debt if Spain agreed to transfer state-owned infrastructure and other assets to the separatist government. \nThe separatist government proposes replacing Spain's army with its own, estimating the cost at 350 million euros, or about $411 million, a year. \nBut that estimate, like almost every other, has been challenged by economists as too optimistic; Josep Borrell and Joan Llorach note that NATO's annual membership fee alone is 3 billion euros, or roughly $3.5 billion. \nSevi Rodriguez Mora, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, calculates that added barriers to trade between Catalonia and the rest of Spain would cause a 10 per cent drop in the region's gross domestic product. But he added that economic arguments had been pushed to the margins of the debate. \n\"Economics is a sideshow, used by one side or the other as propaganda,\" he said. \"Everything is about identity politics. It's a definition of 'us.'\" \nMany young activists -- the core of the movement's public support -- expressed serene confidence that added tax revenue would more than make up for the drop in trade, even if Catalonia was forced to remain outside the European Union. \nGala Cabre, 16, was sitting outside Barcelona's Museum of Contemporary Art, where skateboarders clattered across the plaza, and said Catalonia would thrive as a small, wealthy enclave. Her point of comparison was Andorra. \n\"Andorra is an independent country that has its own currency,\" Cabre said, as her friends nodded encouragement. (Actually, it uses the euro.) \"Everything is cheaper there. Andorra has a lot of police. It's a very safe country.\" \nShe and her friends, who planned to spend Tuesday \"screaming and saying what we want\" during a regionwide general strike, also felt sure that the European Union would ultimately welcome Catalonia, even if Spain opposed it. \nDona Barragin, 17, said various European powers, like Germany and Britain, had quietly signalled their support. \"Maybe they have not told us officially, but they support us,\" she said. \"Inside, they support us.\" \nEuropean Union leaders have in fact been reluctant to embrace Catalonia's cause for fear of fuelling broader separatist forces in the bloc and its member states. \nThe depth of support for independence even in Catalonia is hotly disputed. Opinion polls, although of uncertain reliability, have shown a split in opinion that hovers around 50 per cent. \nIn 2012, for the first time, 51.1 percent of respondents favoured independence, according to the Centre d'Estudis d'Opinio, the official Catalan polling agency. In the most recent regional parliamentary elections, in 2015, 48 per cent of voters cast their vote for pro-independence parties. \nRodriguez said the split in opinion correlated with income, with villagers and affluent urbanites generally in favour of independence, while working-class urbanites, many of whom have roots in other parts of Spain, opposed it. \nAlberto Vallespin, 44, who owns a locksmith's shop in central Barcelona, is from an old Catalan family but worries about the effect on his business, which has suppliers and customers in other parts of Spain. \nSeparation could mean additional taxes on those transactions, Vallespin said, especially if the process is rancorous. And he dismissed the idea that the European Union would accept Catalonia anytime soon. \n\"Things won't be better\" if Catalonia wins independence, he said. \"And they may be worse.\" \nBut Vallespin had not taken part in the referendum, or gone out to demonstrate or closed his shop for the general strike Tuesday. He had customers lined up at the counter. \nHe was part of a vast city that carried on as usual all week, while the chanting crowds marched past. \n\"In the end, the people fighting are the ones who support independence,\" said Gemma Martin, 33, a cashier at a crystal shop in the old city. \"The rest of us are just watching.\" \nNew York Times", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ellen barry", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "alberto vallespin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josep borrell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sevi rodriguez mora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gala cabre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aguro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cabre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gemma martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dona barragin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xavier sala-i-martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joan llorach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noemi aguro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "risco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodriguez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vallespin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loli risco", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "columbia university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catalans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fairfax media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg  catalan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catalonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andorra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "risco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona's museum of contemporary art", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T03:15:40.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53471c63dba83344cbfd514152058168fef35434", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd6So0QrRW.upZjU7tiGozZEGD0VEO1fua7GZ3dY9VcGVYwano3hPKW9fShcuikipm91vxKtQ_ATMcjxRVHnMtnV9aBfygZq3tzsLdNU0mvog9Ebs2jnuoqA8QhQUm3KJ6itzg38cAhIz", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "'Red flags': why the taxman needs to worry about Amazon | Illawarra Mercury", "title_full": "'Red flags': why the taxman needs to worry about Amazon | Illawarra Mercury", "published": "2017-10-03T22:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.565, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 218, "comments": 0, "shares": 218}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 45}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "53471c63dba83344cbfd514152058168fef35434", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd6So0QrRW.upZjU7tiGozZEGD0VEO1fua7GZ3dY9VcGVYwano3hPKW9fShcuikipm91vxKtQ_ATMcjxRVHnMtnV9aBfygZq3tzsLdNU0mvog9Ebs2jnuoqA8QhQUm3KJ6itzg38cAhIz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nassim Khadem", "published": "2017-10-03T22:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "'Red flags': why the taxman needs to worry about Amazon | Illawarra Mercury", "text": "'Red flags': why the taxman needs to worry about Amazon Nassim Khadem 4 Oct 2017, 6:02 a.m. As local retailers worry about the arrival of Amazon destroying their business, the taxman will need to start worrying about how Amazon is going to work to minimise its tax bills. \nAs local retailers worry about the arrival of Amazon destroying their business, the taxman will soon need to start worrying about how Amazon is going to work to minimise its tax bills. List Your Business Here \nThe company, headed by billionaire Jeff Bezos with a $US460 billion ($589 billion) market valuation counts almost all its income outside the United States. It largely ends up in a Luxembourg company, Amazon EU Sarl, which is why the internet giant has come under constant fire from regulators . \nAmazon has filed local accounts in Australia that show the bulk of revenue that flows to and from Amazon Web Services locally, is actually sourced from, and paid by, related parties offshore. This is a tax structure similar to those adopted by other technology companies, including Facebook, Google, Uber and Airbnb. \nWhat we don't know yet is how revenue will be booked once Amazon starts seriously selling here. Amazon's tax structure \nWhat we do know is Amazon.com, which employs 341,400 staff with its main offices located in Seattle, Washington, is incorporated in low-tax Delaware. The business is divided into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). \nIn Australia, Amazon files under the banner of Amazon Web Services. It effectively treats Australia as a marketing operation. \nIts 2016 accounts state so: \"Revenue of the company represents fees received or receivable for support services provided to external third parties and to related companies. Support services include marketing, training and professional services ...\" \nWhile Amazon made a loss, it did pay some tax in Australia. Amazon Web Services financial accounts show it earned $124 million in \"revenue\" in 2016 (compared with $31.7 million in the period April 22 to December 31, 2015, cited in the accounts). A breakdown of 2016 revenue from operating activities shows $7.5 million for external training and professional services and $117 million for inter-company support services. \nAmazon Web Services' final income tax expense was $2.67 millon, much of which is due to $3.4 million worth of share-based compensation, which is likely not tax deductible. It also has a $42.2 million current loan from a related party, but no information is provided. Could it be from the same Lux subsidiary? \nThe low city in Luxembourg City. Amazon has used the low-tax nation to reduce its tax bills. Photo: NYT Luxembourg loan \nAmazon also files accounts locally under \"Amazon Corporate Services\", which provides data-hosting services to Amazon Web Services. \nThe company has previously stated that \"Amazon Corporate Services Pty Ltd does not represent revenue from customers using AWS services, in Australia or any other region\". \nOnce again these accounts show hundreds of millions of dollars of related party transactions with subsidiaries offshore. \nIn 2016 the company received an inter-company loan from its Luxembourg company Amazon Europe Core Sarl for $146.4 million. It was classified as non-current as it is payable in April 2023. This followed an earlier inter-company loan from Amazon Overseas Holdings of $US149.6 million in 2015, which was repaid in 2016. \nAmazon did not respond to questions from Fairfax Media by deadline. Red flag alert \n\"The fact that it is from a Lux Amazon subsidiary is a definitely a red flag,\" says UTS Business School associate professor Roman Lanis. \n\"The corporate structure in Australia raises red flags and is similar to the other US tech/energy companies which we know have been accused/convicted of avoiding tax here. \n\"What we don't know is how will things change or what they will do when they start earning billions in revenue in Australia - that is, when they start selling their products here.\" \nAmazon is going to start selling to Australian consumers, but will it pay enough tax locally? Photo: Dhiraj Singh \nRevenue for Amazon Corporate Services was $317.5 million (up from $237 million for 2015, $147.2 million for 2014, $69.4 million for 2013). Profit was $39.8 million (up from $11.7 million for 2015). Its income tax expense was $13.1 million ($2.3 million for 2015). This resulted in net income of $26.7 million (loss of $13.9 million for 2015). Massive related party deals \nA breakdown of Amazon Corporate Services accounts shows massive related party service fees ($335.7 million in 2016, $247.7 million in 2015). \nIts accounts state: \"Data and support service fee revenue of the company represents fees received or receivable for services provided to a related company. Services include data, marketing, and other support services for Amazon Web Services, a company incorporated in the United States.\" \nData service fee revenue from related companies totalled $293 million in 2016, support service fee revenue from related companies was $18.3 million and rental income from related companies was $6.5 million in 2016. \nAmazon's 2016 annual report states \"as of December 31, 2016, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $US8.6 billion, which included undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the US of $US2.8 billion\". \n\"We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized (sic) to reduce our US taxable income.\" As of December 31, 2016, Amazon had about about $US608 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. \nAmazon has faced court battles overseas. Earlier this year it won a $US1.5 billion transfer pricing dispute in a US court. Global tax fights \nShould Amazon use its Luxembourg subsiduary to reduce its local taxes, and should the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) then try to pursue the company, a tough battle awaits. \nOn March 23 the US Tax Court ruled in favour of Amazon in a transfer pricing dispute, saying it was legal for the internet giant to channel its European sales through its low-tax Luxembourg subsidiary in 2005 and 2006, rather than America. Had it lost, Amazon could have faced a tax bill as high as $US1.5 billion and lower profits for future years. \nAmazon has also come under fire for halving the amount of UK corporation tax it paid last year while more than doubling turnover during the same period. Accounts filed by Amazon UK Services show the company was billed just ??7.4 million ($12.6 million) for 2016 compared with ??15.8 million in 2015. \nOnce a series of deductions had been added, Amazon UK Services actually received a ??1.3 million credit from the British authorities. \nFollow Nassim Khadem on Facebook and Twitter .

List Your Business Here \nIt centres on the prosecution of one Russell Goullet who, in the words of Judge Michael McInerney, was a \"Svengali-like figure who manipulated financial institutions\". \nThe judge's exasperated sentencing remarks are a rollicking ride that should serve to illustrate how easy it is to get away with dishonest behaviour ... at least for quite a while. \nThe Victorian County Court judge gave slaps to all involved, including the big lenders. According to the remarks, the trouble really set in for Goullet in 2009 when he needed a way to keep running his business after being make bankrupt. \nEnter Jay Schulz - a 22-year-old injury-struck defender at the now champion Richmond Tigers AFL club and about to transfer to Port Adelaide. \nHe invested $150,000 in Mr Goullet's business. Let's cross to the judge. \n\"The naivet?? of that investment is best explained when one contemplates ... that he anticipated receiving, as a result of such investment of $150,000, $100,000 per annum,\" the judge says in the remarks. \nSchulz also found himself in the \"elevated\" position of the sole director and shareholder of both companies. \n\"No doubt he felt that was very important and was told by Mr Goullet how important that was. The problem and the reality was, the only reason he was in that position was because Mr Goullet, a failed businessman and a bankrupt, could not hold a corporate position.\" \nNot too long after, Schulz agreed to guarantee a $1 million loan from Westpac which, the judge says, was granted in less than rigorous circumstances. \n\"How and who approved the loan from Westpac is a matter, in my view, that should be investigated, if not by the authorities, by Westpac themselves. I wonder what the shareholders would think of Westpac actions in such circumstances. I make the point, this is post the world financial crisis,\" he says. \nStill Goullet's web of companies were barely afloat, so what to do? Get a credit card, of course. \n\"Hence, the idea to utilise AMEX to obtain short-term relief for the company. That is an amazing phrase, when you think about it.\" \nThe first charge on the AMEX was not to sort out wages but to settle a $25,000 debt on Goullet's Mercedes. \nGoullet, the judge went on, then used the corporate AMEX to purchase boat motors from America \"to continue the entitled lifestyle of himself and his [girlfriend]\". \nAdd to that a $9000 family holiday at Hayman Island. \nNext on the menu was a mortgage from the ANZ for a Porsche using forged documents. \nGoullet described a company to the bank that was turning over $4 million a year, pumping out a profit of almost $800,000, and a backer, Schulz, in rude financial health. \n\"Both of such corporate and individual financial documents being false, none of them were apparently ever independently checked by ANZ,\" the Judge says. \nHe also got ANZ to spring for a forklift. \nWhen Schulz complained that Westpac wouldn't lend him money for property, Goullet switched Schulz out as guarantor on Westpac's $1 million and installed an employee instead. \nThis employee had, in the words of the judge, \"no assets, or personal trading history\" yet Westpac happily signed it over - but not before one of its staff inspected an accursed machine at the centre of the enterprise. \n\"In what is an absolutely remarkable photo ... there is the representative in the exhibit photo, smiling and looking at the machine,\" the Judge says. \nThe employee was soon bankrupted and their \"business\" liquidated, with Westpac never recouping its money. The machine in the picture was \"valued as essentially being worthless\". \n\"Again, no doubt Westpac shareholders would be outraged to find the bank involved in such intemperate financial dealing and being so easily duped by Mr Goullet.\" \nBy early 2012, Schulz had enough.

Another firearm sits in the hallway on a bipod, used for stability when firing at targets. \nPhotos and footage emerged on Wednesday offering a glimpse inside the hotel room that unleashed the deadliest shooting in modern US history. \nRetired accountant and multi-millionaire gambler Stephen Paddock, 64, checked into Room 32135 at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on Thursday. It was a hotel that both he and his girlfriend, Australian-Filipino grandmother Marilou Danley, had stayed in before on their regular trips to the famous Strip. \nFootage obtained by the New York Post show double doors to the suite blown off their hinges and a couch pressed up against the door. Yellow crime scene tape remains criss-crossed across the door. \nInside, an assault rifle on a bipod is seen sitting on the carpeted floor with an evidence marker numbered 19. \nIt is one of 22 rifles and one handgun brought into the double-room suite by Paddock over four days. Police believe he brought them through the hotel concealed in more than 10 suitcases. Some had been modified into fully automatic rifles using bump-stock devices. \nTwo photos shared by a Boston 25 journalist show another two military-grade assault rifles lying on the carpet amid bullets, optics and a bipod. \nA small hammer can be seen, possibly the one used to smash open two windows in the suite and aim on the festival crowd below. He fired incessantly for about 15 minutes on the crowd gathered for the Route 91 Harvest country music festival. \nOn Wednesday, the death toll stood at 59 and the injured at 527. EXCLUSIVE: these are 2 of 23 guns found in #LasVegas shooter's hotel room at #MandalayBay - hammer, bipod, optics, ammo. 59 lives. Chilling. pic.twitter.com/gManlUIeZI ??? Jacqui Heinrich (@JacquiHeinrich) October 3, 2017 At one point, the shooter managed to unleash 280 rounds in only 31 seconds, according to reports https://t.co/A4W3Odoofg ??? New York Post (@nypost) October 3, 2017 \nA few more details on the gunman trickled out on Wednesday morning yet a possible motive remains a mystery. \nMSNBC has reported that Paddock wired $100,000 to the Philippines in recent days, the country that his 62-year-old girlfriend was born in and still visited. \nThe network reported that the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sherriff Joe Lombardo was incorrect when he said that Danley was located by police in Tokyo immediately after the shooting. \nLombardo later told a press conference Daley was in the Philippines, authorities were in contact with her and hoped to have more information soon. \nJonathan Neighbors, 15, adds light to one of the 59 luminaries set on the front steps of Greene Memorial United Methodist Church for victims of the shooting Photo: Heather Rousseau \nThe network said she left the US on September 25 for the Philippines, travelling via Hong Kong. She is due back later this week. \nThe network also said that Paddock had reported 16 gambling wins of $10,000 in the two weeks before the shooting. Federal law in the US requires individuals to report casino winnings of more than $10,000 in a day. \nA picture has emerged of a gambling-obsessed retiree who was oddly stand-offish to friends and family but had made large amounts of wealth which he pumped back into poker hands, a small collection of investment properties, boat cruises, concerts, two airplanes and regular trips to Las Vegas. \nDanley was a keen gambler too, posting photos from Vegas gambling tournaments, including a stay at Mandalay Bay in 2014. \nAfter divorcing her husband of 22 years, she met Paddock in around 2014 and was known in their over-55s community in Mesquite, Nevada, as a friendly woman who liked Zumba classes. \nPaddock was described as a regular gambler, bordering on addict, in a 2012 civil case that he launched against the Cosmopolitan Casino, according to NBC News. He tried to sue the casino after he slipped on the floor and injured himself. However, CCTV showed that he either purposely slipped or fell out of his sandal and the case was dismissed. \nHis large financial transactions made in recent weeks - possibly $10,000 a day - suggest he was placing huge bets in the lead up to the massacre. It raises questions about whether he was also making huge losses.
