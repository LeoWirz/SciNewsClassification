The top two leading causes of death in the U.S. are heart disease and cancer. Shockingly, a recent analysis has conveyed that the third leading cause of death in the U.S is among those that is reversible and highly unrecognized. So you\u2019re wondering what it is? Read on! First we\u2019ll give you the good news\u2014it\u2019s a cause that we can do something about! The bad news is that this preventable factor is being blamed on an estimated 251,454 hospital deaths per year in the U.S. According to a recent analysis appearing on May 3, 2016 in The BMJ , the third leading cause of death is medical error. Why Medical Error Deaths Go Unnoticed Death certificates in the U.S. have no provision for medical error due to the lack of an International Classification of Disease (ICD) code used by the U.S. and 116 other countries. In other words, there\u2019s nowhere for it to be officially documented! A commonly cited report from 1999 estimates that there are 44,000 to 98,000 annual U.S. deaths due to medical error. However, these data are limited and outdated. 1 Using studies dating back to the same year, researchers calculated an average number of hospital deaths due to medical errors of 251,454 people in 2013. This figure greatly underestimates the true number of lives lost to medical errors due to the limitation of available data that is documented in health records (along with the exclusion of outpatients). How Medical Errors Compare to Other Causes of Death The calculated medical error deaths of 251,454 is lower than the 611,000 heart disease deaths and the 585,000 deaths attributable to cancer. However, mortality due to medical errors is significantly higher than that of the next most common cause, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), at an estimated 149,000 deaths per year. Another startling statistic is that deaths from motor vehicle accidents, which averaged 34,000 in 2013, were just about 14% of the number of deaths caused by medical error\u2026but we\u2019re so thorough about the safety our vehicles. Why aren\u2019t we just as (or more) cautious of how our bodies are being cared for? The Common Types of Medical Errors Researchers define medical errors as unintended actions of commission or omission; acts that fail to achieve their intended outcome; errors in carrying out an intended action; use of wrong plans to achieve goals; and deviations from the process of care. They note that harm from medical error can occur at an individual or at a system level. How To Prevent Medical Errors The authors of the current analysis point out three strategies for decreasing the rate of medical errors: Make errors more visible so that their effects can be intercepted. This requires increased review of adverse events, accompanied by communication of information between departments. Have remedies readily at hand to prevent or treat the consequences of medical errors. Follow principles that take human limitations into account in order to reduce error frequency. Researchers recommend that death certificates contain a field in which complications related to care that contributed to the patient\u2019s death can be entered. Another potential strategy is to instill routine investigations to determine what the main contributors to medical error deaths are. This way the areas that may be lacking can be appropriately addressed to be brought back up to par (and kept there with follow-up investigations). The Bottom Line The unsettling issue of medical errors shouldn\u2019t remain hidden. Giving more recognition to the role of medical error in patient death can lead to heightened awareness, increased preventative action, and ultimately save millions of lives!

The case of the Alzheimer's disease vaccine \nEuropean Pharmaceutical Review 10-03-17 \nIn the year 1633, the Roman Catholic Inquisition decided after investigating the facts that the Heliocentric Theory was absurd and declared its champion the Italian polymath Galileo Galilei , considered by many the Father of Modern Science, a heretic. 1 Actually, his theory was correct - what was wrong were the geocentrists' arguments, based on faith and flawed science. Hence, his work was placed in the 'List of Prohibited Books' or the 'Index', curtailing the progress of science. Indeed, the Galileo's affair is a historical lesson that warns scientists against accepting or rejecting facts without scrutinising their validity - a piece of advice that has helped to advance science and prevent the perpetuation of errors. \nIn scientific areas dealing with living organisms, because of their complexity there should be a constant review of studies' assumptions and results. Consequently, areas like drug development have benefited by learning from prior errors, identifying their reasons and ways to resolve them. This requirement is more critical in new areas, lacking significant depositories of past information to tap. But, a rational approach to drug development does not mean focusing solely on one strategy while ignoring other alternatives. A process that benefits from the knowledge of different areas, such as drug development, is largely the result of a multidisciplinary scientific approach, rather than a monolithic one. \nEvidently, the lessons from the advances in medicinal chemistry over the last 200 years have resulted in a revolution in drug development, with antibiotics being a good example of the success of the trial and error approach. Areas like cancer and antiviral drugs have also shown similar successful growth using the same approach. However, that long-term learning curve has not taken place in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where due to a sudden increase in the ageing population, a result of the success of modern medicine in extending our lifespan, humanity faces now an epidemic of a disease that was rare not long ago. \nThis critical situation is evident in the attempts to develop products based on immunological approaches, like vaccination and antibody therapy, to treat, prevent or delay the onset of AD. This strategy is supported by various reports describing the protective effects of natural anti-AD antibodies, which start to decline with ageing and as the disease begins to manifest. 2-4 Evidence for aducanumab \nBut the most compelling evidence of this protective immunity is the monoclonal antibody aducanumab, which is a replica of an antibody against aberrant cytotoxic forms of amyloid \u00df, found in elderly but cognitively normal people. 5 Indeed, it stops and improves the mental decline linked to Alzheimer\u2019s, all signs that anticipate the success of immune therapy. Yet all of the studies using immunological approaches to prevent and/or treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease, with the possible exception of aducanumab, have failed. This has been taken as proof that the immunological approach is unrealistic. But the failures in AD drug development are not limited to the vaccine approach, and extend to all of the other methods being explored. 6 \nAn outcome of the unsubstantiated conclusion that immunologically based methods targeting amyloid-\u00df are unfeasible is the tacit suppression of research concerning vaccines targeting this protein as a strategy against Alzheimer\u2019s disease. 7 A decision that, like that of the 17th-Century Roman Inquisition, assumes that the conclusions derived from dubious studies are the correct ones. Indeed, a review of the assumptions used to design the AD vaccine studies shows errors made from the discovery up to the clinical phase, including some decisions made by regulatory agencies. \nConstant discrepancies should have been a warning about problems with the transgenic mouse models and the need to obtain confirmation using animal models \nRecurrent discrepancies between studies that are supposed to agree implies that those studies as planned are conflicting. Such is the situation with AD immune therapy, where studies in transgenic mouse AD models consistently gave promising results, which warranted these products to enter the clinical phase where they failed. Transgenic animal models, while helpful to explain the pathogenesis of AD, offer only a partial view of this disease where several other important cofactors are missing. 8 This explains why treatments that apparently improved some of the pathology in transgenic mice failed in humans where the disease is more intricate. \nYet those constant discrepancies should have been a warning about problems with the transgenic mouse models and the need to obtain confirmation using animal models, such as dogs and non-human primates where AD occurs with ageing similar to humans. 9 Evidently those clinical failures were due to incomplete scientific planning rather than a scientifically flawed immunological approach. However, the problems in AD vaccine development extend also to the vaccines themselves. A review shows that while these vaccines were intended to remove plaque, the crucial change in transgenic mouse models, they ignored the cytotoxic soluble forms of amyloid-\u00df responsible for the neurotoxicity observed in AD. 7,10-11 \nActually, the first vaccine that failed and harmed some AD patients, AN-1792, also included the potent inflammatory agent QS-21, despite the fact that inflammation worsens this disease. Paradoxically, the AN-1792 vaccine was tested in Phase II using a formulation that was different from the Phase I vaccine and that induced a potent inflammatory immune response causing brain damage. In fact, addition of the non-ionic detergent polysorbate to the AN-1792 vaccine during the Phase II caused a massive increase in the adjuvanticity of QS-21; an effect disclosed in patent application WO1999010008A1 published in 1999. 12 Changes in adjuvanticity \nWhile information from patents is not as thorough as that from scientific publications, the reported significant changes in adjuvanticity caused by the addition of polysorbate should have been a warning of potential problems. Thus, the complications with the AN-1792 vaccine were the result of amplifying the QS-21 undesirable inflammatory Th1 immunity by the addition of polysorbate. Actually, this was an unusual situation, because in clinical studies the formulation used in Phase II is always the one that was proven to be safe in Phase I. Nevertheless, in the AN-1792 case, those rules were evidently overlooked with unfortunate results; a bad outcome that while assumed to be the result of formulation problems also fostered questions about the vaccine concept. \nA result of that crisis was the development of safer vaccines, but still using transgenic mouse models. Furthermore, these presumably safer vaccines frequently had strongly inflammatory adjuvants like QS-21 or similar ones 13,14 - vaccines that were successful in mouse models but failed in humans. The fact that the elicited immune response after vaccination depends solely on the adjuvant, regardless of the antigen's nature, was apparently ignored in these vaccines. Hence, the negative results were most likely due to the wrong vaccine formulations, which, rather than eliciting a protective anti-AD immunity, induced a detrimental one. 7 \nThis confusion affecting Alzheimer\u2019s disease vaccine development is shown by these vaccines' composition and the reported results. For instance, a recent article concludes that the long-term administration to humans of an Alzheimer\u2019s disease vaccine having QS-21 seems to be safe, 15 despite the fact that QS-21 elicits a potent systemic Th1 pro-inflammatory immunity 16,17 which caused the AN-1792 side-effects and worsened AD. While most reports about the AN-1792 vaccine assumed that QS-21 was not detrimental to the vaccinated patients, this adjuvant's damaging effects were clearly indicated in an article showing the higher rate of decline in the cognitive functions of AD patients receiving QS-21 alone, ie, 6-7 points in the MMSE, as compared to the decline of 3.5-4 points for the untreated AD population. 18 \nA serious problem with vaccines against Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the lack of information about their composition \nRemarkably, several AD vaccines have inflammatory adjuvants to enhance the immunity, apparently unaware of the fact that they induce damaging systemic inflammatory immune responses that favour the production of antibody glycoforms which are effectors of inflammation. Another important oversight is the one in which the vaccine has chemical groups like maleimide, which are highly immunogenic and have detrimental effects on the immune response. 4,19 Indeed, because of their high immunogenicity, maleimide groups commonly found in cross-linkers cause epitope-specific immune suppression; still, that chemical group is found in some AD vaccines that have entered clinical studies. The Affitope ADO2 vaccine \nFor instance, the Affitope AD02 vaccine from AFFiRiS /GSK, had a peptide mimicking the A\u00df N-terminus region linked to KLH by a maleimide cross-linker. 20 Since this vaccine did not meet the study's primary or secondary endpoints, the study was ended. 21 Another vaccine currently in Phase II clinical studies, CAD106 , has a virus-like-particle as a carrier for an A\u00df N-terminal peptide; apparently linked by a cross-linker containing maleimide. 22 \nParadoxically, a serious problem with vaccines against Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the lack of information about their composition. Indeed, scientific publications on Alzheimer\u2019s disease vaccines often have extensive information about the biological systems and assays used but seldom give detailed information about the structure of the antigen such as the cross-linking agent, or the adjuvant used. This absence of meaningful information about the components of these vaccines hinders any attempt to establish a rational relationship between specific components and induced immune response. \nOf significance for vaccine development is that most scientists seem to be unaware of the problems caused by different linkers; an unfavourable situation aggravated by the fact that most commercial linkers usually contain the strongly immunogenic maleimide group. However, these complications caused by a highly abnormal immunogenicity may extend to other groups, like those having cyclic rings with aromatic character. 19 Moreover, the maleimide's immune suppression is not limited to peptides, but also extends to carbohydrate antigens; 23 a situation that implies that immune suppression may be more acute for weak antigens like self-antigens, eg, amyloid-\u00df. \nThat maleimides have an adverse role on immunity raises questions about the validity of some studies. Particularly since they can also affect the assays used to assess immunity. From the regulatory point of view it would be advisable to consider the effect of a vaccine's single components (adjuvant, cross-linker, antigen and carrier) besides those of the final vaccine in the pre-clinical phase. These effects may be difficult to identify by testing the vaccine only. \nRegrettably, the AD vaccines' clinical failures have been taken as evidence that this vaccine concept is wrong - a decision that disregards the intrinsic problems linked to virtually all Alzheimer\u2019s disease vaccines. This situation would explain the decision by many organisations to reject research dealing with anti-amyloid vaccines. However, like other conditions where, despite initial failures, researchers persevered until they resolved the problem, AD drug development will benefit if it adopts a similar philosophy. \nThe development of aducanumab strengthens the use of immunological strategies against aberrant A\u00df oligomers to prevent and/or delay AD - a notion that AD drug development has recently started to recognise. While the search for novel therapeutic targets is advisable, abandoning promising areas without identifying the sources of the problems is unwise. Actually, the success of cancer immunotherapy took decades of research filled with failures and successes. Thus, AD drug development should follow those lessons in its quest for the development of acutely needed effective products against Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \nBIOGRAPHY \nDante J Marciani holds a ScD in Biological Sciences and a PhD in Chemistry, and was a scientist at NIH .

Not one! \nEven the National Institutes of Health says magnesium is necessary to help maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keep your heart rhythm steady, support a healthy immune and bronchial system and keep your bones strong so your hip doesn't give out. \nAccording to a survey by the U.S. government 75 percent of American adults have a magnesium-deficient diet. That's three out of four of you. It's getting worse due to the massive coffee consumption because compounds in coffee are 'drug muggers' of magnesium. Human deficiencies occur more often because the soil is very deficient in magnesium, so the salad that grows in the soil isn't soaking up as much mag as it used to back in the day! When you eat it, it's not as nutritious. \nMagnesium levels impact one hugely important organ in your body, your heart! Everyone is so afraid of a heart attack and yet, I bet you don't know that a low level of magnesium is associated with an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP). CRP is a marker for type of inflammation and it's a silent killer. High CRP levels are associated with heart disease. \nHas anyone ever tested your RBC magnesium levels if you have asthma? The reason I ask is because low magnesium levels have long been associated with several adverse, dangerous lung conditions. Even a recent study confirmed how low levels of magnesium and vitamin D are associated with an increased incidence of severe breathing difficulties. Sadly, most patients are put on inhalers for their entire lifetime, without ever getting tested to see if low mag is contributing. \nA low magnesium level can damage your brain and mood. In my book, \"Headache Free,\" I provided research to show how magnesium can reduce headache frequency, while improving mood and restorative sleep. No surprise there ... magnesium is needed to create dopamine, serotonin and other happy brain chemicals. But a very common mistake is taking the wrong form. You will need the kind of magnesium that actually gets into your brain, like the \"threonate\" form, as opposed to the laxative form of magnesium like \"citrate\" which slides through your colon. \nI have much more about magnesium's role in women's health, bone integrity and cardiovascular disease. Sign up for my newsletter on my website ( suzycohen.com ). When you do that, I'll email the longer version of this article. You do need to read it because three out of four American's are magnesium deficient, so if it's not you, then three of your relatives are deficient and that means their heart and brain are at risk. \nSuzy Cohen is a registered pharmacist.

Both are components of cartilage, the tissue that connects our bones.\n\nChondroitin sulfate is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan that is a component of a cartilage molecule known as aggrecan. 1 Four fractions have been identified: chondroitin-4-sulfate, chondroitin-6-sulfate, chondroitin-2,6-sulfate, and chondroitin-4,6-sulfate. While it has been suggested that glucosamine, the smaller molecule, is better absorbed than the larger chondroitin sulfate, both compounds have been effective in studies of arthritis patients.\n\nDo Chondroitin Sulfate Supplements Get Absorbed? A question has been raised concerning whether orally administered chondroitin sulfate results in the molecule being directly incorporated into cartilage. It has been suggested that chondroitin sulfate\u2019s metabolic byproducts could be responsible for the benefits documented in clinical and experimental research. It is, however, notable that a study in which chondroitin sulfate was orally administered to 20 human subjects detected a more than 200% increase in plasma chondroitin sulfate levels, with the peak concentration reached after 2 hours. 2 \u201cThis research extends previous results obtained by other researchers in man and experimental animals, both with chondroitin sulfate and other polysaccharides, confirming that molecules possessing high molecular mass and charge density can be absorbed orally,\u201d author N. Volpi, of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia concluded. \n\nRelief from Osteoarthritis Pain and Inflammation In a three-month randomized trial published in 1992 that included patients with osteoarthritis of the knees and hips, chondroitin sulfate decreased pain and the need for NSAIDs. 3 This effect was carried over into a two-month, treatment-free phase following the initial treatment period. Another trial, involving patients with knee, hip and/or finger joint arthritis , resulted in a significant reduction in severe pain reflected in a 72% decrease in the need for NSAIDs during a three-month course of chondroitin sulfate therapy. 4 The authors remarked that the reduction of pain to a level that could not have been achieved by NSAID therapy alone was of special interest. \n\nAnother randomized, double-blind trial compared the anti-inflammatory effects of chondroitin sulfate and the NSAID diclofenac sodium in 146 knee osteoarthritis patients. 5 While participants who received NSAID therapy had more rapid relief of their symptoms (which reappeared at the end of treatment), those who received chondroitin sulfate experienced a later response which lasted for up to three months after the end of treatment. \n\nIn yet another randomized comparison trial, osteoarthritis patients treated with anti-inflammatory drugs who also received chondroitin sulfate and ibuprofen daily for six months had less pain and need for anti-inflammatories than those who received ibuprofen alone. 6 This response also persisted for three months after the conclusion of the treatment phase. \n\nA comparison of chondroitin sulfate plus naproxen to naproxen alone resulted in reduced progression of joint erosion among patients with osteoarthritis of the hands after two years of treatment. 7 The number of finger joints with erosions detected by x-rays at two years was lower among those who received chondroitin sulfate compared to those who received naproxen alone. \n\nIn the recent ChONdroitin versus CElecoxib versus Placebo Trial(CONCEPT) trial, which compared the effects of chondroitin sulfate, the NSAID drug celecoxib, and a placebo among patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, pain reduction and improvement in function in association with chondroitin sulfate was similar to that of the NSAID and significantly greater than the placebo after 182 days of daily treatment. 8 The authors recommend that chondroitin sulfate be considered a first-line treatment in the management of knee osteoarthritis. \n\nChondroitin sulfate is frequently combined with glucosamine to treat osteoarthritis symptoms. A randomized, double-blind, crossover trial of chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride (HCl) and manganese ascorbate conducted among U.S. Navy personnel with degenerative joint disease resulted in knee symptom relief. 9 In another trial, the combination helped lower an index of severity of osteoarthritis of the knee at 4 and 6 months of treatment in patients with mild to moderate disease. 10 Fifty-two percent of those who received chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine HCl and manganese ascorbate twice per day experienced a response to the treatment in comparison with 28% who received a placebo. \n\nChondroitin sulfate is not a pain blocker, but helps relieve pain by supporting the structure of the joint. 11 In a pilot trial of 69 knee osteoarthritis patients, chondroitin sulfate consumed daily was associated with less cartilage volume loss at six months and 12 months as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 12 \u201c These findings suggest a joint structure protective effect of chondroitin sulfate and provide new in vivo information on its mode of action in knee osteoarthritis,\u201d L. M. Wildi and colleagues conclude.\n\nIn a trial that included 300 participants with osteoarthritis of the knee, treatment with chondroitin sulfates was associated with the maintenance of cartilage at two years as revealed by x-ray evaluation of the knee joint. 13 Those who received a placebo worsened over time. The author of the report concluded that chondroitin sulfates are \u201csuperior to the placebo with regard to the stabilization of minimum joint space width of the internal femorotibial articular space, the mean thickness and the surface.\u201d\n\nHow Long Does Chondroitin Sulfate Take to Work? Arthritis doesn\u2019t develop overnight. Neither can chondroitin sulfate be expected to work immediately. It typically takes weeks for the effects of chondroitin sulfate and/or glucosamine to be noticed, but benefits can be long lasting. Even when used intermittently for just three months twice yearly during a two-year period, chondroitin sulfate helped maintain joint space width in patients with knee osteoarthritis. 14 \n\nA randomized trial that compared the effects of a once-daily chondroitin sulfate oral gel, three times daily chondroitin sulfate capsules, and a placebo in 127 patients resulted in both groups who received chondroitin experiencing a significant reduction in clinical symptoms. 15 The authors note that the effects of a single daily dose did not differ from those of thrice daily administration for all parameters evaluated.\n\nAdditional Help Other supplements, such as fish oil, Korean angelica and Boswellia serrata canbe added to one\u2019s arthritis regimen if fast relief is needed. \n\nReferences Felson DT et al.

The dye molecules are small enough to leak out of blood vessels in the dura but too big to pass through the blood-brain barrier and enter other parts of the brain. \nAt first, when the researchers set the MRI to see blood vessels, the dura lit up brightly, and they could not see any signs of the lymphatic system. But, when they tuned the scanner differently, the blood vessels disappeared, and the researchers saw that dura also contained smaller but almost equally bright spots and lines which they suspected were lymph vessels. The results suggested that the dye leaked out of the blood vessels, flowed through the dura and into neighboring lymphatic vessels. \nTo test this idea, the researchers performed another round of scans on two subjects after first injecting them with a second dye made up of larger molecules that leak much less out of blood vessels. In contrast with the first round of scans, the researchers saw blood vessels in the dura but no lymph vessels regardless of how they tuned the scanner, confirming their suspicions. \nThey also found evidence for blood and lymph vessels in the dura of autopsied human brain tissue. Moreover, their brain scans and autopsy studies of brains from nonhuman primates confirmed the results seen in humans, suggesting the lymphatic system is a common feature of mammalian brains. \n\"These results could fundamentally change the way we think about how the brain and immune system inter-relate,\" said Walter J. Koroshetz , M.D., NINDS director. \nDr. Reich's team plans to investigate whether the lymphatic system works differently in patients who have multiple sclerosis or other neuroinflammatory disorders. \n\"For years we knew how fluid entered the brain.

Some reports even discourage the use of aluminum foil for cooking. Is there a connection between aluminum and Alzheimer\u2019s? \nA Your worries center on the most-abundant metal and the third-most abundant element, one that by mass makes up 8 percent of the Earth\u2019s crust. Plants and animals have evolved in an environment in which aluminum is common. In fact, aluminum is even present in the human brain. This most fundamental of organs contains, on average, 1.02 micrograms of aluminum per gram of brain tissue. Further, brain levels of aluminum increase with age, causing researchers to take a look at how that happens \u2014 and what might be the result. \nThe human body absorbs aluminum from compounds in water, food, aluminum-based utensils, deodorants and drugs. But at toxic levels, aluminum can damage neurons in the brain as well as DNA within neurons. The aluminum ion can affect normal cellular reactions in the brain, cause brain inflammation and lead to neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid deposits that are the hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In fact, aluminum chloride in combination with the sugar D-galactose injected in rats and mice induces many of the brain changes and behavioral changes seen in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \nIn one important study, researchers studied the postmortem brains of 12 people with familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease in England . They found elevated aluminum content in all but one of the brain samples. The researchers also found aluminum concentrated near neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid deposits, which have been linked to Alzheimer\u2019s. They couldn\u2019t conclude that aluminum was the cause of the dementia; it may be that degenerative brain diseases concentrate and retain aluminum within the brain. Still, a connection seems clear. \nThe findings are alarming. Aluminum is more ubiquitous today than ever before. Aluminum hydroxide, aluminum sulfate and aluminum chloride are used in drinking water treatment and waste water management, and we use aluminum foil and aluminum in our food preparation and storage. Considering such exposure, it\u2019s important to ask questions about the potential impact. \nA 15-year study in France assessed the aluminum levels in drinking water and the rate of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in multiple areas of southern France . The concentration of aluminum in the water varied from 0.001 to 0.514 mg/?liter depending on location. Of the 1,677 people over the age of 65 who completed the study, 461 were diagnosed with dementia. Those whose aluminum intake was more than 0.1 mg per day had 2.26 times the risk of dementia compared with those whose intake was less than 0.1 mg per day. \nAll of that said, neither I nor medical science overall can provide a hard and fast answer to your question about the risk of aluminum exposure. It is heartening, however, to know that water boards measure the amount of aluminum in drinking water at a time when the correlation between human exposure to high levels of aluminum and dementia is still largely unknown. \nDr. is an internist and assistant professor of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles .

FILE PHOTO | NMG Giving Vitamin A supplements to pregnant women during pregnancy and after delivery reduces mother-to-child HIV transmission, a study has shown. According to researchers, the supplements especially come in handy in remote areas where facilities and medication may not be readily available. Researchers from South African Medical Reseach Council said the Vitamin A intervention has largely been superseded by Antiretroviral therapy (ART) which is widely available and effective in preventing vertical transmission. Professor Charles Wiysonge, lead researcher, and director of the South African Cochrane Centre , at the South African Medical Research Council , said in some low and middle countries with high rate of infections, interventions may not be practical or affordable. \u201cSimple, inexpensive, and effective interventions that could potentially be implemented even in the absence of prenatal HIV testing programmes would be valuable. Vitamin A, which plays a role in immune function, is one low-cost intervention that has been suggested in such settings,\u201d says Prof Wiysonge. He said other studies in sub-Saharan Africa have shown low serum vitamin A levels in HIV-positive women to be associated with significantly increased rates of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and infant mortality. \u201cVitamin A was assumed to decrease mother-to-child transmission of HIV by acting through several maternal, foetal, child risk factors for transmission, or all three,\u201d he said. The study was supported by World Health Organisation findings (WHO), which states that over 1,000 new cases of mother-to-child transmission occur worldwide every day, making this the main route of transmission of HIV infection in children. The WHO revealed that Vitamin A deficiency also affects about 19 million pregnant women, mostly from Africa and has been associated with an increase in the risk of transmission of HIV from mother to child. \u201cDuring pregnancy, vitamin A is essential for maternal health and for the healthy development of the fetus. As vitamin A also plays an important role in immune function, it has been suggested that providing vitamin A supplements may reduce the risk of transmission,\u201d states WHO. \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

It occurs in protein-containing foods, such as eggs, meat, and dairy products, and is abundant in beans and legumes. While most people in developed nations consume an adequate amount of lysine, some may be deficient depending on their diet, among other factors.\n\nLysine can exist in a \u201cD or L\u201d form (which refers to the chirality of the molecule). However, the L form of lysine is the essential component of the diet and is the form available in dietary supplements. \n\nLysine for Protection Against Glycation \n\nWhile lysine\u2019s most important role is in protein synthesis, a critical action for the amino acid is in the prevention of glycation : the nonenzymatic bonding of a sugar molecule to a protein or fat that results in the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) which damage tissues, including the lining of the arteries. A similar phenomenon, known as glycosylation, refers to enzymatic bonding of carbohydrates to proteins or fats. Diabetics, who have elevated blood glucose levels, experience an increase in glycation-related damage. \n\nGlucose in the body bonds to proteins that contain lysine. According to the authors of a study that found an 86% reduction in the glycation of collagen in the kidneys of rats that received L-lysine prior to the induction of elevated blood glucose, \u201cThe rationale is that the administered lysine would combine with the circulating glucose and make it unavailable to react with epsilon-amino groups of lysine of various proteins in these diabetic rats.\u201d 1 \n\nLysine and Cataracts \n\nIn cataract formation, which involves glycation of the crystalline lens, a drug that contains L-lysine inhibited the early stages of protein glycation and the formation of advanced glycation end products. 2 L-lysine has also been demonstrated to inhibit the glycation of fibrinogen (involved in blood clotting) in the plasma of type 2 diabetics. 3 \n\nLysine and Diabetics \n\nIn patients being treated for type 2 diabetes, 3 grams of L-lysine per day reduced advanced glycation end products in serum and reversed lysozyme glycation, thereby increasing its activity. 4 (Lysozyme is an antimicrobial enzyme that forms a part of the innate immune system.) \u201cStructure and function of glycated lysozyme are significantly improved by L-lysine; therefore it can be considered an effective therapeutic supplementation in type 2 diabetes mellitus, decreasing the risk of infection in these patients,\u201d authors H. Mirmiranpour and colleagues conclude.\n\nInterestingly, lysine ingested with glucose resulted in a 44% decrease in the 2.5-hour serum glucose response without a change in insulin response in comparison with the serum response to glucose alone in a study that involved healthy participants. 5 \n\nLysine and Herpes Simplex Virus \n\nOne of lysine\u2019s best-known uses is as an aid to suppress herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) or HSV2. The virus is the cause of \u201ccold sores\u201d or \u201cfever blisters\u201d that appear on the lips, mouth, or genitals. While there are several prescription drugs that can treat HSV, L-lysine is used by some individuals to help maintain results during periods in which drugs are not being used to treat active lesions. \n\nThe rationale for using L-lysine against HSV is based on the fact that L-lysine has a competitive relationship with another amino acid, L-arginine, which is needed for HSV to replicate. In research conducted in tissue cultures, lysine antagonized the ability of L-arginine to promote viral growth, thereby suppressing HSV replication. 6 \n\nAlthough plenty of anecdotal evidence exists in favor of the use of L-lysine against herpes, clinical data is limited. An early double-blind multicenter trial in which men and women with recurrent herpes simplex infection received 1 gram L-lysine from L-lysine monohydrochloride or a placebo three times daily for six months resulted in an average of 2.4 fewer HSV infections, decreased severity of symptoms and reduced healing time among those who received the amino acid. 7 In a double-blind crossover study involving subjects with frequently recurring herpetic lesions, one gram L-lysine daily was associated with fewer lesions in comparison with the control group. 8 Researchers D. J. Thein and W. C. Hurt found that when serum lysine levels exceeded 165 nanomoles per milliliter, herpes lesion recurrence decreased significantly. \u201cThese results suggest that prophylactic lysine may be useful in managing selected cases of recurrent herpes simplex labialis if serum lysine levels can be maintained at adequate concentrations,\u201d they conclude.\n\nAnother, crossover study, found positive effects for 1,248 milligrams (mg) L-lysine monohydrochloride daily in the prevention of HSV lesions, but no benefit for 624 mg per day in comparison with a placebo. 9 In a survey of 1,543 subjects with HSV, 84% reported that supplementation with L-lysine prevented recurrence or decreased the frequency of lesions, while decreasing symptom severity and healing time. Eighty-eight percent considered supplemental L-lysine effective. 10 \n\nCold sores, while generally considered an annoyance, could have more serious implications. Herpes simplex type 1 has been found in the cerebrums of the majority of older adults, in many areas affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease . Herpes encephalitis, a condition in which HSV causes severe brain infection, has been known to result in memory loss. It has been hypothesized that L-lysine supplementation could help protect against the development of Alzheimer\u2019s. 11 \n\nLysine and Heart Disease \n\nAnother use for lysine is in the prevention of atherosclerosis. According to Nobel Prize-winning scientist Linus Pauling, \"Knowing that lysyl residues are what causes lipoprotein(a) to stick to the wall of the artery and form atherosclerotic plaques, any physical chemist would say at once that to prevent that put the amino acid lysine in the blood to a greater extent than it is normally. You need lysine, it is essential, you have to get about one gram a day to keep protein in balance, but we can take lysine, pure lysine, a perfectly nontoxic substance as supplements, which puts extra lysine molecules in the blood. They enter into competition with the lysyl residues on the wall of arteries and accordingly count to prevent lipoprotein(a) from being deposited, or even will work to pull it loose and destroy atherosclerotic plaques.\" 12 \n\nThe Impact of Lysine \n\nDue to its presence in protein sources, it\u2019s no surprise that a high lysine diet also benefits muscle. A study in young men who consumed 80 mg lysine per kilogram body weight resulted in improved muscle strength after eight weeks. 13 The finding is of relevance to the residents of developing countries whose populations are at risk of lysine deficiency. In Ghana, a randomized trial of L-lysine supplementation that included men, women, and children resulted in decreased diarrheal episodes and number of days ill among the children and fewer colds and number of days ill among the men. 14 The authors note that lysine impacts diarrhea as well as anxiety by its effects on serotonin receptors, intestinal repair, and opioid peptide transport.\n\n\u201cLysine could be viewed as the \u2018forgotten\u2019 amino acid in human nutrition,\u201d writes D. H. Baker in the Journal of Nutrition . 15 \u201cThis amino acid is rich in the food supply of developed countries. However, in poor countries where cereals dominate the food supply, lysine is the most limiting amino acid in the food supply.\u201d\n\n\u201cLysine has probably been studied more in animal nutrition than any other amino acid, but it has not received the same degree of emphasis in human nutrition. This is perhaps because few pharmacologic uses for lysine in the clinical setting have been advanced.\u201d It is to be hoped that this \u201cforgotten\u201d amino acid will be remembered in future research and that additional uses in human health are uncovered.\n\nReferences Jyothirmayi GN.

Beyond the variation from person to person, however, plastic surgeon Dr. Constance M. Chen points out that all surgery is trauma to the body \u2013 the entire body \u2013 and induces a common and predictable response beyond the immediate surgical site. \"Surgery induces a stress response that produces metabolic changes,\" she says. \"Put simply, all the body's energies are redirected to repair and heal the damage at the surgical site leaving the rest of the body to fend for itself. So, for example, areas like the skin, hair, and nails may become thin, dry, and brittle as they lose the elements that normally support their constant building and replenishment.\" \nThe most noticeable post-surgical reaction is swelling, caused by a process called \"third spacing.\" Most of the fluids in the body are found in three places: the cells, which hold about two-thirds of the body's fluids; the blood vessels; and the spaces between the cells, known as the \"third space.\" Under normal conditions, fluids move freely and balance is maintained between these three spaces. The trauma caused by surgery causes the capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels, to leak, letting fluid shift from the blood vessels to the third space \u2013 the areas between the cells. The resulting swelling will appear along with bleeding and bruising at the surgical site, but may affect other parts of the body as well, with the skin becoming swollen and stretched out. \"Swelling is a normal and important part of recovery,\" says Dr. Chen . \"It increases blood supply to the surgical site to promote healing. When a patient does not understand what is going on, however, swelling can be emotionally distressing.\" \nPromoting Post-Surgical Healing Sometimes patients wonder if special supplements that can improve healing, but then forget how important it is to restore the body's needs through good nutrition and food. The body heals from the inside out, and a well-balanced diet is essential. Lean protein: Collagen, the most abundant protein in the body, plays a key role in repairing damaged tissue. After surgery, extra protein may be needed from sources such as red meat, fish, poultry, eggs, beans, and legumes. Iron, found in liver, red meat, and green leafy vegetables, is vital to replenish red blood cells. Fluids, 6-8 glasses of water a day, will help reduce the swelling and puffiness caused by fluids that leaked out of the capillaries. Fiber: Anesthesia, pain medication, and reduced activity all work to slow down the gastrointestinal system, causing constipation. Along with plenty of water, foods that can help include beans and legumes, bran flakes, oatmeal, apples, pears, and prunes. Citrus fruits and bell peppers are excellent sources of vitamin C, which is depleted by stress. Pineapples and papayas contain enzymes that help digest protein and reduce swelling and inflammation. \nDr. Chen points out that it may be necessary to eat more than usual to compensate for the extra energy that is necessary for healing. If person's basal metabolism requires 2000 calories a day to remain at a steady state, after major surgery 3000 calories a day may be necessary to allow a patient to maintain basal metabolism and heal, for example. Some patients find the need to consume additional calories difficult after an operation because they have a loss of appetite. \nFinally, it is crucial to begin moving as soon as possible after surgery. Even walking has tremendous benefits, such as reducing the risk of blood clots and expanding the lungs. The most common cause of fever after surgery is atelectasis, in which shallow breaths cause the aveoli in the lungs to collapse. The risk of developing atelectasis is reduced by simple ambulation. \"The body gets debilitated very quickly and needs to move,\" Dr. Chen says. \"The joints feel creaky. Even gentle stretching is helpful to stimulate the muscle fibers and overcome stiffness. After the immediate healing has occurred, exercise also gets your heart rate up so that the blood is moving and your lungs fill with oxygen. An overall feeling of well-being will help you look and feel better so that you regain a healthy glow.\" \nIn sum, every patient should carefully follow instructions after surgery. That said, sometimes the body just needs a chance to heal. According to Dr. Chen . \"At the end of the day, the most important element is 'tincture of time.' Although we are all understandably impatient to recover as soon as possible, wounds often just need time to heal.\" \n, MD , is a board-certified plastic surgeon with special expertise in the use of innovative natural techniques to optimize medical and cosmetic outcomes for women undergoing breast reconstruction.

Dou works in the lab of the study's senior author, Shelley Berger , PhD, the Daniel S. Och University Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology and Professor of Biology and director of the Penn Epigenetics Institute . \nHuman cells have complicated ways to protect themselves from becoming cancerous. One way is to force \"premature aging\" via senescence, a process that induces cells to stop growing. Although senescence suppresses cancer, which is the good side of this physiological balance, there is also a dark side. Senescence is associated with normal aging, and senescent cells accumulate in aged tissues. This accumulation impairs healthy tissue by triggering hyper-inflammation. This overdrive eventually contributes to age-related diseases including cancer, heart disease, and neurodegeneration. The overall idea for future therapy is to make a small molecule that could stop the dark side of senescence to treat age-related diseases, especially those related to chronic inflammation. \n\"Chromatin - structures in the cell nucleus in which genes reside - is traditionally viewed as a cell component that stays put in the nucleus to regulate gene expression,\" Berger said \"We discovered misplaced chromatin fragments outside the nucleus that pinch off from the nuclei of senescent cells.\" \nBerger, Dou, and colleagues found that this wayward chromatin activates a DNA-sensing pathway called cGAS- STING , a mechanism based outside the nucleus best known for restraining microbial infection, such as by bacteria or viruses. In the case of senescence and aging, the body's own chromatin leaking outside of the nucleus is read by cells as a \"danger signal\" akin to a microbial infection. The misplaced fragments and the cell's reaction to them eventually lead to inflammation. \n\"While short-term inflammation can help stop cancer from starting, the problem is that long-term, chronic inflammation can lead to tissue destruction, aging, and even, paradoxically, can help cancer to grow and spread,\" Dou said. \nIn the Nature study, the Penn team used stressors such as DNA-damaging agents and activated oncogenes, as well as cells naturally growing old, to set off the alarm. Cells respond in two ways: by shutting down cell replication permanently via senescence and by inducing the alarm system that hails the immune system to mop up the damaged senescent cells. The immune system also has to be in balance: while it is designed to help clean up damaged cells, if uncontrolled, the immune system can do more harm than good. \nMice without an active alarm pathway that have been exposed to a cancer-inducing stress do not call the immune-system for help. This causes problems because damaged cells give rise to tumors in the impaired mice. However, when normal mice are exposed to stressors that induce aging, the build-up of senescent cells stimulates a continual call for immune cells, leading to chronic inflammation, which ultimately causes tissue damage and premature aging. Months after receiving irradiation stress, normal mice with an active alarm system showed massive graying of their fur, a sign of aging in mammals, just like humans show grey hair in old age. By sharp contrast, mice without the alarm system still had their black fur after irradiation. \"This is a graphic example of the bright and dark sides of inflammation,\" Dou said. \nThe researchers believe that finding molecules to target the always-on inflammatory pathway may hold promise in treating chronic inflammation associated with numerous diseases, especially those of aging, such as arthritis, arteriosclerosis, neurodegeneration, obesity, and possibly even hair graying and loss. \nThe study was funded by P01AG031862 from the National Institutes of Health (and CA078831, K99AG053406, P01CA196539), the Glenn Foundation ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T00:01:02.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2eb91a0faa65e3bea12eadff4a077de108b8bae7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.bwMorvmoS1n6WzWewkYzLTqA2TyAqeSUddseVU6Wh767vWKsQbIff5.CvwIFSRrSwvPVICVahDnSaMZY_9UoB0s65.gk7HOk-", "site_full": "www.lifeextension.com", "site": "lifeextension.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Life Extension Daily News", "title_full": "Life Extension Daily News", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.142, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19569, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2eb91a0faa65e3bea12eadff4a077de108b8bae7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.bwMorvmoS1n6WzWewkYzLTqA2TyAqeSUddseVU6Wh767vWKsQbIff5.CvwIFSRrSwvPVICVahDnSaMZY_9UoB0s65.gk7HOk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Life Extension Daily News", "text": "\nYale University Prevention Research Center Director and study co-author David L.

That is a term coined for those who have escaped the age-related diseases and disabilities that afflict, and ultimately kill, many of us before we reach life expectancy, currently projected by the World Health Organization as 76.5 for a man in the U.S. and 81 for a woman. Good life habits when it comes to exercise, drinking, eating and smoking, and about 20 percent genetics, can get us to 90. But after that, the scale tilts toward genetics. Beyond 105, Perls' research shows, survival is 70 percent related to one's genetic makeup. \n\"It's not one powerful gene, but many genes with modest effects. In the right combination it can have a very strong effect,\" Perls said. It's like hitting the lottery, he said. Having a few numbers match is negligible, but when they all line up, it's a jackpot. \nPerls is also participating in another long-running study, the Long Life Family Study. One in 250,000 live to be 105, he said, and only one in 5 million live to 110, known as a supercentenarian. The oldest documented living person was Jeanne Louise Calment, who died in 1997 in Arles, France , at 122 years, 164 days. \n\"(Centenarians) tend not to be lonely. They are gregarious people, and people find their ages so remarkable that they are kind of social magnets,\" Perls said. \nMassa has been a resident at the Pleasant Bay Nursing & Rehabilitation Center in Brewster for the past decade. She was anything but lonely Wednesday as she celebrated her birthday a day early with a singalong with other residents, tapping a foot and occasionally singing, a big sunflower pinned to her sweater. She is the oldest of a dozen centenarians at Pleasant Bay , said executive director Joshua Zuckerman , and he agreed with Perls that most of them do tend to be social people, but the key factor in happiness is family involvement. \nLouise Massa visits her mother almost every day and said her mother lived for her family. \nBorn in to Italian immigrants on Oct. 5, 1909 , she was not a history-maker. Her one brush with the famous came on a trip to Boston , when she was 8 or 9, to a parade marking the end of World War I. She walked up to Gen. John \"Blackjack\" Pershing and petted his horse, Kidron. \nShe contracted scarlet fever and was quarantined in Boston , but ended up looking after some of the other children who were there with her, Louise Massa recalled. \"She loved to take care of other people's kids, nieces, nephews, some of her cousins, she was put in charge of them. She was a responsible person.\" \nWorking as an executive secretary for Jordan Marsh Boston's Downtown Crossing , Massa (her maiden name, Costello, was an Americanized version of the Italian name Castelli) loved to dance and was in the chorus line at company shows. She still shows off her kicks even from her wheelchair. \nFlo Massa grew up living in the double- and triple-deckers in Dorchester with her extended family on the other floors. She was married late in life for those times, at age 35 in 1944, to Charles Massa , 10 years her senior, whom she met through his sister, who also worked at Jordan's. He worked at Western Electric , and they had two children, Louise and a brother who died in an accident when he was young. \n\"The most she got out of life was being with her family. That made her happy,\" Louise said. That was especially true of her cousins, all about the same age, who were her frequent companions as girls. \n\"For all the troubles they went through, they always had laughs.

According to news reporting out of Miyagi, Japan , by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Cellular senescence is observed in the lungs of patients with COPD and may contribute to the disease pathogenesis. Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) belongs to the transforming growth factor beta superfamily and was recently reported to be a circulating protein that may have rejuvenating effects in mice.\" \nOur news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Tohoku University , \"We aimed to investigate the amounts of GDF11 in the plasma and the lungs of patients with COPD and elucidate the possible roles of GDF11 in cellular senescence. The plasma levels of GDF11 were investigated in two separate cohorts by western blotting. The localisation and expression of GDF11 in the lungs were investigated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription PCR, respectively. The effects of GDF11 on both cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced cellular senescence in vitro and on elastase-induced cellular senescence in vivo were investigated. The levels of plasma GDF11 in the COPD group were decreased compared with the control groups in the two independent cohorts. The levels of plasma GDF11 were significantly positively correlated with pulmonary function data. The mRNA expression of GDF11 in mesenchymal cells from the COPD group was decreased. Chronic exposure to CSE decreased the production of GDF11. Treatment with GDF11 significantly inhibited CSE-induced cellular senescence and upregulation of inflammatory mediators, partly through Smad2/3 signalling in vitro. Daily GDF11 treatment attenuated cellular senescence and airspace enlargement in an elastase-induced mouse model of emphysema.\" \nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The decrease in GDF11 may be involved in the cellular senescence observed in COPD.\" \nFor more information on this research see: Decrease in an anti-ageing factor, growth differentiation factor 11, in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Intracellular and extracellular Ab were examined by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot. Amyloid peptides (Ab) receptors, Ab degrading enzymes, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected by RT-PCR, real-time PCR, and ELISA. Phosphorylation of MAP kinases and NF-kB was examined by Western blot. We found that physiological concentrations of androgen enhanced Ab uptake and clearance, suppressed Ab -induced IL-1b and TNFa expression by murine microglia cell line N9 and primary microglia, and alleviated neuronal death induced by Ab -activated microglia. Androgen administration also reduced Ab -induced IL-1b expression and neuronal death in murine hippocampus. Mechanistic studies revealed that androgen promoted microglia to phagocytose and degrade Ab through upregulating formyl peptide receptor 2 and endothelin-converting enzyme 1c expression, and inhibited Ab -induced pro-inflammatory cytokines expression via suppressing MAPK p38 and NF-kB activation by Ab , in an androgen receptor independent manner.\" \nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Our study demonstrates that androgen promotes microglia to phagocytose and clear Ab and inhibits Ab -induced inflammatory response, which may play an important role in reducing the neurotoxicity of Ab.\" \nFor more information on this research see: Androgen alleviates neurotoxicity of b-amyloid peptide (Ab) by promoting microglial clearance of Ab and inhibiting microglial inflammatory response to Ab.

Then came labels boasting \u201czero grams of trans fat.\u201d \u201cSugar free\u201d and \u201clow sodium\u201d claims soon joined the chorus. These days, gluten-free foods are all the rage. \nFor the most part, these food industry trends echoed the nutritional mantras of the time and were designed to improve our health \u2014 especially cardiovascular health. Not only is heart disease the nation\u2019s leading killer, there\u2019s overwhelming evidence that better dietary choices could prevent many heart attacks and strokes. But just how successful have these efforts been? \n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixed picture, but over all, I think we\u2019re going in a good direction,\u201d says Dr. Walter Willett , professor in nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health . The biggest change \u2014 and greatest success story \u2014 is removal of trans fats from processed foods, he says. \nThe trouble with trans fats \nThe main source of these harmful fats is partially hydrogenated oil, a longtime food industry favorite because it\u2019s cheap, it\u2019s easy to use, and it has a long shelf life. For decades, deep-fried fast foods, baked goods, crackers, chips, and margarine were made with partially hydrogenated oils. \nBut in the 1990s, researchers at Harvard and elsewhere began sounding the alarm on the adverse health effects of trans fats. Trans fats raise undesirable LDL cholesterol, make blood more likely to clot, and ramp up inflammation in the body \u2014 all of which raise heart disease risk. In 2003, the FDA began requiring manufacturers to list trans fat on the Nutrition Facts label to boost consumer awareness. As a result, many companies chose to stop using trans fats in their products. \nIn 2007, New York City pioneered a ban on trans fat in foods sold in public eateries, and the health benefits were apparent within just a few years. One recent study found lower rates of heart attacks and strokes in the urban counties that implemented the trans fat ban compared with other urban counties in the state that did not ban trans fats. \nThis healthful trend should be spreading throughout the country, thanks to a long-awaited FDA ruling to ban trans fats entirely from our food supply by June 2018 . \u201cAt this point, about 85% of the trans fat has been removed from our food supply,\u201d says Dr. Willett . For the most part, healthier unsaturated fats (such as those found in olive, corn, canola, sunflower, and safflower oils) have replaced trans fats. Some products now contain small amounts of less-desirable saturated fat from coconut and palm oils. However, many reformulated products cut back on trans fat without increasing saturated fat, according to a survey of 83 major-brand grocery store products and restaurant dishes. \nThese changes jibe with the overall improvement in fat quality in the United States , Dr. Willett notes. This trend helps explain why people who eat higher-fat diets (especially those that include more unsaturated fats) are better off than those who eat low-fat diets, as a major study by Dr. Willett and colleagues found last year. \nThe carb calamity \nThe low-fat craze that took hold in the 1980s turned out to have unintended \u2014 and very unhealthy \u2014 consequences. Following the nutrition dogma of the day, food manufacturers cut fat from their products. But they often replaced it with refined carbohydrates, such as white flour and sugar. Americans also began eating more carbs (think pasta, white potatoes, white bread, and sugary desserts). Eating less fat, however, doesn\u2019t necessarily help you lose weight. And diets high in refined carbohydrates may contribute to weight gain and promote type 2 diabetes and heart disease. \nJust as is true for fats, some carbohydrates are far healthier than others. The best choices include unprocessed or minimally processed whole grains, such as whole-wheat or rye bread, brown rice, bulgur wheat, oatmeal, popcorn, and corn tortillas. Recent diet surveys suggest a slow but steady increase in whole grains in American diets. They\u2019re great sources of heart-protecting nutrients such as fiber, vitamins, and minerals. \nGoing against the grain? \nBut some grains \u2014 including wheat, barley, and rye \u2014 also contain gluten, a protein that\u2019s been getting lots of attention in recent years. \u201cGluten-free diets have been a big trend lately, but there is no good evidence to support these diets for most people,\u201d says Dr. Willett . Exceptions include people with celiac disease, which affects about 1% of the population. In people with the disorder, gluten triggers the body\u2019s immune system to attack the small intestine, leading to gut inflammation, pain and other debilitating symptoms. Another small group of people who report feeling better when they eliminate gluten may have \u201cgluten sensitivity,\u201d but this condition isn\u2019t well documented. \nAccording to a survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center , 63% of Americans believe that a gluten-free diet could improve their mental or physical health. And up to a third of are cutting back on it in the hope that it will improve their health or prevent disease. \nIn fact, the opposite might be true. A recent Harvard study found that people who avoid gluten may eat fewer whole-grain foods. Also, gluten-free packaged foods may have more sugar, fat, and salt than their gluten-containing counterparts. Gluten-free diets aren\u2019t inherently bad, but the way they\u2019ve been translated into the average diet isn\u2019t necessarily healthy, says Dr. Willett . People who need or want to avoid wheat should be sure to eat gluten-free whole grains such as brown rice, oats, buckwheat, and quinoa. \nSugar: Good news, bad news \nThe carbohydrates that pose the greatest threat to heart health are the simple, refined ones \u2014 especially sugar. High-sugar diets have been linked to a higher risk of heart disease, even in people who aren\u2019t overweight. Sugar-sweetened beverages such as sodas, energy drinks, and sports drinks contribute most of the added sugar in the average American\u2019s diet. But recent data show that consumption of sugary drinks has dropped by about 25% in the United States over the past decade, thanks in part to education campaigns and bans on soda sales in schools. This encouraging trend also seems to be slowing the growing epidemic of type 2 diabetes, which is closely linked to heart disease, says Dr. Willett \nUnfortunately, other sugar-awareness efforts are on hold. In 2016, the FDA approved a revamp of the Nutrition Facts label that would require food manufacturers to list added sugars in their products, among other changes. The rule was originally slated to take effect in July 2018 , but the agency announced earlier this year that it will postpone its implementation indefinitely. \nOne anticipated benefit of the label change was that companies would scale back the sugar in their products, similar to what happened with trans fats. In fact, some yogurt and beverage companies have already done so. It\u2019s too early to know if this strategy will prove successful, however. Some food companies that tried removing some sodium from certain products (such as soups and vegetable juices) have now reintroduced it, says Dr. Willett . \u201cTheir competitors didn\u2019t make the change, and the low-sodium products tasted different. We really need to create a level playing field,\u201d he says. \nSalt: Still too high \nIn 2016, the FDA proposed voluntary guidelines for the food industry to slash the amount of sodium in our food supply. Excess sodium (which pairs with chloride to form salt) is linked to high blood pressure, heart attacks, and stroke. The average American eats about 50% more sodium than nutrition experts recommend, and much of is already in their food before it reaches the table. \nTime will tell if the FDA guidelines will make a difference. But a recent study suggests that we\u2019ve been moving in the right direction: the average amount of sodium that households acquired from packaged foods and beverages decreased by 400 milligrams per capita between 2000 and 2014. In the meantime, see \u201cChoosing the healthiest supermarket products\u201d for tips on reading labels and ingredient lists while you shop. \nChoosing the healthiest grocery products \nWhen shopping for processed foods \u2014 anything bagged, packaged, canned, or bottled \u2014 check the Nutrition Facts label. Note that the Daily Value (DV) is the recommended level of a given nutrient for a person eating 2,000 calories per day. \nFor saturated fat, look for a % DV of 5% or less. \nThe same goes for sodium: % DV 5% or less. \nFor sugar, there is no % DV, but experts recommend that women consume no more than 24 grams daily; men should limit intake to 36 grams per day. \nWhen selecting breads, cereals, and grain-based foods, check the list of ingredients. The first ingredient should be a whole grain, such as whole wheat (not enriched wheat). \u201cMultigrain\u201d just means the product includes more than one grain \u2014 and they\u2019re not necessarily whole grains. \n(Harvard Heart Letter) \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

Hirata and Co-Authors Broaden Understanding of Nutritional Biochemistry (Xanthohumol, a hop-derived prenylated flavonoid, promotes macrophage reverse cholesterol transport) \nBy a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Health & Medicine Week -- Current study results on Diet and Nutrition - Nutritional Biochemistry have been published. According to news originating from Shizuoka, Japan , by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Xanthohumol, a prominent prenyl flavonoid from the hop plant (Humulus lupulus L.), is suggested to be antiatherogenic since it reportedly increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. It is not clear whether xanthohumol promotes reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), the most important antiatherogenic property of HDL; therefore, we investigated the effects of xanthohumol on macrophage-to-feces RCT using a hamster model as a CETP-expressing species.\" \nOur news journalists obtained a quote from the research, \"In vivo RCT experiments showed that xanthohumol significantly increased fecal appearance of the tracer derived from intraperitoneally injected [H-3]-cholesterol-labeled macrophages. Ex vivo experiments were then employed to investigate the detailed mechanism by which xanthohumol enhanced RCT. Cholesterol efflux capacity from macrophages was 1.5-fold higher in xanthohumol-fed hamsters compared with the control group. In addition, protein expression and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity in the HDL fraction were significantly higher in xanthohumol-fed hamsters compared with the control, suggesting that xanthohumol promoted HDL maturation. Hepatic transcript analysis revealed that xanthohumol increased mRNA expression of abcg8 and cyp7a1. In addition, protein expressions of liver X receptor alpha and bile pump export protein were increased in the liver by xanthohumol administration when compared with the control, implying that it stimulated bile acid synthesis and cholesterol excretion to feces.\" \nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Our data demonstrate that xanthohumol improves RCT in vivo through cholesterol efflux from macrophages and excretion to feces, leading to antiatheroscierosis effects. It remains to be elucidated whether enhancement of RCT by xanthohumol could prove valuable in humans.\" \nFor more information on this research see: Xanthohumol, a hop-derived prenylated flavonoid, promotes macrophage reverse cholesterol transport.

But now, thanks to vaccines and antibiotics, few of us need worry about \"catching\" anything worse than a cold, flu or an upset stomach. But have we become too complacent? \nScientists are finding evidence that you might be able to catch lifestyle disorders such as diabetes, Alzheimer's and even joint pain. \nLast year, scientists found that bacteria from the gut that have been linked to conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and allergies can form spores - tiny hibernating seeds - given off by bacteria that help it survive and multiply. \nThe research, published in the journal Nature, shows the spores can survive in the air and potentially infect others. \n\"This is a new way of transmitting disease that hasn't been considered,\" said researchers at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute . \nWe look at the surprising conditions researchers believe might be infectious. \nEarlier this year, US researchers suggested that ?Type 2 diabetes might be caught from damaged proteins known as prions - these are infectious agents, like those that transmitted BSE (or mad cow disease) from cattle to humans. \nThe suggestion might sound absurd at first, but a team at the University of Texas has found striking evidence, published in The Journal of Experimental Medicine . \nThe researchers found that most Type 2 patients had clumps of damaged protein, known as IAPP, in their pancreas, the organ which produces insulin vital for keeping blood sugar at the right level. \nThen, the team injected IAPP into the pancreas of healthy mice and within a few weeks the mice also had too much blood sugar, and the insulin-producing beta cells in their pancreas were dying. \nIt's not definitive proof that diabetes can be caught, but the team is investigating possible ways prions could infect humans, such as via blood transfusions or eating prion-infected meat. \nDespite scientists' efforts, we understand little about the cause for several diseases that slowly destroy brain cells, such as Alzheimer's or ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neurone disease) which causes creeping and total paralysis. \nRecently, however, a potential culprit has emerged - cyanobacteria, a close relative of algae, which creates blooms on lakes and ponds. \nIn the US, a neurologist identified ALS hot spots near lakes and wondered if cyanobacteria blooms on the water could be a factor. \nIt turned out that the air above a blooming lake was full of cyanobacteria, thrown up in the spray created by wind or boats, which could be inhaled. Then BMAA was found in diseased brains. \nEarlier this year, scientists at the American Institute for Ethnomedicine reported that vervet monkeys given BMAA developed the plaques and tangles found in the brains of ALS and Alzheimer's patients. \nThe team at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute , which discovered that human gut bacteria form \"spores\" that could leave the body and survive in the outside world, said certain types of gut bacteria were linked to obesity. \nThe Wellcome researchers suggested airborne obesity microbes could be part of the reason why obesity tends to run in families (as well as genetics and lifestyle). \nWe generally think of arthritis as mainly affecting the joints of older people. \nYet it might be that joint pain can be caused by bacteria. Among the bacteria most likely to affect the joints are staphylococcus, which are better known for causing skin and sinus problems; gonococcus - responsible for gonorrhoea; streptococcus that usually affects the skin and throat as well as causing meningitis and urinary tract infections; and pneumococcus which, along with pneumonia, also causes ear and sinus problems. \nThe thinking is that once you've caught an infection, even if this clears up, the bacteria can travel to any joint via the blood. \nCoeliac risk for a partner: \nWe know that the bacteria in our gut - our microbiome - can have a big impact on our health, including our immunity. \nBut could it also affect our risk of developing an auto-immune condition such as coeliac disease? The condition, which causes the immune system to react to gluten, a protein in wheat and other grains, is known to be genetically linked: first-degree relatives have a raised risk of it or other auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. \nTwo years ago Swedish researchers analysing a big database found that the risk was also the same for the non-related family member - the husband or the wife. \nThey suggested sharing living conditions means sharing gut microbes and that this somehow primed them for the condition. - Daily Mail \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

But do you know why? \nFibre is found in plant-based foods. It adds volume to your diet, but passes through the intestines quickly because the body can't digest it. That's why fibre can make you feel full faster and prevent constipation. It may also help lower your cholesterol level and reduce your risk for heart disease, obesity and diabetes. \nAccording to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics , women should get 25 grams of fibre every day and men, 38 grams. \nVegetables are a major source of fibre, some more than others. These include leafy, raw greens, and cruciferous ones such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts. Legumes such as lentils, dried peas and all manner of beans are other good sources of fibre; many even pack in protein, making them a substitution for meat. \nNuts and seeds also add fibre to your diet. Just watch quantities since they're very calorie dense. Put fresh and dried fruit on your list, too. Apples and pears with the skin are good choices. Also try raisins and prunes. \nHot cereal like oatmeal and cold cereal like bran flakes provide good amounts of fibre. And, of course, don't forget whole wheat bread and pastas, bran muffins, brown rice and even popcorn. However, ramping up your fibre intake too quickly can cause gas and bloating. \nSo if you're looking to fill up on fibre, experts say start slow and gradually increase the amount you eat every day. - New York Times \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

So far, the technique has been tested only temporarily in epilepsy patients as intraoperative studies, while it has shown consistent success in rats. However, focal cooling sometimes slightly increases the frequency of epileptic discharges in rats, even while suppressing their strength. \nTo investigate how focal cooling suppresses epileptic discharges with possible increase in frequency, the research team took a computational approach. They employed a model of the rat brain that allowed them to simulate different mechanisms underlying the effects of a focal cooling device on epileptic discharges. \nUsing data from laboratory and rat studies, the researchers first simulated a mechanism by which focal cooling reduces activity at connections between neurons, resulting in less frequent discharges. However, with this mechanism alone, the model could not accurately reproduce electrical activity patterns previously observed in focal brain cooling experiments on rats with drug-induced epilepsy. \nTo compensate for the first mechanism, the researchers devised a second mechanism in which cooling resulted in discharges that were persistent but weaker. Incorporating both mechanisms into the model allowed the team to successfully reproduce results from previous rat experiments. \nFocal brain cooling could be an alternative treatment for epileptic seizures with lower risk of irreversible functional loss compared to surgery, says study co-author Takatomi Kubo. Our study attempts to start an initiative on thermal neuromodulation of brain activity using a computational approach that can elucidate its mechanism and complement animal experiments and clinical tests. \nFurther investigation and laboratory studies could help the researchers refine their model and better understand the mechanisms that underpin focal cooling. \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

Each week, they invite expert guests to join them on their radio broadcast \"Successful Aging\" on Independent Talk 1100 KFNX. Dr. Theresa Ramsey is from The Center for Natural Healing and her focus in her clinical practice is in Lifestyle and Preventative Aging with Bio-Identical Hormone Replacement. \nThis week, Ramsey discussed the importance of vitamins and supplements and offered suggestions on how to best cope with symptoms of aging that many of us struggle with, such as loss of energy, getting enough sleep, maintaining sexual function, reducing memory issues, stress and anxiety. So many aging issues are caused because, quite simply, our diet is working against us, rather than for us. Lowering caloric intake can improve your energy. Americans overeat; it is a fact. Every time we are served a meal in a restaurant, there is more on our plate than we need to consume. That belly fat that everyone hates to carry around isn't just uncomfortable to look at, but it also stores a lot of inflammation that can lead to heart disease, strokes, cancer, diabetes and memory loss. \nRamsey said, \"If we can avoid grains and eat more protein, healthy fats and vegetables, exercise and keep our hormones balanced, we can lose the belly fat and help our metabolism to function properly.\" \nAnother issue that keeps us from living optimally is having our hormones out of whack. Hormones are produced in the body by endocrine glands and are transported by the blood to our organs to stimulate their function. \nThe saying \"sleep is overrated\" is not true. We need at least seven hours of sleep nightly to feel our best. Memory issues, sexual function, stress and anxiety can all be improved when our diet consists of live healthy foods that absorb well in our bodies and balanced hormones. \nWhen discussing vitamins, Ramsey has some favorites that she highly recommends for daily consumption: multi-vitamin, B complex, B-12 (if you are vegetarian or vegan, this is a must since B-12 is found in meat) and D3, which is actually a hormone, rather than vitamin, but crucial for bone health and for keeping your immune system strong. She also recommends fish oil, because our brains are made up of fats and it helps to keep our cells healthy and active. Vitamin A and probiotics are both good choices to help keep your immune system strong against flu and cold viruses. \nEach time Dr. Ramsey is on the show, you can feel the disappointment in Wenzlau's and Oakeson's voices as the show wraps up. They always have more questions than time to answer them all. Dr. Ramsey will be back on air soon, so make sure to tune in every Tuesday to Independent Talk KFNX 1100 as they continue to explore \"Successful Aging.\" For more information on these topics, or to ask a question, visit www.successfulaging.info. \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

This leads to overgrowth of a bacterium that causes liver inflammation and cell death, the study found. \nThe study was published in Nature Communications . It was performed with mouse models, healthy human volunteers, and data from chronic alcoholics. Bernd Schnabl , M.D., was the study's senior author. Cristina Llorente UCSD , was first author. \nProton pump inhibitors are the most effective class of acid reducers, used for such conditions as acid reflux. Unlike antacids such as Tums that neutralize acid, they prevent it from being produced in the first place. And they're widely prescribed or bought over the counter. An estimated 10 percent of the general population takes them. \nHowever, a series of studies has found evidence of potential harm from these drugs. Most of these studies examine correlations, so they don't establish cause and effect. They do suggest that proton pump inhibitors should only be taken when there's a good medical reason. \nLong-term use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with a higher death rate, according to a study released in July. Another correlational study published in 2015 found that who take the drugs have a higher rate of heart attacks. \nOther health concerns linked to use of proton pump inhibitors are vitamin B12 deficiency, reduced effect of chemotherapy for cancer, and increased risk of chronic kidney disease. \nChanges in the gut's microbial population, or \"microbiome,\" associated with taking these drugs has come under increasing scrutiny as a potential cause of some of these ill effects. \nMeanwhile, various liver diseases, both caused by alcohol abuse and other factors, have been increasing in prevalence. \nAround 75-100 million Americans are estimated to have Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, or NAFLD, characterized by excessive fat deposits in the liver. It may not produce symptoms, but in about 25 percent of cases, it can progress to more serious diseases. \nBacterial overgrowth \nPrevious research indicates that the liver acts as a \"firewall,\" capturing gut bacteria escaping into the bloodstream. This establishes a link between what happens in the gut and in the liver. \nA 2014 study from the Mayo Clinic found that regular users of proton pump inhibitors have a less diverse microbiome, putting them at higher risk for infection by dangerous microbes such as Clostridium difficile, along with vitamin deficiencies and bone fractures. \nThe new UCSD -led study found that proton pump inhibitors allow greater growth of Enterococcus in the intestine. Some of the bacteria migrate to the liver, causing inflammation. \nIn the mouse models, liver inflammation promoted progression of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis, and alcoholic liver disease. The mice were either given a proton pump inhibitor or genetically engineered to lack acid production. Some were also given alcohol, to cause alcohol-induced liver disease. \nData from healthy human volunteers indicated that the mechanism found in mice could be at work in people. These volunteers, who were not previously taking proton pump inhibitors, took the commonly used generic PPI omeprazole for 14 days. Levels of Enterococcus rose after the treatment, according to stool samples. \n\"Translocating enterococci lead to hepatic inflammation and hepatocyte death,\" the study stated. \"Notably, expansion of intestinal Enterococcus faecalis (Efaecalis) is sufficient to exacerbate ethanol-induced liver disease in mice. Proton pump inhibitor use increases the risk of developing alcoholic liver disease among alcohol-dependent patients.\" \nRecords of 4,830 chronic alcoholics were examined for the study to assess their risk for a diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease over 10 years. For the 1,024 active PPI users, the risk was 20.7 percent. For the 745 who had previously used proton pump inhibitors, the risk declined to 16.1 percent. And for the 3,061 who had never used PPIs, the risk fell to 12.4 percent. \nUse with caution \n\"Although obesity and alcohol use predispose a person to acid reflux requiring antacid medication, many patients with chronic liver disease take gastric acid suppressive medications without appropriate indication,\" Schnabl said in a UCSD statement. \"We believe clinicians should consider withholding medications that suppress gastric acid unless there is a strong medical indication.\" \nIn some cases, those with acid reflux or heartburn can reduce or eliminate symptoms without drugs, by changes in diet or by losing weight. \nOther institutions involved in the study included: VA San Diego Healthcare System ; ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "schnabl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cristina llorente", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "non-alcoholic steatohepatitis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernd schnabl", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "san diego union-tribune", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "university of california san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "va san diego healthcare system", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nature communications", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "proton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucsd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mayo clinic", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T21:09:29.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c8040ed304fa8b34b7b48724e62ab1ec05e18474", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.bwMorvmoS1n6WzWewkYzLTqA2TyAqeSUddseVU6Wh767vWKsQbIff5.CvwIFSRrS7Gol3UJ8EXVcqFY77d0UtlUfh12NiU7k-", "site_full": "www.lifeextension.com", "site": "lifeextension.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Life Extension Daily News", "title_full": "Life Extension Daily News", "published": "2017-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.142, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19569, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c8040ed304fa8b34b7b48724e62ab1ec05e18474", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.bwMorvmoS1n6WzWewkYzLTqA2TyAqeSUddseVU6Wh767vWKsQbIff5.CvwIFSRrS7Gol3UJ8EXVcqFY77d0UtlUfh12NiU7k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Life Extension Daily News", "text": "\n, Oct. 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Life Extension\u00ae, one of the dietary supplement industry's foremost research and product development companies, has introduced Optimized NAD+ Cell Regenerator\u2122 with Resveratrol, combining unique nutrients for longevity and youthful cellular energy production. \nLife Extension was among the first to promote the amazing health benefits of both resveratrol and later, NIAGEN\u00ae, the first commercially available form of nicotinamide riboside. Now, both powerful nutrients for cellular health and longevity, plus synergistic phytonutrients like fisetin, quercetin, and trans-pterostilbene, compounds that augment resveratrol's healthy effects, promote cardiovascular health, encourage a healthy inflammatory response, healthy gene expression, and more, are combined in a single, convenient, anti-aging formula. \nAge-related declines in cellular metabolism and energy production can lead to feelings of fatigue. NIAGEN increases cellular levels of NAD+, an enzyme critical to healthy cellular energy production. The Life Extension formula provides the optimal dose. In a new clinical study, 250 mg of nicotinamide riboside plus 50 mg of pterostilbene led to a 40 percent increase in NAD+ levels. \n\"Increasing NAD+ also encourages healthy cognitive function in aging adults and supports healthy blood sugar levels already within the normal range, all important factors to longevity and overall health,\" says Michael A. Smith , M.D., senior health scientist for Life Extension in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \nGene expression is the process by which genes transmit signals to the rest of the body. \"Resveratrol is a plant compound that supports the healthy expression of genes associated with slowing down aspects of the aging process, and may be the most effective compound for maintaining optimal health and promoting longevity, period,\" says Dr. Smith . \nResveratrol also promotes healthy insulin sensitivity, encourages enhanced mitochondrial function, promotes a healthy inflammatory response, and protects against the effects of a high-fat diet.

According to news reporting originating in Oporto, Portugal , by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Exceptional long-lived individuals, i.e., centenarians, are thought to have survived or escaped diseases that are common causes of death at younger ages. A better understanding of their health profile and health trajectories provides important information for geriatric care provision.\" \nThe news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the University of Porto , \"This study aims to examine morbidity profiles of a sample of Portuguese centenarians with a particular focus on the characteristics of those who have evaded a list of age-related illnesses. Two hundred and forty-one centenarians (M age = 101.16 years; 88% female) from two centenarian studies were considered. They and/or their proxies were asked on their health history and then labeled as 'escapers'', 'survivors'' or 'delayers'' following Evert et al.' s morbidity typology (2003). Sociodemographic characteristics, physical and mental health status of each group were analyzed. Sensorial impairments and incontinence were the most frequent conditions reported. Considering the three most lethal diseases of the elderly population (heart disease, non-skin cancer and stroke), we verified that 70.6% of centenarians escaped these diseases, and 18.2% experienced a delayed onset of such diseases until the age of 80. Findings reinforce the great variability of age-related pathologies and overall health status in centenarians, but that a great majority had the ability to evade the most lethal conditions.\" \nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Management of patients with multimorbidity in very advanced ages has become a major healthcare challenge and our findings provide further evidence for policies and targeted interventions for this population.\" \nFor more information on this research see: Escaping most common lethal diseases in old age: Morbidity profiles of Portuguese centenarians.

They say immunotherapy's problem is its use in patients has outpaced a fundamental understanding of how it works. \nTo remedy that, they are running an ambitious program that links animal research, novel human trials and intense monitoring of tumors via repeated biopsies. By analyzing the malignancies before, during and after treatment, they hope to better understand the interaction among the cancer, the treatment and the immune system. They know using combinations of therapies for cancer probably will be the key to better outcomes for patients, but they need to figure out exactly which drugs to use, and how. \nAllison doesn't hesitate to tell Sharma what works best for laboratory research. She pushes back on any suggestions that might not help patients, reminding Allison he isn't a physician. \nAnd if they can't compromise, who wins? \"Pam,\" said the gravelly voiced Allison. \"She's louder.\" \n\"I just want things to move things faster,\" she countered. \nOn the sprawling MD Anderson campus, Sharma speed-walks, doling out medical advice, pep talks and the latest test results. \nShe warmly greets Michael Lee Lanning , a retired Army lieutenant colonel who was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2003. Within three years, the disease spread throughout his body, and doctors sent him home with painkillers and phone numbers for hospice. He was 59. \nLooking for a reprieve, he went to MD Anderson and met Sharma. \"She looked me in the eye and said, 'Everyone will die, and some will die sooner,' \" he recalled. A \"cold b----,\" he told his wife. \nBut, as he ran through treatment after treatment, Lanning came to appreciate Sharma's refusal to give up. Two years ago, she had him enroll in a trial testing a combination of radiation and Yervoy, a medication developed by Allison that was the first checkpoint inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration . The treatment kept Lanning's cancer under control until this past December, when the tumors once more began growing and he repeated the one-two punch of radiation and Yervoy. More recently, to keep the tumors in check, he began taking a different immunotherapy drug. \n\"I didn't think I'd make it to 60,\" said Lanning. Now he's 71 years old. His beloved granddaughter, who was 8 when he was diagnosed, is now in college. \nSharma has pushed for close monitoring of tumors in various stages of treatment, believing it provides critical clues about why only some patients respond to immunotherapy and about how to design subsequent trials and experiments. Allison, a fan of the strategy, made its broad expansion a condition of his move from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York to MD Anderson in 2012. Today, about 100 of the center's trials involve such intense surveillance. \nWhile other cancer hospitals do similar analysis, the scale of the effort at MD Anderson sets it apart. \"I'm jealous,\" said Charles Drake , co-director of the cancer immunotherapy programs at Columbia University Medical Center in New York . \"They can apply state-of-the-art analytical tools to tumor specimens before, during and after treatments and see the results in real time.\" \nNow Sharma and Allison are bringing their approach to advanced prostate cancer, notoriously resistant to immunotherapy. Previous research has shown combining two immunotherapy drugs might be better than using just one. In a trial overseen by Sharma, one drug is used to drive T cells, the foot soldiers of the immune system, to the tumor, and a second to block proteins that keep those soldiers from attacking the malignancy. \n\"We have to try,\" she says. \"At least these treatments give our patients a chance.\" \n--- \nBy outward appearance, Allison and Sharma are opposites. She's 47, striking and model-thin; he's 69, rumpled and pudgy. \nJust as pronounced are their similarities. They bonded years ago over their shared obsession with T cells, and these days, Sharma says, \"we talk about data all the time, at dinner, while brushing our teeth.\" \nAllison grew up in a small town in South Texas where his country-doctor father made house calls. His mother died of lymphoma when he was 11 - just the first of many family losses to cancer. Two uncles and a brother later died of the disease. Allison has battled early-stage melanoma, bladder and prostate cancers. \nHe went into cancer research not because of family history but because he always wanted to be the first person to figure something out. Early on in classes at the University of Texas at Austin , he realized that medical school wasn't for him. \"If you are a doctor, you have to do the right thing; otherwise, you could hurt somebody,\" he says. \"I like being on the edge and being wrong a lot.\" \nAllison did not attend medical school, but he did earn a PhD from the University of Texas at Austin . In the mid-1990s, while doing research at the University of California at Berkeley , he became intrigued by a molecule called CTLA-4, which exists on the surface of T cells. It was widely thought to spur the immune system into action.

Women are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease more often than men. \nThe study, by researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine and the University of Arizona Health Sciences , was published Tuesday in Plos One. \n\"This study suggests there may be a critical window of opportunity, when women are in their 40s and 50s, to detect metabolic signs of higher Alzheimer's risk and apply strategies to reduce that risk,\" Dr. Lisa Mosconi , associate director of the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, said in a news release. \nResearchers used positron emission tomography, or PET, scans to measure the use of glucose in the brains of 43 healthy women age 40 to 60 years old. Fifteen of the women were pre-menopausal, 14 were transitioning to menopause, or peri-menopausal, and 14 were menopausal. \nThe study showed that women who had undergone menopause or were peri-menopausal had significantly lower levels of glucose metabolism in key brain regions compared to women who were pre-menopausal. Low levels of glucose metabolism in the brain has been linked to the earliest development of Alzheimer's disease. \n\"Our findings show that the loss of estrogen in menopause doesn't just diminish fertility,\" Mosconi said. \"It also means the loss of a key neuroprotective element in the female brain and a higher vulnerability to brain aging and Alzheimer's disease. We urgently need to address these problems because, currently, 850 million women worldwide are entering or have entered menopause. Our studies demonstrate that women need medical attention in their 40s, well in advance of any endocrine or neurological symptoms.\" \nMenopause has been known to cause brain-related symptoms such as depression, anxiety, insomnia and cognitive defects. Researchers believe these declines are caused in part by declines in estrogen levels. \n\"Our work indicates that women may need antioxidants to protect their brain activity and mitochondria in combination with strategies to maintain estrogen levels,\" Mosconi said. \"We believe that more research is needed to test efficacy and safety of hormonal-replacement therapies at the very early stages of menopause, and to correlate hormonal changes with risk of Alzheimer's. This is a major priority at our Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic .\" \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

Both afatinib and neratinib were designed to inhibit EGFR and HER2 kinases, which are enzymes that regulate cancer cell growth and chemotherapy resistance. \nWhen we looked at the cells under the microscope, we saw neratinib, but not afatinib, causing large vesicles to form next to the cell\u2019s outer membrane. \nAfatinib is similar to neratinib, however, neratinib irreversibly attaches itself onto EGFR and HER2. This attachment permanently blocks the function of the receptors, causing the cell to target them for degradation. Dr Paul Dent who is the Universal Corporation Chair in Cancer Cell Signaling and a member of the Cancer Cell Signaling research program at Massey and this team at the VCU Massey Cancer Center showed that neratinib can, in fact, kill afatinib-resistant NSCLC cells. \n\u201cWhen we looked at the cells under the microscope, we saw neratinib, but not afatinib, causing large vesicles to form next to the cell\u2019s outer membrane. In these vesicles, we saw the EGFR and HER2 receptors being broken down, but we also saw our negative control receptor, c-MET,\u201d said Dr Dent . \u201cIn science, a negative control experiment is something that isn\u2019t expected to work, thereby further validating what you were trying to prove. We thought, \u2018if neratinib can take down c-MET even though it doesn\u2019t attach to it, maybe it can take down other membrane proteins.'\u201d \nWe found that neratinib triggers a seismic event in the plasma membrane \nThe vesicles the researchers saw were part of a process known as autophagy, a natural mechanism that breaks down and recycles unwanted cellular components. Because it is a membrane protein, the scientists turned their attention to Ras. And because of evidence that the common seizure medication valproic acid can influence the regulation of autophagy, they decided to test whether it could synergize with neratinib to further block the actions of Ras. \nIn addition to the afatinib-resistant NSCLC cells, the researchers tested the neratinib and valproic acid combination on cell lines derived from human pancreatic and ovarian cancers containing K-Ras mutations and N-Ras mutations, respectively. \n\u201cWe found that neratinib triggers a seismic event in the plasma membrane where not only are ERBB family receptors such as EGFF and HER2 degraded, but other related receptors in the membrane are brought along for the ride,\u201d said Dr Dent . \u201cWe plan to conduct additional experiments to better understand the process, but the result was rapidly reduced expression of mutated K- and N-Ras.\u201d \nDr Dent currently has another manuscript in press at the journal Cancer Biology and Therapy, which is a follow-up study detailing additional findings from his experiments. As he works to better understand the biology of neratinib-induced Ras inhibition, Dr Dent hopes his laboratory findings can be validated in clinical trials testing a combination of neratinib and valproic acid in patients with afatinib-resistant NSCLC. \nWe are excited about the potential of neratinib to treat a variety of cancers. \nIn addition, the study uncovered other exciting clinical possibilities for neratinib. The scientists tested neratinib in animal models of breast cancer and found that it enhanced the effectiveness of previously established drug combinations, including pemetrexed and sorafenib, which is currently being tested in a phase 2 clinical trial at Massey for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer. Dr Dent is collaborating with Massey clinical researchers to propose a study investigating the effectiveness of the combination of neratinib, sorafenib and pemetrexed in all advanced solid tumours. \n\u201cWe are excited about the potential of neratinib to treat a variety of cancers and complement existing therapies,\u201d said Dr Dent . \u201cWe are creating clinical trial concepts and hoping to secure funding to test them. Because neratinib is already approved by the FDA , as is valproic acid, we\u2019re hopeful that we can translate our findings to the clinic relatively quickly once funding is secured.\u201d \nThe study has been published in the journal Oncotarget. \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

FILE PHOTO | NMG Giving Vitamin A supplements to pregnant women during pregnancy and after delivery reduces mother-to-child HIV transmission, a study has shown. According to researchers, the supplements especially come in handy in remote areas where facilities and medication may not be readily available. Researchers from South African Medical Reseach Council said the Vitamin A intervention has largely been superseded by Antiretroviral therapy (ART) which is widely available and effective in preventing vertical transmission. Professor Charles Wiysonge, lead researcher, and director of the South African Cochrane Centre , at the South African Medical Research Council , said in some low and middle countries with high rate of infections, interventions may not be practical or affordable. \u201cSimple, inexpensive, and effective interventions that could potentially be implemented even in the absence of prenatal HIV testing programmes would be valuable. Vitamin A, which plays a role in immune function, is one low-cost intervention that has been suggested in such settings,\u201d says Prof Wiysonge. He said other studies in sub-Saharan Africa have shown low serum vitamin A levels in HIV-positive women to be associated with significantly increased rates of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and infant mortality. \u201cVitamin A was assumed to decrease mother-to-child transmission of HIV by acting through several maternal, foetal, child risk factors for transmission, or all three,\u201d he said. The study was supported by World Health Organisation findings (WHO), which states that over 1,000 new cases of mother-to-child transmission occur worldwide every day, making this the main route of transmission of HIV infection in children. The WHO revealed that Vitamin A deficiency also affects about 19 million pregnant women, mostly from Africa and has been associated with an increase in the risk of transmission of HIV from mother to child. \u201cDuring pregnancy, vitamin A is essential for maternal health and for the healthy development of the fetus. As vitamin A also plays an important role in immune function, it has been suggested that providing vitamin A supplements may reduce the risk of transmission,\u201d states WHO. \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

If you think you're having a heart attack, should you take aspirin? \n[Heart attack is a subject too vast for one column. We'll need three. This is the first installment.] \nA. A blood clot in a coronary artery narrowed by cholesterol and other substances is the usual cause of a heart attack. Aspirin keeps blood moving through constricted arteries. Therefore, paramedics may give aspirin when they respond to an emergency to treat a heart-attack victim. \nAspirin reduces mortality from heart attacks. But taking aspirin is a subject you should discuss with your doctor. Aspirin could hurt you if your symptoms are caused by a different health problem. \nDoctors call a heart attack a \"myocardial infarction.\" Loosely translated, the term means heart-muscle death. The clogged artery prevents oxygenated blood from nourishing the heart. This can lead to pain, the death of heart cells, scar tissue and fatal arrythmias. \nAbout 1.1 million Americans have a heart attack every year. About 460,000 of those heart attacks are fatal. About half the fatalities happen within an hour after symptoms begin and before the victim gets to a hospital. \nHow do you know if you're having a heart attack? Here are six common warning signs: \nMost heart attacks involve discomfort in the center of the chest that lasts more than a few minutes. It may pause for a while and then restart. The discomfort can be in the form of pain or pressure. Some experience a squeezing or feeling of fullness.Pain in shoulders, arms, back, upper abdomen, neck and jawShortness of breathCold sweatNauseaLightheadednessAnxiety \nAngina pectoris is the medical term for chest pain or discomfort usually caused by coronary artery disease. Angina (pronounced \"an-JI-nuh\" or \"AN-juh-nuh\") is not a heart attack. However, there's a higher risk of a heart attack if you have angina. \nIt is often difficult to tell the difference between a heart attack and angina. If you get angina, you should get medical attention immediately. Exertion brings on angina. It's usually relieved by resting or taking angina medicine. \nA heart attack can happen anytime - during exertion or at rest. Some heart attacks are like the ones you see in films and on stage; they're sudden and dramatic. However, most heart attacks build gradually over several hours. Many heart-attack victims have symptoms days or weeks in advance. \nIf you think you're having a heart attack, call 9-1-1 immediately. There are drugs that break up clots and open arteries; they work best when given within the first hour after the onset of an attack. \nIf emergency medical services are not available, ask someone to drive you to the hospital. You shouldn't drive yourself, unless you have no other choice. \nWhile it may seem macabre, planning for a heart attack is intelligent. Having a basic plan in place could save time and a life. Map out your steps if an attack happened at home or at work. For example, decide who would care for any dependents. And discussing aspirin with your doctor in advance will give you a clear course of action if you have a heart attack. \nCicetti is a health care writer with more than 40 years of journalistic experience. \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

The mouse laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) model was used to mimic some of the inflammatory aspect of AMD. CNV was compared between wild-type (WT) and Apn(-/-) mice fed either otherwise matched diets with 2% x3 or 2% omega 6-LCPUFAs. Vldlr(-/-) mice were used to mimic some of the metabolic aspects of AMD. Choroid assay ex vivo and human retinal microvascular endothelial cell (HRMEC) proliferation assay in vitro was used to investigate the APN pathway in angiogenesis. Western blot for p-AMPK alpha/AMPK alpha and qPCR for Apn, Mmps, and IL-10 were used to define mechanism. omega 3-LCPUFA intake suppressed laser-induced CNV in WT mice; suppression was abolished with APN deficiency. omega 3-LCPUFA, mediated by APN, decreased mouse Mmps expression. APN deficiency decreased AMPK alpha phosphorylation in vivo and exacerbated choroid-sprouting ex vivo. APN pathway activation inhibited HRMEC proliferation and decreased Mmps. In Vldlr(-/-) mice, omega 3-LCPUFA increased retinal AdipoR1 and inhibited NV. omega 3-LCPUFA decreased IL-10 but did not affect Mmps in Vldlr(-/-) retinas. APN in part mediated omega 3-LCPUFA inhibition of neovascularization in two mouse models of AMD.\" \nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Modulating the APN pathway in conjunction with a omega 3-LCPUFA-enriched-diet may augment the beneficial effects of omega 3-LCPUFA in AMD patients.\" \nFor more information on this research see: Adiponectin Mediates Dietary Omega-3 Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Protection Against Choroidal Neovascularization in Mice.

There is no promising therapeutic agent against ammonia-induced complications. The present study was conducted to evaluate the role of carnosine (CA) administration on liver pathological changes, elevated plasma ammonia, and its consequent events in cirrhotic rats. Bile duct ligated (BDL) rats were used as a model of cirrhosis. CA (250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg, daily, i.p) was administered for 28 consecutive days to BDL animals. At the end of treatments, markers of oxidative stress and liver fibrosis was determined in liver and serum biomarkers of liver injury and plasma ammonia was assessed. Moreover, changes in animals' locomotor activity were monitored. Severe bridging fibrosis, inflammation, and necrosis in liver, along with elevated serum biomarkers of liver injury were evident in BDL animals. Furthermore, plasma ammonia was drastically elevated in cirrhotic rats and animals' locomotor activity was suppressed. It was found that CA (250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg, daily, i.p) significantly alleviated liver injury and its consequent events in cirrhotic rats.\" \nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The data suggested that CA is not only a useful and safe agent to preserve liver function, but also prevented hyperammonemia and brain damage as a deleterious consequence of cirrhosis and liver failure.\" \nFor more information on this research see: Carnosine ameliorates liver fibrosis and hyperammonemia in cirrhotic rats.

Nonetheless, ER physicians must maintain a high level of suspicion for heart attack or unstable angina as a cause of the patient's chest pain. Heart attacks that are missed in the ER are associated with a significant number of deaths, and missed diagnoses are common grounds for legal action. \nWith that in mind, most ER physicians have a low threshold to rule out a heart attack, running multiple electrocardiograms and troponin blood tests that check for chemical signs of a heart attack, and very often order admission to the observation unit for stress testing.

Of the 257 medical students studied, more than 55 percent were confident they could counsel patients on nutritional recommendations, but half did not achieve a passing score on a nutrition quiz, according to a study published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association . \nOf particular note, only 12 percent were aware of Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), a key guide to differentiated nutrition requirements, although more than 68 percent agreed that primary care physicians should counsel patients about nutrition. \n\"There is a long-standing disconnect in medicine. Nutrition is understood to be integral to overall health, but it is not given serious attention in physician education,\" said Elizabeth Beverly , PhD, the lead author of this study and assistant professor at Ohio University Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine . \"The lack of knowledge about dietary reference intakes, which tell physicians what kind of nutrient and energy intake their patients need, is concerning because the guidelines vary dramatically by age, sex, and other factors, like pregnancy and disease.\" \nPrior research has shown that physicians who are overly confident are less likely to seek additional resources and more likely to misdiagnose patients. Researchers expressed concern that overconfident medical students may not attempt to further understand or explore important nutritional recommendations when treating patients in the future. \nThe National Academy of Science recommends 25 hours of nutrition education for physicians. However, multiple studies have confirmed that most medical schools fall significantly short of that goal. \nBeverly and her co-authors recommend developing nutrition-related competencies, as well as including nutrition questions on board certification examinations, to help ensure that schools adhere to the minimum number of hours of nutrition education. \n\"Medical schools are focused on preparing students to pass board certification exams. Currently, nutrition knowledge is not evaluated by most certification boards,\" says Beverly. \"If we can change that, schools will adjust their curriculum accordingly and we should ultimately see an improvement in patient education and care.\" \nThe complete study can be found at jaoa.org . \nAbout The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "elizabeth beverly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beverly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "life extension daily news", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "ohio university", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "national academy of science", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american osteopathic association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio university heritage college of osteopathic medicine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T18:32:03.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b531efba71d6b8ca2892bcb98288353418da2db0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.bwMorvmoS1n6WzWewkYzLTqA2TyAqeSUddseVU6Wh767vWKsQbIff5.CvwIFSRrRviE6OhgLLEX.BHsZVzicUMsyoaqmt.Xg-", "site_full": "www.lifeextension.com", "site": "lifeextension.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Life Extension Daily News", "title_full": "Life Extension Daily News", "published": "2017-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.142, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19569, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b531efba71d6b8ca2892bcb98288353418da2db0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.bwMorvmoS1n6WzWewkYzLTqA2TyAqeSUddseVU6Wh767vWKsQbIff5.CvwIFSRrRviE6OhgLLEX.BHsZVzicUMsyoaqmt.Xg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Life Extension Daily News", "text": "One in eight deaths last year caused by dementia \nCape Community 10-16-17 \nFile image One in eight deaths last year caused by dementia \nNEARLY one in eight deaths last year were caused by Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia, figures showed yesterday. \nDementia has become the leading cause of death as other diseases are gradually conquered, and as the increasingly aged population means more and more people are vulnerable. \nThe breakdown from the Office for National Statistics found that dementia was responsible for 12 percent of all deaths in 2016, with heart disease, for many years the greatest killer, the cause of 11 percent. \nDementia became the most common killer in 2015 after numbers of deaths from heart disease declined rapidly \u2013 and last year the gap between the number of dementia and heart disease deaths widened. \nThe share of deaths from heart disease for both men and women has more than halved since the start of this century, while dementia deaths have more than doubled. \nVasita Patel, of the ONS said: \u2018Although increases in longevity and improved treatment of other conditions are part of the reason for this increase, improvements in recognition, identification and diagnosis of dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease have also contributed.\u2019 \nDementia is itself a cause of death, because the gradual decline in the condition of sufferers means that eventually their brain can no longer maintain the functions of the body. But people in its later stages are also vulnerable to other diseases and infections. A doctor may choose to record any of these as the cause of death on a death certificate. \nThe ONS report found that there were 525,048 deaths in England and Wales in 2016, down by 0.9 per cent on the year before thanks to better health and greater longevity. \nA total of 62,948 died from dementia, 41,747 of them women and 21,201 men. \nThe biggest killer among men was still heart disease, but among women dementia deaths were nearly double those from heart disease. \nA total of 57,777 died from heart disease, 35,418 of them men and 22,359 women. \nThe third most common cause of death was strokes, which killed 32,627 last year. \nDementia was the biggest killer of people over 80, responsible for nearly one in five of all deaths in this age group. \nAt younger ages, people were more likely to die from heart disease or cancers. For those aged between 35 and 49, the greatest cause of death among women was breast cancer, and, among men, suicide. \nThe new evidence of the growing threat of dementia brought warnings from pressure groups over the failure of governments to produce ideas to improve the struggling system of providing care for older people who can no longer cope by themselves. \nNicola O\u2019Brien, of the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, said that the figures were \u2018a further wake-up call that the UK is woefully underprepared to cope with the scale of the challenge\u2019. \n\u00a9 Daily Mail \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

Rather, the NIA emphasizes the importance of choosing low-calorie foods that have a lot of the nutrients the body needs. \nBut counting calories can be an effective and simple way to maintain a healthy weight, provided those calories are coming from nutrient-rich foods. \nWhen choosing foods to eat, the NIA recommends eating many different colors and types of vegetables and fruits. \nThe Produce for Better Health Foundation notes that a varied, colorful diet incorporates lots of different types of phytochemicals, which the PBH says have disease-preventing properties. \nThe NIA also advises that men and women over 50 make sure at least half the grains in their diets are whole grains. Numerous studies have discovered the various benefits of whole grains, which are loaded with protein, fiber, antioxidants and other nutrients. Whole grains have been shown to reduce the risk for diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some types of cancer. \nAnother potential hurdle men and women over 50 may encounter is a change in their sense of smell and taste. A person's sense of smell may fade with age, and because smell and taste are so closely related, foods enjoyed for years may no longer tantalize the taste buds. \nThat can be problematic, as many people instinctually add more salt to foods they find bland. \nAccording to the U.S. Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion , older adults should consume no more than 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day. That equates to roughly 3/4 teaspoon of salt. \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

But even if seniors find gyms intimidating, they should still sign up for memberships. In such situations, the following tips can help seniors shed their fears and adapt to their new gyms. \nStart the process slowly \nShop around for a gym that makes you feel comfortable. Get fully informed about which classes are offered, and the benefits, if any, afforded to older members. \nGet a doctor's go-ahead Make sure to clear exercise and gym membership with your doctor prior to purchasing a membership. \nHe or she also may have a list of gyms where fellow senior patients have memberships. \nBuild up gradually \nBegin with exercises you feel comfortable performing. Spend time walking on the treadmill while observing other gym members. \nTour the circuit of machines and other equipment. Find out if you can sample a class to see if it might be a good fit. \nFind a gym buddy Working out with a partner in your age group may encourage you to keep going to the gym and increase your comfort level. \nYou each can offer support and enjoy a good laugh through the learning process. \nDon't get discouraged \nAnyone working out for the first time, regardless of age, will feel somewhat out of place until exercise becomes part of a routine. Give it some time before throwing in the towel. \nOnce you catch on, you may discover you enjoy working out. \nChoose a senior-friendly gym \nSome gyms cater to senior members. They may offer \"SilverSneakers\" classes at their facility. \nOther niche gyms may only accept members of a certain age group. Investigate these gyms if working out with a younger crowd is proving too great a deterrent. \nFitness is important for healthy seniors. It can prolong life, help seniors maintain healthy weights and reduce their risk of injury. \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

Attempting to \nachieve great health in each of these three categories can be difficult \u2014 especially within our environment. Outdoor air quality is a hot topic \u2014 and for good reason \u2014 but there are dangers in the air we breathe indoors as well. A toxin not visible to the naked eye could cut your life short.\n\nWhat Is Asbestos and Mesothelioma? Asbestos is a microscopic, naturally occurring fiber that was commonly used in building materials through the 1970s because of its fire retardant properties. Unfortunately, the material also causes mesothelioma , a rare form of cancer. When asbestos is disturbed, the asbestos dust is inhaled and embedded in the lining of the organs. The three main types of mesothelioma occur in the lungs, heart, and the abdominal cavity. The most common form of mesothelioma is pleural, occurring in the lining of the lungs. Mesothelioma has also been described in the testicles but little is known about the form. \n\nThe disease has a long latency period: Symptoms typically do not manifest until 20 to 50 years after asbestos exposure. Mesothelioma symptoms are particular to where the cancer develops, which makes diagnosis difficult because each form presents itself differently. Symptoms of pleural mesothelioma impact lung function, resulting in fluid build-up in the lungs and difficulty breathing. Patients with pleural mesothelioma symptoms are often misdiagnosed as having more common illnesses such as the flu or pneumonia. These roadblocks to proper diagnosis often lead to patients going undiagnosed until the cancer is stage three or four and has spread. At this stage of the disease, prognosis is poor and often treatment options are no longer viable. Patients are typically only given 12 to 21 months to live. There is currently no cure for mesothelioma so the best course of action is to avoid asbestos exposure.\n\nHow Does Asbestos Exposure Occur? There have been three waves of asbestos exposure. The first involved those who worked with the materials \u2014 mostly male employees of industrial companies or the military. The second wave occurred when the asbestos fibers were brought home on the clothing of those workers and they unknowingly exposed their families to the toxin. The third and current wave of asbestos exposure is due in part to the DIY craze . Homeowners undertaking their own home renovations are unaware of the possibility of asbestos in their home and do not take the necessary precautions. If your home was built prior to the 1980s, it is best to have a professional inspect your home for asbestos before beginning any renovation project. \n\nWhere Was Asbestos Used? Asbestos was used in many building materials including insulation, roofing, and floor and ceiling tiles. The toxin was also used in wallpaper, paneling, furnaces, and boilers. In addition to building materials, asbestos has been found in automotive materials such as brake pads, brake linings, transmission plates, and clutch linings.\n\nIs Asbestos Still Legal? While asbestos is no longer mined in the United States, the toxin is still legal to use and regularly imported. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) did try to achieve a complete ban of asbestos in the 1970s but their efforts were overturned after those benefiting from its use protested. In 2007 action was taken again when a bill called the \u201cBan Asbestos in America Act\u201d passed the Senate unanimously. Unfortunately, the bill was thwarted in the House and never made it to the president's desk. While a complete asbestos ban is expected in Canada this year, other developing countries are experiencing a growth of asbestos trade and use. A complete ban of asbestos in the United States is not expected under the current presidential administration. \n\nAbout: Rachel Lynch is the Press and Media Coordinator for the Mesothelioma Cancer Alliance, specializing in asbestos use around the world. \n\nReferences: Mesothelioma Cancer Alliance.

'The fact that the sun isn't up until a quarter after 7 and it is pitch black outside by 5, that is different than a spring day. [In the winter,] your circadian rhythm gets messed up.' Seides had noted in the past that heart attack admissions to Washington Hospital Center dropped during summer months, which he always attributed to people going away on vacations and relaxing. 'Maybe I am looking at it the wrong way,' he says. 'There may not be a reduction over the summer, but maybe an increase in the winter.' \nMurray Mittleman , director of the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Research Unit at Harvard Medical School , recalls first spotting the phenomenon more than 10 years ago while looking at deaths in Hawaii . Targeting 1984 through 1993, he found that more than 11,000 people died from coronary heart disease. Of those deaths, 10.4 percent occurred in August, while 13.3 percent occurred in March, a variance of about 22 percent. And that surprised him. \nHe assumed that more people died in the winter in colder regions. He thought those colder temperature could cause heart-related events because blood vessels constrict in the cold, which might set off cardiac death, he said. But during the time frame of his study, the average temperature in Hawaii was 77 degrees; nonetheless, more people died in the winter months. \n'The thing about the winter statistics which is kind of interesting,' Mittleman said, is that 'we see similar patterns in different places. There are more cardiac deaths in the Northern Hemisphere in December, January and February, and in the Southern Hemisphere in June and July. Hawaii North America .' \nHeart attacks and strokes result from a complicated cascade of events often set off by a trigger - stress, the misuse of drugs, tobacco or alcohol, a heavy meal, the flu, even an earthquake or environmental pollution - that interrupts the body's normal systems. \nMost cardiac deaths, according to Peter Stone , co-director of the Samuel A. Levine Cardiac Unit at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston , are due to a disruption of plaque accumulated on the walls of blood vessels. Plaque then interacts with platelets to form clots, impeding blood flow to the heart, which causes a heart attack, or to the brain, which causes a stroke. \nAs we age, plaque forms into nodules of yellowish pus and cholesterol, much like a pimple, on artery walls, Stone said. A thin, fibrous seal, like a cap, keeps these nodules intact. The yellowish nodules come and go, as a pimple does. \n'That thin cap is what keeps us alive,' Stone said. 'I have been working for 20 years to figure out why plaque gets fragile and if we can predict which plaque will get fragile in the future and intervene.' \nThe amount of plaque people accumulate depends on their genetic background, what they eat, how they live and factors that can increase risk, such as having high cholesterol or diabetes, smoking cigarettes, and being physically inactive and overweight, Stone said. \n'All of these act individually and in concert to increase the odds that plaque will rupture,' he said. 'You never know when a bad event is going to happen. Your plaque could be really fragile and can rupture just by getting up. We really don't know what is inside of us. If a severe stimulus system like the cold in winter, winning the soccer game or losing the soccer game [disrupts] plaque, it could be the final straw that breaks the proverbial camel's back.' \nTo help safeguard against setting off triggers in the winter months, physicians recommend following a few guidelines. Seides suggests getting a flu shot. 'During influenza or a high fever, a lot of chemicals are released into circulation,' he said. \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

The immune system goes from keeping cancer cells in check to awakening and feeding residual cells, while turning a blind eye to their growth. \n\"Excitingly, many of the methods employed by treatment-resistant tumours to re-grow and hide from the immune system can be blocked using existing immunotherapies. This idea is, in fact, supported by emerging data from clinical trials, showing that immunotherapies can reduce the risk of cancers coming back.\" \nStudy co-author Professor Kevin Harrington , Professor of Biological Cancer Therapies at the ICR, said: \n\"It is becoming increasing clear that the immune system is at the core of the puzzle of how we can treat cancer more effectively. \n\"This fascinating new study helps explain why sometimes a patient's immune system can be effective against cancer cells while at other times it is not. It also shows there is a lot more to learn about the nature of those cancer cells that lie dormant as a way of resisting the killing effects of cancer treatments. \n\"Changes must occur in these cells that make them better able to manipulate the immune system - and understanding this could open up new treatment options to prevent relapse.\" \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

Most - and possibly all - ovarian cancers do not start in ovaries but instead in the fallopian tubes, which are attached to them, claims a recent study. \nThe new findings also point to the possibility that removing a woman's fallopian tubes, but not her ovaries, may reduce risk of ovarian cancer in those at high risk for disease, including those with genetic changes (mutations) known to increase risk (e.g. BRCA). \nSenior study author from New York University's school of medicine said that based on a better understanding of its origins, the study suggests new strategies for the prevention and early detection of ovarian cancer. \nThe results revolve around the fallopian tubes, which enable egg cells that have the potential to be fertilised and become embryos to pass from the ovaries where they are made to the uterus. \nThe new study found that ovarian cancer cells have more in common with cells covering the tips of fallopian tubes than with those on the surface of ovaries. \nIf biomarkers can be found for these tubal cells, then according to researchers, future blood tests, advanced Pap smears, or direct tests on tubal tissue might be able to detect the ovarian cancer earlier. \n\"We are one of several centers taking part in Women Choosing Surgical Prevention or WISP trial, which seeks to determine whether removing the tubes improves quality of life, compared to removing both the tubes and ovaries,\" Levine stated. \nDespite the remaining uncertainties, the current study does confirm previous results that had suggested that many high-grade serious cancers in the pelvis are preceded by abnormal cells (lesions) occurring in the fallopian tubes, called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC). \nCancer cells may arise from nearby tissue or may have spread to a location from another part of the body, but their genetic profile reflects the tissue of origin. \nThus, the researchers knew going in that if STIC cells and ovarian cancer cells had different genetic profiles, they must have originated in different tissue types. \nInstead, in-depth molecular analyses of cells from 96 women with high-grade serous carcinoma failed to identify any genetic differences between cancer cells arising in the tubes and serous \"ovarian\" cancers occurring elsewhere in the pelvis. \nThey found no differences in the 20,000 genes that they can identify. \n\"This leads us to believe that that these ovarian cancers all originate in the fallopian tubes,\" Levine noted. \nOvarian cancer is more aggressive than many other cancers because it is hard to diagnose in its earliest - and most treatable - stages. \nFewer than 50 percent of women diagnosed with the disease survive for longer than five years after their diagnoses, according to the American Cancer Society ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "levine", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stic", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T13:07:25.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ffef8f359baad77454489bb0d5e25f99fddf9b0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.bwMorvmoS1n6WzWewkYzLTqA2TyAqeSUddseVU6Wh767vWKsQbIff5.CvwIFSRrQ.YL1oGGJOTIn91GLvGbv7YLOg1yEwDN0-", "site_full": "www.lifeextension.com", "site": "lifeextension.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Life Extension Daily News", "title_full": "Life Extension Daily News", "published": "2017-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.142, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19569, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ffef8f359baad77454489bb0d5e25f99fddf9b0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.bwMorvmoS1n6WzWewkYzLTqA2TyAqeSUddseVU6Wh767vWKsQbIff5.CvwIFSRrQ.YL1oGGJOTIn91GLvGbv7YLOg1yEwDN0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Life Extension Daily News", "text": "What is role of PSA in prostate cancer? \nRoanoke Times \nDear Mike , \nYou may recall, when I was still working, all those debates we had about the PSA. ... You were a pain in the neck with the way you favored including the PSA in the yearly physical, and I felt - and there were many others back then who agreed with me - it should not be included. I really thought it was \"junk science.\" ... Well, I wish I listened to your logic. I retired five years ago and moved to Chicago to be with my son and his family. I find myself diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer. \nMy frustration is that I refused to have a PSA for years during my yearly physical because I was convinced the PSA test would do more harm than good to me. I looked at the studies and decided that I didn't want to chase down every red herring the PSA result could generate so I ignored it. Then, my back started to hurt really bad, and my PSA was through the roof. \nI know you still write for the paper, and it's a great thing you do for people, so tell them what happened to me and tell the guys to order the PSA and do whatever it takes not to have to go through this if it can be avoided. \nMy thoughts and prayers are with you, my friend. If anyone I know will fight and beat this, it's you. I am so sad to hear what you're going through, but you know as well as I that there are things that can be done for people in your situation. \nThe issue of the PSA test, which measures proteins produced by the prostate gland, has cut both ways for decades, and doing a PSA is not a guarantee of anything. \nWe know of cases where the PSA failed to identify cancer. And, conversely, of many unnecessary blood tests and biopsies, not to mention unnecessary patient anxiety, that have been generated. When it works, the test has value, and when it doesn't, it casts doubt. \nFor many years, I have been an advocate of using PSA tests until a more definitive test becomes available. I am biased in that the PSA led to the diagnosis of my prostate cancer six years ago before the typical symptoms of the cancer presented themselves. That result led to a biopsy and ultimate treatment. \nOne of the objections to the PSA has always been the number of unnecessary biopsies it could generate. Yet if we look at the diagnostic yield of many biopsies - from breast biopsies to skin biopsies to colon polyp biopsies - the number of normal results found could, in retrospect, render the biopsy \"unnecessary.\" Yet the tests are accepted as part and parcel of good practice, and, in competent hands, the rate of complications is low. \nThe path to diagnosing this disease is not always as straightforward as in my case, but given the potentially serious nature of the disease, it's worth the effort. As a practicing physician, I have had many cases where the test result correctly prompted further work-up that offered at least some choices for patients and their families. To be sure, other times we went off on an expensive wild goose chase. \nOnly recently have the data begun to define the PSA's place in clinical practice. By \"recently,\" I refer to a study led by Dr. Ruth Etzioni Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in , published Sept. 4 in the online edition of the Annals of Internal Medicine. The study found that PSA screening can \"significantly reduce the risk of prostate cancer death.\" \nHowever, some people take issue over diagnostic error and overtreatment. Those are justifiable concerns, but what is the \"business\" of medicine if not to save lives? The history of our profession is replete with procedures, medicines and technology that have been less than perfect but, in their day, made their contribution to improving the human condition. With time and hard work, we got better and built on the missteps of the past. \nAfter 40 years in this field, I believe the PSA test is a stepping stone to better technology. Until we reach that point, we still have to try to save lives. \nSome say that statistically the number of saved lives is small. To that, I say no number of saved lives is small. Some say that if everybody thought like that, the health care system would go broke. That is the same rhetoric used right before we started widespread screening colonoscopies for colon cancer, screening mammograms for breast cancer and screening chest CT scans for lung cancer. Now, these studies are considered good practice, and nobody discusses their cost. \nIndeed, the aforementioned tests have their flaws - as all studies do - but we still order them. Given the prevalence of these cancers in our society, the expense is clearly justified. \nEqually, given the prevalence of prostate cancer in men, I feel the test should be done as part of the yearly physical in the appropriate age group. Medicine is not always neat and tidy. It is often imperfect. But we do what we can with what we have. \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

However, another carotenoid, alpha carotene, not only converts to vitamin A in the body, but also has benefits of its own.\n\nWhere Can You Find Alpha Carotene? Like beta carotene, alpha carotene is found in a variety of vegetables and fruits. Alpha carotene (\u03b1-carotene) is also found in dietary supplements. Cleavage of alpha carotene in the body produces retinol and alpha retinol whereas cleavage of beta carotene produces two retinol molecules. 1 Only a small amount of fat needs to be present for optimal alpha carotene absorption. 2 In the National Survey of Dietary Intake in Spain (2009-2010), alpha carotene was determined to represent 12.8% of provitamin A carotenoids. 3 Specific locations on three chromosomes were recently identified as being associated with serum alpha carotene levels. 4 \n\nMortality Risk A study reported in JAMA Internal Medicine that involved 15,318 adults enrolled in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Follow-up Study revealed a 23% lower adjusted risk of death from any cause over an average 13.9 year follow-up period among those whose serum alpha carotene levels were 2-3 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL) in comparison with participants whose levels were 0-1 mcg/dL. 5 For participants whose levels were 4-5 mcg/dL, 6-8 mcg/dL, and 9 mcg/dL or more, the respective risks were 27%, 34%, and 39% lower. \n\nThe researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and UCLA also uncovered decreasing risks of mortality from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other causes over follow-up in association with rising alpha carotene levels. Authors Chaoyang Li, MD, PhD, and colleagues note that \u201cAlthough alpha carotene is chemically similar to beta carotene, in vivo study results suggest that alpha carotene is about 10 times more effective than beta carotene in inhibiting the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cells; that alpha carotene, but not beta carotene, has a potent inhibitory effect against liver carcinogenesis; and that alpha carotene is more effective than beta carotene in inhibiting the tumor-promoting action of glycerol in lung carcinogenesis and skin tumor promotion. \n\nAn investigation involving 13,293 men and women enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III, 1988\u20131994, uncovered a 46% higher risk of all-cause mortality through 2006 among those whose serum alpha carotene levels were among the lowest 25% in comparison with those whose levels were among the highest. 6 \n\nColon Health An assessment of the effects of carotenoids and vitamin A on the risk of recurring colon polyps (which can be a precursor of colorectal cancer ), found that participants in the Polyp Prevention Trial whose serum alpha carotene levels were among the top 25% of subjects had a 45% lower risk of recurrence. 7 Those with a higher dietary intake of alpha carotene with or without supplements also had a lower risk of developing new polyps. A case-control study in China that matched 538 individuals with colorectal cancer with 564 subjects who did not have the disease found that those whose serum alpha carotene levels were among the highest 25% had a 51% lower risk of colorectal cancer compared to those whose serum levels were among the lowest 25%. 8 \n\nLung Cancer An analysis of a case-control study of lung cancer uncovered a 30% lower risk of the disease among subjects with the highest one-third of alpha carotene intake in comparison with those whose intake was among the lowest third. 9 When examined according to smoking status, having a high-intake of alpha-carotene was protective against lung cancer in men who were heavy smokers. A meta-analysis of five prospective studies that provided data concerning blood concentrations of carotenoids and retinol among determined a 34% lower risk of lung cancer per each 5 mcg/100 milliliter alpha carotene. 10 \n\nMoreover, results from a population-based, case-control study of the association between the consumption of fruits and vegetables and risk of lung cancer suggest that consumption of yellow-orange (carrots, sweet potatoes or pumpkin, and winter squash) and dark green (broccoli, green beans, green peas, spinach, turnip greens, collards, and leaf lettuce) vegetables, which have a high alpha carotene content, was more strongly associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer than was consumption of all other types of vegetables. \n\nBreast Cancer In an investigation that included 2,188 participants in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study who developed breast cancer over a 20-year period who were matched with women who did not develop the disease, having a plasma level of alpha carotene that was among the top 20% of subjects was associated with a 26% lower risk of breast cancer during follow-up than subjects whose levels were among the lowest 20%, and for recurrent or lethal breast cancer, the risk was 46% lower. 11 \n\nA prospective analysis of 185,885 adults enrolled in the Multiethnic Cohort Study found an 8% lower adjusted risk of invasive bladder cancer in men and a 48% lower adjusted risk in women whose alpha carotene intake was among the top 25% in comparison with those whose intake was among the lowest quarter of subjects. 12 \n\nIn a meta-analysis of 10 studies that examined the associations between carotenoid intake and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, subjects whose intake of alpha carotene was highest had a 13% lower risk of the disease compared to those whose intake was among the lowest. 13 Of the carotenoids examined, a significant inverse dose-response relationship existed only between alpha carotene and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma risk, which was 13% lower per each 1,000 mcg per day increment of intake. \n\nHeart Disease In a study that included 34 subjects with coronary heart disease and 40 control subjects, plasma alpha carotene and gamma-tocopherol levels were significantly lower in the heart disease patients. 14 \u201cThese data suggest that plasma levels of alpha carotene and gamma-tocopherol may represent markers of atherosclerosis in humans.,\u201d A. Kontush and colleagues conclude. \u201cMeasuring these antioxidants may be of clinical importance as a practical approach to assess atherogenesis and/or its risk.\u201d\n\nBone Health and Eye Health In addition to cancer and heart disease, consuming more alpha carotene may also help protect the bones and eyes. Among participants in the prospective European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Norfolk, a lower risk of hip fracture was observed among men with higher plasma alpha carotene levels, and increased bone density among women who had a higher intake. 15 A 2015 study found that people with the highest intakes of \u03b1-carotene maintained macular health better than those with lower intakes of \u03b1-carotene. 16 \n\nObesity and Chronic Disease Research suggests further roles for alpha carotene. \u201cSerum alpha carotene may provide a deeper and clinically relevant purpose, beyond previous suggestions for its use as a biomarker for fruit and vegetable consumption, in that alpha carotene may be a biomarker for chronic disease risk frequently linked with obesity,\u201d note E. T. Nuss and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cAs humans begin to live over a century, determining biomarkers of ultimate health is important. Alpha carotene does not have the same distribution in the food supply as beta carotene and therefore is often overlooked in surveys.\u201d 1 \n\nReferences Nuss ET et al.

That is the result of a 2003 law, in effect written by the industry, preventing the federal government from seeking bids for the manufacture of drugs and medical devices \u2013 a process used in other areas, such as defence spending. \nInstead, the pharmaceutical companies can charge whatever price they want for drugs bought for the publicly run Medicare and Medicaid programmes \u2013 and the federal government has no choice but to pay up. \nMeanwhile, the drug companies say that to allow foreign imports would endanger the quality and safety of medicines in the US. But that justification has been widely scorned in the face of escalating and sometimes opportunistic pricing, such as the surge in the price of EpiPen antidotes to allergic reactions last year, to $600 \nBritain\u2019s National Health Service negotiated a price of about $70 for the same product. Scores of attempts by some members of Congress to introduce legislation to bring down the price of prescription medicines or to let people buy them from Canada , where they are often cheaper, have failed to make it out of committee. \nWhile lobbying shapes medical policy across the board, it has had a profound impact on the opioid epidemic as deaths quadrupled between 1999 and 2015. The pharmaceutical industry poured resources into attempting to place blame for the crisis on the millions who have became addicted instead of on the mass prescribing of powerful opioids. \nThe relatively small number of members of Congress who led the charge against the epidemic years before it became a significant political issue have struggled to push through legislation. \nRepresentatives and Mary Bono saw repeated efforts to pass laws curbing the mass prescribing of opioid painkillers fail amid concerted campaigns by the drug makers. Rogers and Bono founded the Congressional Caucus on Prescription Drug Abuse in 2010 and proposed several pieces of legislation over a number of years. \nBono , who was alerted to the opioid crisis after Chesare, her son with the late singer Sonny Bono , became addicted, said there was a false but effective campaign by companies profiting from the epidemic to portray any attempt to rein in the mass prescribing of painkillers as depriving millions of people of legitimate treatment for chronic pain. \n\u201cWe were getting tremendous pushback from the industry. It was a massive, well-organised effort,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course we felt it, maybe indirectly at times.

Well, according to experts, not as much as it should. Doctors say we need 4,700 milligrams daily, but studies show most people aren't getting enough potassium in their diet. \nWhy the name may not ring a bell with most people, it's \"street name\" - electrolytes - may be more familiar. Most energy drinks are designed to replenish these essential minerals. Along with potassium, the nutrients calcium, magnesium, sodium, phosphate and chloride work together to regulate important body functions. If you run low on them, look out. Low levels affect sleep, muscles, heart rhythms, joints, digestion, anxiety levels, blood pressure and balance. \nIf you are looking for an effective way to feel better, here are four reasons potassium is essential for good health. \n1. It reduces bone loss. \nThe role of potassium in bone health relates to the ability of selected potassium salts to neutralize bone-depleting metabolic acids. \n\"These acids 'eat away' at bone, much like acid rain eats away at a limestone statue,\" said Susan E. Brown , MD. \"It is, however, is largely neutralized by potassium compounds, and to a lesser degree magnesium compounds, obtained from fruits and vegetables.\" \nAlong with fresh produce, potassium is found in bananas, seeds, and most popular spices. \n2. Maintains blood pressure. \nTo appreciate the role of potassium, you need to understand kidney function. The tricky process of controlling blood pressure relies on the kidneys. When the body is filled with excess fluid, blood pressure increases, so the kidneys to need to filter the blood and eliminate excess fluid that is stored in the bladder. But they need potassium to help draw out extra fluid and direct it to storage. When potassium levels are low, kidneys will not function efficiently. So, by reducing salt intake and adopting a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, potassium levels will remain high, which will help the kidneys keep the blood clean and blood pressure levels healthy. \n3. Reduces risk of kidney stones \nMuch of the focus on dietary needs for seniors revolves around fats and salt intake. But it's also important that potassium levels are normal. \n\"Recognizing that the physical changes associated with aging can affect kidney function and the absorption of nutrients, we monitor our menus to be sure we are providing nutrients like potassium, which is necessary to maintain blood pressure, reduce sodium sensitivity, and reduce the risk of things like kidney stones,\" said Debra Koenig ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-20T06:02:22.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0b5ff3512cd12406015f9ca85c1c1535636fc09c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.bwMorvmoS1n6WzWewkYzLTqA2TyAqeSUddseVU6Wh767vWKsQbIff5.CvwIFSRrQ_jqIxiBFbLCdLiCcNP8UPxZFSwbWkIwM-", "site_full": "www.lifeextension.com", "site": "lifeextension.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Life Extension Daily News", "title_full": "Life Extension Daily News", "published": "2017-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.142, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19569, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0b5ff3512cd12406015f9ca85c1c1535636fc09c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.bwMorvmoS1n6WzWewkYzLTqA2TyAqeSUddseVU6Wh767vWKsQbIff5.CvwIFSRrQ_jqIxiBFbLCdLiCcNP8UPxZFSwbWkIwM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Life Extension Daily News", "text": "\n) and orthopedic surgeon Henry W. Meyerding . Meyerding used the toxins in conjunction with surgery for patients with bone cancer, achieving survival rates far higher than with surgery alone. \nColey dedicated the next 40 years of his life to perfecting his unorthodox cancer treatment. A major obstacle to Coley was that the toxin results were inconsistent. More than a dozen formulations were produced at one point. Some mixtures more effective, some were less so. In addition to this, each patient reacted differently to the treatments and the toxins themselves were, at times, fatal. \nColey would not be without controversy. He became both a revered cancer surgeon and an oft-criticized doctor who stubbornly defended both his treatment and his reputation until his death in 1936. More than 100 years after his first success, cancer researchers are still traveling the path Coley blazed long ago. \nOne of the major battles Coley fought, and seemingly lost, was in his own hospital. Around the same time that Coley\u2019s Toxins became the talk of the town, radiation therapy was also an emerging cancer treatment. The nation\u2019s preeminent cancer pathologist, James Ewing , was staunchly in favor of treating patients with the promising new radiation method. Ewing was also Coley\u2019s boss and his biggest opponent. Ewing forbade Coley from using his toxin inside Memorial Hospital . A large blow to the surgeon\u2019s work. Another problem with the toxins and Coley\u2019s research was that he could not explain why they worked. Or did not work, as the case may have been. Despite this, Coley continued to firmly believe that microorganisms were what caused cancer and that the toxins, in some cases, killed those cancer causing agents that were at work in the body. He held this belief until the day he died. \nThe pharmaceutical firm Parke-Davis & Co. made various formulations of Coley\u2019s Toxin available to all physicians from 1899 to 1951, and at least 42 physicians from Europe and North America reported success stories in patients treated with the toxin, specifically for bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. In a 1945 study of the toxins\u2019 efficacy, among 312 inoperable cases of cancer, 190 were considered regressions after treatment \u2014 a cure rate of about 60 percent. Coley went on to treat nearly 1,000 patients with his toxin and published more than 150 papers on the subject. By 1962, however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration refused to acknowledge the toxin as a proven drug and made it illegal to use to treat cancer. \nToday, immunotherapy is a rapidly ascending field of cancer research because scientists are finally figuring out the immune system\u2019s quirks, and the pharmaceutical industry is getting into the game. \u201cImmunotherapy is probably the hottest area of cancer research right now,\u201d says Jill O\u2019Donnell-Tormey, CEO and director of scientific affairs at the Cancer Research Institute . \nShe notes that biotech firms are investing heavily in immunotherapy research, and about 40 percent of the roughly 6,000 cancer clinical trials taking place in the United States today include some form of immunotherapy. \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

In 2010, the family received the results of a genetic test that showed Tommy had the type of mutation that would be helped by the drug. Since Ataluren is a mutation specific drug, it benefits only 13 percent of boys with Duchenne. \nOn , Parzymieso was invited along with several other families and medical community members to the first Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meeting to discuss Ataluren. \nThe meeting was held after PTC Therapeutics , the company that developed the drug, filed on two separate occasions a new drug application with the FDA . Both times the FDA refused to accept the filing. After the second refuse to file, Parzymieso said PTC filed a new drug application under protest. This led to an advisory committee meeting, and subsequently, Parzymieso's involvement. \nPTC has had a relationship with Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, a not-for-profit organization that does fundraising and advocacy for muscular dystrophy research, of which Parzymieso is a part. Due to the relationship, the not-for-profit reached out to see if Parzymieso would speak on behalf of the unmet need. \nDuring the meeting, PTC presented its data on why the drug should be approved. The FDA also presented data on why the agency thinks the data is ineffective. \nParzymieso, who is an advocate for the 21st Century Cures Act, a recent piece of legislation to get drugs from development into clinical trials and approved for use, is hoping her testimony on Ataluren gets it approved. \nParzymieso was one of 28 parents, doctors and physical therapists to testify. \n\"I stood up there with three other families whose children have not been able to gain access to Ataluren,\" Parzymieso said. \nAtaluren has been in clinical trials since 2006 for boys with Duchenne. \nThe process of trying to get into one of the trials has been incredibly frustrating for Tommy and his family. \nParzymieso said Tommy has missed the age requirement on two separate occasions to be in one of the trials. \nIn 2013, a trial was opened for boys ages 7 to 10 when Tommy was 5, and enrollment was closed before he turned 7. On the heels of that trial, another was opened for boys up to and including age 5. Tommy was already 6 when that study began. \n\"He's one of a small handful of boys in the world that has not been able to access this drug,\" said Parzymieso about Ataluren, which is conditionally approved in Europe \nDenied on two occasions, Parzymieso described the process as excruciating. \n\"That's the word I used when I testified before the FDA ,\" she said. \"I'm sitting here waiting and watching everybody else get their chance at this drug.\" \nParzymieso said she stressed to the FDA that every day they wait for approval is another day when individuals with Duchenne lose muscle function. \n\"We don't have time to wait for the FDA to require more clinical trials and more studies of this drug,\" she said. \"We don't have time to wait for them to deny approval of this drug and then wait for some other therapy that's not yet been discovered to come down the line.\" \nFollowing the hearing, the 11-person committee voted 10-1, saying more data is needed to see if the drug is effective. The drug will go up for FDA Tuesday, Oct. 24 . \nParzymieso said the one panel member who voted in favor of Ataluren being approved said he read almost 100 comments of written testimony on the drug. \nOn , the FDA will take the committee's recommendations under advisement and decide to accept the findings and request another clinical trial, deny the application or grant an accelerated approval of the drug. \nIf approved, Ataluren would be taken daily. Parzymieso said advocates are still working on a cocktail of drugs that could be taken together to combat Duchenne. Ataluren would be a significant member of the cocktail. \nParzymieso said the drug is not a cure for Duchenne, but she added that the drug creates a better quality of life. \nDuchenne sees boys lose the ability to walk between 9 and 12 and have their motor skills diminish in their teens. Parzymieso said some on the drug have walked into their 20s and have more energy than those who haven't been exposed to it. \nClinical trials also show an improvement in skeletal and pulmonary function, Parzymieso said. \nIn the last year, Parzymieso said the family has begun to travel out of state to Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio , considered one of the best Duchenne care centers in the country. Tommy will still go to his local team of doctors who are also helping in the process. \nIn November Tommy began taking steroids due to a significant regression in his ability to function. Parzymieso said her son was falling nearly every day at school. \n\"We immediately saw an improvement in his function; he responded very well and quickly to the steroids,\" she said. \"He feels like he's gotten back to his baseline with respect to his energy and being able to stay on his feet.\" \nTommy will also use a scooter at school as needed if his muscles are feeling tired. \nHe also has been taking a preventive heart medication, spironolactone, to help against the disease. \n\"We know all of the boys are in cardiomyopathy, and the hope is if we can treat it before we can see it on the film or in the reports, we can delay its true onset and keep their hearts functioning longer,\" said Parzymieso about the heart medication. \nTommy remains in good spirits. Parzymieso said he's been elected to Student Council , is playing hockey and is serving as the honorary captain for Orchard Park's varsity football team. \nParzymieso feels that she and others have presented a strong case for the drug to be approved. \n\"They're saying we haven't shown that the drug has improved these kids, but you have to consider that without the drug they're already regressing each day,\" she said. \"Any improvement, no matter how small, is still a miracle for these kids. Maintaining function is an incredible win even though it might not be statistically significant under the old paradigm of the FDA \nMore than 80 doctors have also submitted letters to the FDA asking for the approval of Ataluren. \n\"We have a child that has no options, and we know each day he regresses,\" she said. \"We want the chance for a safe drug to try and see if we can give him some hope, benefit and chance to be an outlier on this disease and have a course that's different than those that came before him.\" \nNext week, if the FDA accepts the findings, the Parzymieso family will once again be faced with the question of \"What's Next?\" Parzymieso said the family will continue to look for a way to help Tommy in his battle. \n\"We'll keep doing what we've been doing, constantly researching and staying connected with the community to find out what drugs are coming into clinical trials, what's being done in the labs, what is showing promise,\" she said. \"We keep on pushing on and not expecting no as an answer.\" \nemail: \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

Sheldon Whitehouse's Republican opponent is trying to focus attention on the incumbent's role in passage of a controversial 2016 law that has been blamed for worsening the nation's epidemic of fatal opioid overdoses. \nWhitehouse's co-sponsorship of the bill came up on Sunday, when The Washington Post and \"60 Minutes,\" in a joint investigation, reported that the law has made it more difficult for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to take action against those who added to the proliferation of opioids. \nIn response to the coverage, state Rep. Bobby Nardolillo , Whitehouse's challenger in 2018, issued a news release asserting that The Washington Post's report says that Whitehouse \"bears some legislative responsibility for the explosive growth of non-prescription opioid use in America.\" \nWhitehouse spokeswoman Meagan McCabe said Wednesday night that she \"absolutely contests\" that interpretation. \nShe said Whitehouse was the author of major legislation designed to curb the opioid epidemic.

I'm reluctant to rely too heavily on drugs. Aren't there any vitamins or non-prescription medications I can take to prevent migraines? \nDear Reader: The short answer is yes: You can reduce your risk of migraines through non-prescription methods - and you're not alone in trying to do so. Migraines affect about 12 percent of people in the United States , occurring more often in women, in people between the ages of 30 and 39, and within families. \nThe headaches can last for hours or up to three days, causing an inability to focus and significant lost productivity. A retrospective analysis of migraine sufferers found that emotional stress was a trigger for 80 percent of them, missing a meal was a trigger for 57 percent, and lack of sleep was a trigger for 50 percent. \nWhen it comes to behavioral interventions, relaxation techniques, cognitive therapy, consistent aerobic exercise and good sleep hygiene can all decrease the frequency of migraines. Now let's look at the data on nutritional supplements. \nWe'll start with coenzyme CoQ10. In a small 2005 study, patients who experienced migraine headaches two to eight times per month were randomly assigned to take either a placebo or 100 milligrams of CoQ10 three times per day for at least three months. The authors measured success as a greater than 50 percent reduction in the frequency of migraines. Only 14.4 percent of those who took the placebo showed this level of reduction, but 47.6 percent of those who took CoQ10 reduced their frequency of migraines by that amount. \nThen there's the B vitamin riboflavin. A small 1998 study found that 59 percent of people who took a daily dose of 400 milligrams had a greater than 50 percent reduction in the frequency of migraines, compared to 15 percent of those who took a placebo. However, it took three months for riboflavin to show this benefit. \nKnowing that sleep problems increase the risk of migraines, researchers in a 2016 study compared the effects of 3 milligrams of melatonin to the effects of the anti-depressant amitriptyline or of a placebo. After three months, 54.4 percent of people who took melatonin had a 50 percent or greater reduction in frequency of headaches compared to 39.1 percent in the amitriptyline group and 20 percent in the placebo group. That seems promising, but note that a 2010 study of people who took 2 milligrams of melatonin for a two-month period did not show significant benefit when compared with a placebo. \nNow let's move on to botanicals. Small studies have suggested that the root of the butterbur plant, Petasites hybridus, can decrease migraine frequency, but the plant can be toxic to the liver and, in animal studies, has led to genetic changes that could lead to cancer. \nFeverfew is another potential treatment. A combined analysis of six trials of the herb yielded conflicting results. Overall, the studies showed that feverfew can decrease the frequency of migraines by 0.6 times per month compared to placebo. Note that it can cause rebound headaches if abruptly stopped, however. \nIn short, more studies are needed. That said, CoQ10, riboflavin and melatonin all seem like reasonable approaches to help prevent migraines. \nRobert Ashley , M.D., is an internist and assistant professor of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles .

The resulting brain DHA deficit can be reversed by omega-3 FA supplementation.\" \nOur news journalists obtained a quote from the research from National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism , \"The objective was to test whether there is a critical period for providing omega-3 FA to correct cognitive deficits caused by developmental omega-3 FA deprivation in mice. Twelve timed-pregnant mice [embryonic day 14 (E14), C57/BL6NCr] were fed an omega-3 FA-deficient diet containing 0.04% a-linolenic acid [ALA (18: 3n-3)], and their offspring were fed the same deficient diet (Def group) or changed to an omega-3 FA-adequate diet containing 3.1% ALA at 3 wk, 2 mo, or 4 mo of age. In parallel, 3 E14 pregnant mice were fed the adequate diet and their offspring were fed the same diet (Adeq group) throughout the experiment. Brain FA composition, learning and memory, and hippocampal synaptic protein expression were evaluated at 6 mo by gas chromatography, the Morris water maze test, and western blot analysis, respectively. Maternal dietary omega-3 FA deprivation decreased DHA by > 50% in the brain of their offspring at 3 wk of age. The Def group showed significantly worse learning and memory at 6 mo than those groups fed the adequate diet. These pups also had decreased hippocampal expression of postsynaptic density protein 95 (43% of Adeq group), Homer protein homolog 1 (21% of Adeq group), and synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (64% of Adeq group). Changing mice to the adequate diet at 3 wk, 2 mo, or 4 mo of age restored brain DHA to the age-matched adequate concentration. However, deficits in hippocampal synaptic protein expression and spatial learning and memory were normalized only when the diet was changed at 3 wk.\" \nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Developmental deprivation of brain DHA by dietary omega-3 FA depletion in mice may have a lasting impact on cognitive function if not corrected at an early age.\" \nFor more information on this research see: Perinatal Brain Docosahexaenoic Acid Concentration Has a Lasting Impact on Cognition in Mice.

A person's epigenome is inherited, but it is also reversible based on what you eat, whether you exercise, and even where you live, for example. \n\"Traditional genetics says that you inherit a sequence from your parents. Epigenetics says you can inherit these other changes to the DNA, as well,\" Moody explains. \"This is where the whole maternal programming of metabolism--the epigenome--comes into play. We wanted to show these changes are easily altered, even after this critical period. You can still change that epigenome later in life. \n\"The message is not that the high-fat diet is itself bad, but rather you always have the opportunity to change it later. It's not like you are doomed by what your mom or dad did in early in life,\" she adds. \nFor the study, the researchers looked at rats that were exposed to a high-fat diet (45 percent fat) during gestation and lactation. At weaning, some of the rats stayed on a high-fat diet and some were put on a low-fat diet (16 percent fat). \nThe researchers then did whole-genome sequencing of the rats, focusing on differences between gene expression in the livers of the two sets of rats. In particular, they wanted to see if DNA methylation in the liver adapted to the new, low-fat diet. DNA methylation is a mechanism cells use to control gene expression at the epigenetic level. It involves the addition of a methyl group to DNA that changes the way genes are transcribed and affects gene expression. \nScans showed remodeled DNA methylation patterns in the low-fat group, which changed gene expression associated with fat metabolism and inflammation in the liver; there was less fat accumulation and inflammation in the liver. This shows that DNA methylation is responsive to dietary changes later in life. \nWhile there were physiological changes in the rats on low-fat diets, including lower body weight, Moody says they were most encouraged to see the changes in specific metabolic pathways related to type 2 diabetes, suggesting changes in rats' risk for the disease. \n\"There were definitely physiological outcomes, but we focused on the epigenetic outcomes,\" Moody says. \"We did a whole genome scan, so we weren't just looking in one particular area. So I think it's even more impressive that it was these specific pathways--the type 2 diabetes mellitus pathways--that were metabolically related that were the most changed.\" \nBecause research--some from Pan's own lab--has shown that the early-life environment, including nutrition, can program certain diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and even some cancers, the study may offer good news for health throughout the lifespan. \n\"The early-life environment will mark your epigenome in a certain way so that you may develop certain phenotypes or disease states. Our study shows that after that early programming state, after weaning, and after the lactation period, when we introduced a new type of diet it changed the epigenome in a way that actually affects metabolism and potentially will reduce some of the damage caused by an early-life high-fat exposure,\" Pan says. \nPan adds that their study shows that the \"reprogramming\" is possible at least from the point of post-weaning. \"Whether we can start from adolescence, or even later in life, we don't know that yet. But hopefully our study shows that by simply changing nutrition you can reverse some of the potential consequences.\" \nPan's goal is also to continue identifying potential molecular mechanisms involved in this early programming. \"If we identify mechanisms, then we can do more detection of disease risk. Even if we don't know what happened during a person's early-life environment, but we do know that they have the potential to develop these kinds of diseases, we can tell them to pay attention to their diet, environment, stress, etc. to minimize the risk of eventually developing these diseases. \n\"Goal two is to find intervention strategies, including this case, where we show that if you switch to a different diet you actually can specifically remodel the epigenome in the liver related to certain metabolic pathways,\" he says. \nMoody says she will continue to take a more whole-body systemic approach to understand how dietary patterns can affect the epigenome in different tissues in the body and how that can reduce disease risk.

He called it \"juice.\" Well, these days linseed - what we call flaxseed - is having a Renaissance moment as a food and oil that leads to better health. \nThe benefits of flaxseed: Flaxseeds (always use the ground variety, not whole) deliver a substantial amount of vitamin B-1/thiamine as well as some B-2, B-3, B-5, B-6, folate (B-9) and choline. Plus every tablespoon of ground flaxseed contains almost 2 grams of fiber and 1.6 grams of omega-3 ALA fatty acid (which can ease symptoms of diabetic neuropathy). One of flaxseed's great assets is that it contains 75 to 800 times more lignans, a form of polyphenol, than other plant foods! The lignans and other nutrients in the seed are associated with a reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease, the slowing of prostate tumor growth, tamping down your stress response and quelling inflammation. \nWhat about flaxseed oil? The oil is a great source of ALA, but it becomes rancid easily (store in the fridge no more than six to eight weeks). And, it does not contain the lignans, fiber or protein of the ground seeds. \nSo how do you get this power-packed seed into your diet? Grind the seeds in a coffee grinder as needed; aim for eating 2-3 tablespoons a day. They add flavor and texture to salads, soups and cereals, steamed veggies, broiled fish and smoothies. \nMehmet Oz , M.D., is host of \"The Dr. Oz Show,\" and Mike Roizen , M.D., is chief wellness officer and chair of Wellness Institute Cleveland Clinic .

It\u2019s watercress and even though most doctors will argue that the more chemotherapeutic drugs (anti-cancer drugs), the better, I still feel strongly that we can make dietary changes that improve outcomes, whether or not you take chemo. \nThey may poo-poo this thinking, but I still feel that eating specific foods can have a positive impact on your outcomes. \nResearch is clear and shows that a great deal of people give up on chemotherapy and fail to adhere to conventional medical treatments. Many stop altogether or they begin to integrate various holistic remedies and dietary changes. Which makes me think of watercress. \nWatercress, belongs to the cruciferous vegetables, same as broccoli and cauliflower, but it\u2019s not as popular as those. \nStill, I want to give it some love and attention today because it has some powerful tumor-fighting compounds in it. Plus, we already know from empirical evidence that 30 to 40 percent of all cancers somehow benefit or respond from proper nutrition. \nResearchers have investigated how watercress can be beneficial in breast cancer and other cancers. In a study published in the British Journal of Nutrition a group of breast cancer survivors went through a phase of fasting, before consuming a bowlful of watercress about the size of a cereal bowl (approximately 80 grams of watercress). They took some blood samples from the women, at intervals over the next 24 hours. \nTheir blood evaluations found rather significant levels of a plant compound called phenylethyl isothiocyanate or PEITC for short. This PEITC starves the cancer cells. This PEITC inhibits a protein called HIF (Hypoxia Inducible Factor) which is responsible for signaling normal tissue around the tumor to send oxygen and nutrients TO the tumor cells. HIF is not playing nice, it\u2019s making your own cells boost cancer growth. \nAm I saying watercress cures cancer? Of course not, but eating certain foods like watercress can\u2019t hurt you, it can only help you, and more than anything, it puts you in a pro-active position which is empowering. Let\u2019s face it, hearing the word \u201ccancer\u201d is heart-stopping. Having something you can do that is so simple is crucial. \nThe researchers in the study actually validated the effects of the watercress compound PEITC, they weren\u2019t guessing. They physically measured blood levels of that HIF in their bloodstream and saw it declining progressively after eating watercress. That is just so amazing! \nAnother study back in 2004, evaluated how PEITC impacts the speed at which cancer cells grow (termed proliferation) and tumorigenesis (the formation of tumors). The scientists were able to confirm that watercress inhibits cancer cell growth and not only that it makes cancer cells commit suicide, a process called apoptosis. It means the party\u2019s over for the cancer cells. \nSuzy Cohen is a registered pharmacist and the author of \u2018The 24-Hour Pharmacist\u2019 and \u2018Real Solutions.\u2019 For more information, visit www.suzycohen.com .

The second, pentostatin, was first identified from a bacterium and was developed as a commercial drug to treat leukemia and other cancers in the 1990s. \n\"For the first time, we decoded the biosynthesis mechanism of cordycepin in the fungus, and during the research we unexpectedly discovered pentostatin,\" said Wang Chengshu, head of the research team at the Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology , a branch of the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences . \n\"These two compounds coexist in fungal cells in the form of a protector and protege - that is to say, cordycepin is synthesized with the coupled production of pentostatin to protect the stability of the former,\" he said. \nTheir research also showed that the fungus initiates a detoxification process when the cordycepin in the body reaches an excessively high level, which can be toxic. \n\"It reminds us that excessive intake of the fungus may not be healthful,\" Wang said. \nA paper about the team's findings after nearly eight years of research was published on the website of the international journal Cell Chemical Biology on Thursday. \nCordyceps militaris, bright orange-yellow mushrooms sold as a fresh supplement for soups and stews, is a much more affordable alternative to caterpillar fungus. \n\"However, in the research, we've proved that neither of the compounds is produced in caterpillar fungus,\" Wang said. \nCordyceps fungi are popular in China for their widely believed immunity-enhancing and energy-strengthening properties. Their uses in medical treatment date to the Compendium of Materia Medica , a book widely deemed the encyclopedia of traditional Chinese medicine written in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). \n\"There have been long-running arguments as to whether such fungi are antibacterial or anti-cancer, and people use them based on experience in most cases. It's a major advance that our team scientifically proved that Cordyceps militaris really carries such properties,\" said Guo Jinhua , Party chief of the institute. \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

A second phase, which included 30 people, found that those who received a single stem cell infusion treatment showed improved lung function and an ability to walk farther than the group that received a placebo. \n\"People got better early,\" Hare said, \"and the improvement was sustained over time.\" \nThe average age of those participating in the clinical trials was 78, Hare said, and those who received stem cell infusions intravenously showed physical improvement at three and six months after the therapy. \nFor the next phase of the clinical trial, Hare said, he will recruit about 120 people. But before that, Hare said, researchers are working to establish measurable goals in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration , which would give the final approval for the therapy to be used broadly. \nWalking distance is one of the measurable goals, and researchers already reported that elderly subjects in the clinical trials were able to walk 60 to 70 meters farther during a six-minute period after receiving the infusions. \nAnother measure would be to reduce inflammation biomarkers that can be found in the blood. \nIf the third phase of the clinical trial can show that stem cell infusions reduce those biomarkers for inflammation, Hare said, the therapy is more likely to win FDA \nHare said the third phase of the clinical trial will be funded by Longeveron, a Miami company that he founded in 2014, and that has licensed the technology for the stem cell infusion therapy. The first two phases of the clinical trial were sponsored by UM. \n\"You need a commercial entity to do this,\" Hare said. \"It's very difficult for a university to take on that level of responsibility.\" \nLongeveron will manufacture the stem cell infusion therapy and distribute it if the FDA approves the drug for human use, said Hare, who disclosed his ownership stake in the company as conflict of interest in the Journals of Gerontology. \nAcademic researchers with financial interests in the drugs they are studying is fairly common, said William Allen , a medical ethicist with the University of Florida's College of Medicine . \n\"It doesn't mean that there's no potential for problems,\" Allen said. \"But lots of places do this.

And let's face it - endless amounts of nagging can only do so much. The ideal, of course, would be a kid who wants to eat healthy. What parent wouldn't like that? Fortunately, there are simple techniques that can help \"train\" your kids to become healthier eaters. Parents, these may really come in handy . Eat Dinner Together In a day and age when convenience trumps all, it\u2019s hard to eat as a family during dinnertime. But studies show that it\u2019s definitely worth it. Kids who eat dinner with their parents tend to eat healthier meals. They\u2019re more likely to eat fruits and vegetables and are less likely to eat fried foods, sodas, and trans fats. 1 Put Fruit In A Colorful Bowl There are psychological aspects to your diet. If something looks good, you\u2019re more likely to want to eat it. Cornell researchers conducted a series of experiments examining the health habits of kids eating lunch in a school cafeteria. In one study, fruit sales increased by 104% when placed in a colorful bowl. 2 The take home message? Place fruits and vegetables in colorful plates and bowls and get creative with arrangements. Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind In the same Cornell study, researchers found that when unhealthy items were placed out of reach, for example ice cream was put in a freezer with an opaque top, sales for healthier items increased. In addition, relocating the salad bar tripled sales. 3 The take home message? Keep junk foods out of sight (or even better, don\u2019t buy them) and keep the healthier foods within close reach . Bite Sized Portions Are Best Do kids really avoid healthy foods because they don\u2019t like the taste? Perhaps not. It may be a matter of portion size. At least, that\u2019s what the results of the Cornell study implied. When given the option, kids chose apple slices over whole fruit. In a school cafeteria that had fruit slicers, apple sales increased by a whopping 71%. 4 The take home message? Pre-cut fruits and vegetables in small portion sizes work! Be A Good Role Model Kids are going to do what they see at home. If you eat healthy, then chances are your kids will too. Examine your own eating habits and determine if they\u2019re up to par. Hide It If all else fails, sneak the produce into their favorite foods. If you\u2019re creative enough, they\u2019ll never suspect foul play. For example, add shredded carrots to tomato sauce or zucchini to your favorite bread mix. We\u2019re sure you can think of more ideas... Hopefully, some of these suggestions will help get your kids eating healthier. If you have any tips of your own to share. Please drop them in the comments!

Smith, MD Enhancing your diet with nutritional supplements will get you closer to optimal health then diet and exercise alone. Now as a reader of this blog, there's a good chance that you already agree. But why, exactly, is this the case? Because the food we eat, even if fresh and organic, does not have the same nutritional value as it used to. Simply put, the American soil is sick and is producing nutrient poor food . Supplement With an Ideally Dosed Multivitamin The very first and most essential supplement is an ideally dosed daily multivitamin. I once asked a friend of mine if he took a multivitamin. His response was, \u201cVitamins and minerals are so pass\u00e9. I want to take the latest innovations and something more powerful.\u201d Don\u2019t be like my friend. Never think of the basic vitamins and minerals as outdated and not \u201cpowerful.\u201d From vitamin A to the mineral zinc, your body is totally dependent on these nutrients for optimal health. And I promise you this: You can always live without the latest Amazonian herb that claims to cure everything, but you can never live without vitamins and minerals. By the way, a multivitamin is usually a lot cheaper than herbal and plant extracts! I can\u2019t stress enough, though, that not all multivitamins are the same. There are your basic, bare-bones multivitamins that provide minimal doses of some essential nutrients. And then there are your robust multivitamins that deliver ideal doses of a full spectrum of essential nutrients. What is the main difference between these multiples? Dosage. The first type is based on the government\u2019s \u201crecommended dietary allowance,\u201d or RDA, and the second reflects what I call the \u201cideal daily intake,\u201d or IDI. What if, instead of RDAs, we promoted IDIs\u2014science based ideal daily intakes of vitamins and minerals that far exceed expectations set forth by the U.S. government because they are all about optimizing health. Dosing vitamins and minerals at this level goes way beyond protection against deficiencies. It enters the world of optimizing energy levels, hormonal balance, cardiovascular wellness, bone strength, digestive ease, visual acuity, cognitive agility, emotional stability, and joint integrity. Supplement With Healthy Oils like Omega-3s The second essential supplement is a high-quality omega-3 fatty acid product . Chances are, you\u2019ve heard of omega-3 fatty acids, because they\u2019ve had their fair share of media exposure lately. In the simplest terms, omega-3 fatty acids are healthy fats. They\u2019re sometimes called \u201cessential fatty acids\u201d because, quite simply, they are essential to health\u2014you can\u2019t live without them. Yet your body can\u2019t make them. So you either have to get them through your diet or through supplementation. An abundance of scientific research substantiates the wide-ranging health benefits of omega-3 fats. Some of these benefits include: Supporting mental health 1 Decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and heart attacks 3 Lowering systemic inflammation 4 The last one on the list, lowering inflammation, is more important than you might realize. I firmly believe\u2014and I\u2019m not alone in this\u2014that inflammation is the common denominator of all age-related diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Lowering levels of chronic, low-grade inflammation in your body is probably the single most important thing you can do to promote optimal health. Supplement with Ubiquinol CoQ10 The third essential supplement is coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) , in the ubiquinol (not ubiquinone) form. This one supplement can make such a big difference in your health and well-being that I think every single American adult could benefit from taking it. What the heck is a coenzyme? Well, \u201cco\u201d means \u201cwith\u201d or \u201ctogether.\u201d And enzymes catalyze all the chemical reactions in your body that sustain life. So coenzymes work together with enzymes to keep you alive. Coenzyme Q10 specifically works with enzymes inside the mitochondria of your cells to produce energy in the form of ATP\u2014energy your cells need to function. If your CoQ10 levels are low, you won\u2019t just feel tired and drained. Every cell, tissue, and organ in your body will suffer because they\u2019re all powered by ATP. CoQ10 is most well-known for promoting cardiovascular health. And that makes sense when you think about it, because your heart demands more energy than almost any other organ in your body. But CoQ10 has other benefits too. Scores of human clinical trials have shown that CoQ10: Is helpful in multiple heart conditions 5 May slow the progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease 6 Helps control blood sugar in diabetics 7 Increases feelings of vigor in healthy folks 8 CoQ10 is naturally produced in the body, but as you get older, you make less of it. Tissue samples have revealed that CoQ10 levels tend to peak at around age twenty and then continuously decrease with age. 9 So, as you can see \u2026CoQ10 is essential! Probiotic Supplements Replace Healthy Gut Bacteria The fourth and final essential supplement is a probiotic product. Think about it: Your survival is dependent on your gut\u2019s ability to extract protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals from your food. When your gut health is compromised, it doesn\u2019t matter how healthy a diet you eat\u2014you won\u2019t be able to access all the nutrition it provides. Not only that, a good portion of your immune system\u2014 about 70 percent\u2014is actually located within your GI tract. 10 Here\u2019s my point: The makeup of bacteria in your gut influences how well your gut and immune system work. The more healthy bacteria you have, the stronger your immune system and the more efficient your digestive system. To begin, avoid things that can lower your levels of beneficial bacteria\u2014and make room for the bad guys to multiply\u2014like excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, stress, and eating a typical, toxin-heavy, nutrient-poor American diet. After that, you\u2019ll have to replace the good bacteria you\u2019ve lost over the years by taking a probiotic product. I suggest a product providing lactobacillus and bifidobacteria with at least 10 billion colony forming units (CFU). The Bottom Line Health, first and foremost, begins with a high-quality, ideally dosed multivitamin. Working up, add omega-3 fatty acids, ubiquinol CoQ10, and then probiotics. These four essential supplements are foundational to your health as they help every cell and tissue throughout your body.

Because those birth defects happen in the first month of pregnancy, often before a woman knows she is pregnant, and with almost half of pregnancies in the U.S. unplanned, multivitamins are recognized as a key strategy to reduce the risk of NTDs, the March of Dimes says. \nBabies born to Hispanic women are more likely to be born with NTDs than babies born to non-Hispanic white women --- and non-Hispanic black women, the survey shows. \nThe March of Dimes says up to seven in 10 NTDs in the U.S. each could be prevented if all women capable of having a baby took daily multivitamins containing folic acid. \nAfter pregnancy begins, the folic acid recommendation increases to 600 micrograms daily. In addition, iron, calcium, vitamin D, DHA, and iodine have been found to play a key role in baby's growth and development during pregnancy. \nHighlighting the challenges of access to care, Hispanic women reported the cost of prenatal care having an impact during pregnancy (53 percent), which is significantly higher than among black women (34 percent) and relatively higher than in the general population (43 percent). \n\"Disparities among racial and ethnic groups in birth defects and other birth outcomes, such as preterm birth and infant mortality, have lifelong implications for the health and well-being of families and for our nation,\" says Dr. Jos\u00e9 Cordero , a professor and director of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Georgia College of Public Health . \n\"It is critical that we continue to work to improve access to information and comprehensive prenatal care for mothers in African American /black and Hispanic communities,\" says Cordero, who also is a physician . and a former member of the March of Dimes board of trustees. \nSurvey findings also show that 77 percent of all women worry that potential changes to the health care system would impact access to prenatal care negatively. Also, 43 percent of women who have been or are currently pregnant reported that costs of care affect when and whether they seek prenatal care for their pregnancy. \n\"The March of Dimes is hearing this consistently from women-they are scared that insurance coverage to support healthy pregnancies and full-term babies, such as prenatal care and prenatal vitamins, may diminish or even disappear with the proposed changes in the health care system,\" says Stewart. \nOf women who reported taking a prenatal or multivitamin during their current or last pregnancy, half took over-the-counter vitamins, and half took prescription prenatal vitamins. Of those women who took prescription prenatal vitamins, 88 percent reported it was covered by their insurance. \nPhysicians are the No. 1 source of education for women about healthy pregnancies. Seventy-four percent of women who have been or currently are pregnant reported seeing their physician for information about pregnancy health and childbirth, and 92 percent of women who did take prenatal vitamins or multivitamins during their current or last pregnancy said they did so based on a recommendation from a health care professional. \nNearly half of women who have been or are currently pregnant also reported they sought information online, which the March of Dimes says reinforces the opportunity to reach millions with prenatal health facts. \nOther survey findings show most women reporting they're aware that folic acid is important for health of baby-but not when to take it, how much to take, or why it is important. Even less understanding was reported around other key nutrients. \nWhile nearly two-thirds of all women were able to identify folic acid as a very important nutrient, fewer than 40 percent of women cited iron, calcium, and vitamin D as vitamins that may help reduce a woman's risk of having a baby with a birth defect. \nAbout 85 percent of women who reported being familiar with folic acid either didn't know or cited an inaccurate recommended amount of the nutrient. \nThirteen percent of women weren't aware that avoiding smoking and tobacco products would help reduce the risk of birth defects, and 12 percent were unaware that eliminating drinking and illegal drugs would do the same. \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

According to news reporting from Derby, United Kingdom , by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"In addition to being essential for movement, skeletal muscles act as both a store and source of key macronutrients. As such, muscle is an important tissue for whole body homeostasis, undergoing muscle wasting in times of starvation, disease, and stress, for example, to provide energy substrates for other tissues.\" \nThe news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the University of Nottingham , \"Yet, muscle wasting is also associated with disability, comorbidities, and mortality. As nutrition is so crucial to maintaining muscle homeostasis 'in health', it has been postulated that muscle wasting in cachexia syndromes may be alleviated by nutritional interventions. This review will highlight recent work in this area in relation to muscle kinetics, the acute metabolic (e.g. dietary protein), and longer-term effects of dietary interventions. Whole body and skeletal muscle protein synthesis invariably exhibit deranged kinetics (favouring catabolism) in wasting states; further, many of these conditions harbour blunted anabolic responses to protein nutrition compared with healthy controls. These derangements underlie muscle wasting. Recent trials of essential amino acid and protein-based nutrition have shown some potential for therapeutic benefit. Nutritional modulation, particularly of dietary amino acids, may have benefits to prevent or attenuate disease-induced muscle wasting.\" \nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Nonetheless, there remains a lack of recent studies exploring these key concepts to make conclusive recommendations.\" \nFor more information on this research see: Nutrient modulation in the management of disease-induced muscle wasting: evidence from human studies.

Other than skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer found in American women. \nOctober is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The goal of the month is to promote awareness of the symptoms and warning signs of breast cancer, as well as to raise funding for research. An additional point to the campaign is promoting mammograms for early detection. \n\"If we find it early enough it is curable,\" said Julie Holden , 21st Medical Group mammography technician. \"We want to catch it while it's small. It is a much better prognosis if we find it when it's just starting out. That's why we recommend annual screenings.\" \nThe exact cause of breast cancer is unknown, Holden said. Because there are no signals to indicate who will contract the disease in advance, annual screenings for women should start at age 40. For women with a history of breast cancer in their family screenings should start earlier. \nAccording to the CDC , breast cancer mostly affects women who are older than 50, but younger women also are at risk. About 10 percent of breast cancer cases in the U.S. are found in women younger than 45. \nWarning signs of breast cancer can include a noticeable change in the size or shape of the breast, pain in an area of the breast, a change in the look of the nipple, or discharge from the nipple, among other symptoms, according to the CDC . \nAny of the symptoms can come from a cause other than breast cancer, however, if they are present, report them to a health care professional to identify the cause. The professional will order a mammogram and an ultrasound to determine the cause. \n'The biggest warning sign is a palpable lump,\" Holden said. \"If the patient feels a new lump they need to get in and have it checked. That's why the annual screening is so important. The screening can see things way before you can feel them, so we catch them earlier.\" \nSome facts about breast cancer: \n* 1 in every 8 women is diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime.

Around 500,000 people in the UK have Alzheimer's but currently there are no effective treatments or a cure. \nDr , a senior lecturer at Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences , is leading the study. He said: \"The lack of a cure for Alzheimer's disease means there is an urgent need to develop new, innovative approaches to combating it. \n\"We have known for a long time that the beta amyloid protein is toxic to brain cells; it has recently been found that manipulating the activity of neurons can reduce the protein in some regions of the brain. \n\"But what is not well understood is how it can be used to do this across many brain regions at the same time. \n\"We are hopeful that this research can contribute to a new strategy for stopping Alzheimer's developing, particularly in people who, owing to family history or genetic issues, are seen to be at high risk of the disease.\" \nThe pre-clinical research will be focused on a brain area which communicates with many other areas and is among those most affected by Alzheimer's. \nIt will discover whether activating neurons in this brain area, using light, can enhance fast brainwaves which are impaired in people with the disease. The study will investigate whether such enhancement of brainwaves can reduce build-up of the toxic protein in a range of areas of the brain. \nThe research has received a grant of Pounds 50,000 from Alzheimer's Research UK \nDr Carol Routledge , the charity's director of research, said: \"Dementia is one of our greatest medical challenges, but research has the power to improve our understanding of the condition and deliver effective new treatments. \n\"With around 70,000 people in Scotland living with dementia and no new treatments in over a decade, pioneering projects such as these offer real hope in the fight against dementia. It is paramount that we can support researchers as they add crucial pieces of knowledge to our growing understanding of the diseases that cause dementia.\" \nScotland is leading a number of cutting edge research projects into Alzheimer's disease. In 2016, scientists at Glasgow University hailed a \"potential breakthrough\" after a protein therapy was shown to completely reverse symptoms during a trial on genetically-engineered mice. \nThe study, in collaboration with researchers in Hong Kong , demonstrated that mice given injections of this protein via their stomach lining restored their memory and cognitive functions back to the level of a healthy mouse of the same age within one week. \nCredit: By Lucinda Cameron , Press Association Scotl \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

The finding might explain disordered eating behavior -- and even a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease -- among obese and diabetic individuals, the researchers said (see also Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases and Conditions - Obesity ). \nThe study was published Oct. 19 in JCI Insight. \nBoth obesity and type 2 diabetes are linked to decreased metabolism in the brain. This hypometabolism is also associated with Alzheimer's disease, but researchers have not pinpointed why. To examine the mechanism, the Yale team studied brain glucose levels in three different groups of adults: individuals who are lean and healthy, and those with either obesity or poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. \nAfter fasting overnight, the study participants received intravenous infusions of glucose for two hours. During the infusions, the researchers used a brain scanning technique -- magnetic resonance spectroscopy -- to measure levels of glucose in the brain. \nWhile blood glucose levels among the participants were similar, the researchers detected significant differences in brain glucose. Among the obese and diabetic participants, \"we found decreased or blunted entry of glucose into the brain,\" said first author and assistant professor of medicine Janice Hwang , M.D. \nThat blunting could be one mechanism that undermines the ability of the brain to sense glucose, she noted. \nThe researchers also rated participants' hunger, satisfaction, and fullness before and after the infusions. \"The lean people who had more glucose entry into the brain also felt more full, even though they hadn't eaten overnight,\" she said. \nHwang explained further: \"Glucose is the most primitive signal to the brain that you've eaten. Could it be that obese individuals are not getting sugar into the brain, and not sensing it; thus the feedback loop to stop eating could also be blunted?\" \nThe study points to the importance of sugar transport from the blood into the brain as both a target for further research and possible pharmacological intervention in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, the researchers noted. \nKeywords for this news article include: Bariatrics, Overnutrition, Type 2 Diabetes, Yale University , Alzheimer Disease, Diet and Nutrition, Nutrition Disorders, Risk and Prevention, Obesity and Diabetes, Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus, Neurodegenerative Diseases and Conditions, Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases and Conditions - Obesity. \nOur reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around the world.

Once we pinpoint the beneficial effects that these novel gene variants are causing, we'll be in a position to develop drugs that mimic those effects and, ideally, help people attain longer, healthier lifespans.\" \nThe first of the three projects funded by the grant will be led by Yousin Suh , Ph.D., professor of genetics, of ophthalmology & visual sciences and of medicine at Einstein. She and colleagues will analyze the entire genomes (approximately 20,000 genes) of 700 healthy centenarians and compare them with the genomes of 800 individuals (average age 70) with no family history of extreme longevity. The researchers will look for gene variants that are enriched in the centenarian genome but rare or absent in the genomes of the \"ordinary\" individuals. The scientists will check to see whether those candidate longevity genes are also present in the genomes of other centenarians being studied in the US and Europe . \nNovel gene variants found in the first project will then be introduced into the genomes of mice, to evaluate whether the gene variants yield benefits in animals that are relevant for late-life human health. Knowledge gained from finding \"longevity variants\" in people and validating them in animals will culminate in the third project: developing and testing small molecules aimed at duplicating the positive physiological effects produced by the longevity gene variants. \nKeywords for this news article include: Pharmaceuticals, Therapy, Genetics, Risk and Prevention, Albert Einstein College of Medicine . \nOur reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around the world.

According to news reporting originating from Kaohsiung, Taiwan , by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Maternal high-fat (HF) diet is believed to induce oxidative stress and activate nutrient-sensing signals, which increase the risk of adult offspring to develop hypertension. We investigated whether resveratrol prevents the combined maternal plus postweaning HF-diets-induced hypertension in adult male offspring, with a focus on the kidney.\" \nOur news editors obtained a quote from the research from Kaohsiung Medical University , \"Female Sprague-Dawley rats received either a normal diet (ND) or HF diet (D12331, Research Diets) for 5 weeks before mating and during gestation and lactation. The male offspring were placed on either the ND or HF diet from weaning to 4 months of age, resulting in four experimental groups (maternal diet/postweaning diet; n=8-10/group): ND/ND, ND/HF, HF/ND and HF/HF. Another group of HF/HF rats (n=10) was treated with 0.5% resveratrol in drinking water between 2 and 4 months of age (HF/HF+R). Rats were killed at 4 months of age. We found that HF/HF-induced hypertension in adult offspring was prevented by resveratrol. Resveratrol mediated its protective effect on HF/HF-induced hypertension in the kidneys of male offspring by diminishing oxidative stress; reducing renal asymmetric dimethylarginine levels; mediating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in favor of vasodilatation; restoring nutrient-sensing pathways via increased levels of silent information regulator transcript 1 (SIRT1), AMP-activated protein kinase 2 alpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha; and inducing autophagy. Our data implicated an association between oxidative stress, RAS, nitric oxide, and nutrient-sensing signals in HF/HF-induced hypertension.\" \nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Resveratrol, acting as an antioxidant as well as a SIRT1 activator, might be a therapeutic approach for hypertension.\" \nFor more information on this research see: Resveratrol prevents the combined maternal plus postweaning high-fat-diets-induced hypertension in male offspring.

This leads to inflammation and surface damage, which provides a foothold for fatty deposit to build up. \nThe researchers have shown this response is triggered by a protein called hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which controls cell metabolism and is known to have a role in some types of cancer. \nDrugs that target HIF are already in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, but this new research suggests they could be repurposed to prevent atherosclerosis. \nProfessor , lead author from the University of Sheffields Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease , said: Weve found an exciting new target for treating atherosclerosis, and we know there are cancer drugs that we could potentially repurpose. \nThat would save us having to develop something from scratch, and means were that bit nearer to treatments that doctors and patients will be able to benefit from. \nThe bends and branches in our blood vessels are completely normal but we tend to find this is where fatty deposits are most likely to build up. We now have an explanation for this, along with the potential to develop treatments that prevent atherosclerosis. \nProfessor , Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation , said: Stopping the build-up of fatty plaques in arteries has the potential to significantly reduce deaths from heart attack and stroke. \nAs research reveals more of what goes on in our blood vessels to allow fatty plaques to develop, we can find ways to prevent this build-up. Its too early to say for certain, but treatments targeting HIF might one day allow us to do this. \nThe study is published in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (ATVB) today (25 October 2017). \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

Unfortunately, there are limited available treatments that can prevent this hyperexcitability. However, University of Alabama at Birmingham researchers have found that inducing a biochemical alteration in brain proteins via the dietary supplement glucosamine was able to rapidly dampen that pathological hyperexcitability in rat and mouse models (see also Central Nervous System Diseases and Conditions - Epilepsy ). \nThese results represent a potentially novel therapeutic target for the treatment of seizure disorders, and they show the need to better understand the physiology underlying these neural and brain circuit changes. \nProteins are the workhorses of living cells, and their activities are tightly and rapidly regulated in responses to changing conditions. Adding or removing a phosphoryl group to proteins is a well-known regulator for many proteins, and it is estimated that human proteins may have as many as 230,000 sites for phosphorylation. \nA lesser-known regulation comes from the addition or removal of N-acetylglucosamine to proteins, which is usually controlled by glucose, the primary fuel for neurons. Several years ago, neuroscientist Lori McMahon , Ph.D., professor of cell, developmental and integrative biology at UAB, found out from her colleague John Chatham , D.Phil ., a UAB professor of pathology and a cardiac physiologist, that brain cells had the second-highest amounts of proteins with N-acetylglucosamine, or O-GlcNAcylation, in the body. \nAt the time, very little was known about how O-GlcNAcylation might affect brain function, so McMahon and Chatham started working together. In 2014, McMahon and Chatham, in a study led by graduate student Erica Taylor and colleagues, reported that acute increases in protein O-GlcNAcylation caused long-term synaptic depression, a reduction in neuronal synaptic strength, in the hippocampus of the brain. This was the first time acute changes in O-GlcNAcylation of neuronal proteins were shown to directly change synaptic function. \nSince neural excitability in the hippocampus is a key feature of seizures and epilepsy, they hypothesized that acutely increasing protein O-GlcNAcylation might dampen the pathological hyperexcitability associated with these brain disorders. \nThat turned out to be the case, as reported in the Journal of Neuroscience study, \"Acute increases in protein O-GlcNAcylation dampen epileptiform activity in hippocampus.\" The study was led by corresponding author McMahon and first author Luke Stewart , a doctoral student in the Neuroscience Theme of the Graduate Biomedical Sciences Program. Stewart is co-mentored by McMahon and Chatham. \n\"Our findings support the conclusion that protein O-GlcNAcylation is a regulator of neuronal excitability, and it represents a promising target for further research on seizure disorder therapeutics,\" they wrote in their research significance statement. The researchers caution that the mechanism underlying the dampening is likely to be complex. \nResearch details \nGlucose, the major fuel for neurons, also controls the levels of protein O-GlcNAcylation on proteins. However, high levels of the dietary supplement glucosamine, or an inhibitor of the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAcylation, leads to rapid increases in O-GlcNAc levels. \nIn experiments with hippocampal brain slices treated to induce a stable and ongoing hyperexcitability, UAB researchers found that an acute increase in protein O-GlcNAcylation significantly decreased the sudden bursts of electrical activity known as epileptiform activity in area CA1 of the hippocampus. An increased protein O-GlcNAcylation in normal cells also protected against a later induction of drug-induced hyperexcitability. \nThe effects were seen in slices treated with both glucosamine and an inhibitor of the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc groups. They also found that treatment with glucosamine alone for as short a time as 10 minutes was able to dampen ongoing drug-induced hyperexcitability. \nIn common with the long-term synaptic depression provoked by increased O-GlcNAcylation, the dampening of hyperexcitability required the GluA2 subunit of the AMPA receptor, which is a glutamate-gated ion channel responsible for fast synaptic transmission in the brain. This finding suggested a conserved mechanism for the two changes provoked by increased O-GlcNAcylation -- synaptic depression and dampening of hyperexcitability. \nThe researchers also found that the spontaneous firing of pyramidal neurons in another region of hippocampus, area CA3, was reduced by increased O-GlcNAcylation in normal brain slices and in slices with drug-induced hyperexcitability. This reduction in spontaneous firing of CA3 pyramidal neurons likely contributes to decreased hyperexcitability in area CA1 since the CA3 neurons directly excite those in CA1. \nSimilar to the findings for brain slices, mice that were treated to increase O-GlcNAcylation before getting drug-induced hyperexcitability had fewer of the brain activity spikes associated with epilepsy that are called interictal spikes. Several drug-induced hyperexcitable mice had convulsive seizures during the experiments -- this occurred in both the increased O-GlcNAcylation mice and the control mice. Brain activity during the seizures differed between these two groups: The peak power of the brain activity for the mice with increased O-GlcNAcylation occurred at a lower frequency, as compared with the control mice. \nKeywords for this news article include: Cells, Neurons, Seizures, Neuroscience, Peptides and Proteins, Brain Diseases and Conditions, University of Alabama at Birmingham , Central Nervous System Diseases and Conditions - Epilepsy. \nOur reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around the world.

This allows the complete resection of adenomatous polyps and prevents unnecessary polypectomy of non-neoplastic polyps. \n\"We believe these results are acceptable for clinical application and our immediate goal is to obtain regulatory approval for the diagnostic system\", added Mori. \nMoving forwards, the research team is now undertaking a multicentre study for this purpose and the team are also working on developing an automatic polyp detection system. \"Precise on-site identification of adenomas during colonoscopy contributes to the complete resection of neoplastic lesions\" said Mori. \"This is thought to decrease the risk of colorectal cancer and, ultimately, cancer-related death.\" ( ANI ) \nArticles featured in Life Extension Daily News are derived from a variety of news sources and are provided as a service by Life Extension.

When asked why they hadn't taken these steps, most board members said there was a perception that it was not a problem in the company, the boards were focusing on other things, or they didn't feel that it was a board-level issue. ___ (c)2017 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)
