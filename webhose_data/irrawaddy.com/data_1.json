Other concrete structures had been put to use as army fortifications and checkpoints. \nJournalists are not usually permitted to visit the area, a government soldier told The Irrawaddy that, at night, they see flashes of light, but there have not been any clashes for months. \nOn the road from Waingmaw town to Gang Dau Yang, The Irrawaddy saw thousands of acres of banana plantations, produced through cutting and planting tissue culture, with warning signs saying: \u201cMilitary-Owned Land.\u201d \nBusinesspeople are clearly making millions of kyats from agriculture in these conflict areas: Who are they and how were they permitted to farm the land? Kachin displaced person Bran Li points out his abandoned house in Gang Dau Yang village in Waingmaw Township. (Moe Myint / Irrawaddy). \nVacant Land Law \nOver the past six months, The Irrawaddy received classified documents from Waingmaw Township\u2019s Department of Agricultural Land Management and Statistics which shows the previous government issued ownership documents of 170,000 acres of land in Waingmaw Township to companies and individuals between 2013 and 2014 under the Management of Vacant, Fallow, or Virgin Land Law of 2012. \nThe list of owners includes: Former Kachin State chief minister Lajon Ngan Sai, senior KIA official Dr. La Ja, relatives of KIA generals, and Shan Yin Hku company which is owned by Zahkun Tin Ying of the Border Guard Force (BGF) that was previously the New Democratic Army-Kachin (NDA-K). The land permits were issued by the Union government. \nThe list also features a person named U Aung Min. Local community groups told The Irrawaddy this could refer to a former Union minister who founded the Myanmar Peace Center (MPC) but The Irrawaddy was unable to independently verify this. \nThe document shows Dr. La Ja applied for 5,900 acres and Lajon Ngan Sai was granted 2,700 acres. \nKIA official Dr. La Ja has cultivated at least 670 acres of land and the former chief minister has begun working 530 acres of land, though the document does not specific which crop. \nShan Yin Hku applied for 10,000 acres of land and has begun working 3,500 acres of it in Man Dwang and Man Waing villages of Waingmaw Township. \nThe Irrawaddy spoke to Dr. La Ja in Chiang Mai last month and he confessed to operating 500 acres of plantations growing cassava\u2014used to make tapioca\u2014in Gang Dau Yang but that he later abandoned the land before the government revoked the license a few months ago. \nHis name may still appear on official documents, he said, even though he is no longer operating a plantation. The Irrawaddy was unable to observe the land itself to verify. \nOn Aug. 11, The Irrawaddy contacted the land records department of Waingmaw Township in order to confirm the details and implementations of the land, but was refused permission. \n\u201cIt is too dangerous for us [to provide the document], you know the situation here,\u201d said a junior clerk, adding that he was once threatened with dismissal by a cabinet member.

(Moe Myint / Irrawaddy). \nOpium Poppy Substitutes \nLast month, The Irrawaddy spoke to Kachin State Chief Minister Hket Awng who officially confirmed the list above. \nAccording to him, Dr. La Ja received 5,000 acres and former chief minister Lajon Ngan Sai received 2,700 acres of land as approved by the previous government. \nHe said the U Aung Min listed \u201cprobably\u201d referred to the former Union minister. \nHket Awng explained that individuals and companies can apply to use vacant land but must implement their proposals within four years in line with the 2012 Land Law\u2014failure to do so can result in the land being repealed. \nHe said the Central Committee for Vacant, Fallow, and Virgin Land Management and Kachin State authorities handed over 1.2 million acres of land to companies, armed organizations, and politicians over the past few years with the purpose of decreasing the amount of opium produced in the state. \nOnly 100,000 acres are currently being cultivated, he said. \nLocal authorities allocated land to 525 individuals and businesses while the central committee granted 301 permits. It\u2019s unclear how much of the 1.2 million acres was deemed vacant due to displacement of villagers into camps. \nThe land grows rice, sugarcane, rubber, and bananas, according to local parliamentarian Naw Li who said more than 30,000 acres of banana plantations had been established in Waingmaw Township alone\u2014mostly with Chinese owners producing fruit for the Chinese market. \nBoth the member of Kachin State parliament and the chief minister claimed all such projects were approved under the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP)-led government.

(Moe Myint/ Irrawaddy). \nAdvantages and Disadvantages \nThe government acknowledges that planting banana through tissue culture damages the soil quality but ignores the activity encourage more jobs in the area and to avoid formers reverting to poppy cultivation. \nAccording to the Kachin State chief minister, 10,000 acres of banana plantations were handed to BGFs and their relatives to halt opium poppy cultivation. \nThe chief minister claimed the National League for Democracy (NLD)-led government had reduced 10,000 acres of poppy cultivation in the border regions to just 3,000 acres, though he had no official data to support this claim. \nWorkers in remote regions such as Che Phwe and Sar Law switched from working on poppy plantations to bananas since 2015, he said. \nParliamentarian Naw Li provided a different perspective, pointing out banana plantations did not provide decent revenue and the soil would soon lose its nutrients unless a lot of fertilizer was used. \nThe Irrawaddy met with a banana expert from China overseeing a 2,000-acre banana plantation in Nanwa forest of Waingmaw Township\u2014an area protected by the Forestry Department and close to KIA outposts. After nine years, the soil became so damaged he is now seeking a new location to farm. \nThe project is operated by local businessman U Nyunt Aung but two Chinese workers supervise the plantation and hired 22 migrant workers from Rakhine State. \nOne of the Chinese nationals Xiao Li told The Irrawaddy his boss exports at least 300 truckloads of bananas to China annually, each carrying 20 tons. \nHe sells one banana stalk for 36 Chinese Yuan (US$5.4) across the border in China. \nNaw Li said the move to cultivate bananas rather than opium poppy did not bring benefits to locals who are not taught new agricultural techniques and said he estimated the state government received just 60,000 kyats for each lorry load of bananas in taxes. \nAlthough he agreed with the project\u2019s intention, he said opium fields had not been significantly reduced as bananas are usually grown on flat land with more water, rather than the hills which support poppy crops. \n\u201cPoppy growers are not interested to work in banana gardens,\u201d said parliamentarian Naw Li. \nA militia leader in Sudung, Waingmaw Township told the Irrawaddy that opium production has not been dramatically reduced in border areas as locals could not get as much money from other harvests such as bananas, rice, rubber, rambutan, dragon fruit, and cassava.

(Moe Myint/ Irrawaddy). \nFurther burdens \nAfter one-and-a-half years in office, the NLD still do not have proper statistics on the implementation of projects under the vacant, fallow, and virgin land policy. \nRegional lawmaker Naw Li said even regional ministers are not allowed to enter restricted areas without permission from regional border affair ministers due to safety concerns. \n\u201cEven cabinet members keen to interact with local people, they can\u2019t reach out to the people on the ground,\u201d said Naw Li. \nKachin State Chief Minister Dr. Hket Aung told The Irrawaddy they have received land dispute complaints claiming land belongs to IDPs. \nHe ordered the state office\u2019s secretary to establish a land scrutiny commission in order to establish the amount of redistributed land and how much of it belongs to IDPs. \nHe declined to give a time frame for the scrutiny process and the resettlement of IDPs but acknowledged it could be a growing problem in the area. \n\u201cOur government is working for peace. The IDPs must return to their origins when we have peace. We will not let official land confiscation happen in future,\u201d he said. Trucks queue in the border town Sudhung in Waingmaw Township.

A day earlier, U Khin Maung Htay, a lawmaker representing Ann Township Constituency No. 2, submitted his resignation. \nThree lawmakers have requested to leave the ANP this year, within a three month period. Upper house lawmaker Daw Htoot May sent her resignation letter to the ANP in late July to rejoin the newly re-registered Arakan League for Democracy (ALD) party. \nThe ANP was formed in June 2013 with the merger of two Rakhine political parties, the Rakhine Nationalities Development Party (RNDP) and the Arakan League for Democracy (ALD), to consolidate votes in the 2015 general election. The latter formed for the 1990 election and the former was established in 2010 and has contested in the elections since then. \nDue to the friction within the ANP, the ALD decided to re-establish its party early this year. \nIn their resignation letters, U Than Maung Oo, 57, and U Khin Maung Htay, 33, said they resigned as members and central committee leaders of the ANP. \nRegarding his decision, U Than Maung Oo told The Irrawaddy on Tuesday that even though they had merged the parties, the two party\u2019s political aims were opposing and they \u201ccould no longer work together.\u201d He was one of the people who had initiated the party merger in 2013. \nU Khin Maung Htay did not comment on his resignation. \nANP vice chairman U Khine Pyay Soe said the decision on the resignation letters would have to wait until the central committee leaders meeting, which will be held next week, either on Oct. 13 or Oct. 14. \n\u201cAs the central committee leaders are selected through the ANP\u2019s congress, the decision to approve the resignation letters will have to come from the central committee meeting,\u201d explained U Khine Pyay Soe. \nThe ANP is the third largest party in the country and it won 45 out of 1150 seats in November 2015, following the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) party and the opposition Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP). \nIt contested 63 seats in Rakhine and Chin states, and Irrawaddy and Yangon regions; and won 10 seats in the Upper House, 12 in the Lower House, 22 in Rakhine State Parliament and one seat for the Rakhine ethnic affairs minister post in Yangon. \nDespite its majority win in the state Parliament, the party did not get to lead the state government, as the heads [chief ministers] of the state and regional governments were appointed by the president, according to the military-drafted 2008 Constitution. \nThe ANP strictly imposed that its members abide by its regulations and those who did not follow party rules were expelled. There have been about seven ANP members, (who were strong ALD members) expelled from the party for \u201cviolations of party regulations\u201d since 2016, according to U Tun Aung Kyaw, a general secretary of the ANP. \nU Kyaw Lwin, the Rakhine State minister for agriculture, livestock, mining and forestry, and U Mya Than, the deputy state speaker, were among those expelled for collaborating with the National League for Democracy in the formation of the state cabinet and Parliament \u2013 as the ANP had a policy that it would not collaborate with the NLD. \nU Aung Mya Kyaw, a secretary of the ANP, told The Irrawaddy, \u201cThese latest two resignation letters will be the last to resign from the party, as those who wanted to leave the ANP were all strong ALD members.\u201d \nBut none of the three have officially left the ANP yet, he said, as they will have to deal with any issues related to them with the party before their resignations are accepted. \n\u201cFor instance, Ma Htoot May sent her resignation months ago, but she is still on the party list and she can leave only when she has dealt with the issues she needs to,\u201d said U Aung Mya Kyaw. \nChit Min Tun contributed to this report.

common enemy of Myanmar and Bangladesh, Myanmar\u2019s State Counselor\u2019s Office said on Tuesday. \nMyanmar declared the ARSA an extremist terrorist group in accordance with the country\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Law after violent attacks on security outposts on Aug. 25. \nMyanmar State Counselor\u2019s Office Minister U Kyaw Tint Swe visited Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, from Sunday through Tuesday and met with the Bangladeshi Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdul Hassan Mahmood Ali to draft plans for the repatriation of Muslim residents who had fled to Bangladesh escaping military clearance operation after the attack by the ARSA in northern Rakhine. \nThe United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the exodus of more than 500,000 Rohingya since late August has become the \u201cworld\u2019s fastest developing refugee emergency, a humanitarian and human rights nightmare\u201d at the UN Security Council meeting last week. \nThe Myanmar government claimed more than 500 people have been killed since Aug. 25, most of them insurgents, whom it has accused of attacking civilians in northern Rakhine State. \nMinister U Kyaw Tint Swe was accompanied by permanent secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, U Kyaw Zeya. \nBangladesh also stressed its policy of zero tolerance against terrorism, according to a Tuesday statement issued by the Myanmar State Counselor\u2019s Office on its official Facebook page. \nMyanmar State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said in an address to the nation and international communities last month that \u201crefugees from this country will be accepted without any problem\u201d under the 1993 agreement with Bangladesh. \nAccording to Reuters\u2019 report, the two countries had agreed on Monday to form a \u201cworking group\u201d to commence plans for repatriation. \n\u201cWe are looking forward to a peaceful solution to the crisis,\u201d the Bangladeshi foreign affairs minister was quoted in the report. \nMinister U Kyaw Tint Swe said during the meeting with Bangladeshi officials that Myanmar was \u201cready to begin the verification and repatriation of refugees,\u201d according to the statement.

Myanmar says more than 500 people have been killed, most of them insurgents. \nNational Security Adviser Thaung Tun told Reuters that he has spoken with his US counterpart, H.R. McMaster, on the phone and visited members of the US Congress in Washington last week. He said sanctions were not specifically discussed. \nThe United States called last week on countries to suspend providing weapons to Myanmar\u2019s military, but it stopped short of threatening to reimpose US sanctions, which were suspended under the Obama administration. \n\u201cWe need to ensure that democracy has a chance to survive in Myanmar. This is a young democracy,\u201d Thaung Tun told Reuters in an interview at the United Nations, noting that government leader and Nobel peace laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has only been in office for 18 months. \nDaw Aung San Suu Kyi assumed power following a landslide election win after former military leaders initiated a political transition. For years, the United States and others imposed sanctions on Myanmar in support of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s campaign for democracy. \n\u201cWe have a lot of challenges and these challenges cannot be overcome in a day. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. So we can\u2019t undo 50 years of challenges,\u201d said Thaung Tun, adding that he hoped to meet in person with McMaster, President Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, to brief him on the current situation. \n\u201cNobody Above the Law\u201d \nA Trump administration official said last month the violence made it harder for the United States and Myanmar to build warmer ties, and there would likely be some \u201ceasing\u201d in the short term, but he did not expect a return to sanctions. \nThaung Tun said he had not met privately with US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley but had spoken to her briefly on the sidelines of other meetings in New York. \nThe UN Security Council met publicly last week on Myanmar for the first time since 2009. Haley said the Myanmar authorities appeared to be carrying out \u201ca brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority.\u201d \nShe said countries should stop supplying weapons to Myanmar until the military has sufficient accountability measures. \nThaung Tun said \u201caction has been taken against a number of policemen who exceeded their bounds in dealing with detainees.\u201d \n\u201cWe have very strict instructions for the security forces to carry out their duties within the bounds of the code of conduct,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody is above the law.\u201d \nHe said that ethnic cleansing or genocide was not happening in Myanmar. \nThe Myanmar government has said that there have no military operations since Sept. 5. But Thaung Tun said that since then security forces have responded when attacked. \n\u201cUnder the cover of night there have been some sporadic attacks and the police and the security people have been required to respond in self-defense,\u201d he said. \nThe Rohingya are denied citizenship and classified as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots in Myanmar that go back centuries, with communities marginalized and subjected to bouts of communal violence over the years. \nBangladesh and Myanmar agreed on Monday to set up a \u201cworking group\u201d to plan the repatriation of those who had fled.

We hope to work out a final rate at the December meeting,\u201d he told The Irrawaddy. \nThe new rate will then be put forward to parliament for approval, according to the Ministry of Labor, Immigration and Population. \nThe new rate is an appropriate amount because there is little difference between the amounts proposed by employer and labor groups, said U Khin Maung Nyo. \nThe minimum wage law was enacted in March, 2013, and respective by-laws in July that year. The new wage\u20143,600 kyats for an eight-hour working day\u2014came into effect on Sept. 1 the same year. \nIt was applied to workers across all sectors nationwide, except small and family-run businesses that employ fewer than 15 people.

He was 87. \n\u201cHe was sick because of his poor heart, and it was like he could not stand it anymore,\u201d a member of his family told The Irrawaddy. \nBorn in 1930, U Aye Myint took an early interest in the floral patterns carved into wooden buildings in the ancient capital of Innwa in Mandalay Region and in Sagaing Region and was inspired to become skilled in traditional Myanmar design. \nHe learnt his craft from veteran Myanmar artists including U Kywe Lay and U Khin Maung (Bank) and began his career in 1954. \nIn 1970 he was asked by military junta leader Gen. Ne Win to travel to Japan, Germany, and Britain to learn the art and technology of designing currency. \nWorking at Wazi in Magwe Region, he designed Myanmar currency notes and coins\u2014which were printed with help from German technologies\u2014as well as lottery tickets and stamps. \nHis designs for the five and 10 kyat notes became famous among the people, especially as they featured the face of independence hero Gen. Aung San. \nAfter a number of years, however, he was forced to retire as Myanmar\u2019s ruling generals became suspicious of him and accused him of political activism. \n\u201cHe told us that one of his design failures, and one of the most memorable points of his life as a currency designer, was that the cluster of toddy palm fruits on the five-kyat note faced upward rather than downwards,\u201d said one of his students and disciples Tampawaddy U Wing Maung. \n\u201cHe said the design and pattern of the note was made in Germany while he was there but due to a rush in the process, he only found the mistake after the notes were printed and distributed.\u201d \nAfter leaving Wazi, U Aye Myint struggled as a designer of traditional Myanmar art in Yangon for about 11 years, often drawing cover designs for Buddhist literary magazines. \n\u201cHe was a passionate artist who always explained every piece of his art work and design in those magazines. By reading his texts and viewing his art works, readers could learn about traditional Myanmar art and design,\u201d explained Tampawaddy U Win Maung. \nAfter settling down in Amarapura, U Aye Myint\u2019s designs appeared at many Buddhist religious buildings including the ornamentations of the southern stairway of Yangon\u2019s Shwedagon Pagoda and the golden umbrella of Mandalay\u2019s Maha Muni Buddha Image. \nIn early 2016, on the day of his 86th birthday, U Aye Myint launched a showcase of his works in Mandalay. \nDuring the exhibition, he launched a book named Ancient Myanmar Designs, a collection of Myanmar traditional arts and designs, which he and the late historian Dr. Than Tun had collected over the space of 50 years. \nUntil his last days, U Aye Myint worked as a consultant at Saung Dar traditional weaving Academy in Amarapura and a consultant for conservation and restoration works of numerous historical buildings around Mandalay, including Mandalay\u2019s ancient Shwenandaw Kyaung Temple and Amarapura\u2019s famous U Bein Bridge. \n\u201cAn expert like him should be substituted. However, his disciples will continue to preserve the value of traditional arts and designs and will hand them down to future generations,\u201d said Tampawaddy U Win Maung. \nU Aye Myint is survived by his wife, three daughters and a son. His body will be cremated at Taung Inn Myauk Inn cemetery on Wednesday afternoon.

But it can matter what you read, where you read it, and who you are. If you are not careful, you could make a gaffe or insult those around you. Take the British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson , for example. \nWhen the Foreign Secretary visited Myanmar\u2019s Shwedagon Pagoda earlier this year during an official trip to Myanmar, the 53-year old Conservative Party member tolled a huge bell and recited lines from the poem Mandalay by Rudyard Kipling: \u201cThe temple-bells they say/ Come you back, you English soldier.\u201d (In fact, \u201cBojo\u201d made a mistake, it\u2019s British, not English in the poem.) \nHis impromptu recital was recorded and featured in a documentary on Britain\u2019s Channel 4. In the video, Boris Johnson was interrupted by British ambassador to Myanmar who said \u201cprobably not a good idea\u201d and \u201cnot appropriate\u201d in a stern voice after reminding the Foreign Secretary he was on microphone. \nYes, it is inappropriate and insensitive for Boris Johnson to recite those lines in a country that was colonized by the British from 1824 to 1948. \nTo make matters worse, the person uttering \u201ccome you back, you English soldier\u201d was not just an ordinary citizen but the Foreign Secretary from the country that annexed Myanmar through three bloody wars and oppressed local resistance. \nWere it not for UK Ambassador Andrew Patrick\u2019s interruption, the Foreign Secretary may have continued with the lines \u201cBloomin\u2019 idol made o\u2019 mud / Wot they called the Great Gawd Budd / Plucky lot she cared for idols when I kissed \u2018er where she stud!\u201d \nReferring to the Buddha as the \u201cGreat Gawd Budd\u201d at one of the holiest Buddhist sites in the country would have been an act of sacrilege. \nWho knows why the Foreign Secretary uttered lines from the colonial poem. Probably, he is a great fan of Rudyard Kipling or felt nostalgic for the age of British imperialism. Whatever the case, a British Foreign Secretary\u2019s recitation of the colonial poem in the country where they once colonized is an insult to the country and hurts the feeling of its people. \nAdding to Myanmar people\u2019s dismay, the release of the video footage coincides with a time when Britain, along with many other countries, has been actively criticizing the Southeast Asian country and its popular leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi for the country\u2019s treatment of the self-identifying Rohingya issue, which is in face the result of a bad colonial legacy left by the British to Myanmar people. \nIf the British hadn\u2019t encouraged Bengali inhabitants from Bengal Province of India (now Bangladesh) to migrate into the then sparsely populated and fertile valleys of Rakhine in the 1800s, Myanmar today would be in a very different position in the controversial issue. \nWhile the British government has been repeatedly criticizing the Lady for her silence on the issue as well as for not doing enough to defend the minority self-identifying Rohingya, St Hugh\u2019s college of Oxford University, where she studied politics, philosophy and economics between 1964 and 1967, removed the painting of the Nobel laureate from its main entrance as the college received the gift of a new painting. It\u2019s questionable why the portrait was taken down amid criticism on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s on the issue. \nOn Tuesday, Oxford City Council withdrew an honor granting Aung San Suu Kyi the Freedom of Oxford as it was \u201cno longer appropriate\u201d for her to hold it given to her response to the self-identifying Rohingya issue. \nOf course it would be annoying for Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to see those kind of responses from the UK, which was in some ways her second home, spending nearly two decades studying and raising a family there with her late British husband. \nFor the majority of the Myanmar people, the actions of Oxford City Council and Oxford University were deliberate insults to the woman whom they have elected as their leader. \nIt\u2019s interesting to ask why Britain\u2019s government and civil organizations are united in humiliating Myanmar and its leader unlike many other western countries like the US, which is taking a much more supportive role by offering assistance to implement the recommendations made by the Rakhine State Advisory Commission to help the country tackle an issue spawned by British colonial rule. \nIs Britain under the mistaken impression that it has the right to bully the country because it once colonized it? \nRather than pointing fingers at Myanmar, the British should be mindful that when it comes to the self-identifying Rohingya issue, their forebears were responsible for the encouragement of mass migration from India to Myanmar for cheap farm labor. It should be noted that they did it for the interests of British Empire, especially after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 when rice demand was high in Europe. \nMyanmar had no chance to solve the problem of migration encouraged by Britain under authoritarian rule from 1962 to 2010. The former quasi-civilian government made little success in tackling the issue despite their efforts after 2012. \nUndaunted, the country\u2019s first democratically elected Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government is now trying to fix it amid other problems the country is facing such as bringing peace with ethnic armed groups. Please be aware that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government is just 18 months old. \nIt is very unfair to today\u2019s Myanmar, struggling to cope with the problems the British left behind while being criticized by those responsible who ignored their wrongdoings they did in the country more than a century ago.

Everything is fine. We\u2019re now staying at military camp [in Buthidaung]. We don\u2019t know how long we have to stay here. We are altogether eight women and eight children. \nWhen did you arrive back in Myanmar? \nWe arrived back on Oct. 3. We came [back] from Bangladesh. We had to stay one month and five days in Bangladesh at Kutupalong Refugee Camp. Bengalis tried to find us to kill us. \nHow were you abducted by terrorists? \nThey came into our village [Ye Baw Kya] around 8 a.m. on Aug. 25. They took all our phones, and surrounded the village. They tied us up and blindfolded the men. They beat the men, and asked how much gold and cash we had. I gave them all my possessions. Then they took all the villagers outside the village to Baw Tala village. Then they put men and women in separate groups. We eight women were put in a separate place. They slit the throat of men first, and knifed children and women. Then they asked eight of us if we would convert to Islam, and we won\u2019t be killed if we did. They said the God we believe in is nothing and their Islam is mighty. So, we said we would convert to Islam if they didn\u2019t slash us. So, they didn\u2019t kill us. \nWhat happened then? \nWe stayed overnight in Baw Tala village that day. We were forced to eat beef [Hindu followers abstain from eating beef], and study to dress like Muslim [women]. We didn\u2019t eat, but the children ate a little. \nDidn\u2019t you beg terrorists not to kill your husbands? \nWe did. We went down on bended knees and begged them. We had given them all our gold and made them promise not to kill our husbands. They slashed my husband even after they got gold from us. I told them that I had given them a lot of gold and asked them not to kill him. When they were about to kill my children, I said I won\u2019t do as they want if they kill my children. I said I didn\u2019t want to survive if they killed my children. [So, they didn\u2019t.] We have a gold shop. Bengalis took all 30 ticals of gold and over four million kyats. \nHow did they take you to Bangladesh? \nThey took us on foot beyond the mountains in the west of Khamaungseik village. We had to sleep two nights on mountains. We had nothing to eat and it was absolutely terrible. We arrived in Bangladesh on Aug. 28. \nWho were the people who attacked your village? \nThey included villagers of Khamaungseik as well as terrorists. I recognized around ten Khamaungseik villagers. Their leader is Norulauk. While we were detained at Baw Ta La village, five people guarded us. Others left, saying they would attack the government. The five men who were guarding us said this area [Rakhine] is not a Hindu State, not a Bamar State. They said they would turn the area [from Maungdaw border] to Sittwe to their [self-identifying Rohingya] State. We were brought by those five Bengalis to Bangladesh. The rest were left in Myanmar reportedly to attack the government. Now, they are in Bangladesh. I saw them in clothes which they had taken from our brothers and husbands. \nWho came and rescued you from Bangladesh? \nWe arrived in Bangladesh on Aug. 28 at Kutupalong Camp. Then, they brought Mawlawis and initiated us into the Islam faith. We were asked to repeat Muslim words and shout \u201cAllah.\u201d We were also asked to eat beef, and wear Burqas. Then a Muslim boy there reportedly told a Hindu barber at Kutupalong market that eight Hindu women from Myanmar were being Islamized. Hindu elders came and rescued us around 8 p.m. in the evening. \nHow did the Muslim boy know about you? \nAs soon as we arrived in Bangladesh, we were given lunch at a house. Then, they interviewed us and video-recorded it. They asked us to say in the interview that Hindus were killed by Arakanese people. They also asked us to say that our husbands, parents and relatives as well as Muslims were killed by the government; and that we would be killed if we didn\u2019t. \nSo, how did you escape? \nWe contacted [Hindu community leader] U Ni Mal . We sneaked out of Kutupalong Camp. We left for Taung Pyo Letwe in the car of a Hindu man. It took around one and a half hours. On the way, we were inspected by the Bangladesh border guards. The driver said we were going to Deepavali Festival [a Hindu religious festival]. When we got out of the car, we saw government officials waiting for us in Taung Pyo Letwe.

Yangon Chief Minister U Phyo Min Thein and officials taking a water bus in Yangon on Friday (Photo: Thet Tun Naing/ The Irrawaddy) \nYangon Chief Minister U Phyo Min Thein said at the launching ceremony that he hopes the new water transport will be helpful for the traffic congestion on Yangon\u2019s roads which has caused commuter journeys to lengthen, pledging the government was strict in ensuring the tender-award winning company was up to standard on safety and security. \nThe service was previously planned to launch in late June. Daw Tint Tint Lwin told The Irrawaddy that there had some delay in importing boats because of bad weather and also in arranging the required documents with the related government departments for the project. \nShe said based on the customers\u2019 demand, the routes and stops will be expanded under the Yangon regional government\u2019s instructions. \nTwo routes along Nga Moe Yeik Creek and Thanlyin Township will follow within three to six months after the jetties have been constructed, she said. \nSome 56 to 67 boats are expected to service the full operation, which aims to serve an annual 12 million commuters this year and a projected 24 million by 2020. \n\u201cI hope to get full customers on all 13 boats under phase one as even in the trial there was high demand,\u201d she added. \nShe added that Yangon Region Transport Authority is also arranging to expand the bus lines that connect the water bus terminals. \nCommuters will use a top-up card payment system with water bus rides costing between 300 and 500 kyats.

An estimated 2,000 self-identifying Rohingya continue to flee Rakhine State daily according to the International Organization for Migration. \n\u201cThis flow out of Myanmar has not stopped yet, it\u2019s into the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya [who are] still in Myanmar, we want to be ready in case there is a further exodus,\u201d Mark Lowcock, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs told a news briefing in Geneva on Friday, according to Reuters. \u201cHalf a million people do not pick up sticks and flee their country on a whim.\u201d \nThe self-identifying Rohingya Muslims are denied citizenship and classified as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots in Myanmar that go back centuries, with communities marginalized and subjected to bouts of violence over the years. \nMyanmar has denied it is pursuing ethnic cleansing in the state and, according to Reuters, Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed on Monday to form a working group to commence plans for the repatriation of refugees. \n\u201cIt is not honest. [Self-identifying Rohingya Muslims] are fleeing even as we have told them that nobody would cause any harm to them, and [the government] would provide security and social assistance,\u201d U Zaw Htay said. \nU Zaw Htay said there were also reports of Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA)\u2014a self-identifying Rohingya militant group which sparked the latest violence with deadly attacks on 30 police outposts on Aug. 25\u2014making threats by phone from Bangladesh to Muslims in Rakhine State, encouraging them to leave for Bangladesh, he said. \n\u201cSo, it is also possible that they are fleeing because of fear and concerns that they will be alone when renewed clashes occur,\u201d he said. \n\u201cBut then, we also heard reports that Muslims were paid to leave by boat [from Rakhine] and arrive at the camp [in Bangladesh]. Putting two and two together, this has brought into question who are funding them to leave,\u201d he added. \nDuring a visit of Myanmar State Counselor\u2019s Office Minister U Kyaw Tint Swe to Bangladesh Dhaka this week, Bangladesh said it regarded ARSA as a common enemy of the two countries. \nIn her diplomatic briefing in September focusing on the Rakhine issue, State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi urged the international community not just to look at problems but also to look at the areas where there were no problems. \nShe explained that 50 percent of Muslim villages remained intact. Human Rights Watch said last month that more than half of 400 self-identifying Rohingya villages in Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships had showed fire damage, according to satellite imagery. \n\u201cIf those people remain [in Rakhine State] Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s statement is valid. At such time, attempts at mass migration is not honest, I think. Because Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has called the international community to help find out the reason behind the exodus,\u201d said former political prisoner U Tun Kyi who is a Muslim. \n\u201cSo, I think they are trying to contradict the statement of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\u201d \nSince last week of September, thousands of self-identifying Rohingya Muslims from villages in Buthidaung have gathered at the border with Bangladesh. According to the government information committee, there were around 13,000 Muslims at the border. \n\u201cTogether with community elders, we met them and asked if they needed any assistance. They replied mildly that their relatives [from Bangladesh] called them and they would go and settle with them,\u201d said U Tin Maung Swe, secretary of Rakhine State government. \n\u201cThey said they have no problems. Entire villages are leaving and therefore there are thousands of people,\u201d he said. \nThough authorities dissuaded them from leaving and promised to provide security, health care and food, they refused to stay, he added. \n\u201cBut I don\u2019t like them breaking through border fences. The border is quite long and they can go [into Bangladesh] through other ways,\u201d said U Tin Maung Swe. \nU Tun Kyi said he condemned any person or organization which is deliberately forcing a mass exodus. He said he believed that there are persons and organizations that have exerted improper influence over people of poor education-level in the area. \n\u201cThere are a lot of interests. ARSA also has interests. The government and the Tatmadaw have shown arms seized from ARSA to international diplomats. Those arms are old and broken. Why can\u2019t the government defeat ARSA which only have broken guns?\u201d questioned U Tun Kyi. \nUpper House parliamentarian U Khin Maung Latt said international laws allow people to flee and it is difficult for the government to stop them. \n\u201cAuthorities said they would provide security and food, but they don\u2019t accept it.

At the end of a short battle, half a dozen men he had grown up with in his village were dead. \n\u201cWe had no training, no weapons,\u201d said Rashid, from the Buthidaung area of Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state, who had joined the group just two months earlier. \nAccounts from some of those, like Rashid, who took part in attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on dozens of police posts early on Aug. 25 paint a picture of a rag-tag band of hopeless, angry villagers, who were promised AK-47 rifles but ended up fighting with sticks and knives. \nHundreds joined as recently as June, according to the accounts, and membership meant little more than a knife and messages from leaders on the popular mobile messaging app Whatsapp. \nReuters interviewed half a dozen fighters and members of the group now sheltering in Bangladesh, as well as dozens of others among the more than half a million Self-identifying Rohingya refugees who have fled across the border to escape a Myanmar army counteroffensive that the United Nations has branded ethnic cleansing. \nARSA, which emerged in 2016, says in press releases and video messages from its leader, Ata Ullah, that it is fighting for the rights of the Self-identifying Rohingya, a stateless Muslim minority that has long complained of persecution in mainly Buddhist Myanmar. \nMyanmar says ARSA is a ruthless Islamist extremist movement that wants to create an Islamic republic in northern Rakhine. \nDespite the massive suffering inflicted on their communities in the weeks since the August attacks, most of the fighters now stuck in dirt-poor camps said they were determined to continue their fight and some refugees voiced support for the insurgency. \nOther refugees Reuters spoke to criticized the insurgents for bringing more misery upon them. \nMyanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s spokesman, Zaw Htay, said ARSA had killed many Muslims who had cooperated with the authorities and so \u201cpeople have felt threatened and terrorized\u201d into supporting it. He added that Myanmar\u2019s intelligence showed that religious scholars were prominent in recruiting followers. \nARSA denies killing civilians, and did not respond to a request for comment this week. \nAnalysts say the violence could galvanize ARSA members and supporters huddled in the refugee camps and among those Self-identifying Rohingya still in Myanmar, as people feel they have even less to lose. \n\u201cA militancy like this finds fertile ground because of the desperation of the community,\u201d said Richard Horsey, a Yangon-based analyst and former U.N. official. \u201cThey are willing to take suicidal steps because they don\u2019t see any other choice.\u201d \nTransnational Islamist groups could also try to exploit the desperation in the camps to radicalise people, Horsey added. Al Qaeda last month called for support for the Self-identifying Rohingya. \nHomemade Weapons and Whatsapp \nReuters could not independently verify the individual insurgents\u2019 stories, but there were broad similarities in all of their accounts. \nOne fighter, 35-year-old Kamal Hussain from a village in Rathedaung in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state, said he joined ARSA when a religious teacher stood in his village square in June, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and implored a crowd of hundreds to fight. \n\u201cHe said we have no choice but to attack Myanmar because our brothers and sisters are being killed day by day. I think everyone joined that day,\u201d Hussain said, as he sat under a tarpaulin in a Bangladesh refugee camp. \u201cWe should attack again and again. I would go back to fight if I had the chance.\u201d \nUnlike longer-serving fighters, most new joiners had little or no training or contact with the group\u2019s leaders, who communicated using Whatsapp and delivered rudimentary homemade explosives ahead of the assaults. \nA third fighter, his account supported by comments from two elders from his village interviewed separately, said he and about 60 men from Myin Hlut signed up three months ago. \nThe 26-year-old, who asked not to be named because he feared arrest by Bangladeshi authorities, said he was among 200 men who attacked another police checkpost in the early hours of Aug. 25. \n\u201cWe had only knives and sticks, no guns,\u201d he said. \u201cThey promised us AK-47s but we got nothing. The explosives didn\u2019t work. We had two of them for the whole group, but when we threw them nothing happened.\u201d \nAbout 40 fighters were killed, he said, but added that he would do it again if called on. \n\u201cI still support ARSA,\u201d he said. \u201cIf my leaders call me to go again and fight, I will go back.\u201d \nAccording to two village-level commanders, there were Whatsapp groups restricted to leaders and others to members. \nBigger groups, administered from overseas, were used to build broader community support for ARSA and the Self-identifying Rohingya cause. \nOn his phone, Shoket Ullah, an uncle of the 26-year-old fighter, scrolled through messages posted in the Whatsapp group \u201cARSA.G1\u201d, administered through a Saudi phone number, where ARSA press releases, videos of alleged Myanmar military violence and messages of support for Self-identifying Rohingyas were shared. \nAnother Whatsapp group on Ullah\u2019s phone, \u201cRohingya Desh Arakan\u201d, is administered by someone using a number from Malaysia. Tens of thousands of Self-identifying Rohingya live in both Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. \nLocal Backing \nSelf-identifying Rohingya anger at Myanmar has long existed, but this is the first serious armed resistance in decades. \nIn the crowded Bangladeshi camps, several refugees voice support for ARSA. \n\u201cI am disappointed and regret what happened but this was pre-planned by the Myanmar government,\u201d said Shafi Rahman, a 45-year-old Burmese teacher whose village was burned to the ground the day after the attacks. \u201cIf ARSA didn\u2019t attack, they would have done this to us anyway.\u201d \nSeveral refugees said some people had begun to sell cattle, vegetables and rice to raise funds for ARSA. \nNot everyone was supportive, however. When Kamal Hussain, the fighter, argued that ARSA needed to keep fighting, his neighbors in the camp shouted him down. \n\u201cWe have lost everything. Violence is not the answer,\u201d shouted one elderly man, as muddy water spilled into the tent he now calls home. \nIt is not obvious how fighters would regroup and rebuild after so many have fled across the border or disappeared. \nThree of the fighters who spoke to Reuters said they had been surprised by the ferocity of the Myanmar military\u2019s response, and within weeks commanders had told their men to put down their weapons and abandon their villages. \nSeveral said Whatsapp groups where regional and field commanders from ARSA, which before a rebranding this year called itself al-Yakin, or \u201cFaith Movement\u201d, would post updates had gone quiet. \n\u201cPeople who blame this on al-Yakin need to realize my people had to flee in 1978 and in the 1990s when there was no ARSA,\u201d said one of the two village-level commanders, who grew up in Bangladesh after his family fled an earlier outbreak of violence, but returned to Myanmar in the 1990s. \n\u201cWe should continue to attack.

But it can matter what you read, where you read it, and who you are. If you are not careful, you could make a gaffe or insult those around you. Take the British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson , for example. \nWhen the Foreign Secretary visited Myanmar\u2019s Shwedagon Pagoda earlier this year during an official trip to Myanmar, the 53-year old Conservative Party member tolled a huge bell and recited lines from the poem Mandalay by Rudyard Kipling: \u201cThe temple-bells they say/ Come you back, you English soldier.\u201d (In fact, \u201cBojo\u201d made a mistake, it\u2019s British, not English in the poem.) \nHis impromptu recital was recorded and featured in a documentary on Britain\u2019s Channel 4. In the video, Boris Johnson was interrupted by British ambassador to Myanmar who said \u201cprobably not a good idea\u201d and \u201cnot appropriate\u201d in a stern voice after reminding the Foreign Secretary he was on microphone. \nYes, it is inappropriate and insensitive for Boris Johnson to recite those lines in a country that was colonized by the British from 1824 to 1948. \nTo make matters worse, the person uttering \u201ccome you back, you English soldier\u201d was not just an ordinary citizen but the Foreign Secretary from the country that annexed Myanmar through three bloody wars and oppressed local resistance. \nWere it not for UK Ambassador Andrew Patrick\u2019s interruption, the Foreign Secretary may have continued with the lines \u201cBloomin\u2019 idol made o\u2019 mud / Wot they called the Great Gawd Budd / Plucky lot she cared for idols when I kissed \u2018er where she stud!\u201d \nReferring to the Buddha as the \u201cGreat Gawd Budd\u201d at one of the holiest Buddhist sites in the country would have been an act of sacrilege. \nWho knows why the Foreign Secretary uttered lines from the colonial poem. Probably, he is a great fan of Rudyard Kipling or felt nostalgic for the age of British imperialism. Whatever the case, a British Foreign Secretary\u2019s recitation of the colonial poem in the country where they once colonized is an insult to the country and hurts the feeling of its people. \nAdding to Myanmar people\u2019s dismay, the release of the video footage coincides with a time when Britain, along with many other countries, has been actively criticizing the Southeast Asian country and its popular leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi for the country\u2019s treatment of the self-identifying Rohingya issue, which is in face the result of a bad colonial legacy left by the British to Myanmar people. \nIf the British hadn\u2019t encouraged Bengali inhabitants from Bengal Province of India (now Bangladesh) to migrate into the then sparsely populated and fertile valleys of Rakhine in the 1800s, Myanmar today would be in a very different position in the controversial issue. \nWhile the British government has been repeatedly criticizing the Lady for her silence on the issue as well as for not doing enough to defend the minority self-identifying Rohingya, St Hugh\u2019s college of Oxford University, where she studied politics, philosophy and economics between 1964 and 1967, removed the painting of the Nobel laureate from its main entrance as the college received the gift of a new painting. It\u2019s questionable why the portrait was taken down amid criticism on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s on the issue. \nOn Tuesday, Oxford City Council withdrew an honor granting Aung San Suu Kyi the Freedom of Oxford as it was \u201cno longer appropriate\u201d for her to hold it given to her response to the self-identifying Rohingya issue. \nOf course it would be annoying for Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to see those kind of responses from the UK, which was in some ways her second home, spending nearly two decades studying and raising a family there with her late British husband. \nFor the majority of the Myanmar people, the actions of Oxford City Council and Oxford University were deliberate insults to the woman whom they have elected as their leader. \nIt\u2019s interesting to ask why Britain\u2019s government and civil organizations are united in humiliating Myanmar and its leader unlike many other western countries like the US, which is taking a much more supportive role by offering assistance to implement the recommendations made by the Rakhine State Advisory Commission to help the country tackle an issue spawned by British colonial rule. \nIs Britain under the mistaken impression that it has the right to bully the country because it once colonized it? \nRather than pointing fingers at Myanmar, the British should be mindful that when it comes to the self-identifying Rohingya issue, their forebears were responsible for the encouragement of mass migration from India to Myanmar for cheap farm labor. It should be noted that they did it for the interests of British Empire, especially after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 when rice demand was high in Europe. \nMyanmar had no chance to solve the problem of migration encouraged by Britain under authoritarian rule from 1962 to 2010. The former quasi-civilian government made little success in tackling the issue despite their efforts after 2012. \nUndaunted, the country\u2019s first democratically elected Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government is now trying to fix it amid other problems the country is facing such as bringing peace with ethnic armed groups. Please be aware that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government is just 18 months old. \nIt is very unfair to today\u2019s Myanmar, struggling to cope with the problems the British left behind while being criticized by those responsible who ignored their wrongdoings they did in the country more than a century ago.

There is no doubt that the violence in Rakhine State is more serious than we first thought. Last month, terrorist group ARSA [Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army] released a statement and declared one month\u2019s ceasefire. The one month will be over on the 9th of this month. We\u2019ll discuss if ARSA is likely to resume their terrorist attacks at that time or try to take political advantage of the sheer number of displaced persons, and if the international community is merely engaged in controversy over the terminology of Bengali or Rohingya or whether [the international community] is supporting the Rohingya ethnicity concept and their claims on territory. We will also discuss the impact of the historical legacy on the Rakhine issue and what our reporter Ko Moe Myint, who went to Rakhine State together with foreign diplomats recently, saw on the ground. Our reporter Ko Moe Myint, and U Maung Maung Soe, who has been continuously analyzing and commentating on the Rakhine, issue will join me to discuss this. I\u2019m Irrawaddy English editor Kyaw Zwa Moe. \nThe Rakhine issue has seemingly become more complicated, rather than shaping up in black and white. U Maung Maung Soe, you have recently come back from Rakhine. What did you see and hear on the ground? ARSA\u2019s ceasefire will expire on the 9th of this month. Will they resume attacks or do they have plans to make political strikes? \nMaung Maung Soe: After the attacks on Aug. 25, Bengali villages were damaged and burnt, and there were reports of people fleeing. Around 400,000 refugees reportedly fled to Bangladesh. And ARSA said they would cease fire for one month. But even after attacks have ceased, Bengali villagers are still fleeing [to Bangladesh] till today. Some accuse that they flee because of the threats of nearby ethnic Arakanese villagers. Some reports from the ground claim that Mawlawi [Islamic scholars] who have links with ARSA are intimidating Bengali villagers to leave [for Bangladesh] by the 9th of this month. Arakanese people are the minority in Buthidaung and Maungdaw. Most of the Arakanese villages have only 40 to 50 households. Only a few Arakanese villages have more than 100 households. \nKZM: Muslims are the majority there. \nMMS: There are many Bengali Muslim villages with 500 to 1,000 households. Their population is around 250,000 in Buthidaung alone. And ethnic Arakanese population is around 40,000. The Bengali population is even bigger in Maungdaw. There are around 500,000 Bengalis while there are only around 30,000 ethnic [Arakanese] people. So, it is impossible that the minority threatens the majority. So my view is that ARSA is trying to gather all the Bengalis in the region at the Bangladeshi border. According to reports on the ground, normally rice cultivation starts in May in Maungdaw as the monsoon comes early in Rakhine State. But this year, [self-identifying Rohingya] didn\u2019t grow rice [in May]. They only grew sparsely in July. So, this suggests that they had already known there would be clashes ahead. They also know that there will automatically be organizations which would provide foods for Bengalis when they get into Bangladesh. So, my view is they are trying to gather massive crowds of Bengalis at the border in order to launch a political strike. It seems that they have no intention to come back immediately even if the government says it would accept them back according to the 1993 criteria [agreed with the Bangladesh government]. They are gathering to launch a political attack and press demands for their political ambitions. Perhaps they know there will be countries which would back them, and feed the Bengalis who fled. So they have made preparations to fight politically. About the armed attacks, they may launch attacks if their families are not left [in Rakhine State]. We should be on the alert for armed attacks, but we can\u2019t predict the possibility of a large-scale attack. \nKZM: Ko Moe Myint, what is your assessment of what Ko Maung Maung Soe said? U Maung Maung Soe, you deny the allegations of foreign news agencies that Arakanese and other ethnic people have threatened them. We also heard reports that ARSA have been calling on them to leave Rakhine State. Ko Moe Myint, what have you heard during your trip to Maungdaw with foreign diplomats? \nMoe Myint: It is difficult to make an overall assessment of the issue on the ground. The situation is different from segment to segment and place to place. In Rathedaung, Arakanese people outnumber Muslims and there are fewer Muslim villages\u2014but not small, there is a population of around 3,000 villagers. There were cases in which Arakanese people picked a fight or quarrel with Muslim villagers if they encountered them while they went fishing outside their villages. But it was not that whole Arakanese villages went to Muslim villages and threatened them. There might have been quarreling and swearing during encounters. And this news was spread by word of mouth and exaggerated during the process, and later rumors emerged that whole Arakanese villages threatened [self-identifying Rohingya]. \nKZM: It can be said that there has been disharmony and hostility between two societies on the ground for a long time. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said in her speech that there is no harmony, but only deep hostility between two sides. And about the armed attacks, we can\u2019t predict exactly. Former US Ambassador to Myanmar Derek Mitchell\u2014he has an understanding of Myanmar\u2014has recently said that the issue is not merely about the controversy over the terminology of Rohingya or Bengali. Beyond the terminology, he said, they have an agenda to demand ethnicity\u2014to add Rohingya as the 136th ethnic group in Myanmar which currently has 135 ethnic groups. And if they get ethnicity, they would demand territory\u2014a Rohingya State or Muslim State\u2014like Rakhine State, he said. He was telling the international community that it is a very complicated issue. He implied that there might be a separatist agenda. Myanmar citizens and ethnic Arakanese people have serious concern for this. What is your assessment, U Maung Maung Soe? \nMMS: The international community\u2019s perception of the Rakhine issue is influenced by democracy and human rights. But to view this issue only from the points of view of democracy and human rights is not enough. We also need to view this from the historical aspect so as to get correct understanding of it. French historian Jacques Leider has said that Myanmar-Bangladesh border divides two groups of societies, languages and culture. The other side is Indo-Aryan group and this side is Tibeto-Burman group, divided by the border line. Even after the British had colonized India, it treated the area from [Bangladesh\u2019s] Chittagong and Cox\u2019s Bazar to [Myanmar\u2019s] Nat River, which is the border today, as a deserted area. There was no human habitation there then. \nThe culture, language, and faith of this side are different from those of the other side. Talking of the problem of so-called Rohingya people, we need to take a look back into history. Relations started in the 15th Century when Arakanese King Minbagyi invaded 12 regions in Chittagong and Bengal. Arakanese overpowered and invaded them. In the 16th Century, Mughal re-captured those areas. This is the first relation. \nWhen the Arakanese king occupied those areas in the 15th Century, they brought around 4,000 prisoners of war. Today, they are called Myaydu Muslim. Though they are Muslim followers, they speak Myanmar language and dress like Myanmar people now. They are a minority and not problematic. \nThen, Kaman came into Myanmar in the 16th Century. They belonged to Persian tribes. They fled the power struggle for the throne between Mughal kings and took shelter in Rakhine State. Today, they are recognized as Kaman. Kaman means archers. Their population size is not problematic to Rakhine State. Kaman people speak Arakanese language and dress like Arakanese people. But in 1825, the British occupied Rakhine State, and the Suez Canal was opened after 1860. Then, the British needed laborers to transport rice in bulk. \nKZM: So, they needed laborers? \nMMS: So, they brought in cheap laborers from Chittagong of the Indian subcontinent. Initially, they came into Myanmar in cultivation season, then went back and came again in harvest, then went back. \nThe British built a railroad between Buthidaung and Maungdaw. They brought in laborers by train, by ship. As time went by, those people settled there. According to 1930 statistics of the British, 40,000 people came into Rakhine State, and the number was 20,000 in 1934. Their population had increased gradually. The British brought them not only into Rakhine, but also down to Yangon, Hanthawaddy District which is today Bago Region, Kungyangon and so on. As a result, anti-Muslim riot broke out in Yangon in 1938. An investigation into the riot was launched and led by economist James Baxter. The investigation report stated that the number of laborers who were brought into Myanmar from India subcontinent had increased yearly, and clashes between racially and culturally different peoples had increased and needed to stop. But no action could be taken to stop it as World War II broke out in 1942. \nKZM: So, it is fair to say it is one of the legacies of the British. \nMMS: This is a colonial legacy. To summarize the points I\u2019ve made, they are not native people. Arakanese people have the same view, which is factually correct according to history. They are in fact immigrants brought in by the British. They were brought not only into Rakhine State, but also to Yangon and Mandalay. Their population is estimated to be around two to three million. They were given citizenship according to citizenship law. But local Muslim people are not problematic because they take themselves as Myanmar citizens, and live through thick and thin with Myanmar. They claim themselves to be Myanmar Muslims. They don\u2019t demand a separate ethnicity or ethnic rights. They are not problematic. \nBut [Bengalis] have demanded ethnicity. At Alel Than Kyaw Conference in June 1951, Bengalis called themselves Arakan Muslim. There was not the term \u2018Rohingya\u2019 at all then. So, we can conclude that \u2018Rohingya\u2019 is a term that was made up later. There are also calls for establishment of a safety zone now. Taking a look back at history, the Alel Than Kyaw Conference in June 1951 made a lot of demands including equality between Arakanese and Muslim people, designation of a Muslim state, appointment of Muslim ministers in the Rakhine State government, 50-50 sharing of all of interests of Rakhine State between Arakanese and Muslim people, and teaching of Urdu language at government schools, and not teaching other languages without Muslims\u2019 approval. Now, they are making similar demands made at 1951 Alel Than Kyaw Conference. \nWe can give immigrants citizenship depending on the length of time they have lived in the country. We can give them democratic and human rights. But if they ask for ethnicity and ethnic rights, it is difficult to accept. It is highly unlikely. So, this problem is the root-cause of entire problem, and we must handle this carefully. \nKZM: Ko Moe Myint, you went to Maungdaw and other places together with around 60 diplomats on Oct. 2. What did you see on the ground? It was the government-guided trip. Were diplomats satisfied with the trip or did they make complaints? \nMM: We went to Kha Mauk Seik by helicopter. And we saw a few houses\u2014not entire village\u2014on fire at a Muslim village around one mile from Kha Mauk Seik. I asked Hindu and Arakanese people from nearby villages and they said no one was living there, and no security guard was guarding there. And police only occasionally pass through that village during their patrols. Why such a place was on fire while diplomats were visiting the area? So, it is questionable why such a place was on fire, diplomats pointed out. \nTo keep the balance, the government took the diplomats to Muslim villages, Arakanese villages as well as harmonious communities as Daw Aung San Suu Kyi [suggested]\u2014places like Nga Khu Ya villag where Muslim, Hindus and Arakanese people live together. Diplomats met Hindus and Muslims as well. And most of the people on the ground have concerns because of the news that they would be fiercely attacked if they failed to leave by the 9th of this month. According to the accounts of Hindus, ARSA leader Ata Ullah has sent video message to all of his followers. And villagers also received phone threats. Hindu villagers talked about these to diplomats as well as journalists. Diplomats were divided into three groups in the trip, and I was in the group of EU and UN diplomats. Villagers are not educated and most of them only have primary school-level education. The questions asked to such people by EU and UN diplomats were even more detailed than a police investigation. So, villagers were not able to answer some questions. When diplomats arrived back from their respective trips and gathered at a gathering point in Sittwe, they were shaking heads\u2014because of the things they saw on the ground and from helicopter, there were many burnt grounds and they took pictures of them from helicopter. \nKZM: The situation was very bad. \nMM: Yes. They were talking to each other, shaking their heads. The government took diplomats to Rakhine State to witness the situation on the ground, and said that there is nothing covered up on the ground. But with this first trip, the government was only able to show the situation, but could not properly explain the real causes of the problem. \nKZM: Because it happened more than one month ago. \nMM: The EU and the UN have released statements as you might have read, and diplomats have focused on a [UN] fact-finding mission. The government said we could talk freely to villagers during the trip, but villagers, for example Muslim villagers, gave different accounts to the government and us. Their statements were different. UN reps do not have trust in the government\u2019s guided tour. They think it was difficult to grasp reality. \nKZM: The international community has made the same voice about the Rakhine issue, mainly focusing on human rights and helping victims on humanitarian grounds. But there are slightly different views on this between the US, UK and other countries. U Maung Maung Soe, you said the issue is the legacy of the British colonial rule. We\u2019ve seen that the UK government\u2019s stance is different from others. What is your assessment? \nMMS: For the moment, the British government, Parliament and Oxford University are being childish. Very childish. I think they are one-sided and hardly fair. Simply childish. They should take a look back at the Afghanistan problem. Who instigated Taliban to fight with Russia? Who provided them with weapons? It was the United States of America. Everyone knows this. They provided weapons for Afghan people, saying they were being oppressed. But, what happened as a result? This is the very reason Al Qaeda and Taliban terrorist organizations have grown. Then, United States of America had to fight in Afghanistan. So, it was like they have to use an axe because they failed to use a needle in time. When we look at a problem, we should not be one-sided. Only when we have a balanced view, we will be able to solve the problem. What I would like to suggest to the persons from western countries is that you should take lessons from Afghanistan. Only then this problem could be solved correctly. Otherwise, we will have to face a very big problem. \nKZM: Thank you for your assessment.

West Edges Towards Punishing Myanmar Army Leaders over Rakhine Crisis-Sources Self-identifying Rohingya refugees who arrived from Myanmar by boat, walk on a bamboo bridge of Shah Porir Dwip in Teknaf, Bangladesh. / Mohammad Ponir Hossain / Reuters 2.3k By Reuters 9 October 2017 \nYANGON/WASHINGTON, United States \u2014 The European Union and the United States are considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar military leaders over an offensive that has driven more than 500,000 self-identifying Rohingya Muslims out of the country, officials familiar with the discussions say. \nInterviews with more than a dozen diplomats and government officials based in Washington, Yangon and Europe revealed that punitive measures aimed specifically at top generals were among a range of options being discussed in response to the crisis. \nNothing has yet been decided and Washington and Brussels may decide to hold off for now, the sources said. There are also discussions about increasing aid for violence-riven Rakhine state. \nThe active discussion of sanctions\u2014not even on the table a month ago\u2014shows how the dramatic exodus of self-identifying Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar\u2019s northwest is putting pressure on Western policymakers to take action. \nWhile much of the outcry overseas has focused on Nobel laureate and Myanmar\u2019s national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, few Western diplomats see an alternative to her leadership. Suu Kyi does not control the military, which still wields considerable power under Myanmar\u2019s army-written constitution. \nThe EU Foreign Ministers Council will discuss Myanmar on Oct. 16, although officials do not expect any move on sanctions that soon. Danish minister for development cooperation, Ulla Tornaes, told Reuters that Copenhagen had been working to get the crisis on the agenda, \u201cwith the wish to put further pressure on the military.\u201d \nTwo Washington-based U.S. officials with knowledge of the Trump administration\u2019s Myanmar deliberations said targeted sanctions against commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing and several other generals, as well as leaders of ethnic Rakhine Buddhist militias accused of torching self-identifying Rohingya villages, were under consideration. \nSuch sanctions\u2014if decided on\u2014would likely entail U.S. asset freezes, bans on travel to the United States, prohibitions against Americans doing business with them and other unspecified penalties. Washington was moving cautiously as it consulted with governments in Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia, the U.S. officials said. \nA senior Yangon-based European diplomat also said Western countries were coordinating their response to the crisis and were in agreement that it was the military, and specifically the commander-in-chief, who needed to be targeted in any punitive action. \nAny punishment was likely to be symbolic at first to allow room for further talks, Yangon-based diplomats said, giving the example of formally banning the army chief, who over the past year visited Brussels, Berlin and Vienna, from further travel to Europe. \nWestern diplomats admit their leverage is limited: compared with China, whose ties with Myanmar have warmed since Suu Kyi took office 18 months ago, U.S. and European investment and military engagement with the country are small. \nThey are also wary of action that could hurt the wider economy or destabilize already tense ties between Suu Kyi and the army. \nPressure Building \nThe United Nations is pressing for increased humanitarian access to other parts of Rakhine, where hundreds of thousands of self-identifying Rohingya remain. How Myanmar responds to calls for increased aid, the investigation of alleged atrocities or repatriation of refugees would be a key consideration in deciding what action to take, U.S. and EU diplomats in Myanmar said. \n\u201cWe can pile political pressure, look into financing we have in Myanmar. We have humanitarian aid, as well as development aid \u2026 the European Commission won\u2019t invest in the development of Myanmar if the conditions, including security, are not there,\u201d said a Brussels-based EU diplomat who follows Myanmar. \n\u201cThere is also the arms trade embargo and we discuss regularly whether we should reward the reforms in Myanmar and look at gradual easing of that, or the opposite.\u201d \nEU economic sanctions on Myanmar were lifted after the army stepped back from direct rule of the country in 2012, beginning the democratic transition that brought Suu Kyi to power last year, but an arms embargo in force since the 1990s remains. The United States removed most sanctions on Myanmar last autumn. It too has kept an arms embargo in place. \nOne Washington-based U.S. official said that, while there was no firm deadline, Washington hoped to have a plan of action on Myanmar in place by the time President Donald Trump travels to Asia for a series of summits in the first half of November. \nThe administration wanted to send a strong message to Myanmar\u2019s military, but was concerned that too drastic action could allow China to expand its growing diplomatic and economic influence in the country, the official said. \nThere is little support in the administration for the re-imposition of broader economic sanctions, the official added. \nThe White House declined comment on internal deliberations on the self-identifying Rohingya crisis. \nSTRAINED RELATIONS \nIn another sign of pressure building on Myanmar, New York-based diplomats said the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in the U.N. General Assembly was pushing for a human rights resolution on the country. \nLast year the EU announced that for the first time in 15 years it would not introduce a resolution at the General Assembly\u2019s Third Committee, which focuses on human rights, condemning Myanmar\u2019s record\u2014rewarding it for progress. \nThe European bloc could revive the resolution in the current session, taking on board the OIC draft and broadening it out beyond the self-identifying Rohingya crisis, one diplomat in New York said. \nDiplomats said some members of the U.N. Security Council were exploring whether the 15-member body could agree a formal statement, or even a resolution, calling for an end to the violence, full access for aid and the safe return of refugees. \nHowever, Myanmar has said it was negotiating with China and Russia, which have veto powers in the Security Council, to protect it from any possible action. China and Russia have both expressed support for the Myanmar government. \nMyanmar\u2019s relations with the U.N. have grown increasingly testy since the discovery of World Food Programme-branded biscuits at a suspected militant camp in July prompted the government to accuse the U.N. agency of supporting the insurgents, forcing it to shut down its operations in Rakhine. \nMyanmar is stalling on accepting a plan by the U.N. to upgrade the U.N. country head to the more powerful rank of Assistant Secretary-General (ASG) when its current top official, who is due to be rotated, is replaced. \nThaung Tun, Suu Kyi\u2019s National Security Advisor, told Reuters that the U.N. \u201cmust treat us equally\u201d. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine with anybody if all member states have an ASG assigned. Not just us,\u201d he said.

All of a sudden, Yangon, the commercial hub of Myanmar, seemed deserted. \nTo search for new opportunities is one of the reasons for migration. In the case of Myanmar, Yangon is often home to those opportunities. It is the place where people from all over the country come to look for educational and occupational prospects. \nSo, as internal migrants went back to their home towns during Thadingyut holidays, Yangon was eerily quiet. \nThis movement of people is something Than Kyaw Htay has depicted in his ongoing art exhibition in Yangon.

So, I remembered the lives of migrants and organized this exhibition,\u201d said Than Kyaw Htay. \nBorn in 1978 in Rakhine State\u2019s Sittwe, the ethnic Arakanese artist studied at the State School of Fine Art (Yangon) in 1997. He made his name with a series of Mrauk-U and Bagan scenes in 2004. \nHe has organized eight solo shows and participated in dozens of group art exhibitions at home and abroad including Thailand and France. \nIn his \u2018Silent Moves\u2019 series, large crowds of people are moving\u2014some carrying bundles of clothes on their heads and some pulling their children. \n\u201cThe artist elicits the internal pain of the migrants in minimal brushstrokes. Viewers are left uneasy with their unanswered questions. Who are these people? Where are they leaving from and where are they headed for? And, most disturbingly, why are the people leaving?\u201d said artist Aung Min. \n\u201cI wonder if it may be the symbolic future of Rakhine people,\u201d he added. \nThere will be a total of 20 paintings priced between US$2,000 and 2,500 at the exhibition, which will be held until October 15 at River Gallery on Yangon\u2019s 38th Street. Renowned Arakanese painter Than Kyaw Htay marks the 20th anniversary of his arrival in Yangon with a solo exhibition centered on migrants. \n\u201cLife is a migration and it is part of Samsara,\u201d said Than Kyaw Htay, referring to the Buddhist belief in the cycle of birth and rebirth.

More than 500,000 have fled although reports suggest the number is still rising. \nThe government deemed ARSA a terrorist outfit soon after the group\u2019s Aug. 25 offensive. Government spokesperson Zaw Htay tweeted on the announcement of ARSA\u2019s ceasefire that \u201cwe have no policy to negotiate with terrorists\u201d\u2014a sentiment echoed by defense minister Lt-Gen Sein Win in Naypyitaw on Monday. \n\u201cNo government negotiates with terrorist groups. We dismiss them (ARSA),\u201d he told media, adding that Myanmar did not recognize the ceasefire. \nAsked about the current security situation in Rakhine, he said the army and home affairs ministry are collaborating to ensure rule of law and regional stability. \n\u201cBut given the nature of the area, it is very large. So there may be destruction if they [ARSA] want to carry out attacks,\u201d he said. \nARSA on Oct. 6 tweeted a statement saying the ceasefire will end at midnight on Oct. 9. The statement accused the military of blocking humanitarian access to Rakhine and added that ARSA is open to further ceasefires. \nThe self-identifying Rohingya Muslims who have fled northern Rakhine to Bangladesh since Aug. 25 have brought tales of rape, murder, and arson during Myanmar Army security operations the UN\u2019s human rights body has labeled \u201ca textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\u201d \nMyanmar has denied it is pursuing ethnic cleansing in the state and, according to Reuters, Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed on Monday to form a working group to commence plans for the repatriation of refugees.

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein accused India of lacking \u201cbasic human compassion,\u201d in seeking to deport the refugees. India\u2019s UN representative in Geneva termed the comments \u201ctendentious judgment\u201d based on \u201cselective and even inaccurate reports which do not further the understanding of human rights in any society.\u201d \nOut of this mud slinging comes no clear winner, but the more worthwhile question of why India is displaying such rigidness on accommodating the self-identifying Rohingya. Why the sudden alarm, when the community has been living in the country for years? \nMuch debate has taken place over whether the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government under Narendra Modi is averse to providing asylum to Muslims, given that many in the right-wing party and its ideological fountainhead the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) have been called anti-Islamic. \nBut an anti-Muslim agenda would have seen the BJP opening post-1971 Bangladesh war files and attempting to deport many Muslim refugees from among the near 10 million people of various religious groups that came across to India. Deciphering the Indian government\u2019s position calls for a more rational examination of the factors at play. \nSecurity Concern \nJihadi outfits with alleged connections to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) top the list of India\u2019s worries about its population of self-identifying Rohingya. \nThe rise of the erstwhile Harakah al-Yakin\u2014now calling itself ARSA\u2014has seemingly rattled intelligence agencies in India, Bangladesh and other parts of the region. \nUnlike the predominately Muslim countries of Malaysia and Indonesia, or Thailand, which often prefers to be a silent spectator, perhaps to conceal its own human rights record, India is voicing its many concerns. \nIntelligence agency reports in India and Bangladesh reveal systematic efforts are underway to strengthen the Rohingya militant groups with more trained men and money. \nSome would argue that reports of Rohingya militant groups associating with jihadi outfits in Pakistan and receiving funds from Islamic groups in Saudi Arabia are bereft of evidence. Even if that were the case, India could not ignore the blatant display of support for ARSA by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Al Queda, and other Islamic groups. \nMany international organizations and perhaps also a number of news outlets have chosen to ignore these messages of support from terrorist groups and instead speak of ARSA\u2019s rudimentary arms. India cannot afford to be as foolhardy and allow a Syria-like situation in the region. \nSeveral longtime experts on Myanmar have cast doubt on the \u201crag-tag\u201d nature of ARSA, deeming it a group guided by a calculated strategy executed to near perfection. Independent political analyst Richard Horsey who works with the International Crisis Group tweeted on Sept. 30 that \u201cARSA is murderous and willing to sacrifice entire Rohingya population for a dubious political objective.\u201d \nHorsey added that ARSA\u2019s clothing and weapons may be \u201crag-tag\u201d but \u201cdefinitely not in relation to their objectives and impact: sophisticated & brutal.\u201d \nTerrorism Network \nIndian intelligence agencies have been working around the clock to piece together an ARSA terrorist network and authenticate claims the group has deep support from transnational jihadi outfits by various experts. Links between ARSA and other terrorist groups in Pakistan, and possibly in Afghanistan and Iraq have been reported. However, the modus operandi of ARSA vis-\u00e0-vis its terror network is not yet clear. \nOne name doing the rounds in intelligence agency reports as well as Indian media is that of Abdus Qadoos Burmi, a Pakistani of Rohingya origin based in Karachi who allegedly has links with LeT and received patronage from Hafiz Saeed, the Pakistani Islamist behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks. \nBurmi has been identified as the head of Islamic fundamentalist organization Harkat ul Jihad al-Islami-Arakan (HUJI-K) and has been instrumental in creating international support for ARSA and other groups like Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), a front of the LeT in Bangladesh. \nSources in India and Bangladesh intelligence speaking on condition of anonymity shared some precise information which claim that JuD has spearheaded training for ARSA, instructing fighters on how to produce improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and strategizing with the group\u2019s leaders. JuD enjoys backing from the Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan and is known to have deep resources in Bangladesh, its primary entry point to Myanmar. \nIndian intelligence agencies believe that the JuD has a presence in refugee camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar along the Naf River although it is unclear whether JuD is involved in recruiting or training men from these camps. In India, the home affairs ministry has cautioned that \u201cillegal Rohingya immigrants\u201d from Rakhine are \u201cvulnerable\u201d to recruitment by terrorist groups. \nLiaising for the training of ARSA began as early as 2008, with Burmi leading the activities under the banner of Aqa Mul Mujahideen (AMM). Intelligence agency reports have also linked Burmi to terrorist activities in Kashmir. Indian security agencies suspect others from Rakhine of being involved in nefarious undertakings in Kashmir. \nFor instance, intelligence agencies identified \u201cChota Burmi,\u201d a member of Pakistani terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), who was killed in a clash in 2015, as a \u201cRohingya from Rakhine.\u201d \nAs for ARSA leader Ata Ullah, there are ample reports that have appeared in almost all forms of news media, both within and outside Myanmar, which suggest that he was born in Pakistan and raised in Saudi Arabia, and formed the outfit after the 2012 riots between self-identifying Rohingya and Arakanese. Indian intelligence officials are of the view that ARSA has been \u201cworking in close coordination with AMM,\u201d which is now led by Havistoohar, who reportedly underwent six months training by the Taliban in Pakistan. \nMembers of the Border Security Force (BSF) in India told this writer that they are sharing regular information with both Myanmar and Bangladesh security forces about suspected ARSA involvement in smuggling weapons to Rakhine with the help of \u201cdifferent groups.\u201d BSF officials did not elaborate on who these groups could be. \nRecently, Australian National University Associate Professor Greg Fealy was quoted by ABC radio as saying \u201cweapons can come through broader Islamists network,\u201d and that \u201cmilitants in Bangladesh could provide the weapons to the Rohingyas.\u201d It remains to be seen if ARSA is actually involved in smuggling weapons or a wider network used to transfer arms and ammunitions to Teknaf in Cox Bazar and into parts of northern Rakhine. \nAl-Qaeda and ARSA \nIn its recent broadcast, \u201cEvidence of a link between Rohingya militants and jihadist groups,\u201d ABC Radio claimed Al-Qaeda is attempting to forge links with ARSA. Indeed, Al-Qaeda called on Muslims around the world to send weapons to the self-identifying Rohingya in Myanmar. \nAl-Qaeda offshoot Ansar Ghazwat Ul Hind in Kashmir has been actively campaigning for the self-identifying Rohingya in India. Its leader Zakir Musa has warned Prime Minister Modi to stop any plans to deport the refugees from India. \nThe Kashmir Factor \nThe unprecedented support that the self-identifying Rohingya has received from separatist groups in Kashmir has certainly not gone down well with New Delhi. \nRecently, Kashmir separatist leaders marched against the persecution of the Muslims in northern Rakhine. The separatists, however, did not condemn reports of killings of other minority groups like the Hindus and Mros at the hands of ARSA. \nMany would say the Indian government\u2019s plan to deport the refugees is reasonable given its internal security situation. In response to the UN human rights chief\u2019s claim that India and Pakistan had not engaged with his office on human rights concerns in Kashmir, India representative to the UN Rajiv Chander said, \u201cIt is a matter of regret that the central role of terrorism is once again being overlooked. Assessments of human rights should not be a matter of political convenience.\u201d \nInternationally designated terrorist Hafiz Saeed is suspected to have made attempts to recruit young Rohingya refugees in relief camps in Indonesia, on the pretext of providing them relief, into the LeT and send them to Kashmir. \nWhile the threat of the militant Islamic movement cannot be used to legitimize military brutality, we also cannot lose sight of the fact that the militant Islamic movement has been troubling the region. This is exactly what New Delhi has been telling the world. The intellectual community in India has aired similar feelings. \nBrahma Chellaney, a professor of Strategic Studies at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi, in a recent article titled \u201cMyanmar\u2019s Jihadi Curse,\u201d which appeared in the online portal Project Syndicate argued that the \u201cexternal forces fomenting insurgent attacks in Rakhine bear considerable responsibility for the Rohingyas\u2019 current plight.\u201d \nChellaney, the author of nine books including \u201c Asian Juggernaut ,\u201d notes \u201cthe links between Rohingya militants and such external forces, especially terrorist organizations like ISIS, that have driven the government of India, where some 40,000 Rohingya have settled illegally, to declare that their entry poses a serious security threat.\u201d \n\u201cEven Bangladesh acknowledges Rohingya militants\u2019 external jihadi connections,\u201d he adds, in a possible attempt to vindicate the Indian government\u2019s stance on the issue. \nTherefore, given the complexity of the issue, faulting Aung San Suu Kyi for drawing similarities between security issues in Myanmar and India would not be right. She argued that it has become difficult to sift militants from innocent civilians, as is the case in Kashmir. Perhaps leaders like Aung San Suu Kyi, Bangladesh\u2019s Sheik Hasina and India\u2019s Modi realize how vulnerable their socio-political landscape is in the face of growing religious fundamentalism. \nRising Radicalization \nThe main Islamic political party in Bangladesh, Jamaat-e-Islami, is officially banned, but it enjoys significant support in a country which has been angered by the treatment of Muslims in Rakhine. A change of guard in Bangladesh could well see the rise of Jamaat-e-Islami once again, meaning a possible increase in the radicalization of the region. \nNew Delhi\u2019s recent display of seriousness in dealing with the exodus of self-identifying Rohingya is palpable. In the last week several key initiatives were adopted to ensure there is no attempt to push more of the refugees into northeastern India. None of the eight states in the area can afford more anti-foreigner movements, such as one of the 1980s that left the region reeling from communal violence and subsequent insurgencies. \nIndia\u2019s defense secretary Ashok Kumar Gupta visited the Indian-Myanmar border township Moreh on Oct. 3 in what was described by local media as a move to \u201cassess the law and order situation in the area in the wake of the Rohingya refugee crisis.\u201d \nManipur shares a 398-kilometer border with Myanmar. Even though these areas are hilly and far from northern Rakhine, it appears that both the central and the state government of Manipur do not want to take any chances. \nThe visit by the Indian government official follows the decision to open two immigration checkpoints in Mizoram state along its borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh (Zorinpui checkpost in Lawngtlai district) and Bangladesh (Kawrpuichhuah checkpost in Lunglei district). In addition, the Indian government has beefed up its security along the India-Bangladesh land and riverine borders along West Bengal and Assam. \nIndeed, the exodus of Rohingya to Bangladesh and other parts of the region has turned into a sprawling humanitarian crisis. But it also has the potential of destabilizing the region, especially with the growing support for ARSA. \nBidhayak Das is a former journalist who has spent over a decade working on promoting democracy in Myanmar.

Rakhine People displaced by violence walk with their belongings, while moving to another village, in Maungdaw, Rakhine state, Myanmar September 12, 2017. / Stringer / Reuters 1.6k By Reuters 10 October 2017 \nMYEBON, Rakhine State \u2014 Buddhist villagers in relatively peaceful parts of Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine State are enforcing a system of local apartheid that punishes people trading with minority Muslims, fueling fears that violence in the far northwest could spread to new areas. \nEthnic Arakanese, who form the majority in central parts of the state, have set up committees in several districts that have meted out sanctions ranging from fines to public beatings and expulsions. They say the measures are necessary to protect their communities from self-identifying Rohingya Muslim militants. \nMuslim residents say they are being cut off from essential supplies and accuse authorities of turning a blind eye. Aid workers fear thousands will attempt to escape via perilous sea routes to Thailand and Malaysia when the monsoon rains abate. \nAbout 250,000 Muslims live in central Rakhine, an area not directly affected by a military offensive against militants who attacked security forces in the northern part of the state in late August. The army operation has forced more than half a million people to flee to Bangladesh, in what the United Nations has denounced as ethnic cleansing. \n\u201cIn the current situation, it\u2019s not possible for different communities to live together,\u201d said Ashin Saromani, a Buddhist monk in the central Rakhine town of Myebon, where one such committee was set up at a meeting in a monastery four days after the Aug. 25 militant attacks in the north. \n\u201cThe government can\u2019t reconcile them. That\u2019s why we prohibited communication with the Muslims, to prevent conflict.\u201d \nRakhine State government spokesman Min Aung said he was not aware of efforts to punish Buddhists who had contact with Muslims. He said he thought tensions could best be eased by interfaith community groups. \n\u201cOther states and regions have interfaith groups working for peace. In Rakhine there\u2019s no group like that,\u201d he said. \nTension between ethnic Arakanese and Muslims have simmered for years. Nearly 200 people were killed and 140,000 displaced in communal violence in the state in 2012. \nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that the violence seen in the north of the state could easily spread. \n\u201cThe failure to address this systematic violence could result in a spillover into central Rakhine, where an additional 250,000 Muslims could potentially face displacement,\u201d said Guterres in a recent speech. \u201cThey are outnumbered by Rakhine communities, some of whom have engaged in violent acts of vigilantism against their Muslim neighbors.\u201d \n\u2018National Traitor\u2019 \nIn Myebon, about 3,000 Muslims have been confined to a camp for displaced people since the 2012 violence, surrounded by tens of thousands of hostile Arakanese Buddhists. They have relied on aid from international agencies and fishing, supplemented by a small amount of trade in the town. \nSince late August, loudspeakers mounted on tricycle rickshaws have rolled around the town, blaring messages from local monks and Arakanese community leaders exhorting Buddhists to avoid contact with Muslims. \nOne Arakanese woman who ignored the warnings, 35-year-old Soe Chay, told Reuters she was surrounded by a mob on Sept. 12 after buying goods at a market to sell to Muslims. \nThey beat her, cut her hair and marched through the town with a sign reading \u201cnational traitor\u201d hung around her neck. \nKyaw Swar Tun, deputy director of the Rakhine General Administration Department (GAD) that oversees the local bureaucracy, said the case was an \u201cindividual problem\u201d that was already being dealt with by the courts. \nTwo women and a man have been charged with assault on Soe Chay. The two women were members of the Arakan Women\u2019s Network in Myebon, which denied taking part in the attack. \n\u201cPeople got angry because they don\u2019t have a nationalist spirit, even though they know that 30 police stations were attacked and locals from Maungdaw were beheaded,\u201d said Khin Thein, leader of the network in the town, describing the incident. He was referring to the Aug. 25 attacks, which concentrated in northern Rakhine\u2019s Maungdaw Township. \nBuddhist community leaders in Myebon have also blocked international aid agencies from reaching the camp, saying only the government can deliver aid, which must be checked by Buddhists. \n\u201cWe are concerned that if we don\u2019t check that boat of the NGOs communicating directly with the Bengalis, they might include weapons together with the aid,\u201d said Ashin Saromani. Bengali is a derogatory term for the self-identifying Rohingya implying they are interlopers from Bangladesh. \nSimilar community-enforced restrictions on aid have been in place elsewhere in Rakhine, according to aid workers. \n\u2018Fear of Revenge\u2019 \nAnti-Muslim sentiment has been bubbling up elsewhere in mostly Buddhist Myanmar since the conflict erupted in Rakhine. \nPolice had to disperse a mob that attacked Muslim homes and businesses in the central Magwe division on Sept. 10. \nIn Kayin State in the east, Muslims were told last month they must get special permission from authorities before travelling outside of their villages, because of security concerns. \nCloser to the conflict zone, Muslim villagers in Rathedaung Township say they have been directly pressured to leave by their Arakanese neighbor\u2019s. \nIn Ku Taung village, near the besieged Muslim villages, a group of 46 Arakanese Buddhist elders has formed a \u201cdisciplinary committee.\u201d \nThey have fined Buddhists as much as 500,000 kyat (US$370) for infractions including selling betel leaves to Muslims, according to farmer Tun Thar Sein. \nSome Rakhine villages have set up security teams to protect against the spread of militancy. In Mrauk-U and Minbya, an area that saw several unexplained explosions last month, residents said Muslims were no longer allowed into Arakanese villages. \nKyaw Swar Tun, the local administrator, said authorities would deal with any cases brought to them according to the law, but was not aware of any such problems in central Rakhine. \nBack in the Myebon camp for displaced people, Muslims say they will have to move away. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible for us to go back and stay together in Myebon because the Rakhine who destroyed our homes will be afraid to face us,\u201d said Cho Cho, a Muslim resident. \u201cThey fear that Muslims will take revenge.\u201d Topics: Conflict, Rakhine State", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

Police at the scene of mob blocking aid shipment in Sittwe on Sept. 20. / Min Aung Khine / Facebook 1.4k By Min Aung Khine 10 October 2017 \nSITTWE, Rakhine State \u2014 Ten men accused of involvement in a violent mob which blocked a Red Cross aid shipment bound for conflict-torn Maungdaw in Rakhine State capital Sittwe last month will be brought to trial on Friday, according to the Township Police Force. \nA 300-strong mob gathered late on Sept. 20 at Set Yoe Kya jetty where a boat carrying relief supplies for self-identifying Rohingya Muslims was preparing to travel upriver to Maungdaw, reported Reuters. \nThe mob\u2014armed with slingshots and petrol bombs\u2014forced the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to unload the aid from the boat and prevented the vessel from leaving, according to Myanmar government\u2019s Information Committee. \nPolice detained nine people at the scene and three more perpetrators were identified in further investigations. One of them was arrested and two others are still at large, said police lieutenant Kyaw Moe of Sittwe No. 2 Police Station. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve arrested 10 and declared two others as fugitives,\u201d he told The Irrawaddy. \nThe 10 detainees are from Set Yoe Kya and Mindra Shik villages on the opposite bank of the river from Sittwe town, and the two fugitives are from Sat Yone Su ward in Sittwe. All of them are casual manual laborers and bricklayers, according to police. \n\u201cAccording to our investigation, they had no motive. It happened mainly because they were drunk. There was no organizer. It was the result of a gathering of drunkards,\u201d said the police lieutenant. \nDetainees have been charged with Articles 145 and 438 of Myanmar\u2019s Penal Code, said police. \nAccording to Article 145, anyone who joins or continues in an unlawful assembly, knowing that such unlawful assembly has been commanded in the manner prescribed by law to disperse, shall be punished with up to two years\u2019 imprisonment, or a fine, or both. \nArticle 438 is about committing or attempting to destroy a vessel by fire or any explosive substance and is punishable by transportation for life, or up to ten years\u2019 imprisonment and fine. \nAccording to Information Committee, an ICRC member was supervising loading of relief supplies onto a vessel in Set Yoe Kya Creek which he hired from a local man around 2 p.m. on Sept. 20 when some locals arrived and complained that those supplies would be sent to terrorists. \nLater, crowds gathered and disorder broke out, which was quelled by police using tear gas. \nAnti-NGO sentiment has developed in Rakhine State since conflict in 2012, with ethnic Arakanese protesting what they feel is unfair favorable treatment of the self-identifying Rohingya.

And we\u2019ve welcomed his suggestion,\u201d Dr. Min Kyi Win told The Irrawaddy. \nThailand is the biggest investor in Mon State, with Thai petroleum firm PTTEP investing US$2.146 billion in an offshore gas field in the Gulf of Martaban\u2014the largest investment among 18 international investors in Myanmar\u2019s energy sector as well as the largest foreign investment in the state. \nThailand\u2019s $414 million Mawlamyine Cement Limited (MCL) cement plant is also the largest investment in Mon State\u2019s industrial sector. \nThe Chinese ambassador\u2019s visit to the area is the first on its kind under the National League for Democracy (NLD) government. \nThe ambassador said China is interested in importing fruits from Mon State, especially pomelo, pomelo juice and dried pomelo, said Daw San Wint Khaing, the Pa-O ethnic affairs minister for Mon State. \n\u201cWhat we want is a market economy rather than their investment. We have to try to build a seller\u2019s market rather than a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d she said. \nThe 15-member Chinese diplomat delegation led by Hong Liang met Mon State chief minister Dr. Aye Zan and other ministers. The Chinese ambassador also invited the chief minister to visit China, according to ministers. \nIn early 2017, Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) issued an announcement for the establishment of investment commissions at region and state levels. \nAccording to the instruction, region and state governments are authorized to decide on investment proposals of less than $5 million for their areas but have to seek MIC approval for investments of more than $5 million. \nInvestment commissions at region and state levels have seven members, headed by chief ministers. Staff officers of relevant investment and company administration boards act as secretary, and five ministers as members. \nMon State received more than $5.433 billion in foreign investment from 1994 to the end of 2016, according to records of the Mon State Directorate of Investment and Company. \nTranslated from Burmese by Thet Ko Ko.

Because of that, we need solutions through the interim management,\u201d the general secretary said. \nThe NCA\u2019s interim program included information on how to collaborate with the government on administrative affairs and environmental protection, he said. \nPadoh Saw Tadoh Moo said the interim management of these areas was one of the two key issues discussed during an urgent four-day meeting of the KNU\u2019s Central Standing Committee held in Lay Wah last week. \nThe meeting was the first urgent gathering of standing committee members since the KNU\u2019s 16th Congress in March. Another key issue discussed was reviewing the peace process and how to proceed. \nKNU leaders also discussed developmental projects and national parks and forest reserves in their territories. \nA statement released on Oct. 7 said Karen leaders decided to delay allowing investment in development projects which may impact local communities and the environment as there are currently no specific laws and regulations in place to protect from effects of such project. \nOne of the challenges the group is now facing is the case of environmental preservation, said Mahn Ba Tun, head of the KNU\u2019s forestry department. \nHe explained that neither the KNU nor local residents were informed of central government efforts to extend the forest reserves and the national parks along the border with Thailand and Tanintharyi Region in 2015. \nThe central government in Naypyitaw has also allowed international non-governmental organizations such as the World Wide Fund for Nature Myanmar (WWF) and Fauna and Flora International (FFI) to study the areas without the consent of KNU, said KNU leaders. \nIn November last year the KNU signed a memorandum of understanding with the World Wide Fund for Nature Myanmar (WWF) to protect the forest in KNU-controlled territories. \n\u201cGovernment efforts to set national parks and forest reserves in KNU Brigade No.4 area [in the Myeik-Dawei area of Tanintharyi Region] has caused obstacles for the current peace building process,\u201d the KNU statement released last week said, \u201cwe will protect our forests based on our policies.\u201d \n\u201cWe have been protecting our forests and our wild animals and we will uphold our forest policy and regulations on further forests preservation and protection,\u201d Padoh Saw Tadoh Moo told The Irrawaddy, adding that they had begun awareness programs with locals to protect wildlife and timber forest reserves.

If positive news could eliminate tourists\u2019 fears of terrorist attacks, the situation would be better.\u201d \nU Tint Lwin, director general of the hotels and tourism ministry, said news of the unrest has scared tourists and affected the whole tourism industry. \n\u201cThere are worries that [tourists] may experience a terrorist attack or have difficultly traveling in the country,\u201d said U Tint Lwin. \nAccording to tour operators based in Rakhine, visitors to the region\u2019s famous sites have declined significantly. \n\u201cThe number of tourists have declined by half compared to last year,\u201d said Ma Moh, a tour operator based in the ancient Arakanese capital Mrauk-U. \n\u201cDuring this month last year most of the hotels were fully booked,\u201d she said. \u201cBookings for transport were also full, but this year is quite dry.\u201d \nTour operators across the country have reported a slump in business. Package tours to Bagan, one of Myanmar\u2019s main attractions, have been dropped. \n\u201cCompared to last year, the situation is bad for the season. Bookings have been canceled, especially from Europe and the USA. And there have been few independent tourists from those countries compared to last year,\u201d said Daw Maw Maw, a tour operator in Bagan. \nHoteliers and tour operators are hoping for some kind of stability and peace in Rakhine and the surrounding regions, which they say has not only affected tourism but also the security of the whole country. \n\u201cAlthough the effects on the tourism industry are not hugely impactful, we still worry about our own security because the government announced there might be terrorist attacks in big cities,\u201d said U Myint Lwin, a hotelier from Mandalay. \n\u201cHowever, we hope there will be peace and stability in Rakhine State soon. We are also hoping there will be more visitors to our country before the peak tourist season ends,\u201d he added. \nAccording to figures from the Ministry of Hotels and Tourism, 2.9 million tourists visited the country in 2016. More than 3.5 million tourists were expected for 2017, according to the figures, with about 2.27 million tourists visiting the country from January to August this year.

And the government accepted our proposal.\u201d \nEight ethnic armed groups and the U Thein Sein government signed the NCA on Oct. 15, 2015. The government has planned a national-level event in the administrative capital to mark the anniversary. \nAccording to NCA-signatory sources, delegates of NCA non-signatories are likely to hold separate peace talks with State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and Myanmar Army Commander-in-Chief Snr-Gen Min Aung Hlaing, if they attend the NCA anniversary event. \nEight NCA signatories will each send an 11-member delegation to the event and KNU chairman Gen Mutu Sae Poe is set to address the ceremony and reaffirm the KNU\u2019s dedication to the government\u2019s NCA path to internal peace. \nThe eight ethnic armed groups that signed the NCA are: the KNU, the CNF, the APL, the All Burma Students\u2019 Democratic Front (ABSDF), the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS), Karen National Union/Karen National Liberation Army (Peace Council) (KNU/KNLA PC), the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA), and the Pa-O National Liberation Organization (PNLO). \nThe FPNCC comprises of UWSA, Kachin Independence Army (KIA), National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA), Shan State Progressive Party (SSPP), Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), and Arakan Army (AA). \nThe Myanmar Army has repeatedly said it would not hold peace talks with the MNDAA, TNLA and AA because they came to existence only after emergence of a democratic government, in contrast to other long-established ethnic armed groups. \nThe UNFC is comprised of the New Mon State Party (NMSP), Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP), Lahu Democratic Union (LDU) and Arakan National Council (ANC).

The junta has announced election dates at least two times in the past, only to push them back later, citing concerns such as changes to the constitution and security issues. \n\u201cAround June we will announce the date for the next election,\u201d Prayuth told reporters at Bangkok\u2019s Government House. \n\u201cIn November we will have an election.\u201d \nFormer army chief Prayuth, who led the May 2014 coup widely criticized by Western nations, said it was necessary to end a decade of political turbulence and root out corruption. \nIn April, King Maha Vajiralongkorn signed into law a military-backed constitution that kickstarts the process for an election the junta has promised will restore democracy. \nThe new charter provides for a proportional voting system likely to reduce the influence of major political parties, which critics say aims to strengthen the role of the military. \nAnalysts expect political activities to resume slowly after the funeral of King Bhumibol Adulyadej this month ends a year of mourning for a monarch many Thais saw as a father figure. \n\u201cPrayuth wants to delay the election but he knows that after the king\u2019s cremation, there will be pressure for an election,\u201d said Kan Yuenyong of the Siam Intelligence Unit think tank. \n\u201cThis announcement for the election in November next year will act to reduce that pressure, because if not, there could be chances for protests,\u201d he told Reuters. \nThailand\u2019s main stock index rose 0.7 percent after the news, having opened Tuesday down 0.3 percent. \nGood For Country \nThe government has faced increasing pressure to lift a ban on political activities levied soon after the coup. \nPrayuth will consider lifting the ban \u201cat an appropriate time\u201d, he told reporters, without giving details. \nThe junta had initially promised an election in 2015, after seizing power from the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, sister of Thaksin Shinawatra. \nThaksin\u2019s governments, or those backed by him, have won every election since 2001, partly because of their overwhelming popularity with politically-powerful rural voters. \nBut the Shinawatras made enemies, including those among the military-backed establishment who accused Thaksin and his allies of corruption. \nThaksin was ousted in 2006 and lives abroad in self-imposed exile. Yingluck followed suit in August, when she fledThailand ahead of the verdict in a criminal case. \nSome politicians expressed skepticism over the election date. \n\u201cIt isn\u2019t really believable, because they have changed it many times,\u201d said Chaturon Chaisang, a member of Thaksin\u2019s Puea Thai Party. \nOng-art Klampaiboon, deputy leader of the Democrat Party, Puea Thai\u2019s biggest competitor, welcomed the news. \n\u201cThe election date creates clarity,\u201d Ong-art said. \u201cThis should be good for the country and the people.\u201d Topics: Election, Thailand", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yingluck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thaksin shinawatra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prayuth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thaksin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chaturon chaisang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prayuth chan-ocha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maha vajiralongkorn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhumibol adulyadej", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kan yuenyong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yingluck shinawatra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aung hlaing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ong-art klampaiboon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "government house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democrat party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siam intelligence unit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puea thai party", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "myanmar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangkok", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shinawatras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangkok", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T10:14:18.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "840501de443fa6b3722b60e455dff11feb1e0529", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQnD1hkKhwylEE9xU3S1F_NID_KaBTgMVc6saXdI5hnuHHs.cLsIMxTBT7heMI7djfKz0wM5TGmCKYbYBvLSlRNFEV8FqDZOV8wW40WFa8o4IRfvRbajYeB", "site_full": "www.irrawaddy.com", "site": "irrawaddy.com", "site_section": "http://www.irrawaddy.org/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Irrawaddy", "title": "Pope to Meet Top Buddhist Monks in Myanmar, Address Military", "title_full": "Pope to Meet Top Buddhist Monks in Myanmar, Address Military", "published": "2017-10-11T08:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.irrawaddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Feature-4.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 55744, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "840501de443fa6b3722b60e455dff11feb1e0529", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQnD1hkKhwylEE9xU3S1F_NID_KaBTgMVc6saXdI5hnuHHs.cLsIMxTBT7heMI7djfKz0wM5TGmCKYbYBvLSlRNFEV8FqDZOV8wW40WFa8o4IRfvRbajYeB", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Thant Nay Lin", "published": "2017-10-11T08:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Pope to Meet Top Buddhist Monks in Myanmar, Address Military", "text": "News Pope to Meet Top Buddhist Monks in Myanmar, Address Military Pope Francis poses with Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi at the end of a private audience at the Vatican May 4, 2017. / Reuters 1.4k By Reuters 11 October 2017 \nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis will meet Myanmar\u2019s top Buddhist monks, its military generals and civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi in November when he visits that country and Bangladesh, both caught up in a crisis over the self-identifying Rohingya Muslim minority. \nAccording to a full programme of the Nov. 26-Dec. 2 trip released by the Vatican on Tuesday, the pope will say two Masses in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and one in Bangladesh, which is predominantly Muslim. \nFrancis will be the first pope to visit Myanmar and the second to visit Bangladesh, where Pope John Paul visited in 1986. \nThe pope arrives in Yangon, the country\u2019s largest city, on Nov. 27 after a flight of more than 10 hours and is scheduled to rest for about 24 hours before heading to the country\u2019s capital Naypyitaw for a day. \nThere, he will have separate private talks with President Htin Kyaw and Suu Kyi, who is both State Counsellor and Foreign Minister, making her effectively the country\u2019s civilian leader. \nA senior Vatican official said military leaders are expected to attend a separate, public meeting where the pope will address politicians and diplomats. This is where he is expected to give the keynote speech of the trip. \nMyanmar is facing international scrutiny over the plight of its Rohingya community. In February, Francis said they had been tortured and killed simply because they wanted to live their culture and Muslim faith. \nLast August, some hard-line Buddhists were riled with the pope spoke about \u201cthe persecution of our Rohingya brothers and sisters\u201d and asked Catholics to pray for them, adding that they should be given \u201ctheir full rights\u201d. \nOn Nov. 29, the pope will address the Sangha Maha Nayaka, the country\u2019s highest Buddhist authority, which is a government-backed panel of senior monks responsible for regulating the Buddhist clergy. \nThe United Nations refugee agency said on Tuesday that Bangladesh border guards reported more than 11,000 Rohingya refugees crossing into their country from Myanmar on Monday alone.. \nThe government offensive has drawn international condemnation and U.N. accusations of ethnic cleansing, which the government denies. \nThere are about 700,000 Roman Catholics in Myanmar according to the country\u2019s cardinal, Charles Maung Bo, out of a population of about 51.4 million. \nCatholics make up a tiny minority in Bangladesh.

We need to have inner peace in each of us first and avoid the actions which could affect the peace, while praying for the peace,\u201d he said. Religious leaders called for peace in Myanmar at the event. (Photo: Thet Tun Naing) \nMuslim leader Alahaj Mofti Mohamad said the harmony in which Muslims have lived for centuries in Myanmar is being threatened by hate. \n\u201cWe, the Muslims, strongly hope for the immediate end of the current conflicts and the haters. We strongly desire to live in harmony as our ancestors lived in past centuries. We want back the situation where we shared the happiness together with humanity, without haters and doubts of each other, without discrimination,\u201d he told the crowd. \n\u201cWe would like to urge every citizen to work for the peace, unity and living in harmony,\u201d he added. \nThe patron of Quan Yin Buddhist monastery and a Hindu leader also called for followers of all religions to cooperate for the peace and stability of the country. \nWhile urging people to practice the way of peace, Cardinal Charles Bo, the current Archbishop of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Yangon, also urged the international community to understand the situation of the country. \n\u201cWe went to tell the world that Myanmar is living under the teaching of Lord Buddha. We have sympathy to every human being. The world has to understand [Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s] government and has to help her. It is impossible to solve every problem in just 18 months,\u201d said Cardinal Charles Bo. \nThe Cardinal said the country under the leadership of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has its own strategy to solve the problems. He criticized the international community for stripping awards from the State Counselor. \n\u201cShe is not working for her country to win the awards. The Nobel peace prize came to her, she did not chase it. The awards can be stripped from her. For me, I would like to give back the awards with the compensation,\u201d said the cardinal. The National League for Democracy (NLD) organized the gathering. (Photo: Thet Tun Naing) \n\u201cDaw Aung San Suu Kyi is the one who led this country to the democratic path and struggled for many years. We want to let the world know that we have our own strategy to solve our own problems. We believe in the leadership of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who is our hope,\u201d he added. \nYangon chief minister U Phyo Min Thein, who lit the peace candle to open the ceremony, said the event showed the world the country is living in harmony and praying. \n\u201cThis event shows Myanmar is a country with the people of different faith, living in harmony and sharing the sympathy for those who are in difficultly,\u201d said the chief minister. \n\u201cWe hope the world will understand the situation of our country,\u201d he added. \nInterfaith ceremonies were also held in other cities such as Mandalay, Monywa, Mawlamyine and Loikaw at the same time as the Yangon event.

Patrick Murphy. / Wakar Uddin / Facebook 3.4k By Moe Myint 11 October 2017 \nYANGON \u2014 US Department of State officials, representatives of Rohingya organizations, and US-based international groups have discussed the need for an indiscriminate UN-administered safe zone in northern Rakhine State as well as the cessation of violence and solutions to the region\u2019s humanitarian crisis. \nOne of the meeting\u2019s attendees, Wakar Uddin, posted two pictures and a summary of the meeting on Facebook. Wakar Uddin is chairman and director general of the Arakan Rohingya Union (ARU), an umbrella organization representing dozens of self-identifying Rohingya groups. \nInternational Campaign for the Rohingya (ICR), also one of the participants, posted on Facebook its representatives had met with US officials, including Deputy Assistant Secretary for Southeast Asia W. Patrick Murphy, and discussed \u201csanctioning Burmese army leaders and business interests.\u201d \nICR stated that Murphy, who visited northern Rakhine in late September, was working with other agencies to address the Rakhine crisis and that he said in terms of sanctions \u201ceverything is under consideration.\u201d \nAccording to Wakar Uddin\u2019s post, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Scott Busby, also attended the one and a half hour meeting at the state department in Washington, along with Simon Billenness of International Campaign for the Rohingya, John Knaus of National Endowment for Democracy, Khedidja Ouheb of Zakat Foundation, Kathryn Striffolino of Save the Children, and Ronnate Asirwatham of American Jewish World Service. \nBased on Wakar Uddin\u2019s list of attendees, there was no representation from organizations in other parts of Myanmar society. \nThe meeting covered a range of issues, including the repatriation process of more than 500,000 Muslims and a smaller number of Hindus who fled an army crackdown in northern Rakhine State after militant group Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) attacked 30 police outposts on Aug. 25. \nWays in which the US government is encouraging its Myanmar counterpart to stop the violence from security forces and locals in Rakhine against Muslims were shared during the meeting, wrote Wakar Uddin. The implementation of former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan\u2019s recommendations in Rakhine and public security issues were also discussed. \nWakar Uddin previously met with Murphy and other US officials following militant attacks on police outposts in the region on Oct. 25. \nBorn in Rakhine\u2019s troubled Maungdaw Township, Wakar Uddin graduated from Ye Zin Agricultural University (YAU) based in what became Myanmar\u2019s capital Naypyitaw and left Myanmar for the United States in 1970, where he earned a PhD and currently works as a professor at Pennsylvania State University. \nWakar Uddin is also chairman and founder of the Burmese Rohingya Association of North America (BRANA). His other organization, the ARU, was established after a conference for the self-identifying Rohingya at the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) headquarters in Saudi Arabia in May, 2011 in order to achieve rights for the community in Rakhine. Communal riots between Arakanese Buddhists and self-identifying Rohingya Muslims rocked the state the following year. \nARU\u2019s mission statement notes it was \u201cformed on the agreed principles of an indivisible Arakan State within the territorial integrity of the Union of Myanmar, through seeking peaceful co-existence, democracy and human rights, and federalism.\u201d \nARU seeks a political solution to the issues faced by the \u201cRohingya ethnic minority,\u201d according to its statement, using a term for the community strongly opposed by most in Myanmar. It does this, the statement reads, in order to reclaim citizenships and restore political, social, economic, cultural, educational and human rights. \nWakar Uddin has been close to international organizations over the past years, as well as high-profile western bureaucrats and diplomats. He has posted photos online posing with former Secretary of State John Kerry, former US ambassador Derek Mitchell, W. Patrick Murphy, the Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) leaders, UN human rights special rapporteur Yanghee Lee, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and the State Department of Norway. He has posted descriptions of his activities on Twitter and Facebook, and also attended the UN General Assembly held earlier this year. \nWhenever Wakar Uddin speaks to the media, he never hesitates to use controversial words such as \u201cgenocide\u201d and \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d to describe the actions of the Myanmar Army in Rakhine. He uses the terms \u201cethnic minority Rohingya\u201d and even sometimes \u201cindigenous people\u201d in an attempt to shape the Rohingya as an ethnic minority of Myanmar on the international stage. \nHe urged the UN, OIC and other super-power countries to intervene when it came to the self-identifying Rohingya crisis. \nDuring an interview with Al Jazeera on Sep 10 , two weeks after militant attacks in northern Rakhine, Wakar Uddin said the Muslim world should come forward, with strength, to speak out about the self-identifying Rohingya crisis and urged the establishment of a strong coalition from the international community, including western countries. \n\u201cThe Security Council should be a force to consider demilitarization in northern Rakhine State and send a UN peacekeeping force like Lebanon, like Africa. And OIC countries just like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and they should ask China and Russia not to block [the vote to intervene in Myanmar at UN security council].\u201d \nWakar Uddin was unavailable for comment at the time of this report.

Faltering Peace Process Attendees of the Union Peace Conference\u2014also being heralded as the 21st Century Panglong Conference\u2014pictured on the event\u2019s opening day in Naypyidaw. / J Paing / The Irrawaddy 2.9k By Nyein Nyein 11 October 2017 \nMyanmar has been attempting to bring about peace in the country for almost six years now, with the Union government convincing only eight of Myanmar\u2019s 21 ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) to sign its landmark nationwide ceasefire agreement (NCA). \nOn Sunday, the government and NCA signatories will celebrate the two-year anniversary of the signing of the accord in the country\u2019s capital Naypyitaw. \nThe government\u2019s peace commissioners have said they are attempting to achieve peace with all EAOs including members of alliances\u2014namely the United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) and the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee (FPNCC). The government, however, does not recognize the latter as a bloc and would rather meet each of the seven FPNCC groups separately. \nEarlier this year, the State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said she \u201chopes 2017 can be designated as a year of peace,\u201d as her party the National League for Democracy (NLD) has marked national reconciliation and peace as a priority. \nNot long after she uttered the words, peace observers and advocates said her imaginations of peace were sure to fail\u2014they described the peace process as languid, with both formal and informal negotiations stalling. \nTwo possible reasons for stalling progress: The Myanmar Army\u2019s reluctance to hold national-level political dialogues\u2014a key step in NCA signing\u2014in either Shan or Rakhine states due to unsuitable venues and lack of security respectively. And the military\u2019s reluctance to accept three EAOs\u2014the Arakan Army (AA), Kokang\u2019s Myanmar National Democratic Alliance (MNDAA) and the Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army (TNLA). \nIn addition to these hurdles, conflict in Rakhine State that began in August added delays to already faltering peace talks between the government and EAOs. \nViolence flared when recently-established Muslim militant group the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) attacked 30 police and military outposts in northern Rakhine State\u2014killing 12 members of the security forces. \nEnsuing military clearance operations have brought waves of international criticism over the treatment of Muslim minority the self-identifying Rohingya\u2014of whom more than 500,000 have fled to Bangladesh bringing with them reports of rape, torture, extra-judicial killing and destruction of property by government forces. \nSelf-identifying Rohingya continue to leave at a rate of thousands a day despite some Muslim communities remaining intact. \nState Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2014who also leads the country\u2019s peace process\u2014has had to focus on the Rakhine State situation, including the implementation of recommendations by the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State led by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. \nIn line with one of the recommendations, the government has said it will register repatriated Muslim refugees from Bangladesh through the national citizenship verification process. \nAs this situation unfolds, ARSA appears to have positioned itself alongside Myanmar\u2019s other EAOs. \nSome ethnic armed group leaders have denounced ARSA\u2019s violence while the humanitarian catastrophe of the self-identifying Rohingya has grabbed the world\u2019s attention. \nARSA announced a unilateral ceasefire for one month to allow humanitarian assistance, which ended on Monday. The group offered peace talks with the government on Sunday, which were rejected on the grounds that they did not negotiate with terrorists. \nIn a statement dated Oct. 7, ARSA said: \u201cIf at any stage, the Burmese Government is inclined to peace, then ARSA will welcome that inclination and reciprocate.\u201d Defense Minister Lt-Gen Sein Win reiterated the government\u2019s stance of non-negotiation in comments to The Irrawaddy. \nHarn Yawnghwe, who has been involved in Myanmar\u2019s peace process since its inception and is director of the Euro-Burma Office, told The Irrawaddy this week that even if the government does not want to it should hold talks with ARSA. \n\u201cFor me, I think through armed conflict it is hard to find solutions, while negotiations can help reduce tensions,\u201d he said. \nAs Myanmar\u2019s peace talks with EAOs stall, it is interesting to see which groups see ARSA as a potential partner in negotiating peace with the Union government. \nShan, Karen, Pa\u2019O, Mon, and Arakanese ethnic leaders The Irrawaddy spoke to rejected ARSA as an ethnic armed group\u2014claiming leaders were raised in Pakistan and that the group\u2019s intentions deviate from other EAO\u2019s fight for ethnic equality, autonomy, self-determination, and federalism. \nSome leaders The Irrawaddy spoke to agreed with the government\u2019s argument that the self-identifying Rohingya are not indigenous to Myanmar and therefore have no basis for claiming territory. \nSelf-identifying Rohingya should be given citizenship in line with the government\u2019s national verification process, all ethnic leaders The Irrawaddy spoke to agreed. \nMany ethnic leaders, however, refused to comment officially on the issue\u2014with the excuse of not knowing the full details of Rakhine State affairs. \nKNU vice chairman Padoh Saw Kwe Htoo Win said the EAO had been sharing views on Rakhine affairs within their peace process steering team (PPST) but said \u201cas the Rakhine state affair is a sensitive issue, we are very careful [not to publicize our stance].\u201d \nBut ethnic leaders both on and off the record reasoned that as \u201cRohingya\u201d are not listed as an ethnicity of Myanmar and they did not know ARSA leaders, it would be hard for them to accept the armed group\u2019s call. \nChairman of NCA-signatory the Arakan Liberation Party U Khine Soe Naing Aung said there had been many groups in history attempting to represent Rohingya, but they were rejected as the group is not a nationality of Myanmar. \nHe said Rakhine State affairs affect the whole of Myanmar and he believes the NLD government should work to provide citizenship, neutralized citizenship or associate citizenship to Muslims in Rakhine State. \nChairman of Pa\u2019O Nationalities Liberation Organization Khun Myint Tun echoed the view that Rakhine State affairs must be viewed as a Union affair in which all are concerned in finding a solution. \nHe said the problems in Rakhine State were rooted long before independent Myanmar: \u201cSo we have to accept that there are inhabitants who have been living in the area since the [British] colonial times and who have migrated from neighboring Bangladesh over time. We need to see [the situation] fairly and work out for better solutions.\u201d \nAlso many [EAOs] wouldn\u2019t publicize their views on either support or denouncing the ARSA \u201cto avoid the international pressure,\u201d Khine Soe Naing Aung said. \nIt\u2019s not surprising that ethnic armed leaders refused to agree with the government or military\u2019s line on Rakhine State publicly\u2014virtually all ethnic armed groups have suffered from the Tatmadaw\u2019s oppression in one way or another over the past six or seven decades.

Award Stripping State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangon in Dec, 2015 after her party won landslide victory in 2015 general election. / Myo Min Soe / The Irrawaddy 1.8k By San Yamin Aung 12 October 2017 \nYANGON \u2014Myanmar\u2019s State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi does not find it surprising to be stripped of awards honoring her struggle to achieve democracy in the country over the past decades. \nShe told the Nikkei Asian Review in a recent interview: \u201cActually, nothing is surprising, because opinions change and world opinions change like any other opinion,\u201d considering reactions from western countries on her stance amid the Rakhine crisis. \nBut the majority of those in Myanmar who supported and believed in her\u2014including members of parliament\u2014see the wave of condemnation as humiliating to the leader they elected. \nThe 72-year-old Myanmar\u2019s de-facto leader who is barred from running for president under the military-drafted Constitution, is now under strong international censure for failing to criticize the military\u2019s actions against the self-identifying Rohingya and address accusations of ethnic cleansing in the conflict-marred state. \nAmid mounting criticism on the issue, Britain has seemed to be the most active among many other countries. One of Britain\u2019s largest trade unions Unison has suspended an award given to her when she was placed under house arrest, while the London School of Economics\u2019 students union said it would be stripping her of her honorary presidency. \nSt Hugh\u2019s College of Oxford University, where she studied politics, philosophy and economics between 1964 and 1967, removed the painting of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, as the college received the gift of a new painting. The portrait had been there since 1999. Daw Zin Mar Aung with the Daw Aung San Suu Kyi portrait at Oxford University. (Photo: Zin Mar Aung/ Facebook) \nOxford City Council voted unanimously last week to strip her of the Freedom of the City award, as it was \u201cno longer appropriate\u201d for her to hold it. \nA number of other British institutions also say they are reviewing whether to revoke honors bestowed upon her. \nBritish Ambassador to Myanmar Andrew Patrick told The Irrawaddy via email, \u201cThe UK government is not involved in decisions taken by independent institutions, such as Oxford University and its colleges.\u201d \n\u201cShe is our country\u2019s leader and people will feel bad about those acts. As a citizen, I feel bad too. But we need not to focus on that much and instead on what we can do for our democratic transition,\u201d Lower House lawmaker Daw Zin Mar Aung said. \nShe said the international community need to be mindful when making decisions on Myanmar based on wrong and incomplete information because it is not helpful for the country\u2019s fragile democratic transition. \n\u201cThey need to know Myanmar is still in the young democratic transition which they have praised. But what the international governments and experts are forgetting is that they are pressuring Myanmar as if it is an established democratic country.\u201d \nYangon regional lawmaker Nay Phone Latt also agreed. \n\u201cPolitically, it is really a difficult situation. The civilian government itself doesn\u2019t have full executive power under the current Constitution. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is also severely restricted under the circumstances. For us, we can understand her. But some international organizations seemingly don\u2019t really understand the conditions,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIf they decide without getting enough information, it is unfair. If that is the case, the college\u2019s image would be harmed [in the future],\u201d he added, referring to the removal of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s portrait at St Hugh\u2019s College of Oxford University. \nMany Myanmar citizens changed their Facebook profiles to a picture of the removed portrait and photos of the State Counselor to show their support, writing \u201cthe pictures of the State Counselor in their heart couldn\u2019t be taken down\u2019.\u201d \nIn response to international pressure, thousands have gathered in Myanmar\u2019s major cities to proclaim, \u201cWe stand with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u201d in recent weeks. People gather in downtown Yangon on Sept. 19 to show their solidarity with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi as she makes a diplomatic address on Rakhine State. / Thet Htun Naing / The Irrawaddy \nArtist MPP Ye Myint who showcased paintings of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangon and Mandalay, saw the acts of stripping the leader of her awards as \u201cchildish.\u201d \n\u201cI admired her since 1988 when she gave her public speech for the first time near Shwedagon Pagoda. The admiration never changed and kept growing,\u201d he said. \nHkun Okker, leading patron of the Pa-O National Liberation Organization, said some countries are stripping her of awards to protect their own interests, worrying about their own business activities with Muslim nations. \n\u201cIt is their decision. Because they took back awards, it doesn\u2019t mean the State Counselor is wrong,\u201d he said. \nChristian leader Cardinal Charles Maung Bo, who is Myanmar\u2019s first ever cardinal and archbishop of Yangon, said at a mass interfaith event in Yangon on Tuesday the country trusts in the leadership of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi who has made many sacrifices for the country and democracy. \n\u201cIt is not that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has begged for the Nobel Prize, but it is only international organizations that followed around Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and gave her awards. They can take all their awards back. And we\u2019d rather like to return those awards with an extra refund,\u201d the cardinal said. \n\u201cBut, there is something that they can\u2019t take away\u2014the love of citizens toward Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. No one can grab their reliance on her. She has the hopes of millions of people in her hands\u2026There is a need for the international community to understand and help this government. Condemning and blaming is meaningless.\u201d \nEthnic Karen Naw Susana Hla Hla Soe, a prominent women\u2019s rights activist who is now an Upper House lawmaker, echoed similar sentiments, saying no one asked for the prizes, including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi herself. \n\u201cThey gave their own and have now taken them back. It is too sloppy. But Aunty Suu won\u2019t respond to those. She will only be serious for the country,\u201d she said.

Maybe he will contribute cash to displaced ethnic Arakanese people via Sittwe or maybe he will directly meet with villagers in Maungdaw. It\u2019s up to the decision of the authorities,\u201d said Ko Phoe Thar. \nSittwe residents posted on Facebook that Wirathu and local monks donated 1.8 million kyats to displaced people from Maungdaw who have sought refuge in some monasteries. \nTin Maung Swe, secretary of Rakhine State government office, said: \u201c[Wirathu] went [to Maungdaw] previously and this time we will also allow. What else?\u201d \nThe region has been locked down, with journalists and international aid agencies prohibited from entering the area, since militant attacks on Aug. 25. \nThe government has conducted a number of guided tours for diplomats, journalists, and UN officials while the UN and NGOs call for unfettered access to deliver life-saving aid to vulnerable communities. \nA few Arakanese civil society groups publically criticized the visit of Wirathu, including coordinator of Kyaukphyu Rural Development Association (KRDA) U Tun Kyi, who pointed out that Mandalay Region, where Wirathu is based, has a number of problems with Chinese immigration and investment including the Letpadaung Copper Mine. \n\u201cWhy did he deliberately pick up Rakhine to voice out nationalism, rather than Mandalay?\u201d said U Tun Kyi. \nHe explained that Wirathu has visited Rakhine in the past, but did not improve the situation on the ground in Rakhine State. \nU Tun Kyi said he was concerned that the current problem in Rakhine is one of nationality, but it could easily be changed into an issue of race and religion. \n\u201cPolitics and religious should not be mixed. I don\u2019t like it indeed,\u201d said Tun Kyi. \nMeanwhile, ethnic affairs expert U Maung Maung Soe urged the government to establish a coordination team which contains representatives of the Muslim community in Rakhine State in order to control administration works in border towns. \nSelf-identifying Rohingya Muslim Kyaw Hla Aung told The Irrawaddy over the phone on Thursday that the cabinet members of Rakhine State did not come to meet the Muslim community in Sittwe and they have no idea how to consult for the National League for Democracy (NLD) government regarding the Rohingya crisis in Maungdaw. \n\u201cWe are not even allowed to leave the camp and know nothing about Maungdaw at this moment. So how can we make a suggestion to authorities?\u201d said U Kyaw Hla Aung. \nThe interaction between the NLD-led Rakhine State government and the Muslim community is weak, he said. \n\u201cEven when they did show up here, we don\u2019t know the right person to share our ideas with. I assume they don\u2019t actually want to listen to our opinions\u201d, said U Kyaw Hla Aung. \nU Kyaw Hla Aung remarked that Wirathu is travelling with his own plan to lend a hand for the Buddhist community while the Muslim community is contained in a camp. \nAccording to UN estimations, more than half a million Muslims fled neighboring Bangladesh and are sheltering in makeshift camps. Both Myanmar and Bangladesh authorities have formed joint-committee for repatriation process but have not yet announced a precise timeframe for the implementation.

Even today, half of our patients come to Thailand for accessing health and protection services. They rely on us to help them. We cannot let them down.\u201d \nA drop in funding available in the area came after political changes over the past five years in Myanmar. \n\u201cOur services programs are not yet completely shut down, but we have been reducing our costs and referring the emergency operations cases as much as we can,\u201d said Naw Annie Po Moo, the deputy director for the community operations of MTC. \nDue to funding needs, she said, MTC\u2019s almost 500 staff salaries would be reduced by 20 percent starting October. \nInternational governments and foundations as well as individual donors have supported the clinic. According to its 2016 annual report, the clinic received support from almost four dozen aid organisations and foundations, including The Global Fund (to fight aids, tuberculosis and malaria), USAID, UKaid, International Rescue Committee and Open Society Foundations. \nThe fundraising campaign aims to raise funds for its 2018 operational costs, to help continue running their programs: primary healthcare, education to children and child protection and training the medics to help the communities, including those internally displaced people. \n\u201cThe targeted fund is not for all running costs, but it would help to keep some of our services,\u201d said Naw Annie Po Moo. \nThe MTC provide treatment to an average of 420 patients per day and annually they treat more than 110,000 outpatients\u2014a tenth of them inpatients\u2014and deliver more than 2,500 babies. \nIn addition, MTC provides social support and protection to more than 2,400 children living in its boarding houses. The clinic is raising funds to secure an initial US$300,000 for some of its operational costs. \nVisit MTC\u2019s website or contact the clinic via its email [email protected] to contribute.

It was announced on Wednesday that she would end her duties in Myanmar by the end of October. \n\u201cThe Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator will use her remaining time until the end of the month to further the UN system\u2019s efforts to promote peace and security, human rights, as well as humanitarian and development assistance for all people in Myanmar,\u201d said the announcement. \nThe news of Lok-Dessallien\u2019s possible removal from her role first surfaced in June. \nAccording to a BBC news report, she was being criticized internally and being accused of the suppressing internal discussion on the self-identifying Rohingya issue. \nHowever, the spokesperson of the UN office in Myanmar refused to give comment on her recall. \nThe Canadian citizen began the job in January 2014 and was the first woman to take up the role.

Reports they have brought of killings, rape, and arson by security forces have stoked claims of ethnic cleansing in the international community. \n\u201cThe task of shouldering the duty shall be within the framework of rules, laws and other directives issued by the state. No action goes beyond the legal framework,\u201d said the Myanmar Army commander-in-chief. \nDespite the army\u2019s denial of crimes, the UN human rights office said on Wednesday that Myanmar security forces began its \u201cclearance operations\u201d before the Aug. 25 militant attacks, brutally driving out self-identifying Rohingya Muslims from the region, torching their homes, crops and villages to prevent them from returning, according to Reuters. \nIn a report based on 65 interviews with refugees who have arrived in Bangladesh in the past month, the UN human rights office said that the destruction by security forces, often joined by mobs of armed Arakanese Buddhists, of houses, fields, food stocks, crops, and livestock made the possibility of the self-identifying Rohingya returning to normal lives in northern Rakhine \u201calmost impossible.\u201d \n\u201cCredible information indicates that the Myanmar security forces purposely destroyed the property of the Rohingyas, scorched their dwellings and entire villages in northern Rakhine State, not only to drive the population out in droves but also to prevent the fleeing Rohingya victims from returning to their homes,\u201d the report said. \nDuring the Wednesday meeting, the ambassador said the US wants to make a constructive approach in order to reduce (international) pressure on Myanmar, according to the account of the meeting posted on Thursday. \n\u201cLocal Bengalis were involved in the attacks under the leadership of ARSA [Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army],\u201d said Snr-Gen Min Aung Hlaing, using a term for the self-identifying Rohingya to imply they are interlopers from Bangladesh. \u201cThat is why they might have fled as they feel insecure.\u201d \n\u201cThe native place of Bengalis is really Bengal. Therefore, they might have fled to the other country with the same language, race and culture as theirs by assuming that they would be safer there,\u201d the army chief said. \nOn Tuesday, nearly 2,000 self-identifying Rohingya from Buthidaung Township, an area relatively peaceful, gathered at the shores of the Bay of Bengal at A Lel Than Kyaw and Gawdu Thara villages to board ferries for Bangladesh despite the authorities\u2019 requests for them to return home and assurances for the provision of food and their safety. \nThe Muslims wanted to leave because of food shortages and the fact they could no longer make a living in the area, according to one of the crowd, Mahmoud Shobi.

Saw Mutu Sae Poe\u2014will deliver the opening speeches. \nFor Khun Okka of the Pa-O National Liberation Organisation (PNLO), the anniversary celebration is an attempt to awaken a stalling and faltering peace process. The NCA has brought no quantifiable results, some like Khun Okka argue, only a complex stalemate. Union Peace Dialogue Joint Committee (UPDJC) member Sai Kyaw Nyunt has complained that the NCA has become even more complex and convoluted in the two years since groups first signed. \nOnly eight out of Myanmar\u2019s 21 ethnic armed groups signed the accord at its inception. We must ask the question: Why has the NCA failed to include all ethnic armed groups and why are they refusing to sign it? \nThe success of the NCA can be seen to hinge on four groups: The Myanmar Army, the civilian government, NCA-signatory ethnic armed groups, and non NCA-signatory armed groups. \nThe Myanmar Army (The Tatmadaw) \nThe Tatmadaw is the major linchpin in the peace process. Peace or conflict depends on how it reacts to the demands of ethnic groups. \nThe 2008 Constitution is heavily loaded in favor of the Tatmadaw by granting its members 25 percent of seats in the Union and state parliaments and leaving the military in charge of three key ministries. \nDaw Aung San Suu Kyi herself admitted she cannot control the Tatmadaw under the military-drafted 2008 Constitution when she met the New Mon State Party (NMSP) in early September. \nThe National Defense and Security Council (NDSC) is the country\u2019s most powerful body and is comprised of eleven members: From the military, the commander-in-chief, the deputy commander-in-chief, one vice-president, the defense minister, the home minister, the border affairs minister and from the civilian government, the president, the second vice president, the speakers of both houses of the Union parliament, and the foreign minister (Daw Aung San Suu Kyi). \nWith six members from the military against five from the civilian government, voting power remains with the Tatmadaw. \nThe Tatmadaw\u2019s blatant power hangs over Myanmar\u2019s peace process and unless it is willing to cease conflicts and expedite negotiations, the NCA will go nowhere and bring no benefits. \nAn example is the case of three armed groups\u2014the Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), the Arakan Army (AA), and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA)\u2014who are excluded from the peace process by the Tatmadaw. \nThe Civilian Government \nThe government acts as negotiator between the Tatmadaw and ethnic armed groups. Under the tenure of U Thein Sein\u2019s government, numerous negotiations took place but no quantifiable results were seen, except perhaps the, now stalling, NCA. \nThe process has now been taken over by the new government led by Nobel Laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi who has convened two conferences dubbed the 21st Century Panglong Union Peace Conference. Despite the State Counselor\u2019s stated conviction to inclusiveness, a number of ethnic armed groups have been excluded from participating in the conferences. \nThe first session of her 21st Century Panglong peace conference ended with the United Wa State Army walking out on the second day of talks, claiming they had not been given permission to address the conference. \nThe second session of the conference ended without agreement on the contentious issue of non-secession from the Union, which participants claimed was contrary to the spirit of the 1947 Panglong Agreement and the promises made by Gen. Aung San. \nThe conference reached agreements on 37 points, 12 of which concerned politics. \nThe government declared these agreements a historic breakthrough, but there is still no clear timeline to fulfill agreements made at the conference. \nNCA Signatories \nThe culmination of negotiations under former president U Thein Sein saw eight ethnic armed groups signing the NCA on 15 Oct, 2015. \nThe eight ethnic armed groups that signed the NCA are: the KNU, the PNLO, the Chin National Front (CNF), the Arakan Liberation Party (ALP), the All Burma Students\u2019 Democratic Front (ABSDF), the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS), Karen National Union/Karen National Liberation Army (Peace Council) (KNU/KNLA PC), the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA). \nAfter signing the NCA, these groups were allowed to fully participate in both the first and second sessions of the Panglong conferences. They have attempted to expedite the peace process by active participation in the conferences and other dialogues with the government. \nNCA Non-Signatories \nMost ethnic armed organizations\u2014including powerful outfits the UWSA and the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO)\u2014refused to sign the NCA. According to Maj-Gen Gun Maw of the KIO, the reasons were threefold: \nFirstly, the Tatmadaw set a precondition for three smaller ethnic armed organizations\u2014the TNLA, the AA, and the MNDAA\u2014to disarm before entering the talks. The KIO is alligned particularly with the TNLA and two of KIO\u2019s brigades\u2014four and six\u2014are stationed next to TNLA and MNDAA troops. The groups share territory and conduct joint operations against the Myanmar Army. \nSecondly, the UNFC presented a nine-point proposal to the government while meeting at the National Reconciliation and Peace Centre in Yangon on March 3, 2017 which would need to be fulfilled before signing the NCA. The government and the bloc have so far agreed on half of the bloc\u2019s nine-point proposal, but the Tatmadaw has not agreed on UNFC concerns regarding ceasefire monitoring, a military code of conduct, demarcation, and troop relocation. \nThirdly, some EAOs, including the KIO, have said they expect a certain level of agreement with the government. They proposed a joint committee of the government, political parties, ethnic armed groups, and the military to oversee the peace process framework. The government and military rejected this request. \nIn an Aug. 24 statement, the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee (FPNCC) emphasized adherence to its policy that any political negotiations with the government and the Tatmadaw must involve the FPNCC as a bloc, rather than separate talks with the seven groups. The government Peace Commission is planning to meet the UWSA and NDAA, without the rest of the bloc, soon. \nThe third session of the 21st Century Panglong Peace Conference will be held soon, but it is still not clear who will be included. \nHopefully, the anniversary will remind all groups to evaluate the stalled NCA process and move forward. The country needs to stabilize conflicts and expedite the peace process as the image of the country is stained by the Rakhine State crisis. \nThus, these four major actors\u2014the Tatmadaw, the Government, NCA signatories and Non-NCA signatories\u2014must put concerted efforts to accelerate the momentum of the peace process. Absent of such efforts, the success of the NCA seems a forlorn hope and gaining peace in Myanmar will be elusive. \nJoe Kumbun is the pseudonym of a Kachin State-based analyst.

\nBANGKOK \u2014 Thailand is putting the finishing touches this month to a lavish five-day funeral ceremony in a final goodbye to its late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who helped shape the Southeast Asian nation for decades after World War Two. \nMany of the hundreds of thousands of black-clad mourners are expected to camp for days near Bangkok\u2019s Grand Palace to capture a good view of the ceremonies, which will be guarded by 78,000 police officers and culminate in the cremation on Oct. 26. \n\u201cOctober is a sad period,\u201d Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who announced plans for a national election next year, told reporters in the capital on Tuesday. \u201cI ask that politicians and political parties be peaceful and orderly.\u201d \nArtisans have worked for ten months in Bangkok\u2019s ancient quarter to build an elaborate cremation site fashioned after a vision of heaven, where Thais believe dead royals return to live above Mount Meru, a golden mountain in Hindu mythology. \nThe funeral of King Bhumibol, who died on Oct. 13 last year after seven decades on the throne, is also a time of uncertainty for some Thais, said a Thailand-based analyst, who declined to be identified because of sensitivities around the monarchy. \n\u201cIn many ways the king was Thailand and his death has left a huge vacuum in the Thai psyche,\u201d said the analyst, pointing to social and political upheavals in recent decades. \n\u201cWhat happens after his funeral? Where will Thailand head next? These are profound questions that must be answered.\u201d \nAncient Traditions \nThe late king was succeeded by his son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, or Rama X, who has overseen sweeping changes to the royal household, including the running of palace finances. \nThough steeped in ancient traditions, the funeral of King Bhumibol will permit more public participation than those of previous kings, said Thai monarchy expert Tongthong Chandransu. \n\u201cA strong bond has been formed between the people and the monarchy\u2014the strongest compared to past reigns,\u201d Tongthong told Reuters. \u201cSo we can see more people participation in the royal funeral of this king.\u201d \nAmong the many royal objects restored for the funeral is a golden chariot that will carry the king\u2019s body in a giant ornate urn to the cremation site. \nThe urn will move to the Royal Crematorium before the cremation on the night of Oct. 26, which has been declared a national holiday. \nMore than 3,000 performers will join in a nightlong final tribute of music and puppet shows to end a year of mourning. \nThais devoted to the memory of the king have folded paper flowers for his cremation, making 10 million in Bangkok alone, city authorities said. \n\u201cThis is our \u2018Mandela,\u2019 or our \u2018Princess Diana,\u2019 moment,\u201d said graphic designer and self-proclaimed royalist Apichai Klapiput. \n\u201cWhat the world will see is rivers of tears that show how much Thais love King Bhumibol Adulyadej.

More than 200 people were killed in storms last year. \n\u201cIn the past 10 years, we haven\u2019t suffered from such severe and intense floods,\u201d state-run Vietnam Television quoted agriculture minister Nguyen Xuan Cuong as saying. \nA typhoon tore a destructive path across central Vietnam just last month, flooding and damaging homes and knocking out power lines. \nThe latest floods hit Vietnam on Monday. \n\u201cOur entire village has had sleepless nights\u2026it\u2019s impossible to fight against this water, it\u2019s the strongest in years,\u201d a resident in northwestern Hoa Binh province was quoted by VTV as saying. \nVietnam\u2019s Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control said authorities were discharging water from dams to control water levels. \nSome 317 homes had collapsed, while more than 34,000 other houses were submerged or had been damaged. \nEarlier reports said more than 8,000 hectares (19,800 acres) of rice had been damaged and around 40,000 animals were killed or washed away. \nHoa Binh province in the northwest declared a state of emergency and opened eight gates to discharge water at Hoa Binh dam, Vietnam\u2019s largest hydroelectric dam, the first time it has done so in years, VTV reported. \nPrime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc visited northern Ninh Binh province where water levels in the Hoang Long river are their highest since 1985. \nRising sea levels are also threatening Vietnam\u2019s more than 3,260 km (2,000 mile) coastline, resulting in increased flooding of low lying coastal regions, erosion and salt water intrusion. \nFloods have also affected seven of 77 provinces in Thailand, Vietnam\u2019s neighbour to the west, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation said on Thursday.

However, just as no one can fully understand the situation of our country the way we do, no one can desire peace and development for our country more than us. That is why we need to tackle these problems based on the strength of our unity.\u201d \nAs the Rakhine State affair is \u201ca matter of national importance,\u201d Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said, government would take a leading role at both Union and state level and give \u201cserious consideration the sincere offers of cooperation made at home and from abroad.\u201d \nShe invited non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations and business leaders as well as the international partners, UN agencies, financial institutions like the World Bank and ADB, INGOs like the Japan\u2019s Nippon Foundation and friendly countries, to join hands and cooperate with the government. \nIn her nine-minute long speech titled \u201cReport to the People,\u201d Daw Aung San Sui Kyi said, she places \u201cgreat hope in our Union\u2019s nationals\u201d living within the country and abroad, and calling \u201call the sons and daughters of our Union\u201d to give a helping a hand in resolving the Rakhine State issue. \nShe repeatedly emphasized, as in her previous speeches, the need to overcome the challenges with the power of people and extended her thanks to the public for the support they have been shown these days. \n\u201cThere is no power which can compare with the support of the people, trust of the people and the unity of the people. I believe that no matter whatever difficulties we face, we can overcome, with the unity of our people,\u201d she said.

Traditionally, Myanmar people work on farms, go to pagodas and monasteries, enjoy festivals, and hold maternal love in high esteem. Yangon-based painter Nay Tun is inspired by traditional Myanmar life. \nAll these aspects are on display at Nay Tun\u2019s seventh solo exhibition at OK Gallery from Oct. 14 to 18. \nNay Tun came to fame for expressing his profound love for Myanmar tradition and customs, which he has dedicated his artistry to since his first solo show in 2009. Yangon-based painter Nay Tun is inspired by traditional Myanmar life. \nBorn in 1955 in Yangon, he went to State School of Fine Art, and has participated in more than 100 group shows so over the course of his career. \nThe artist said: \u201cI really love what late artists U Kin Maung (Bank), Baji Aung Soe, U Aung Khin, and Rahula have said. They said that regardless of techniques, what you draw about Myanmar tradition should be distinctive to viewers. I love Myanmar tradition also and have therefore created these paintings.\u201d Yangon-based painter Nay Tun is inspired by traditional Myanmar life. \nHis paintings depict monks collecting alms, a horse and cart rolling through Bagan, women growing rice on farm, Mingun Bell, the second largest bell in the world, hanging in grandeur. \nThere will be 40 paintings on show at OK Gallery in Aung San Stadium (North Wing) in Yangon, each priced US$300.

While such gaffes that call to mind the bad old days of colonialism are in bad taste, more pertinent stories about the West and its neo-colonial endeavors in Myanmar are going largely unreported. Since the so-called transition to democracy\u2014 a transition often misunderstood and much exaggerated\u2014 Myanmar has been the center of a \u201cgold rush\u201d , as businesses from Asia and the West hope to make money from what has been called \u201cAsia\u2019s last economic frontier\u201d. \nThe EU accounts for about 10 percent of foreign direct investment in Myanmar and is keen to raise that number with its planned Investment Protection Agreement (IPA), a wide-ranging agreement on trade that has been in-negotiation in recent years. Yet, it has raised considerable concerns from civil society groups about the lack of transparency in these negotiations, and the potential negative impacts of the treaty. In 2016, more than 500 CSOs jointly wrote to the EU commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m , expressing their frustration with a \u201cconsultation process\u201d run by consulting agency \u201cDevelopment Solutions\u201d\u2014 one that amounted to little more than a few \u201cworkshops\u201d in Yangon and a scant questionnaire. \u201c\u2026[O]ne key question is missing: the question whether we at all want an IPA,\u201d the letter states. \nA key part of the IPA is that it would bring the Myanmar government under an Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) regime in regards to its dealings with EU companies. ISDS is a mechanism which allows investors to sue governments in independent arbitration courts, and its inclusion in recent multilateral treaties such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership have opened up a public debate about both its effectiveness and fairness towards developing countries. \nIn theory, an ISDS helps give confidence to foreign investors by protecting them against unstable governments that might renege on investment agreements. However, in practice, the mechanism has often been used to punish governments seeking to regulate industries, even if the regulation is in the interests of public safety. In 1997, over concerns about public health, the Canadian government effectively banned the chemical MMT. Following this, they were challenged by Ethyl , a US corporation that manufactured MMT in Canada. Ethyl argued that banning MMT violated the terms of the NAFTA agreement. Rather than go to an international tribunal, the Canadian government ended up repealing the ban and paying US$13 million to Ethyl in a settlement . \nIn 2016, the Ukrainian government was sued for $820 million by the US pharmaceutical company, Gilead . This was made possible by a 1994 US-Ukraine bilateral treaty which included an ISDS. Gilead, which was selling the anti-hepatitis C drug, Sofosbuvir, in the country was angered by the introduction of cheaper generic versions of the drug and wanted Ukraine to preserve its monopoly within the country. In early 2017, Gilead withdrew the threat and came to an agreement with Ukraine: They would lower their price, but competitors offering lower prices would be banned. \nISDS, once in place, effectively acts to put companies above the law, and this has chilling effects on democracy and on the ability of countries to legislate against and reform damaging corporate behavior. In Indonesia, following the dictatorial reign of Suharto, the government enacted laws against open-pit mining. A recent investigation by Buzzfeed News found that an Australian mining company, Newcrest, made veiled threats to the Indonesian government, stating that unless they were able to continue mining, they would bring in international tribunals. This wasn\u2019t an empty threat as the country had already suffered a $261 million loss at one of these tribunals, when Indonesia was forced to pay a US energy company, Karaha Bodas, for loss of potential future profits after the government closed down a power plant project due to lack of funds. \nConcerns over ISDS were a focal point of an open letter in 2016 from almost 200 local CSOs in Myanmar calling for a suspension of the EU-Myanmar IPA: \u201cInclusion of an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism in the EU-Myanmar IPA will seriously hamper any initiatives for equitable and sustainable development by laying Myanmar wide open to multimillion dollar law suits by foreign investors should the governments introduce new and tighter regulation to protect public health, access to water, access to public services, degradation of the environment and regulation supporting a sustainable peace in Myanmar.\u201d \nYet, the EU seems determined to push through the law. In an interview earlier this year, the eagerness of resident EU Ambassador, Roland Kobia, to see the deal through seemed to be almost tangible as he warned that \u201cMyanmar needs to get its act together\u201d or investors would go elsewhere. Would they really though? There\u2019s no real evidence that such agreements have any effect on the number of investments at all. Even business-centric publications such as the Financial Times have begun to question the usefulness of ISDS in bilateral treaties . \nIn September, a consortium of Myanmar and international NGOs jointly launched a report \u201c Myths and risks of the EU-Myanmar Investment Protection Agreement.\u201d Among other valuable insights, the report showed how the idea that the treaty would encourage investment was without solid grounding in evidence and how claims that it would help workers rights were mere aspirations. In fact, the opposite could be true, as there is already a precedent for companies suing governments for increasing the minimum wage , for example. It also outlined the potential chilling effects of the agreement on democratic and judicial reform, and the peace process, as well as the continued concerns about a lack of transparency. \nMyanmar knows what it\u2019s like to have corporations play the bully. The British invasion of Mandalay in 1885 , that deposed Thibaw, was kick-started by the actions of the Bombay Burmah Company, which misled the Burmese government about how much teak it was extracting and underpaid its employees. When the Burmese sanctioned them for this, the British suggested arbitration (run by the British, of course), a proto-ISDS, if you will. The arbitration never happened and the rest is history. It was a convenient excuse for the British to invade, yet while the West isn\u2019t going to march armies up the Irrawaddy anymore, it still pays to be cautious when foreign investors come knocking. \nBack to the current day, on October 2 it was reported that the IPA had been suspended, due to the ongoing unrest in Rakhine State. While the reprieve is welcomed, the cynical will see it as merely optics rather than principles. When the EU inevitably resumes work on the IPA, will it finally listen to civil society? \nEwan Cameron is a teacher and writer living in Myanmar.

I doubt if all the works could be implemented within a year,\u201d he said. \nHe explained that Maungdaw, Buthitaung and Rathedaung townships used to have electricity 3.5 hr to 5 hr a day, and only around ten percent of the whole Rakhine State has electricity. \nMaungdaw has a community-based electricity supply committee that buys electricity from local private suppliers. \nIn Buthidaung, the government currently provides electricity with two generators. It previously provided electricity for five hours a day. After the outbreak of violence in the area, electricity\u2014at 35 kyats per unit\u2014is being supplied from 6.30 p.m. to 4.30 a.m. daily, according to Buthidaung local Ko Aung. \nOnly 38 percent of the country\u2019s population is connected to the national grid, leaving 62 percent of the population, most of them in rural areas, without access to government-supplied electricity, deputy electricity minister Dr. Tun Lwin told Parliament in June. \nThe production cost of electricity by state-owned and private power plants is around 92 kyats per unit, but the price sold to users is 69 kyats on average. The government had to subsidize the gap, which created a loss of 337 billion kyats during the 2016-17 fiscal year, said the deputy minister. \nTranslated from Burmese by Thet Ko Ko.

In February the military formed a five-member team led by Lt-Gen Aye Win in response to a UN report based on interviews in January with more than 200 self-identifying Rohingya refugees among some 70,000 who fled Myanmar for Bangladesh following militant attacks on police outposts in October. \nThe United Nation\u2019s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights report stated security forces committed mass killings and gang rapes of Muslims in a campaign that \u201cvery likely\u201d amounted to crimes against humanity. \nThe state-run newspaper in May summarized the internal military inquiry, rejecting the allegations and saying the report was \u201cbased on lies and invented statements.\u201d \nMilitary investigators, among others, interviewed nearly 3,000 villagers from 29 villages and \u201cwrote down\u201d testimony from 408 villagers, 184 military officers and troops, it said. \nIt added that three low-ranking soldiers were jailed for minor offences, such as stealing a motorbike or beating up villagers in one incident. \nWith the new investigation focusing on operations after Aug. 25, it was unclear whether the report would include retrospective findings from last year. \nMilitary spokesperson Maj Gen. Aung Ye Win was not available for comment on Friday. \nOn Thursday, Myanmar Army chief Snr-Gen Min Aung Hlaing told the Japanese ambassador for Myanmar that the army has conducted an investigation into any misconduct by security forces occurring after the Aug 25 attacks. \n\u201cNow we are trying to have a factually comprehensive report,\u201d he said during the meeting with the ambassador in Naypyitaw, according to a report posted on the army\u2019s chief Facebook. It did not mention a release date for the findings. \nThe latest investigation revealed that the security forces\u2019 actions were within the legal framework, as they were strictly ordered to take action in accordance with law and used the lowest number of troops possible, according to the post. \nIn January, the government detained several police officers over a video showing policemen beating self-identifying Rohingya in November last year that went viral. \nThree police officers were sentenced to two months detention in a jail for police over the video, according to AFP, with security forces saying those involved had \u201cno intention\u201d to cause harm.

to be Done Attendees of the 21st Century Panglong Union peace conference in Naypyitaw in May 2017. / Myo Min Soe / The Irrawaddy 1.8k By San Yamin Aung 13 October 2017 \nYANGON \u2014 Stakeholders and activists welcomed a slight increase in women involved in Myanmar\u2019s peace process but cautioned there were challenges to meet the target of 30 percent female participation. \nWomen\u2019s rights groups have been advocating for a minimum 30 percent female representatives of nationwide peace negotiations launched in 2011. \nOn Oct. 15, 2015, eight of Myanmar\u2019s 21 ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) signed landmark peace accord the nationwide ceasefire agreement (NCA) which stated: \u201cWe shall include a reasonable number of women representatives in the political dialogue process.\u201d \nThe country\u2019s framework for political dialogue later added an official commitment to \u201cmake efforts to achieve 30 percent female participation in all political dialogues.\u201d \nWomen were largely excluded from Union-level peace conferences held in January and August last year and May this year, however. \nOnly seven percent of the 700 attendees of the January 2016 Union Peace Conference were women. \nThe number slightly improved to 13 percent of 663 attendees in the August conference last year and 17 percent of 910 attendees in May this year. \nMyanmar\u2019s failure to reach the 30 percent target was discussed at an international seminar on the roles of women in Myanmar\u2019s peace process held by Ar Yone Oo\u2019s Social Development Association and the Peace Research Institute Oslo in Yangon on Monday. \nNaw Susana Hla Hla Soe, a prominent women\u2019s rights activist who is now an Upper House lawmaker, said representation of more than half of Myanmar\u2019s population in the peace process was very low, particularly at national-level peace dialogues and among decision-making bodies. \nShe said she was only ever permitted involvement in social affairs discussions at political dialogues in Karen State, despite wanting to join political discussions. \n\u201cThere is an idea that women are only concerned with social affairs,\u201d she said, adding it is important to include women\u2019s voices in the planning and implementation of all parts of the peace process. \nDaw Thandar Oo, founder of Women and Peace Action Network of Shan State (WPAN), echoed Naw Susuan Hla Hla Soe\u2019s comments and said female participation in political and security affairs was lacking. \n\u201cExcluding women\u2019s voices is to ignore the majority of voices,\u201d she said, adding that without including or taking consideration of women\u2019s experiences and opinions in all sectors, it will be impossible to implement peace. \nZaceu Lian, liaison officer of the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, said when each group select delegates for their quota to attend the peace talks, they experienced difficulties finding representatives as they chose experts on the issue who can debate well with the military. \n\u201c[Peace negotiations] are not a place to train [women], but a place to debate with the military and other groups. When they see a woman they think they are not ready, which is why no women were included in discussions on security,\u201d he said. \nChin Chin, a technical adviser to the Chin National Front, argued that the 23 political parties with parliamentary seats are only allowed to send about five people each to peace talks and therefore usually choose party\u2019s chairman or secretary general. \n\u201cIn this case, we need to reconsider the structure of political parties which are dominated by men at the top levels,\u201d said Chin Chin. \nDaw Thandar Oo of WPAN, who attended the three previous Union peace conferences said: \u201cThere has always been a question of how much women know and how skillful they are in being involved in peace dialogues.\u201d \n\u201cWhere does skill come from,\u201d she asked. \u201cIt comes from our experience, that\u2019s why we need to open more spaces for women.\u201d \nHkun Okker, a leading patron of the Pa-Oh National Liberation Organization (PNLO), said: \u201cWe have agreed to include at least 30 percent. The groups which attend peace conferences need to try to meet that in choosing representatives. They have a responsibility for that,\u201d adding that he hopes the number will be met in the upcoming peace conference which is expected to be held in December. \nState Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who is chairperson of Union Peace Dialogue Joint Committee, has also called greater female participation in the country\u2019s peace process. \n\u201cThere are ongoing movements calling for 30 percent participation in the peace process. I want more than that; I want 50 percent,\u201d she said at an International Women\u2019s Day celebration in Naypyitaw in March, adding that participation did not just mean sitting in on the conference.

It is therefore fair to assume that continued ignoring of this fact amounts to resisting the federal Union which people aspire to, opposing democracy, having desire for armed \u2018anarchy,\u2019 and disregarding the interests of the Union and its people.\u201d \nThe number of NCA signatories has not increased since an initial eight ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) signed the accord two years ago. \nMore than a dozen EAOs\u2014some of whom helped draft the NCA\u2014have shown little interest in signing the pact. \nSixteen EAOs under the banner Nationwide Ceasefire Coordinating Team and government peace negotiators under the previous administration drafted the NCA in late 2013. \nBut clashes continue in Myanmar\u2019s northeast involving the Ta\u2019ang Nationalities Liberation Army, Arakan Army, and Kokang\u2019s Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army\u2014all of whom the Tatmadaw refuses to accept as peace partners. \nThese three EAOs are allied with the militarily strong United Wa State Army (UWSA) and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) under new political alliance the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee (FPNCC). \nThe UWSA-led bloc has called for an alternative approach to the NCA. The government, though, has rejected negotiating with the FPNCC as a whole and insists on meeting each of its seven members separately. \nEfforts of the government\u2019s Peace Commission to bring NCA non-signatories to sign the pact have been further hampered by a nine-point proposal from another ethnic bloc, the United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC). The bloc of five members is waiting for the government to agree to the proposal before signing the NCA. \nDaw Aung San Suu Kyi, who heads the National Reconciliation and Peace Center among other state roles, said at Sunday\u2019s ceremony that the government was \u201cready to welcome\u201d non-signatories to the NCA. \nShe invited them to collaborate with the government in implementing the basic principles needed for a federal state. \n\u201cOur government welcomes all non-signatory groups to participate in the process of formulating the principles towards a Democratic Federal Union in the future. In fact, the NCA is not an end in itself, but just the first step towards national reconciliation in the country,\u201d said the State Counselor. \n\u201cI would like to reiterate today that the NCA opens the door for political dialogues which will pave the way to the Union Peace Conference,\u201d she added. \nIn the second round of the Union Peace Conference in May, the delegates signed a part of the Union Accord, but it did not cover key federal principles regarding equality and self-determination. \nUnion peace conferences would be held biannually in accordance with the plan, said Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. \nAlmost five months after the second session of the Union Peace Conference, national-level political dialogues are yet to be held. In the dialogues, regional stakeholders discuss suggestions at large-scale public consultations, the results of which are shared at the conference. \nStill, the State Counselor said the government would hold its third round of the Union Peace Conference later this year as planned and two more next year. \nMembers of the Union Peace Dialogue Joint Committee (UPDJC) and the Joint Ceasefire Monitoring Committee (JMC) gave reports on their progress. The committees are the mechanisms to implement the NCA, established at a Joint Implementation Coordination Meeting (JICM) two years ago. \nGen Saw Mutu Say Poe said self-determination, autonomy and ethnic rights for ethnic nationalities are yet to be fully implemented despite an agreement between independence hero Gen Aung San and ethnic leaders of Shan, Chin, and Kachin states under the Panglong agreement signed in February 1947. \n\u201cOur aim is to build a union envisioned by the 1947 Panglong agreement, and to end an almost seven decades long civil war. To reach our goal, we have to implement the peace process through the roadmap drafted in the NCA and to hold political dialogue with all stakeholders,\u201d he told the ceremony. \nOn the same day the KNU released a statement urging the government and the Tatmadaw to compromise on policies regarding ethnic equality and the right to self-determination. \n\u201cThe compromising of these policies could enable the remaining EAOs to sign the NCA, and reinforce the efforts for peace and the emergence of a federal democracy,\u201d read the statement. \nGen Saw Mutu Say Poe stressed in his speech the need to hold regular gatherings of the JICM, the highest authority in decision-making on NCA implementation. \nBut the government reportedly does not want to call JICMs unless there are disputes to resolve. \nNCA signatories showed optimism that clashes between their groups and the army had significantly reduced since they signed the NCA. \nSalai Lian Hmung Sakhong of the Chin National Front told reporters in Naypyitaw on Sunday, \u201cIt is a big success as we have seen that military engagement in the ceasefire territories have been reduced by 80 to 85 percent.\u201d \nDaw Aung San Suu Kyi shared similar observations at the ceremony. \n\u201cDespite criticism of the NCA, there has been noticeable progress. We have successfully decreased conflicts in the regions of the ethnic armed organizations signatories and as a result, the socio-economic lives of the local people have significantly improved,\u201d she said. \n\u201cIt has been two years since we signed the NCA. There is no reason to retreat. We only need to go forward and pave our way towards our desired goal,\u201d she added.

But there is little cooperation between the natural resources and environmental conversation ministry and the industry ministry, said Dr. Min Kyi, which breeds irresponsible business operations. \nHe cited the state government\u2019s recent surprise checks on some factories in Mawlamyine in which the majority of the operations were found to be violating guidelines. \nThe environmental conservation department has issued guidelines to factories regarding environmental conservation. It will shut down factories that fail to implement the guidelines, said the department\u2019s deputy director U Soe Naing. \nThe department will ask factories to make any necessary changes over \u201ca certain period of time\u201d in order to avoid damaging the environment, he said. \n\u201cIf they fail to fix [the issues] beyond that period, we\u2019ll take legal actions,\u201d U Soe Naing told The Irrawaddy. \nHe added that the ministry is too under-resourced to detect all industrial pollution and supervise factories and workshops. \nAfter lawmakers in the state parliament raised questions about strong-smelling rubber processing plants on the Mawlamyine-Mudon highway in September, the Mon State chief minister suspended the plants\u2019 production until they submit EMPs to the state government. \nTranslated from Burmese by Thet Ko Ko.

The generals wanted to declare a state of emergency in Rakhine State as clearance operations were launched. \nIf Daw Aung San Suu Kyi decided to go to New York while U Htin Kyaw was in a Bangkok hospital receiving treatment, U Myint Swe would be in charge and the army could declare a state of emergency in Rakhine State. \nSince day one, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has objected to declaring a state of emergency in Rakhine State. \nVice president U Myint Swe is a former top general and served as Yangon chief minister under the U Thein Sein administration and was known as a military hardliner under the Snr-Gen Than Shwe regime. \nAfter reading the precarious situation, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi decided not to go to New York and instead delivered a diplomatic briefing addressing Rakhine State in English. Simultaneously, rallies to support Daw Aung San Suu Kyi were held in some major cities to condemn mounting international pressure on the State Counselor. \nU Htin Kyaw came back from medical treatment but Daw Aung San Suu Kyi cancelled her planned trip to Prague. \nInstead, she went to Brunei to attend the Golden Jubilee gala of King Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah\u2019s succession to the throne. She was seen with several Asean leaders who have expressed concern on the situation in Rakhine State. \nMalaysia decided to disassociate itself from a statement on Rakhine issued by the Filipino chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. It said that the statement misrepresents the reality of the situation and omits references to Rohingya Muslims. \nIn any case, under the 2008 Constitution, the army can declare a state of emergency. But there is process. \nOnly the President can declare a state of emergency after consulting and coordinating with the Commander-in-Chief of Defense Services and Home Affairs. This declaration must be submitted to the National Defense and Security Council (NDSC) for approval as soon as possible, according to the Constitution. \nIt should be noted that under the current administration, regular NDSC meetings do not take place. \nThe commander-in-chief would have sovereign power, but he would have to seek NDSC approval to extend the emergency period to six months or more. \nHe also has to report to an emergency session of the Union Parliament. This scenario is likely if the country is perceived as facing a serious emergency situation or a formidable threat to sovereignty. \nAmong diplomats and observers, there are still rumors of a coup. \nChina, India and other of Myanmar\u2019s close neighbors watch the ongoing power play in Naypyitaw knowing that relations between State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and Snr Gen Min Aung Hlaing are at a low point.

of the terminal hall of new Daxing Airport constructed on the outskirts of Beijing, China October 16, 2017. / Jason Lee / Reuters 2.3k By Reuters 16 October 2017 \nBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s capital unveiled the \u201cshining example\u201d of its 80 billion yuan (US$12.14 billion) new airport on Monday, tipped to become one of the world\u2019s largest when it opens in October 2019 amid a massive infrastructure drive overseen by President Xi Jinping. \nRepresentatives showed off the sprawling skeleton of \u201cBeijing New Airport,\u201d which is made up of 1.6 million cubic metres of concrete, 52,000 tons of steel and spans a total 47 square kilometers (18 square miles), including runways. \nIt is expected to serve an initial 45 million passengers a year with an eventual capacity of 100 million, putting it on par with Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. \n\u201cLined up together there\u2019s roughly 5 kilometers of gates,\u201d said project spokesman Zhu Wenxin. \u201cIt\u2019s a shining example of China\u2019s national production capacity.\u201d \nUpdates on the airport come as the ruling Communist Party is set to open its 19th congress later this week, a twice-a-decade leadership event where Xi will consolidate power and emphasize successful projects and policy from his first five years. \nThe project, which broke ground in 2014, is one of the region\u2019s largest infrastructure investments under Xi\u2019s rule, which has been plagued by fears of slowing economic growth, offset slightly by a construction spree. \nChina has sought to boost its profile as both an aviation hub and a manufacturer in recent years. The country\u2019s first home-grown passenger jet, the C919, lifted off on its maiden flight in May, edging into a multibillion-dollar market currently dominated by Boeing Co and Airbus SE. \nSituated 67 kilometers south of Beijing, the airport technically falls in neighboring Hebei province, though it will eventually constitute its own development zone. \nIt will relieve pressure on Beijing\u2019s existing international airport, to the northeast of Beijing and currently the world\u2019s second largest by passenger volume, which opened a new terminal worth $3.6 billion in 2008 ahead of the Beijing Summer Olympics. \nThe existing airport will continue to operate major international flights, though a third smaller domestic airport in the city\u2019s south will close in coming years. \nTwo of China\u2019s three major airlines, China Eastern Airlines Corp and China Southern Airlines Co, will relocate to the airport on completion, accounting for roughly four-fifths of the new airport\u2019s total traffic. \nThe airport will be connected to Beijing by a high speed train with a top speed of 350 kilometer an hour, as well as an inter-city train and a major expressway. \nOriginal plans for the airport were made by French airports operator Aeroports de Paris, though third-party improvements to the original version make the final design \u201cwholly domestic,\u201d said Zhu. \n\u201cIt\u2019s like a large flower, but made of steel,\u201d said one construction worker on the site, who declined to share his name because he was not authorized to speak to press.

Many were injured, with the elderly carried on makeshift stretchers, while women balanced household items, such as pots, rice sacks and clothing, on their heads. \n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t step out of the house for the last month because the military were looting people,\u201d said Mohammad Shoaib, 29, who wore a yellow vest and balanced jute bags of food and aluminum pots on a bamboo pole. \u201cThey started firing on the village. So we escaped into another. \n\u201cDay by day, things kept getting worse, so we started moving towards Bangladesh. Before we left, I went back near my village to see my house, and the entire village was burnt down,\u201d Shoaib added. \nThey joined about 536,000 self-identifying Rohingya Muslims who have fled Myanmar since Aug. 25, when coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response, with the fleeing people accusing security forces of arson, killings and rape. \nMyanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing and has labeled the militants from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army who launched the attacks as terrorists, who have killed civilians and burnt villages. \nNot everyone made it to Bangladesh alive on Monday. \nSeveral kilometers to the south of Palongkhali, a boat carrying scores of refugees sank at dawn, killing at least 12 and leaving 35 missing. \nThere were 21 survivors, Bangladesh authorities said. \n\u201cSo far 12 bodies, including six children and four women, have been recovered,\u201d said police official Moinuddin Khan. \nBangladesh border guards told Reuters the boat sank because it was overloaded with refugees, who pay exorbitant fees to cross the Naf River, which forms a natural border with Myanmar in the Cox\u2019s Bazar region of Bangladesh. \nThe sinking came about a week after another boat capsized in the estuary on the river, which has become a graveyard for dozens of Muslim refugees. \nFood, Aid Restricted \nRefugees who survived the perilous journey said they were driven out by hunger because food markets in Myanmar\u2019s western Rakhine State have been shut and aid deliveries restricted. They also reported attacks by the military and Rakhine Buddhist mobs. \nThe influx will worsen the unprecedented humanitarian emergency unfolding in Cox\u2019s Bazar, where aid workers are battling to provide refugees with food, clean water and shelter. \nOn Monday, the Red Cross opened a field hospital as big as two football fields, with 60 beds, three wards, an operating theatre, a delivery suite with maternity ward and a psychosocial support unit. \nHundreds of thousands of self-identifying Rohingya had already been in Bangladesh after fleeing previous spasms of violence in Myanmar, where they have long been denied citizenship and faced curbs on their movements and access to basic services. \nThe United States and the European Union are considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar\u2019s military leaders, officials have told Reuters. \nEU foreign ministers will discuss Myanmar on Monday, and their draft joint statement said the bloc \u201cwill suspend invitations to the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar/Burma armed forces and other senior military officers.\u201d \nThe powerful army chief, Min Aung Hlaing, told the United States ambassador in Myanmar last week that the exodus of Rohingya, whom he called non-native \u201cBengalis,\u201d was exaggerated. \nBut despite Myanmar\u2019s denials and assurances that aid was on its way to the north of violence-torn Rakhine State, thousands more starving people were desperate to leave. \n\u201cWe fled from our home because we had nothing to eat in my village,\u201d said Jarhni Ahlong, a 28-year-old Rohingya man from the southern region of Buthidaung, who had been stranded on the Myanmar side of the Naf for a week, waiting to cross. \nFrom the thousands gathered there awaiting an opportunity to escape, about 400 paid roughly US$50 each to flee on nine or 10 boats on Monday morning, he added. \n\u201cI think if we go to Bangladesh we can get food,\u201d he said Topics: Myanmar Army, Rakhine State,

Body guards make way for Daw Aung San Suu Kyi amid her admirers to attend a meeting at Yangon University in 2016. / The Irrawaddy 3.4k By Htet Naing Zaw 16 October 2017 \nNAYPYITAW \u2014 The military leadership has warned State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi over her security arrangements and she has replied that she would take extra caution. \n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, the military has constantly warned about her security, and she has replied to the military that she would exercise caution,\u201d U Khin Maung Win, the chairman of the Lower House Judicial and Legal Affairs Committee told The Irrawaddy. \nOn Sunday evening, Phyo Ko Ko Tint San, ACE Company chairman and the son of sports minister under U Thein Sein\u2019s administration U Tint San, and two ACE employees were detained before boarding a Yangon-bound Myanmar National Airline flight for illegal possession of firearms and illicit drugs , leading to public concerns about the security of the country\u2019s political leaders. \nPolice found 12 WY tablets, 1.5 grams of methamphetamine, two pistols and 72 bullets in U Phyo Ko Ko Tint San\u2019s backpack, according to the Ministry of Home Affairs. \nAnother five pistols and 804 bullets were found in U Phyo Ko Ko Tin San\u2019s room at Naypyitaw\u2019s ACE Hotel, and nine more pistols and 892 bullets were found in the room of one of the ACE staff members on Sunday evening. \n\u201cTatmadaw also has the things [security apparatus] that we have. They have warned about her security. And Daw Suu also agrees to take caution with her movements,\u201d said U Khin Maung Win, who is also a lawmaker representing Yangon\u2019s Lanmadaw Township. \nU Zaw Htay, the spokesperson of the government and closest government official of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said that security has been increasingly tightened for her since 2016 after her name appeared on a hit list sent by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militant group to police in Malaysia. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve arranged considerable security for her since that time. I can\u2019t tell you certain things, but there are also undercover officers,\u201d he told The Irrawaddy. \nPolice Colonel Zaw Khin Aung, the chief of Naypyitaw Police Force, believes that the seizure of firearms is not directly related to security of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. \n\u201cThere is nothing to worry about. We take full responsibility for her safety,\u201d he told the reporters in Naypyitaw on Monday. \nUpper House MP U Thein Swe, who has served as a security officer for Daw Aung San Suu Kyi for many years, is worried about her safety because the State Counselor cares about work much more than her safety. \n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about her safety because of the arms seizure. So, I want concerned authorities to give greater attention to her security. And I also want to urge them to take harsh legal actions against keeping arms without security duty. Only then, the security of the country will be safe,\u201d said U Thein Swe. \nThough Daw Aung San Suu Kyi uses bullet-proof cars provided by the government when she goes outside on official duty, she only uses her own private car in other times, said U Thein Swe, suggesting that she should take caution all the time. \n\u201cWhatever reason she goes outside for public duty, she is the most important person of the country. There should be full security since she is the leader of the country. There should be 24-hour security for her, and she should accept it,\u201d said U Thein Swe. \n\u201cThe number of arms was not that large as in the previous cases of Aye Ne Win and Kyaw Ne Win,\u201d said U Khin Maung Win, referring to the case in 2002 when the grandsons of military dictator General Ne Win were arrested for allegedly plotting a coup. \n\u201cIt is fair to say that [Phyo Ko Ko Tint San] has intentionally stockpiled firearms. I don\u2019t mean he would assassinate a certain person.

Meanwhile, about 30,000 Arakanese and Hindus were internally displaced by militant violence. \nThe World Bank stated it would continue \u201chigh-impact projects that support education, health services, electricity, rural roads and inclusion of all ethnic groups and religions, particularly in Rakhine state.\u201d \n\u201cWe also assessed the conditions of our recently approved development policy loan and concluded that further progress is needed for the loan to be made effective,\u201d the statement added. \nThe loan is one of the 13 projects funded by the World Bank in Myanmar and was signed between the bank and the Myanmar government in August as direct financial support to the government\u2019s union budget to help address the macroeconomic stability and fiscal resilience. \nThe loan comes from the World Bank\u2019s fund for low-income countries, International Development Association (IDA). The loan includes a repayment period of 38 years, with a grace period of six years and a zero interest rate, according to the bank.

It\u2019s not,\u201d Federica Maurizio, a sexual health and reproductive rights expert at UNFPA in Bangkok, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \n\u201cMaternal health \u2026 is one of the key indicators that really tells you how much the health system in a country is able to provide for the people.\u201d \nOona Campbell, professor of epidemiology and reproductive health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it raises wider issues of women\u2019s place in society. \n\u201cDo we care about women? Do we think it\u2019s not a problem if the wife dies? Is this something we care about enough to deliver services that are good quality?\u201d she said. \nToo Good to be True? \nCampbell said it was not entirely accurate to chart a country\u2019s progress using a global goal. \nAnother way to measure progress, she suggested, was to use country level targets, such as aiming to reduce maternal deaths by at least two-thirds from 2010, and for no country to have an MMR greater than 140 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030. \nCampbell also cautioned that data is weak in many countries due to a lack of civil registration and poor cause-of-death records. \nThis could mean calculations of Afghanistan\u2019s dramatic improvement, hailed as one of the gains of foreign aid there, may be an overestimate, said Campbell. \nUN figures showed the maternal mortality rate had dropped to 396 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2015 from 1,600 deaths in 2002 after the US-led invasion that ousted the Taliban after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. \nBut Afghanistan\u2019s own data put its MMR three times higher. \nMateen Shaheen, UNFPA\u2019s deputy representative in the country, said women\u2019s access to healthcare in Afghanistan remained tricky as culture dictates that women are only seen by female healthcare workers. UNFPA operates 124 clinics staffed by women and aims to nearly double that by the late 2018. \nMeanwhile, the maternal mortality rate has been almost flat in the past 25 years in the Philippines, a wealthier nation than Afghanistan. In 2015, there was 114 deaths for every 100,000 births with 2,700 women dying in childbirth despite an increase in skilled birth attendants and access to anti-natal care. \nA law was passed in 2012 insuring access to contraception, sexual education and maternal care but it has been mired in legal challenges, said Klaus Beck, UNFPA country director in the Philippines. \nThe Philippines is the only Southeast Asian country where teenage pregnancies are not falling which Beck said could also impact maternal mortality with the risk for mothers under the age of 15 in low- and middle income countries double that for older women. \n\u201cThe absence of a legal framework \u2026 to provide access to family planning, particularly for the poorest, has always been a stumbling block for many, many years,\u201d in the disaster- and conflict-prone archipelago, said Beck.

The EU may consider additional measures if the situation does not improve but also stands \u201cready to respond accordingly to positive developments,\u201d according to the statement. \nTensions in Rakhine reached a tipping point when Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) attacked police stations and an army base on Aug. 25 in what it called a move to obtain rights for self-identifying Rohingya. \nThousands of Arakanese were internally displaced by the militant violence and an ensuing army crackdown forced about 534,000 self-identifying Rohingya to flee for Bangladesh. \nThe European Council follows the British government\u2019s suspension last month of its training program with the Myanmar Army in light of the army\u2019s security operations in Rakhine State, which have been dogged by allegations of human rights abuses against the self-identifying Rohingya. \nThe EU Council called on all sides to bring an immediate end to the violence and urged the Myanmar Army to end its operations and ensure the protection of all civilians without discrimination. \nThe council said it would support the Myanmar government in order to ensure the \u201cswift and full\u201d recommendations of former UN chief Kofi Annan\u2019s commission on the state, including the \u201ccrucial issue of citizenship for the stateless Rohingya population.\u201d \nThe council added the EU would continue its work helping the government address the challenges of its democratic transition. \n\u201cWhen so many people are displaced so quickly this strongly indicates a deliberate action to expel a minority. Therefore it is of utmost importance that refugees can return in safety and dignity,\u201d it stated. \nIt reiterated its call on the government to defuse tensions between communities and grant full, safe and unconditional humanitarian access without delay, including for UN, ICRC, and international NGOs. \nThe council also urged the government to cooperate with the Human Rights Council\u2019s independent international Fact-Finding Mission and to allow it full access to the country without delay. \nThe EU Council\u2019s adopted conclusions also called the government to restore humanitarian access to all communities affected by conflicts in Kachin and Shan states, including to 100,000 internally displaced people.

President U Htin Kyaw submitted a letter to Parliament late last month urging lawmakers to change it to 1 October through to 30 September starting from the 2018-19 financial year. \nFiscal years vary in different countries\u2014156 countries follow the calendar year while 12 countries including the United States, Laos and Thailand use the October-September period. Myanmar has been practicing the April-March fiscal year since 1974. \nOn Tuesday, the first day of Parliament after more than a month-long break, the deputy minister U Maung Maung Win for the planning and finance ministry took the floor, saying that the possible redetermination was based on the nature of slow, local infrastructure businesses and a long New Year holiday in the early period of the current fiscal year. \n\u201cThe construction industry doesn\u2019t have much business during monsoon while there is effective operation and no long holidays starting from October,\u201d U Maung Maung Win said, endorsing the proposal at Parliament. He added that changing it would balance the accounting process for businesses and institutions. \nThe determination of the fiscal year is mainly based on a country\u2019s economic mission, monetary and financial policies, he said. \nThe issue was brought into parliamentary discussion late last year by a lawmaker and was later discussed during the meeting of the union financial commission held in July. \nBased on consultation with union ministries and state-level institutions, the decision to change the fiscal year was made by cabinet members in September, U Maung Maung Win explained. \nUnion lawmakers will discuss the presidential proposal later this week.

Among the nine other detainees are Ko Thiha, the driver of U Phyo Ko Ko Tint San, ACE general manager U Joseph, and five ACE employees living in Dekkhinathiri Township, according to the home affairs ministry. \nOn Tuesday morning, police searched the house of U Phyo Ko Ko Tint San in Bahan Township\u2019s Golden Valley in Yangon, and seized eight firearms, three bullets, a camouflage jacket bearing his name and the Myanmar national emblem, one long-sleeved black shirt with the Myanmar national emblem and skull and crossed bones emblem, two sniper scopes, a military green compass, a walkie-talkie, a gun sight, and two bullet-proof jackets. \nIn addition, a magazine bag, two hand bags, a walkie-talkie bag, two WY tablets, a bag with what is believed to be methamphetamine residue and drugs paraphernalia. \nBahan Township police have also opened a case. \n\u201cSo far we\u2019ve arrested nine both in Yangon and Naypyitaw.

And such a permit is normally given to retired military officers under certain conditions, but not to civilians. And that permit has to be approved by the home affairs minister,\u201d he said. \nAccording to the retired police officer, the government at present only allows security service providers which hire and train retired service personnel of the military and police as security guards for companies, hotels and so on. But it has not permitted security companies with armed security services.

He had asked his wife for money in order to buy alcohol, the request escalating into an argument and the attacks. He was later arrested and confessed to the murders. \nUpper House Lawmaker Naw Susana Hla Hla Soe, who is also a secretary of the parliamentary Women and Children\u2019s Rights Committee, cited the quadruple murder as an instance of the increasing violence against women. \nOffenders are not deterred from committing violence against women\u2014even murder, she said, adding that the rule of law is essential in preventing such cases. \nThe final version of the bill has been finished, according to women\u2019s right activists who helped draft the legislation. They told The Irrawaddy the draft bill would be submitted during the current parliamentary session. \nThe bill will better protect women from all forms of violence, including domestic violence, marital rape, sexual violence, harassment and assault in the workplace and public place, they said. \nHla Hla Yee, co-founder and director of Legal Clinic Myanmar, which provides mostly women and children with free legal aid, said when the bill is enacted, survivors of violence will receive more effective legal and healthcare support. \nThe draft bill carries a life sentence for rape of girls under the age of 18 and disabled women. Those found guilty of marital rape face two to five years in jail. The bill also includes harsher punishments for hurting girls and women. \nThe Women and Children\u2019s Rights Committee secretary Naw Susana Hla Hla Soe said the committee has been working on the implementation of the National Strategic Plan for the Advancement of Women (2013-2022) in addition to the new law. \nWorking committees to implement the action plan were formed soon after lawmakers returned from presenting the government\u2019s report on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) to the United Nations last year.

He is the most senior UN official to visit Myanmar to render long- and short-term assistance for the government\u2019s endeavors on the recent Rakhine issue. \nCurrently, most international relief agencies, including the UN, have been banned from northern Rakhine State as the government accused them of providing assistance to Muslim militants involved in the Aug 25 attacks. \nWith respect to the feelings of Arakanese Buddhists about humanitarian aid, the senior general said, the UN needed to change the view that assistance provided by INGOs was intended only for self-identifying Rohingya. \n\u201c[The perception that aid was handed out unfairly] was regarded as an act of bullying with the help of foreign organizations, including the UN, at a time when the majority Bengalis killed the minority ethnics. The UN needed to carry out the delivery of assistance fairly and equally,\u201d he said.

Constitutional Change to Alleviate Rakhine Crisis Karen National Union chairman GenSaw Mutu Say Poe shakes hand with Tatmadaw chief Sen Gen Min Aung Hlaing on Monday, Oct. 16 in Naypyitaw. / Karen National Union HQ Facebook 2.6k By Nyein Nyein 17 October 2017 \nCHIANG MAI, Thailand \u2014The Karen National Union (KNU) has appealed for the government and military to find \u201cpolitically dignified\u201d and \u201cnonviolent ways\u201d to alleviate the current Rakhine State crisis. \nAbout 536,000 self-identifying Rohingya Muslims have fled Rakhine for Bangladesh since Aug. 25 Muslim militant attacks on police stations and an army base intensified clearance operations plagued by accusations of indiscriminate killing, rape and arson. \nThe KNU had fought with the Tatmadaw for more than six decades starting in 1949 until the ethnic armed group signed a bilateral ceasefire with the quasi-civilian government in 2012 and then became one of eight signatories to the nationwide ceasefire agreement (NCA) in 2015. \nPadoh Saw Ta Doh Moo, general secretary of the KNU, told The Irrawaddy on Tuesday the KNU is concerned about the welfare of civilians affected by the violence, as ethnic Karen endured similar military operations in 1979-80 and 1998-99 that led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of the Karen population of southeast Myanmar. \nA KNU statement released on the second anniversary of the NCA on Sunday read that the government and Tatmadaw\u2019s handling of the Rakhine crisis \u201cbring the memory of what the KNU and the Karen people have experienced under the state\u2019s four-cut policy through various forms of aggressive military operations that caused over 200,000 Karen people to become internally displaced persons (IDPs) and over 150,000 to become refugees.\u201d \nThe statement acknowledged \u201cefforts to achieve peace are being made,\u201d but \u201cregrets to witness the repeat of the history from the past 20-30 years.\u201d It called for nonviolent solutions to the crisis and stated worries that the peace process will be derailed. \n\u201cAs a peace partner, we raise our concerns to change those situations,\u201d Padoh Saw Ta Doh Moo told The Irrawaddy. \n\u201cFor disputes and problems between our nationalities, we could find the solutions through negotiations based on our national reconciliation concept, but the Rakhine crisis is related to international and religious beliefs. Such pressure is an added burden to Myanmar and affects the peace process,\u201d he said. \nSelf-identifying Rohingya Muslims are not considered indigenous people of Myanmar by most in the country and widely referred to as \u201cBengalis.\u201d \nDaw Aung San Suu Kyi launched the Union Enterprise for Humanitarian Assistance, Resettlement and Development in Rakhine last week to tackle the humanitarian crisis. The enterprise will focus on repatriating and providing aid for those who fled to Bangladesh, according to the government. \nBut the predicament of other mass repatriation efforts paints a gloomy picture for Rakhine. Displaced Karen in the southeast, Shan in the east, and Kachin in the north are yet to be repatriated. \n\u201cWe have not yet been able to start the repatriations of Karen refugees who became displaced in the last two or three decades,\u201d said Padoh Saw Ta Doh Moo. \u201cAt that time, many innocent civilians faced many troubles.\u201d \nNearly 100,000 refugees live in nine camps along the Thailand-Myanmar border, the majority of them Karen, according to a 2016 The Border Consortium (TBC) report. \nPadoh Saw Ta Doh Moo said Rakhine\u2019s deep-rooted problems \u201cshould have been tackled carefully and systematically by the governments although they [Muslims in Rakhine] may not be the ethnic nationalities, but the remains of the negative legacy of colonial Burma [Myanmar] in northern Rakhine.\u201d \nBecause of the lack of solutions, he said, the problems have expanded and weighed on Myanmar\u2019s existing social issues. \nThe KNU statement urged for a constitutional change to \u201ccreate a society for peaceful coexistence\u201d and to address the \u201cremaining negative legacy of colonialism\u201d in Myanmar. The negative legacy, said Padoh Saw Ta Doh Moo, was problems arising from Muslim laborers brought into Myanmar from the then Indian colony. \n\u201cIn order for a check and balance system to emerge, we need to change the 2008 Constitution, as the [military-backed] Constitution is different from democratic principles, and now the government and the Tatmadaw have to negotiate for the power,\u201d he said. \nThe KNU statement reiterated its commitment to achieve peace through solving the problems by way of political means. \nThe NCA signatories\u2019 peace process steering team led by KNU chairman Gen Saw Mutu Say Poe met separately with the State Counselor and the Tatmadaw chief Snr Gen Min Aung Hlaing on Monday afternoon to discuss the effective implementation of the NCA. \nThe State Counselor agreed to a joint review of the NCA and further collaboration in order to hold union peace conferences, said KNU vice chairman Padoh Saw Kwe Htoo Win, who was present at the meetings. \nLeaders of the NCA signatories were in Naypyitaw for two days, as they joined the NCA two-year commemoration. \nOn Monday morning, Gen Saw Mutu Say Poe and Gen Yawd Serk, chairman of the Restoration Council of Shan State, also separately met the former president U Thein Sein for social greetings, according to the spokespersons of both groups.

Secretary Accused of Corruption People protest in front of Arakan National Party headquarters in Rakhine State capital Sittwe on Tuesday. / Min Aung Khaing / The Irrawaddy 1.8k By Moe Myint 17 October 2017 \nYANGON \u2013 After the Arakan National Party (ANP)\u2019s central executive committee dismissed township-level secretary Aung Than Wai last week, several hundred Sittwe residents, unhappy with the decision, protested against the party steering committee on Tuesday afternoon. \nDuring a two-day meeting the previous week, 21 CEC members discussed the situation in Rakhine State, future development of the state, and the punishment of party officials accused of misconduct. \nKhine Pyay Soe, chair of the party\u2019s disciplinary committee, told The Irrawaddy over the phone on Monday that CEC members voted to dismiss Aung Than Wai. \nTwelve members voted for dismissal, seven members elected for Aung Than Wai to be removed from the position but to remain a party member, and some attendees such as Dr. Aye Maung, abstained from voting, he said. \nANP insiders told The Irrawaddy that after coordinated attacks against three border police outposts in Maungdaw district by Muslim militants on Oct. 9 and ensuing government security operations\u2014resulting in thousands of internally displaced persons (IDPs)\u2014the ANP in Sittwe led by Aung Than Wai organized a fundraising campaign for Arakanese IDPs which received at least 10 million kyats. \nAung Than Wai allegedly embezzled eight million kyats instead of contributing the money to IDPs. The party steering committee received complaint letters from the ground. The party\u2019s top leaders established an investigation committee in order to examine the misconduct of ANP\u2019s secretary in Sittwe. \nKhine Pyay Soe confirmed the dispute and explained the party faced internal division over Aung Than Wai\u2019s alleged corruption. \n\u201cHe took eight million for his personal matter instead of donating to IDPs. But malpractice member Aung Than Wai refused to accept the investigation,\u201d he said. \nKhine Pyay Soe recalled that Aung Than Wia also misused party funds from ANP lawmakers without informing a 25-member township level committee. \nAung Than Wai also discretely removed township level committee members who were elected at the party conference. \nThe Irrawaddy phoned another meeting attendee, ANP Union parliament lawmaker U Ba Shein, who said the steering committee expelled the township-level secretary for breaching the party\u2019s rules and regulations and declining to consider internal friction as well financial abuses within party. \n\u201cLower level party members must obey the decisions of the central committee whether they like it or not\u201d, he said. \nSittwe resident Aung Ko Moe who requested peaceful assembly permission from authorities and was granted to march on Tuesday afternoon, accused secretary Tun Aung Kyaw and disciplinary committee chair Khine Pyay Soe of trying to separate the party and called for their dismissal in a Facebook post. \nThe post featured protest slogans such as: \u201cWe don\u2019t accept the separatist agenda against the ANP\u201d and \u201cThe disintegrators of the ANP is our enemy.\u201d \nOrganizer Aung Ko Moe uploaded an apology letter from Sittwe ANP\u2019s chairman Aye Thein for insulting Aung Than Wai in early 2017 regarding financial abuses. The document mentioned the party\u2019s financial report but did not mention the IDP fund. \nAccording to the document, Aye Thein testified that his party had already received the township-level financial report when he erroneously insulted Aung Than Wai in 2016. \nAung Than Wai filed the case against Aye Thein under Myanmar\u2019s notorious telecommunication law Article 66(d). \nThe case avoided going to court after Aye Thein sent the apology letter, resigned from the CEC and ANP Sittwe and Aung Than Wai withdrew case, according to an ANP committee member who asked for anonymity. \nAung Than Wai and secretary Tun Aung Kyaw could not be reached by The Irrawaddy.

(The Irrawaddy) 1.4k By Nan Lwin Hnin Pwint 18 October 2017 \nAn ethnic Kachin woman in faded clothes, carrying a small baby, entered the compound of the Myanmar Army Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) 319 in Kachin State\u2019s Mansi Township. \nShe came to attend a military court hearing and to seek justice for her late husband who was killed before she gave birth to their last child, who is now three months old. \nIn 2014, Magyi Khon Nang fled clashes between the Tatmadaw and Kachin Independence Army (KIA) along with her husband Labya Naw Hkum from their village Kaung Kha in Mansi Township, to a camp for displaced persons in Mai Hkaung Village. \nOn May 25 this year, Labya Naw Hkum left home to work as a day laborer as usual. But he never came back. He was one of three displaced civilians arrested, killed and buried in the jungle by a column of LIB 319 soldiers on their way home. \nSix soldiers are thought to be responsible for the killings. Magyi Khon Nang was at LIB 319, at the company\u2019s invitation, to attend the trial at a military court for the case. \n\u201cI want justice. To recompense for my loss and sorrow, I wish [the soldiers responsible] to be handed life imprisonment,\u201d said Magyi Khon Nang as she went red in the face. \nSoothing the whimpering baby in her hands the mother of three said: \u201cI was eight months pregnant when her father died. I had difficulties to go to the hospital and had to give birth at my home,\u201d she said. \n\u201cThat day, [my husband] said he would do some casual jobs. I remember that he was wearing a shirt with a \u2018peace\u2019 logo given by the camp, and carrying a bag made from a rice bag given by the World Food Program (WFP). He told the children that he would find money and come back home in the evening,\u201d she recounted. \n\u201cMy three kids don\u2019t have anyone to call \u2018Dad\u2019 as their Dad is dead now,\u201d she said, wiping away the tears. \nLabya Naw Hkum, 27, together with friends Nhkum Gam Aung, 31 and Maram Brang Seng, 22 went to work as day laborers to carry logs at Hkapra Yang, some five miles from the camp in Mai Hkaung Village. \nOn their way back home, they were killed and buried in the jungle, some four miles from Mai Hkaung Village by a column of LIB 319 soldiers on patrol. \nLaphai Nan Ban, mother of Maran Brang Seng, said: \u201cHe got the job to carry logs. Sometimes he got 5,000 kyats a day, and sometimes 10,000 kyats. He gave the money to us, which we used on food and healthcare.\u201d \nWFP has been providing foods to displaced persons\u2019 camps in Kachin State for years, but since the end of 2016, it has reduced food rations. \nIn Mai Hkaung Camp where Laphai Nan Ban and Magyi Khon Nang are sheltering, a person only gets some 10 kilograms of rice, oil and 2,500 kyats (less than US$2) for a whole month, which has forced the men to do casual jobs to cover household expenses. \nMaram Roi Ja, wife of Nhkum Gam Aung, said: \u201cHe was the only breadwinner in my family. Now I am the one left to support our family. I am very depressed. I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d \nBoth Maran Brang Seng and Nhkum Gam Aung are survived by their two-year-old children. \n\u201cWitnesses told us that a military column arrested and killed our husbands. Then we looked for their bodies together with community elders. We found them on May 28,\u201d said Wahgyi Seng Mai, wife of Maram Brang Seng. \n\u201cMy son\u2019s body was carried on a truck to the cemetery in the evening [after it was uncovered]. I was so sad and I didn\u2019t care about the rotten smell or the feeling of nausea. Others were covering their noses with their hands and tried to move away, but I didn\u2019t want to,\u201d said Maran Brang Seng\u2019s mother Laphai Nan Ban. \n\u201cI wanted to go near him and hug him but they did not allow me to go near him. I could see him clearly. His face was decomposing and some parts of it were torn apart.\u201d Laphai Nan Ban, mother of Maran Brang Seng. (The Irrawaddy) \nHer son was the only breadwinner in her five-member family, and she had no idea what to do to survive, she said. \nCamp organizers and community elders then sent the bodies to Mansi Hospital and filed a complaint with Mansi Township police station along with autopsy results. \nAccording to autopsy results, the three had sustained gunshots, knife wounds, skull fractures, and bursting eyes. \nOn May 30, the Office of the Commander-in-Chief released a statement that an investigation would be carried out into their deaths. The LIB also made an internal investigation. \nSix soldiers, including a battalion commander and three captains, have been charged with the murder. \nThree captains, a lance corporal and a private are charged with several provisions of the military act equivalent to the charges of murder, aiding and abetting, and ordering murder in the Penal Code. \nThe commander is charged with murder and making a false report. \nThe military court heard testimony from camp organizers of Mai Hkaung, the village administrator of Mai Hkaung village and police of Mansi Township before hearing from the soldiers. \nLIB 319 on Sept. 15 invited the families of victims, Kachin civil society organizations and reporters to attend the court hearing. The Irrawaddy attended on Sept. 18. \nThree colonels were acting as judges at the military court, and the accused soldiers took oath that they would testify the truth. \nAccording to their testimony, they met and arrested La Nan who was carrying illicit drugs and around 4 million kyats with him before they encountered three civilians who they also arrested. \nOne of the captains later released La Nan for fear that seeing a drug pusher together with their column would give rise to misunderstanding. The private was ordered to guard the three arrested civilians. One of them died due to unintentional discharge, according to the testimony. \nLa Nan informed the victims\u2019 families about their arrest after he was released, otherwise their bodies could not have been retrieved, said Laphai Nan Ban. \n\u201cBecause of La Nan, we came to know that my son was killed by soldiers. Otherwise, there won\u2019t be any evidence and we\u2019d not have known where they were buried,\u201d she said. \nLa Nan did not appear at the court for testimony, however, since no one knows where he lives. \nCaptains testified that they informed the death of a civilian to the commander by phone, and the commander implied killing all three of them because the area is supposed to be a prohibited area for civilians. \n\u201cIt is no man\u2019s land, no man\u2019s land area. Kill all three. If you are clever enough, you can even shift the blame,\u201d the commander was quoted as saying by the captains. \nThe commander instructed them to bury the bodies carefully in order to avoid people discovering them, testified the captains. And the commander also falsely reported to the senior officers that the three were accidentally shot as they attempted to grab the guns. Family members of Maran Brang Seng. (The Irrawaddy) \nThe military court heard the case in one day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. except for lunch and short breaks. During the lunch break, some soldiers were babysitting the baby girl of Magyi Khon Nang. \nA military officer of LIB 319 told The Irrawaddy: \u201cThey [soldiers] have got their salaries cut since the trial begun.\u201d This was the first time officials of Kachin Baptist Convention (KBC), which is helping displaced persons in Kachin State, local Kachin civil society organizations (CSOs) and media were allowed to attend a military trial over the deaths of Kachin civilians since renewed clashes broke out in Kachin State over six years ago. \nVictims\u2019 families and Kachin CSOs, however, doubt if fitting penalties will be imposed on the perpetrators. \n\u201cSo far we\u2019re satisfied with the court hearing. But we\u2019ll have to wait and see what the final verdict will be,\u201d said La Ja of KBC. \nOfficials of LIB 319 have reported the testimonies to the upper level, and are waiting for the verdict. \n\u201cIf soldiers are sentenced to less than one year in prison, they will be kept in a cell at the military camp. If they are sentenced to more than one year, they will be sent to a civilian prison, in this case Bhamo Prison,\u201d said a military officer. \nService personnel\u2014either the rank and file or officers\u2014automatically become civilians if they are jailed more than one year, he said. \nThe widows of the three slain civilians said they feel like their life is now hopeless, having to assume the responsibility to raise their children alone. \n\u201cIf they are to be punished, they deserve it because they killed our husbands. But, for me and my children, we\u2019ve lost our whole life. We can get nothing back,\u201d said Magyi Khon Nang.

By Zarni Mann 19 October 2017 \nMANDALAY \u2014 Five freelance miners were shot dead and at least 20 injured when security forces opened fire on them for scavenging for jade scraps on Wednesday evening in the Lone Kin mining area of Kachin State. \nAccording to witnesses, police tried to stop a couple of prospectors who were searching for residues of jade at the operation of Myanmar-China joint venture Triple One Company in the Ngopin Phawar jade mining area of Sankhar village. \nA witness who did not want to be named out of fear for their safety said a prospector complained of being injured by a stone thrown by police. \n\u201cAngry prospectors gathered later and confronted the police,\u201d said the witness. \nA group of prospectors then attacked the police, who were providing security for the mining company, and destroyed a piece of heavy machinery, according to first-hand accounts. \n\u201cThe prospectors and the police threw stones at each other. Both sides were hurt and later the police opened fire, killing five prospectors on the spot,\u201d said the witness, adding that out of the injured, nine were in a serious condition. Two policemen, one of them a colonel, were also injured, said witnesses. \nThe police station in Lone Kin said the incident is under investigation and declined to comment further. \nLocal lawmakers told The Irrawaddy those who sustained serious injuries were sent to Myitkyina Hospital in the Kachin capital while others were sent to Lone Kin Hospital for treatment. \n\u201cThe prospectors are allowed to work under a time limit in certain areas. We heard the prospectors went before the opening time and clashed with the police there,\u201d said U Lashi Daseng, MP of Hpakant. \nThe lawmaker said the situation in the area is under control and calm. \nIn Lone Kin and Hpakant jade mining areas, clashes between freelance miners, jade mining firms and security forces are not uncommon, as the firms do not want the prospectors to work in their areas. \nLocal administration offices have mediated negotiations between the prospectors and firms in order to allow prospectors restricted access to the areas.

We decided not to stage the protest because we were not allowed to hold those placards,\u201d Ma Yi Yi Htwe, a protest leader told The Irrawaddy. Police put barriers to stop protestors. (Photo: Nyan Hline) \nThe placards reflect the voices of farmers and people and protestors decided not to stage a protest without those placards, she said. \nThe regional government said that over 350 acres of land in what is now the Dawei Urban Development Project area were confiscated for government ownership since 1990, but farmers said they paid to farm the land until 2011. \nThe U Thein Sein government leased out the land to private companies to build government buildings, residential apartments and shopping centers in an urban development project, leading to clashes between the authorities, company employees and local farmers. \nThe Tanintharyi regional government said in a statement on Sept. 17, 2017 that 40 by 60 foot plots of land in other locations have been recompensed to 63 of 70 farmers whose farmlands are in the urban development project area. \nThe statement also said the regional government would recompense land plots for the seven remaining farmers. However, the farmers have refused to accept land compensation, and called for talks with the government and private companies. \nThe government of the National League for Democracy (NLD) continued leasing out farmlands to private businesspeople though local farmers hoped that it would return those lands instead, said Ma Yi Yi Htwe. \n\u201cChief minister Dr. Lei Lei Maw, and the agricultural and municipal ministers are mainly responsible for this. So, we planned to stage a demonstration to call for their resignation,\u201d said Ma Yi Yi Htwe. \nDawei Public Development Co has won most of the contracts for property development on the controversial lands and has been building residences for ministers, apartments for parliament staff, and residential buildings. About 20 farmers have been sued in clashes with company employees since construction started, according to Ma Yi Yi Htwe. \nThe Irrawaddy was not able to contact concerned police officers, lawmakers and the speaker of the regional parliament for their remarks.

Kaung Htike of the G-4 military training aircraft. / Kaung Htike / Facebook 1.1k By Salai Thant Zin 19 October 2017 \nPATHEIN, Irrawaddy Region \u2014 The wreckage of a Myanmar Air Force training jet that went missing more than one month ago was found on Wednesday evening, some 12 miles south of Gwa Township in Rakhine State. \nThe G-4 military training aircraft flown by two pilots disappeared during a training exercise over Pathein, Gwa, Hinthada, and back to Pathein, the capital of Irrawaddy Region, on Sept. 5. The plane lost contact about 36 miles northwest of Pathein. \nA senior military officer who joined the search for the aircraft confirmed on the condition of anonymity to The Irrawaddy that the wreckage was recovered on Wednesday evening. \nHe said more troops would be brought on the area on Thursday to continue the search. \nGround troops carried out the search for the missing aircraft, with help from the air force\u2019s aircraft and helicopters. \nOn Wednesday\u2014the 44th day of the search and rescue mission\u2014troops found the plane\u2019s nose cone, one wheel, two wings, and machine parts, according to a statement from the Office of the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services. The statement also said \u201cseat\u201d and \u201cparachute\u201d were recovered but did not clarify whether it was one or two. \nThe search continues for pilot Maj. Kaung Htike and co-pilot Capt. Thaw Zin Soe along with the rest of the wreckage. An investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing. \nThe incident came two months after a Chinese-made Y-8-200F Myanmar military transport plane crashed into the Andaman Sea on route to Yangon, killing all 122 soldiers, family members and crew on board. State media in July said the plane nosedived into the sea because of bad weather. \nTranslated from Burmese by Thet Ko Ko.

Many risk their own and other lives by practicing stunts and racing on city roads. \n\u201cFrom this competition, we would like to show how these off-road motorcycles are used. We are also hoping to open the racing opportunities for the sport enthusiasts and to have racing circuits in the future, too,\u201d said Ko Aung Win Tun. \nThe competition is exclusively for Myanmar riders. However, riders from five enduro clubs from China, Thailand and Indonesia will ride with the Myanmar competitors as honorary guests. \nAccording to the organizers, the competition has no restrictions on the type or brand of motorcycle used. There will be two types of race groups split by engine power: 125-230CC and 231-650CC. \n\u201cThere will be a challenge race at the base camp, on that day, just for the amateur riders, just for fun. Anyone who is interested can participate in this walk-in competition. We have no limitations on the motorcycles for that race,\u201d he added. \nA photography competition for photographers across the country will run along with the enduro competition. \nThe distribution of competition entry forms will begin this weekend at motorbike stores in Mandalay. Organizers are hoping dozens of riders will enter.

Analysis: Still Hope Kofi Annan Recommendations will Bring Stability to Rakhine Kofi Annan, center, at a press conference to mark the Rakhine State Advisory commission\u2019s final report launch in Aug in Yangon. / Thet Htun Naing / The Irrawaddy 1.0k By The Irrawaddy 19 October 2017 \nYANGON \u2014 During his five-day trip to Myanmar, the United Nation\u2019s under-secretary-general for political affairs urged the government and military to comprehensively implement the recommendations from the Kofi Annan-led Advisory Commission on Rakhine State. \nUnder-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman is the highest UN official so far to urge the government and the country\u2019s powerful military to implement the recommendations. \nHis visit came days after ex-UN chief Kofi Annan\u2019s briefing to UN Security Council members in his capacity as chair of the advisory commission, which was mandated to make recommendations for improving the situation in the state on conflict prevention, humanitarian assistance, reconciliation, institution-building and development. \nHe said the recommendations of the advisory commission could still serve as a solid framework for achieving lasting peace in Rakhine before he highlighted some of the central issues the commission addressed in its recommendations. \nThe issues include poverty, citizenship verification, closing internally displaced people (IDP) camps, border security and enhancing inter-communal dialogue between Arakanese and Muslims. \n\u201cImplementation of our recommendations could help to stabilize the situation and address the humanitarian crisis,\u201d he told the council members on Friday. \nSoon after the release of the recommendations, Muslim militant group the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) attacked 30 police outposts and an army base in northern Rakhine. \nThe attacks triggered Myanmar Army clearance operations, which forced more than 536,000 self-identifying Rohingya Muslims to flee for Bangladesh, bringing with them reports of indiscriminate killing, rape and arson by security forces. \nTens of thousands of Arakanese have fled militant violence to other parts of the state, with the government denouncing ARSA as a terrorist group and saying it kills civilians. \nKofi Annan said at the press briefing of the Security Council meeting that everybody present agreed on the short-term requirements\u2014the cessation of violence, provision of humanitarian assistance to those in need, and work for the eventual voluntary return of those who in Bangladesh. \nBased on the discussion with Security Council members on Oct. 13, he said, the international community was prepared to engage with Myanmar, working on all the issues the commission has recommended in order to stabilize the situation. \n\u201cIf we don\u2019t, we are going to have a long term frustrating problem in the region which can be very serious down the line,\u201d he warned. \nDespite his encouragement to implement the recommendations, Kofi Annan acknowledged that it was difficult to get coherent and coordinated implementation of these recommendations because of the duality in the Myanmar leadership\u2014both government and military hold powerful positions. \n\u201cBut we need to press ahead to work with the both sides and make sure that as a government they work together,\u201d he said. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for Myanmar that [if] Rakhine is settled, that would give them time and space to focus on other major problems in the country at large because it can take lots of time and effort and resources,\u201d he added. \nThe Myanmar government has welcomed the recommendations and vowed to implement them in the shortest possible time frame, according to a statement from the State Counselor\u2019s Office shortly after the report\u2019s release. \nBut the ARSA offensive has delayed the implementations. Only on Sep. 12\u201418 days after the attacks\u2014was a ministerial committee formed for the recommendations\u2019 rapid implementations. \nSome pilot projects were under way earlier this week, such as resettlement for Rakhine and Muslims villagers whose houses were burnt down. At the same time, national verifications cards for the citizenship process are being issued to Muslims at Shwezar village tract in Rakhine\u2019s Maungdaw Township, according to local media reports.

We\u2019ll check CCTV records and publish the findings. But for the time being, we don\u2019t know the cause of the fire,\u201d he said. \nA fire broke out on the fifth floor of the hotel around 3 a.m. on Thursday morning, and a Chinese woman from Macao jumped from the 3rd floor of the hotel to escape the fire, causing hip injuries. \nFirefighter U Kyaw Swar Lin sustained a head injury after a wooden beam fell on him and broke apart his helmet. He was then rushed to Yangon People\u2019s Hospital and underwent an emergency operation. A fire at Kandawgyi Palace Hotel seen across Kandawgyi Lake in Central Yangon.

I was at the scene around 3.30 a.m. It was an intense blaze, then I heard blasts of something like gas cylinders and oil tanks,\u201d said a witness who lives at an apartment near the hotel. \nAccording to U Htay Lwin, the hotel has fire insurance with Myanma Insurance, and also has insurance for guests at a foreign insurance company. \nAt the time of the outbreak, 141 guests\u2014most of them foreigners\u2014were lodging at the hotel. Guests were transferred to the Chatrium Hotel and Rose Garden Hotel. \nThe fire damaged about 80 percent of the hotel, and the company is yet to calculate financial loss, said U Htay Lwin.

The oldest parts of the existing building were built during the era of British Burma and became the exclusive \u201cBoat Club\u201d in 1934, where it served as home to the European community in what was then known as Rangoon. \nThe place became the site of the Rangoon Rowing Club, a popular haunt with British officers and elite expatriates in the 1930s. During World War II, the two-story, red-brick building was used by the Japanese as a welfare department. In 1948, the property became the National Biological Museum and in 1979, the Ministry of Hotels and Tourism took over the site and converted it into a hotel, featuring 10 teak bungalows, which in 1993 were replaced by a larger lakeside building. \nThe building that was burnt down on Thursday morning was built in the design of golden-teak Thai architecture, as operators Baiyoke Group of Hotels hail from Bangkok, according to the Kandawgyi Palace Hotel. It has been operated by Htoo Group of Companies under his hospitality business until now. Firefighters fight a blaze at Kandawgyi Palace Hotel.

It has projects that include a minority interest in natural gas production and a pipeline, according to the company\u2019s website. \nAsked about Azzad\u2019s concerns, Chevron spokesman Melissa Ritchie said \u201cChevron conducts our business in a responsible manner, respecting the law and universal human rights to benefit the communities where we work, including Myanmar.\u201d \n\u201cIn our experience, peace, stability and the protection of human rights provide the best foundation for the economic development of a region and associated improvement in living conditions for communities,\u201d she said via e-mail, confirming that the company would speak to the investors. \nMore than 536,000 self-identifying Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar since Aug. 25, when coordinated Muslim insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response, with the fleeing people accusing security forces of arson, killings and rape. \nIn September the United Nations\u2019 top human rights official accused Myanmar of conducting a \u201ccruel military operation\u201d against self-identifying Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State, calling it \u201ca textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\u201d \nAzzad\u2019s Brockwell said his firm was \u201cgrowing increasingly concerned over the lack of a constructive response from Chevron\u201d on its requests since the letter was sent, in August. \nBrockwell said it might also file a shareholder resolution for Chevron\u2019s next annual meeting, similar to one Azzad and others filed for its 2017 meeting in May. That resolution called for a report evaluating whether Chevron should stop doing business with governments complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity. The resolution received support from 6 percent of shares voted. \nIn addition to Azzad, an Islamic finance firm, the other lead filer of the resolution was a Catholic religious order, the Ursuline Sisters of Tildonk. \nSimon Billenness, executive director of International Campaign for the Rohingya, a Washington, DC, advocacy group, said it planned to send similar letters to other companies doing business in Myanmar, signed by shareholders in those companies.

Khun Tan has, however, escaped, but we\u2019ve got five of his accomplices,\u201d Dr. Aye Zan told The Irrawaddy. \nKhun Tan, also known as Zat Lite, has reportedly fled to Hopong in Shan State\u2019s Taunggyi District, and the Mon State government is cooperating with the Shan State government to apprehend him, he added. \nAccording to Pa-O ethnic Ko Khun Aung Myo Thein, a resident of Mon State\u2019s Thaton, Khun Tan was born in Kone Tha village in Hopong Township and arrived in Thaton around 18 years ago when he was seven. \nLocal Pa-O people were led to believe that he was the reincarnation of Alantaya Sayadaw Ashin Sakka\u2014a Pa-O ethnic monk who was quite influential and respected among not only Pa-O people but also across the country. \n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, Khun Tan could not speak Burmese well. I believe he won\u2019t declare himself to be the reincarnation of Alantaya Sayadaw. But I don\u2019t know if there are people who are fabricating information,\u201d Ko Khun Aung Myo Thein told The Irrawaddy. \nKhun Tan allegedly convinced Pa-O parents living in the Alantaya religious area\u2014the area surrounding the monastery of Alantaya Sayadaw\u2014that their daughters would be blessed if they have sex with him after they reach puberty. \nAccording to Pa-O ethnic affairs minister of Mon State government Daw San Wint Khaing, such cases began in 2012, and Khun Tan has allegedly slept with hundreds of girls mostly aged around 15. \nKo Khun Aung Myo Thein explained that according to tradition of Pa-O people, persons who are destined to face ill fortune according to their horoscopes can avert it by nominally marrying a person who is believed to have good fortune. \n\u201cSo, there is such a tradition. But marrying is jut nominal and it doesn\u2019t include sex,\u201d he said. \nKo Khun Aung Myo Thein however objected to the term used by media \u201coffering of virginity\u201d to describe Khun Tan\u2019s alleged sex with young girls and said that he had no comment if or not Khun Tan has actually slept with them. \nDr. Aye Zan said his government has been shadowing Khun Tan for two months, and has a record of his offences, but could not take actions against him as no one filed a lawsuit. \n\u201cThe problem was that such a case needs to be filed by the girls. But girls didn\u2019t file a complaint, and it is difficult for us to intervene,\u201d said Dr. Aye Zan. \nHowever, on Oct. 2, a complaint was filed with the Mon State Parliament Women and Child Rights Protection Committee, saying that Khun Tan had seduced five girls, aged between 16 and 18, in Alantaya religious area and three surrounding villages to marry him. \n\u201cSince the locals are very poorly educated, they believed that he was the Buddha-to-be and offering virgin sex would bring [their daughters] good luck,\u201d ethnic affairs minister Daw San Wint Khaing told The Irrawaddy. \nAccording to her, Khun Tan either paid or threatened girls in Alantaya religious area to have sex with him. \nThaton District General Administration Department is interrogating the administrator of Zayit Chaung village for allegedly covering up two rape cases committed by Khun Tan, district commissioner U Teza Aung told The Irrawaddy. \nDaw Khaing Khaing Lei, chairperson of Mon State Parliament Women and Child Rights Protection Committee, and Pa-O ethnic affairs minister Daw San Wint Khaing have received messages of death threats on social media following the disclosure of the case. \nUnion minister for Religious Affairs and Culture U Aung Ko has told reporters in Naypyitaw that his ministry would definitely take action against Khun Tan.

Like it or not, it\u2019s the realpolitik of the country and no one can discard that reality. \nUnlike most countries in the world, the military here is unavoidably at the epicenter of the country\u2019s politics constitutionally, traditionally and historically. \nThat\u2019s a fact. Thus, not only domestic leaders but also international leaders must deal with its leadership to achieve their respective missions in the fragile state of Myanmar. \nMany people of Myanmar loathed the military dictatorship that oppressed them for decades. The international community punished the military with sanctions for its abuse of power against its own people; its grip on power that went against international norms. \nThe Tatmadaw, however, is resilient in the political arena though it has faced continuous resistance throughout its rule. Sanctions from the West for 20 years didn\u2019t make the military weak. \nTo date, political transformation has not evolved beyond a framework designed by the ex-military regime. \nThe past one and a half years since the first elected government led by the National League for Democracy took office has proven again that the military is still the most important stakeholder in the political arena. \nTwenty-nine years after a nationwide uprising stormed against the military dictatorship in 1988, the popular pro-democracy camp has failed in achieving its goal: to remove the military from the political arena after making it return to the barracks. \nAnd the mainstream opposition groups comprising Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s NLD, dozens of other political parties, ethnic parties and political activist groups couldn\u2019t make their own strategies beyond a political roadmap planned by the military regime. \nDuring that time, however, the military managed to have a constitution which guarantees it an important leadership role in the political arena. \nToday, as a result, the military is still at the epicenter of politics although it isn\u2019t running the government. \nConstitutionally, the military\u2019s commander-in-chief Snr-Gen Min Aung Hlaing is perhaps the most important power holder. \nHe chooses the 25 percent of military appointees in all parliaments nationally and regionally. He nominates a vice president and three key ministerial positions\u2014defense, home and border affairs. \nIn addition, the military chief is the supreme commander in chief of all armed forces, from the military to the police to paramilitary groups. In other countries, this position is supposed to be for the president. \nTraditionally, the military had ruled the country for many decades from 1958 to 1960 as a caretaker government and from 1962 to 2011 as a military government. Besides, from 2011 to early 2016, the military-proxy party, known as the Union Solidarity and Development Party, ruled the country through a quasi-civilian government. Thus, the military and its political party had ruled the country for fifty-six out of the sixty-nine years since it gained independence from British colonial rule in 1948. \nHistorically, the military was formed as the Burma Independence Army (BIA) in 1941 to fight for independence from the British. BIA was formed by patriotic politicians led by independence leader Gen. Aung San, father of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. So, the consecutive military leaders hold a belief that the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, is patriotic with \u201ca crucial duty to protect the State from internal and external threats and destructive elements which endanger its sovereignty.\u201d \nWith such roles in history and politics, the military has strengthened itself throughout history. It has become one of the strongest armed forces in Southeast Asia, with more than 450,000 troops. \nAll of its leaders, especially after its takeover of the country in 1988, have never swayed from three causes of their motto: \u201cThe non-disintegration of the Union, non-disintegration of national solidarity and perpetuation of sovereignty.\u201d \nThe current leader of the military, Snr-Gen Min Aung Hlaing, is no different. \nLast Sunday, we could see once more the military\u2019s power and its steadfast political stand when Snr-Gen Min Aung Hlaing made a speech at the ceremony of the 2nd anniversary of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement in Naypyitaw. \nThe military chief was one of three leaders to make speeches together with the de facto leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi representing the government and Saw Mutu Sae Poe, chairman of Karen National Union, representing a bloc of ethnic armed groups which have signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement. \nThe military chief is always among key leaders to make such a speech in important political ceremonies and also a key host to all foreign dignitaries, who request to meet the military chief when they want to discuss military or security matters. \nThe head of the state and other cabinet ministers are not legitimately placed to answer such specific questions. \nSnr-Gen Min Aung Hlaing\u2019s speech on Sunday was different from the other two leaders\u2019 speeches. \nThe State Counselor emphasized leaving a good legacy of peace for the next generation and appealed for collaboration from everyone for the peace process. \nThe Karen leader called for autonomy and integrity for ethnic people in accordance with the Panglong agreement signed in 1947 between the then Prime Minister Aung San and ethnic leaders, making crucial suggestions for the current peace process. \nIn contrast, the military chief not only touched on the peace process and the country\u2019s stability but also about the multiparty system, the military\u2019s tasks in laying out the foundation for the multiparty system, the definitions of democracy, different views on the rule of law, differences between revolution and building the country, and the military\u2019s historic role in fighting for independence. \nSome critics might even have considered his speech a \u201cpolitical lecture\u201d to the audience, from the head of the state to ethnic leaders to heads of foreign missions. \nIt would be very unusual in other countries, but in Myanmar, the exclusive audience had to listen to his 15-minutes speech. And the commander-in-chief delivered the speech with the confidence and conviction needed when speaking to such an audience. \nThe military chief said the military government carried out political, economic and social development undertakings from 1988 till 2010 by building the road for a multiparty system. He said, \u201cEvery person and every organization needs to understand the multiparty system. The military is carrying out to continue to walk on the policy of the multiparty system with steadfast and caution.\u201d \n\u201cAs democracy is seen as a system, it can be assumed that it is as a task or ethic to achieve success if it is followed and respected by everyone.\u201d \nThe senior general said while legal scholars focus on stability to determine the rule of law, there are two factors of \u201caccountability\u201d and \u201cno one above the law\u201d according to political point of view. \nThe military chief said more than one time in his speech, \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d He also added, \u201cAny person or organization must respect the existing laws in carrying out any type of their duties. The law cannot be abused as a tool.\u201d \nHe was not referring to any specific person. Some people might ask whether he was referring to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who was sitting in the front row. Because right after the NLD government took office at the end of March 2016, the NLD-dominated Parliament proposed the \u201cState Counsellor\u201d bill, which the President U Htin Kyaw signed into law in early April. \nThe military lawmakers said the bill was unconstitutional and all of them boycotted the proceedings by refusing to cast a ballot during the session. \nAs for the NLD, the position was created out of political necessity: though Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s party won the landslide in the election, she is barred from the presidency in the military-drafted Constitution. The military leadership might have seen that it was above the law as Daw Aung San Suu Kyi created a position \u201cabove the president.\u201d \nOver the past one and half years in office, the NLD-government has found it difficult to rule the country as it planned to in important areas such as the peace process, amending some laws, planning to change the undemocratic Constitution and other issues, including tackling the urgent Rakhine conflict. For those sectors, the military is at the center among all key stakeholders. \nThe military and the government are not going at the same pace in tackling all the issues. In all security measures, the military calls the shots\u2014especially in fighting with ethnic armed groups and waging military operations against militant group the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which launched orchestrated attacks on government security outposts in late August. \nIt\u2019s sheer unrealistic for someone to imagine that the country\u2019s current political transition will advance without the role of the military or the military will leave the political arena to return to its barracks in the near future. \nIn 2012, the then defence minister Lt-Gen Hla Min said at the security forum of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore that the Tatmadaw \u201cmay play a lesser role in politics once the country is more developed and that when the time is appropriate, there would be changes and the 20 percent participation in the national legislature could be reduced.\u201d Five years after, the military hasn\u2019t changed that standing at all. \nCertainly, Myanmar\u2019s politics and its democratic transition need the military\u2019s collaboration. \nIf the military fully collaborates, the transition will be swift. If the military hesitates, the transition will be sluggish. If the military has no collaboration at all, it will stall completely.

We will bring him to Irrawaddy and investigate,\u201d spokesperson of Irrawaddy Division Police Force Police Lt-Col Khin Maung Latt told The Irrawaddy. \nMyanmar\u2019s minority Muslims in Rakhine State\u2014who identify as Rohingya but are labeled \u201cBengali\u201d by many\u2014are denied basic human rights by the Myanmar government including access to healthcare, education, and freedom of movement. \nNearly 600,000 self-identifying Rohingya have fled northern Rakhine State since Aug. 25 after deadly militant attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army prompted a violent government security crackdown dogged by accusations of rape, extrajudicial killings, and arson. \nThe UN has labeled the government\u2019s actions in Rakhine State a \u201ctext book example of ethnic cleansing.\u201d \nKyangin Township Immigration department has filed a lawsuit against the seven self-identifying Rohingyas under Residents of Burma Registration Rules 1951. Police have charged the driver, his assistant and Ko Shae. \nPolice searched the truck at an inspection gate in Kyangin Township\u2019s Zibinkwin village-tract and discovered seven self-identifying Rohingyas hiding among 260 rice bags in the truck. \nAccording to an initial police investigation, driver Hla Myint and his assistant Yan Maung Tun transported commodities from Yangon to Sittwe and arrived in Minbya on October 15. There, the two met Ko Shae who persuaded them to take self-identifying Rohingyas to Yangon and paid 800,000 kyats in transportation fees for each of them. \nHla Myint accepted the job to transport the self-identifying Rohingya to \u2018Min Mahar\u2019 filling station in Yangon\u2019s Hlaingthayar Township where a man called Abul Sede was supposed to meet them, according to the police. \nKo Shae picked up seven self-identifying Rohingyas onto the truck outside Minbya on Tuesday evening.

The period from the 1950s to the 1970s is still viewed by many as the industry\u2019s \u201cgolden age,\u201d with local filmmakers producing nearly 100 original films each year on average in a competitive market. \nTogether with hundreds of news and documentary reels from over the past decades, there are only 12 black-and-white and 127 color films currently housed at the Film Archive office situated in commercial capital Yangon and some reels are in danger of deteriorating, according to U Bhone, caretaker of the vault. \nMany reels are damaged every year at the archive vault due to outdated preservation techniques. \nRay Edmondson, an award-winning audiovisual archivist and one of the two instructors at the workshop, told The Irrawaddy that the archiving system in Myanmar is still in its early stages. However, awareness raising and capacity building would make people informed about what is happening and what is missing, he continued. Award-winning audiovisual archivist Ray Edmondson was photographed during the workshop on October 19, 2017. (Photo: Tin Htet Paing/ The Irrawaddy) \nEdmondson said cinema is a part of Myanmar\u2019s national memory and identity, which must be looked after. Those who work in film preservation need commitment, enthusiasm and persistence, he explained. \n\u201cIt is not a field [in which] we get rich. You don\u2019t get famous. You don\u2019t get anything\u2026 You do it because it matters,\u201d Edmondson said. \nU Han Linn Aung, a workshop participant and an assistant director at the Motion Picture Development Branch, told The Irrawaddy that such an opportunity is valuable to him because he could relay his knowledge of film preservation techniques to future generations of cinema lovers so that they could develop them further. \nHe feels nostalgic whenever he sees film reels, he said, as he worked in a motion picture department for more than two decades. \n\u201cFilm reels speak to us about many things\u2014histories, diverse cultures and many more things that we weren\u2019t there to witness,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIf we start preserving the current conditions well now, our future generations will be able to work better with what we hand over to them.\u201d Two archivists from Australia; Mick Newnham (L) and Ray Edmondson (R), were photographed during the workshop on October 19, 2017.

So we will close the pagoda for a while,\u201d director of the department U Aung Aung Kyaw told The Irrawaddy. \nPreviously, five temples were open to visitors to view the sunset in Bagan, but after hundreds of pagodas were damaged by a powerful 6.8 magnitude earthquake in August last year, authorities now only allow sunset viewing at Shwesandaw and Taung Guni pagodas which are physically safer for visitors to climb. \nIt was built in 1057 by King Anawrahta, the founder of the Pagan Empire and widely considered the father of the Burmese nation. \nThough the collapse is mainly due to rains, the fact that about 1,000 visitors climb on the pagoda daily to see sunset also played a part, said U Aung Aung Kyaw. \nThe collapse, however, will not have an impact on Myanmar\u2019s bid for nomination of Bagan as a Unesco World Heritage Site, he said. \n\u201cIt has been raining steadily these days in Bagan. As the bricks [of the pagoda] date back to the 11th Century, there are already cracks, and when water got into those cracks, it collapsed,\u201d said U Khin Maung Nu, chairman of community-based Bagan Development Association. \nBagan has stupas, temples and other Buddhist religious buildings constructed from the 9th to 11th centuries\u2014a period in which some 50 Buddhist kings ruled the Pagan Dynasty. There are more than 3,000 stupas and temples in the area. \nTranslated from Burmese by Thet Ko Ko.

So we, including the government, all have to try to get all of the EAOs on board,\u201d she added. \nAccording to peace observers, clashes between the Tatmadaw and nationwide ceasefire agreement (NCA)-signatories reduced by 90 percent after signing the NCA. The Myanmar Army chief has said all EAOs must sign the NCA to join political dialogue, whether they are in clashes with the Tatmadaw or not. \nProblems with leadership have strained the peace process, according to EAO leaders, as the country requires decisions from the civilian government and the military, which holds key security powers, to move forward on issues. \nPrevious chief peace negotiator U Aung Min convinced former president U Thein Sein to support him, enabling U Aung Min to effectively work with Tatmadaw generals. But this aspect of the peace process is missing under the NLD government, said a peace negotiator from the All Burma Students\u2019 Democratic Front (ABSDF). \nThe peace negotiator who asked for anonymity told The Irrawaddy that if NCA signatories did not sign the NCA under the U Thein Sein administration, signing under the current circumstances would be impossible. \n\u201cThe current peace negotiators can not make any decisions. All have to go to the State Counselor, who is the chief peace negotiator. Besides, we have seen some negotiations regress, as the Tatmadaw does not agree on the negotiations although the government has agreed,\u201d he said. \nKhun Okker, patron of the Pa-O National Liberation Organisation, said the government wants to allow ethnic armed groups to hold national-level political dialogues freely but the Tatmadaw wants controls. \nHe is optimistic, however, that if the NCA is maintained, the aspiration of peace will not be destroyed despite the country being far from achieving it. \n\u201cThe slow movement in the peace efforts are due to the people,\u201d he said, tersely appraising the peace process. \nLeaders of NCA signatories hold government leaders and the Tatmadaw directly responsible for the delays, although they welcomed the start of political dialogue after 70 years of civil war. \n\u201cThe main hurdle is how to do the ceasefire. There is no restriction either by the government or the Tatmadaw on whichever status of the delegates joining the [union peace conferences],\u201d said U Min Zaw Oo, advisor to the peace commission, who has been involved in the peace process since its inception. \nThe government peace commission is still in talks with the United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) to sign the NCA. They will meet on Oct 23-24 in Yangon for their seventh round of talks over the nine-point proposal of the UNFC. \nThe current peace process continues in two different paths. The NCA signatories are moving forward to reach a lasting peace in the southern part of the country, while clashes persist in the north. \nThe government sticks firmly to the NCA, while new the Federal Political Negotiation Consultative Committee (FPNCC), led by the United Wa State Army (UWSA) urge for an alternative approach. \nNotably, the FPNCC and the UNFC did not join the celebration of the two-year anniversary of eight EAOs signing the NCA last week. \n\u201cWe invited them [the non-signatories of NCA], they did not come. Same for last year. If I have to frankly criticize, they do not want to acknowledge the work of the eight EAOs and the government and the Tatmadaw. If they come, it shows that they are with us; as they don\u2019t want to show this, they avoid,\u201d said Khun Okker.

This week, we\u2019ll discuss the current talk of the town\u2014the arrest of U Phyo Ko Ko Tint San who was found with firearms and illegal drugs at Naypyitaw Airport. Lawyer U Than Zaw Aung and The Irrawaddy Burmese editor U Yan Paing join me to discuss this. I\u2019m Irrawaddy Burmese editor Ye Ni. \nAs you know U Phyo Ko Ko Tint San, the son of former sports minister U Tint San, was recently arrested at Naypyitaw Airport for illegal possession of firearms and drugs. Police also discovered guns at his ACE Hotel. And again, guns, accessories and things believed to be drugs paraphernalia were also discovered at his hotel and company headquarters in Thaketa and Bahan townships in Yangon. Police have charged him for drugs and illegal possession of firearms.

Further investigation led to the seizure of more guns at his house and hotel in Yangon. So, why does he keep firearms? Police have stated that he was preparing to establish a security company. The name of the company is interesting. Words such as \u2018special force\u2019, \u2018national security council\u2019 are interesting. We should ask if a private security company is allowed to use the terms such as \u2018national\u2019 and \u2018council.\u2019 Again, \u2018special force\u2019 is a term normally used by armed organizations, and authorities should carefully investigate the reasons behind it. Law enforcement personnel should efficiently handle the case and find out his intention. \nYN: Do the charges brought by the police against them match the crime or do you see any suspicious aspects of the case? Because netizens have speculated that the case is politically motivated and there is a mastermind behind. \nTZA: There will be a lot of speculation and wild guesses on social media. But, the responsibility lies on the Ministry of Home Affairs to investigate. If the ministry alone is not enough, assistance should be sought from military agencies in the investigation process. Usually most of the [drug] cases pale into insignificance over time [after the initial drug bust]. And drug and weapons are like husband and wife, they come in pairs. At the moment, it is difficult to say the motive behind. There are speculations, but it is the responsibility of the concerned authorities to investigate. \nYN: What Ko Than Zaw Aung pointed out is interesting. Speaking of illegal arms, U Ko Ni\u2019s assassination, which happened not long ago, involves illegal arms. The gun used in assassination was reportedly brought through the Thailand-Myanmar border. And there is another case in which a motorbike rider was killed by a bullet in Mandalay. No one knew what happened. But it is obvious that he was shot by someone. Ko Yan Paing, do you think police are working hard enough to investigate drug and illegal firearms cases? \nYan Paing: Rather than discussing if the police are working, what I\u2019d like to know, as a journalist, is about the routes through which firearms are brought in. Police must investigate those routes and the arms dealers. And the case of the death of a motorbike rider in Mandalay is minor compared to the big haul of firearms in Naypyitaw\u2014the first of its kind there. Not long ago, firearms were seized reportedly from a vehicle in Thazi Township [in Mandalay], and there are many firearms in border areas. I think those cases are concerned with arms smuggling. But the case in discussion is different; many firearms were seized in a place like Naypyitaw, and in a place like Yangon, guns like the M16 were discovered\u2014it is a serious weapon. And as U Than Zaw Aung has pointed out, guns and drugs come in pairs. If he is high on drugs and shoots at something with those guns, it is very dangerous. So, I think police should give greater attention than they did in previous cases. \nYN: Drugs and weapons usually come in pairs, but the amount of drug seized from him and discovered during police search [of his house and hotel] is not much. So, it can be concluded that he is just a drug user [as opposed to a dealer]. But talking of firearms, police stated that he was planning to establish a security company. As far as I\u2019m concerned, there is still no law that allows for [armed] security service. But what I\u2019d like to know is if the laws allow civilians to keep firearms, or specify the circumstances in which civilians can keep specific types of firearms. As far as I\u2019m concerned, gun licenses were issued under the government of the Burma Socialist Programme Party (BPSS). \nTZA: There were gun licenses issued under the BSPP government starting from 1977 but only to those who were fully-fledged party members and serving on duty in BSPP. They were allowed to keep three weapons including handguns, such as non-military rifles. But after the 1988 pro-democracy uprising, [the military] revoked gun licenses and recalled guns. There are three existing laws in Myanmar regarding weapons\u2014the Arms Act 1878, which is an Indian act, the Arms Act (Temporary Amendment) 1951, and the Arms Emergency Punishment Temporary Act 1949. According to these existing laws, ordinary citizens are not allowed to keep firearms. Lawmakers asked about the keeping of firearms at the parliament probably under the previous government. At that time concerned officials replied that ordinary citizens are not allowed to keep firearms. Security guards of security companies are allowed to use handcuffs and rubber batons. They are not allowed to keep guns. \nYP: Besides what Ko Than Zaw Aung has said, as you see police usually carry out checks on ordinary citizens who go out late at night by car or motorbike, and even seize swords and sticks from them if they carry any. Therefore, I think the case is more than establishing a security company or a hobby. \nYN: This seizure of guns, camouflage jackets and military accessories reminds me of the previous case of such a seizure in the alleged plot of U Aye Ne Win and U Kyaw Ne Win for high treason. And this case has aroused concerns. And there are concerns for the security of State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Talking of illegal possession of arms, there are armed groups in our country in ethnic regions. After they held peace talks [with the government], their members were allowed to come into [government-controlled] towns with guns for a certain period of time though carrying guns in towns is totally banned now. However, the case proves again the speculation that guns are still brought into towns by one way or another. Ko Than Zaw Aung, what measures do you think should be taken to control this? \nTZA: As I have said, it is important to find out intentions in crimes. In the case we\u2019re discussing, it is the accused who has to prove that he does not intend to commit high treason. The Arms Act (Temporary Amendment) stated that despite any contrary provision in any other existing laws, it shall be presumed that a person found to be in possession of arms has the intention of committing the offence of high treason. So in this case, the accused has to prove that he has no intention of committing high treason. \nYN: What do you think, Ko Yan Paing? \nYP: Mainly that the home affairs ministry should work harder, I think. Things are different from the past now. Nowadays, illegal arms will come into the country from various places\u2014drug dealers, China border, Thai border. Recently, guns were discovered on the Thai border and I heard that police even seized air guns that use metal balls. But the question is if police can always do like that? As illegal arms have been found in Naypyitaw and Yangon, laws should be amended as necessary and the Ministry of Home Affairs should make greater efforts to gather intelligence and find out the network of accomplices. \nYN: Thank you for your contribution!

Kaung Htike of the G-4 military training aircraft. / Kaung Htike / Facebook 1.5k By Salai Thant Zin 23 October 2017 \nPATHEIN, Irrawaddy Region \u2014 Two pilots aboard a missing military training jet found last week some 12 miles south of Gwa Township in Rakhine State after going missing last month were confirmed dead by the Tatmadaw medical team last week. \nThe search and research team found the body of pilot Maj. Kaung Htike near the wreckage. Though the body of co-pilot Capt. Thaw Zin Soe was not recovered, the team found his personal belongings at the scene. \nTwo pilot seats attached with parachutes, and two survival kits were found at the scene, according to a statement from the Office of the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services. \n\u201cThough the body of Capt. Thaw Zin Soe was not found, his personal belongings including his watch were found. So the medical team confirmed the death of both pilots,\u201d a senior military officer who participated in search and rescue operation told The Irrawaddy. \n\u201cA military funeral will be held for Maj. Kaung Htike at the scene and we\u2019ll take back the ashes,\u201d he added. \nThe G-4 military training aircraft disappeared during a training exercise over Pathein, Gwa, Hinthada, and back to Pathein, the capital of Irrawaddy Region, on Sept. 5. The plane lost contact about 36 miles northwest of Pathein. Parts of the aircraft were discovered last Wednesday on the 44th day of the search and rescue operation. \nThe training jet had been used by Maj. Kaung Htike to train new pilots for the last three years. \nHe passed the No. 64 piloting training from Namhsan Pilot Training School in Shan State, and was assigned to Mingalardon Air Base. Since 2007, he had been stationed at Pathein Air Base. \nHe was survived by his wife and a daughter, and so is the case for Capt. Thaw Zin Soe. \nThe training jet was a military training aircraft manufactured by Yugoslavia in 1984.

It also means his \u201cAbenomics\u201d growth strategy centred on the hyper-easy monetary policy will likely continue. \nFinal official results from the election, which coincided with an approaching typhoon, are expected early on Monday. \nThe U.S.-drafted constitution\u2019s Article 9, if taken literally, bans the maintenance of armed forces. But Japanese governments have interpreted it to allow a military exclusively for self-defence. \nBackers of Abe\u2019s proposal to clarify the military\u2019s ambiguous status say it would codify the status quo. Critics fear it would allow an expanded role overseas for the military. \nAbe said he would not stick to a target he had floated of making the changes by 2020. \u201cFirst, I want to deepen debate and have as many people as possible agree,\u201d he told a TV broadcaster. \u201cWe should put priority on that.\u201d \nThe LDP\u2019s junior partner, the Komeito, is cautious about changing the constitution, drawn up after Japan\u2019s defeat in World War Two. Several opposition parties favour changes, but do not necessarily agree on details. \nReferendums Risky \nAmendments must be approved by two-thirds of each chamber of parliament and then by a majority in a public referendum. \n\u201cNow that pro-constitutional change parties occupy more than two-thirds of the parliament, the constitution will be the most important political issue next year,\u201d said Hidenori Suezawa, a financial market and fiscal analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities. \n\u201cAnd as we saw in the U.K. \u2026 a referendum could be tricky. So while Abe is likely to be prime minister for the time being, it is too early to say whether he can stay in power until 2021.\u201d Abe declined to say if he would run for a third term. \nAbe had said he needed a new mandate to tackle a \u201cnational crisis\u201d from North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear threats and a fast-aging population, and to approve his idea of diverting revenue from a planned sales tax hike to education and child care from public debt repayment. \nHe called the poll amid confusion in the opposition camp and an uptick in his ratings, dented earlier in the year by scandals over suspected cronyism and a perception he had grown arrogant after nearly five years in office. \nAbe has backed U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tough stance towards North Korea, which has test-fired missiles over Japan, that all options, including military action, are on the table. Trump is to visit Japan Nov. 5-7 to reaffirm the leaders\u2019 tight ties. \nAbe\u2019s Gamble Pays Off \nAbe\u2019s snap poll gamble had seemed risky\u2014some early forecasts saw the LDP losing a significant chunk of seats\u2014after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, often floated as possibly Japan\u2019s first female premier, launched her conservative Party of Hope. \nThat party absorbed a big chunk of the failed main opposition Democratic Party, which abruptly decided to run no candidates of its own. But voter enthusiasm soon waned despite its calls for popular policies such as an exit from nuclear power and a freeze on the planned sales tax rise. \nKoike did not run for a lower house seat herself \u2013 she was in Paris for a climate change event on Sunday \u2013 and failed to say whom her party would back for prime minister. \n\u201cWe had sought to put policies first. But we ended up with a very tough outcome, so I deeply apologise for that,\u201d Koike told NHK. \nA new Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), formed by liberal former DP members, got 54 seats, beating the 49 seats of Koike\u2019s party to become the biggest opposition group, although both have just a fraction of the LDP\u2019s presence. \n\u201cDay by day, we felt we were getting more voter support for our call to revive more decent politics, and not fret about whether it\u2019s right or left wing,\u201d said CDPJ lawmaker Tetsuro Fukuyama. \nSeveral experts noted the ruling bloc\u2019s win was less a victory for the conservative, long-ruling LDP than a defeat for a divided opposition. \n\u201cSimply put, this was the self-destruction of the opposition,\u201d said Zentaro Kamei, a senior research fellow at think tank PHP Institute and former LDP lawmaker. \nShinjiro Koizumi, the LDP lawmaker son of popular former Premier Junichiro Koizumi, warned against LDP complacency. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that our party has become arrogant and complacent. People are also getting increasingly fed up with us,\u201d he told NHK. \nAbe, 63, has already led the LDP and its partner, the Komeito, to four landslide wins since he took the helm of the party. But turnout has been low and the LDP has typically won with about 25 percent of eligible votes. Others either stayed home or backed opposition parties. \nKyodo news agency estimated turnout on Sunday\u2014when heavy rain from powerful Typhoon Lan lashed much of Japan\u2014at 53.7 percent, 1 point above the record low in the last lower house election in 2014.

While the plans are not yet finalized, their comments reflect the government\u2019s thinking on how Suu Kyi\u2019s repatriation pledge will be implemented. \nJamil Ahmed, who spoke to Reuters at a refugee camp in Bangladesh, is one of many who hope to go back. \nDescribing how he fled his home in northern Rakhine State in late August, Ahmed said one of the few things he grabbed was a stack of papers\u2014land contracts and receipts\u2014that might prove ownership of the fields and crops he was leaving behind. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t carry any ornaments or jewels,\u201d said the 35-year-old. \u201cI\u2019ve only got these documents. In Myanmar, you need to present documents to prove everything.\u201d \nThe stack of papers, browning and torn at the edges, may not be enough, however, to regain the land in Kyauk Pan Du village, where he grew potatoes, chili plants, almonds and rice. \n\u201cIt depends on them. There is no land ownership for those who don\u2019t have citizenship,\u201d said Kyaw Lwin, agriculture minister in Rakhine State, when asked in an interview whether refugees who returned to Myanmar could reclaim land and crops. \nDespite his land holdings, Myanmar does not recognize Ahmed as a citizen. Nearly all the more than 1 million self-identifying Rohingya who lived in Myanmar before the recent exodus are stateless, despite many tracing their families in the country for generations. \nOfficials have made plans to harvest, and possibly sell, thousands of acres of crops left behind by the fleeing Muslims, according to state government documents reviewed by Reuters. \nMyanmar also intends to settle most refugees who return to Rakhine State in new \u201cmodel villages,\u201d rather than on the land they previously occupied, an approach criticized in the past by the United Nations as effectively creating permanent camps. \nThe government has not asked for help from any international agencies, who are calling for any repatriation to be voluntary and to the refugees\u2019 place of origin. \n\u2018Ownerless Crops\u2019 \nThe exodus of 589,000 self-identifying Rohingya\u2014and about 30,000 non-Muslims\u2014from the conflict zone in northern Rakhine has left some 71,500 acres of planted rice paddy abandoned and in need of harvesting by January, according to plans drawn up by state officials. \nTables in the documents, reviewed by Reuters, divide the land into paddy sown by \u201cnational races\u201d\u2014meaning Myanmar citizens\u2014or \u201cBengalis,\u201d a term widely used in Myanmar to refer to the self-identifying Rohingya, but which they reject as implying they are illegal migrants from Bangladesh. \nKyaw Lwin, the state minister, confirmed the plans, and said there was a total of 45,000 acres of \u201cownerless Bengali land.\u201d \nTwo dozen combine harvesters operated by officials from the agriculture ministry will begin cutting stalks this month in areas under military control. \nThe machines will be able to harvest about 14,400 acres according to official calculations contained in the plans. It is unclear what will become of the remaining crop, but officials told Reuters they would try to harvest all the paddy, recruiting additional labor to harvest manually if necessary. \nAn acre of paddy in Myanmar typically makes more than US$300 at market, meaning the state will gain millions of dollars worth of rice. \nThe harvested rice will be transported to government stores, where it would either be donated to those displaced by the conflict or sold, Rakhine state secretary Tin Maung Swe told Reuters by phone. \n\u201cThe land was abandoned. There is no one to reap that, so the government ordered to harvest it,\u201d he said. \nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) deputy Asia director Phil Robertson, said the government should at least guarantee that the rice would be used for humanitarian support and not for profit. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t call a rice crop \u2018ownerless\u2019 just because you used violence and arson to drive the owners out of the country,\u201d he said. \n\u2018Model Villages\u2019 \nMany refugees are fearful to return and are skeptical of Myanmar\u2019s guarantees. Those who do decide to cross back into Myanmar will first be received at one of two centers, according to government plans reviewed by Reuters, before mostly being relocated to model villages. \nInternational donors, who have fed and cared for more than 120,000 mostly self-identifying Rohingya \u201cinternally displaced persons\u201d (IDPs) in supposedly temporary camps in Rakhine since violence in 2012, have told Myanmar that they will not support more camps, according to aid workers and diplomats. \n\u201cThe establishment of new temporary camps or camp-like settlements carries many risks, including that the returnees and IDPs could end up being confined to these camps for a long time,\u201d said UN spokesman Stanislav Saling in an emailed response. \nSatellite imagery shows 288 villages, mostly self-identifying Rohingya settlements, have been fully or partially razed by fires since Aug. 25, according to HRW. \nRefugees say the army and Buddhist mobs were responsible for most of the arson. The government says self-identifying Rohingya militants and even residents themselves burned the homes for propaganda. \nThe hamlets where self-identifying Rohingya farmers lived were \u201cnot systematic,\u201d and so should be rebuilt in smaller settlements of 1,000 households set out in straight rows to enable development, said Soe Aung, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement. \n\u201cIn some villages there are three houses here, four houses over there. For example, there\u2019s no road for fire engines when fire burns the villages,\u201d Soe Aung said. \nIdentity Checks \nThose who decide to cross back into Myanmar will first be received at one of two centers, according to government plans reviewed by Reuters. \nAt the centers, officials said, the returnees will fill out a 16-point form that will be cross-checked with local authorities\u2019 records. Immigration officials have for years visited self-identifying Rohingya households at least annually for checks, photographing family members. \nFor refugees who lost all their documents, the government would compare their photos to those that immigration authorities have on file, said Myint Kyaing, the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population. \nOfficials will accept as evidence \u201cnational verification\u201d cards handed out in an ongoing government effort to register self-identifying Rohingya that falls short of offering them citizenship. The card has been widely rejected by Rohingya community leaders, who say they treat life-long residents like new immigrants. \n\u201cWe are not going to go back like this,\u201d said Mushtaq Ahmed, 57, a farmer from Myin Hlut village now living in the Tenkhali refugee camp in Bangladesh, where Jamil Ahmed is also staying. \n\u201cIf I can go back to my house, and get my land back, only then I will go. We invested all our money into those paddy fields.

Aung San (left) and his daughter Daw Aung San Suu Kyi (Right). 1.8k By The Irrawaddy 23 October 2017 \nDaw Aung San Suu Kyi remains the most popular politician and a public figure among the Myanmar public inside and outside of the country. But, like her late father who was assassinated by his rivals in 1947, she has no shortage of enemies. \nThe issue of her safety has been discussed among the Myanmar public for decades and recently the seizure of illegal firearms and illicit drugs at Naypyitaw\u2019s airport again raised concerns for the safety of the State Counselor. \nPhyo Ko Ko Tint San, son of the sports minister who served under president U Thein Sein, and two ACE employees were detained before boarding a Yangon-bound Myanmar National Airlines flight. Police found them with illegal firearms and drugs. \nLike many spoiled children of former generals, Phyo Ko Ko Tint San, chairman of ACE Company, enjoyed privileges and sweet business deals. \nAnd, like perhaps many before them walking into the airport with illegal firearms, they suspected they could pass the x-ray scanner without any problems. This time, however, they were caught. \nPolice, under pressure from the public to follow up the case, searched ACE hotel in Naypyitaw and a house belonging to Phyo Ko Ko Tint San in Yangon where they found more weapons including eight firearms, bullets, a camouflage jacket bearing his name and the Myanmar national emblem, one long-sleeved black shirt with the Myanmar national emblem and skull and crossed bones emblem, two sniper scopes, a military green compass, a walkie-talkie, a gun sight, and two bullet-proof jackets. \nWhat was he planning to do? \nAccording to the police investigation, Phyo Ko Ko Tint San, who is now in custody, was planning to establish a security company. The badges and logos discovered in his property, however, are problematic. \u201cNational Security Council\u201d a letter in badge showed. He had obviously stockpiles firearms, police said. He had been doing it without any legal permission. \nPolice have so far detained 12 people in connection with the case, and reportedly seized over 20 firearms and thousands of bullets at his house, company offices, and hotel in Naypyitaw and Yangon. There are surely more suspects and arrests in the pipeline if police are instructed to clampdown on these criminals, informed sources also believe that more firearms are yet to be found. \nSenior police officers who were involved the case said the seizure of firearms was not directly related to the security of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi but it is learned that the military has warned the State Counselor over her security arrangements and she has replied that she would take extra caution. \nOne of the camouflage jackets discovered is identical to that of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s bodyguards. This has caused concern among her supporters and National League for Democracy party members. \nThe government spokesperson said that security has been increasingly tightened for the State Counselor since 2016 after her name appeared on a hit list sent by the militant group the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria to police in Malaysia. \nIn any case, foreign terrorists may take aim at Daw Aung San Suu Kyi due to the crisis in Rakhine Region in which hundreds of thousands of self-identifying Rohingya fled to a neighboring country due to the military\u2019s clearance operation, but many also assume that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s real threat could come from within. \nSome politicians and oligarchs who once enjoyed lucrative business opportunities and political power but have lost vested business interests under the current administration may have a plan to harm her. Many powerful groups associated with former generals and business cronies are no doubt unhappy with her and her administration. \nSome pro-Suu Kyi political observers suspect that a group of once wealthy and powerful people have been trying to create instability since her party came into power. They may think the instability in the country can pave a way for the military to step in and retake power. \nPhyo Ko Ko Tint San is a member of the Union Solidarity Development Party and contested, in the 2012 by-election, Irrawaddy Region\u2019s Myaungmya Township seat. Security concerns for Daw Aung San Suu Kyi have also been raised as several young privileged delinquents who actively use social media also posted photos of firearms and made threats to kill her. \nUnion Solidarity Development Association (known as the USDA) was established in 1993 under the guidance of the military junta and its patron Snr-Gen Than Shwe. The association became a legal political party before the 2010 general election and contested the rigged election that year then it became ruling party. \nMany of her supporters and colleagues are genuinely and deeply worried for the safety of Aung San Suu Kyi, who is now under the protection of the police and special forces who are under the control of the Ministry of Home Affairs. \nUnder the previous regime, when she was opposition figure, there were several attacks on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. \nIn 2003, state-sponsored mobs attacked her convoy in Sagaing Region and dozens of people were killed as a result, but Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and some top leaders narrowly escaped harm. But the leaders were placed under house arrest for many more years though they did not commit any crime. The incident was known as the Depayin massacre as it took place near Depayin village. \nAfter the attacks, western nations tightened sanctions against the Than Shwe regime and neighboring governments openly condemned the attacks. \nIt was Snr-Gen Than Shwe and his close associates who masterminded the attacks. He ordered two of his trusted generals\u2014Gen. Soe Win who was later prime minister between 2004 and 2007 and Gen Ye Myint\u2014to mobilize criminals, members of the then USDA, and mobs to conduct the attacks. \nMyanmar\u2019s most feared intelligence chief and former prime minister Gen Khin Nyunt mentioned in his memoirs about the infamous Depayin massacre and conceded that top leaders were involved in the assassination plan but took credit that his intelligence officers had save Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s life. \nThis time the tough job will come to the Ministry of Home Affairs, which is under the direct control of the armed forces according to Myanmar\u2019s constitution. \nThe public has not been satisfied with the police\u2019s slow reaction to this case. What\u2019s more, who caught the assassin of National League for Democracy legal advisor U Ko Ni at the Yangon International Airport? Not police but a group of taxi drivers who were hailed as heroes. \n\u201cThe most important thing is to seize remaining weapons and arrest accomplices,\u201d Deputy Home Affairs Minister Maj-Gen Aung Soe told reporters in Naypyitaw. \u201cSo, we are working to make sure they don\u2019t escape.\u201d \nHe needs to keep his promise and words. The world will have to watch how Myanmar\u2019s police department under the home affairs ministry\u2014who have received funding and training from western nations including EU under U Thein Sein period\u2014will show they are working around the clock to keep tracking those criminals who are at large but also making ongoing investigation transparent. \nMany still see Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s life as indispensable in this fragile transition period and failing state in the country. Citizens also witnessed the untimely departure of Aung San and his cabinet, they can\u2019t afford to see it again at a time when the country faces internal and external threats and mounting pressure to solve pressing issues at home.

The other five camps have enough food to last until the end of October. \nKoung Jor camp organizer Lung Sai Lieng said food was last delivered in September. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ve got nothing this month. We are surviving on leftovers from last month. People at the camp are expecting to get farming jobs in Thailand, but work hasn\u2019t started yet because of heavy rains,\u201d he said. \nThe Border Consortium (TBC)\u2014a coalition of INGOS from the US, Britain, Ireland, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia and Norway\u2014has been providing assistance for accommodation, food and education of IDPs at Loi Kaw Wan; Loi Tai Leng; Loi Lam; Loi Sarm Sip; and Koung Jor. \nTBC informed camp organizers in February that it would stop providing assistance to the camps at the end of October although it has been informing camp leaders of the likelihood of this happening since 2015. \nA 60-year old woman in Loi Kaw Wan suffered a mental breakdown leading to her death on hearing news of the cuts, said Lung Sai Pieng, secretary of the Shan State Refugee Committee. \n\u201cCamps are short on food as October is ending soon,\u201d he said. The committee has contacted potential donors to ask for donations. \u201cSome have provided help, but it is short-term assistance. But then it is better than having no food at all,\u201d he added. \nMoreover, it is risky for IDPs to cross the border and work in Thailand because they don\u2019t have legal permits, he said. \n\u201cI\u2019d like to urge the government to provide help for IDPs here,\u201d he said. \nThe homes of IDPs have been occupied by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), Tatmadaw and militia, according to the Shan State Refugee Committee. Meanwhile, there is little land available for farming near the camps. \nThe Shan Human Rights Foundation released a statement in August detailing the background and plight of IDPs in Shan State, saying that IDPs only get seasonal jobs at farms in Thailand and earn much lower wages than Thai workers. Some IDPs find it difficult to leave the camp and work, said the statement. \nYet no international donor has come forward to provide food for the camps, said Lung Sai Lieng. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be useful to talk to the government. It has no attention for IDPs because it focuses on political issues and relations with the military,\u201d he said. \nThe Irrawaddy asked officials of Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) signatories, members of political parties and government officials about repatriation of IDPs, but none of them gave clear answers. \n\u201cThat will be the part of the rehabilitation and social plan. But so far, we\u2019ve not discussed it yet,\u201d said Kwe Htoo Win, vice-chairman of ethnic armed group and NCA signatory Karen National Union (KNU). \nOfficials of some other NCA signatories said it is the responsibility of the government to ensure IDPs are able to return home with dignity. \n\u201cWhat we can say is the peace process is still ongoing. It concerns trust building, and we are trying,\u201d said U Hla Maung Shwe, member of the government\u2019s peace commission, on the plight of the IDPs. \nStudents at two Karreni IDP camps are facing difficulties because of declining international support, said secretary U Bwe Sae of the Karen Refugee Committee. \nLoi Tai Leng Camp was established in 1999, Loi Kaw Wan in 2001, Koung Jor in 2002, and Loi Lam and Loi Sarm Sip in 2006, and Gawng Mung Mong in 2007. They shelter people who fled clashes between the Tatmadaw and Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS), and alleged torture by the military. \nThe eight ethnic armed groups that signed the NCA\u2014the KNU; Chin National Front; Arakan Liberation Party (ALP); All Burma Students\u2019 Democratic Front (ABSDF); Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS); Karen National Union/Karen National Liberation Army (Peace Council) (KNU/KNLA PC); Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA); and the Pa-O National Liberation Organization (PNLO)\u2014are based along the Myanmar-Thailand border, and have been holding political dialogue with the government for two years. \nThe issue of IDPs is included under the \u201csocial sector\u201d\u2014one of five topics under discussion between the government and NCA signatories, but the parties are yet to reach any agreement. \nTranslated from Burmese by Thet Ko Ko. \nThis report originally stated TBC informed camp organizers in July that it would stop providing assistance to the camps at the end of October. Actually, it informed camp organizers in February but had told them of this likelihood since 2015. It stated TBC provided assistance to Gawng Mung Mong. TBC has not provided assistance to Gawng Mung Mong. The original report also cited secretary U Bwe Sae of the Karen Refugee Committee that food supplies to Karen IDPs would be reduced or stopped in 2018. This was removed, as a decision is yet to be made on the matter.

"Burma State Counselor Calls for Unity, Asks Business Community to Help Rakhine Rehabilitation State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi (Center) with businesspeople on Thursday at a ceremony to accept donations for Rakhine State.\u2002 / Htet Naing Zaw / The Irrawaddy 1.3k By Htet Naing Zaw 23 October 2017 \nNAYPYITAW\u2014 In her recent speech to the people across the country, Myanmar State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said no matter what difficulties the country faces, they can be overcome by the unity of her people. \nIn her call for people\u2019s assistance, the State Counselor urged businesspeople to give a hand in rehabilitation works in Rakhine State, in a ceremony to accept donations for the restive state in Naypyitaw on Friday. \nMany in Myanmar would argue she has a right to believe so as history has proved it was the people\u2019s unity that turned her National League for Democracy from an opposition party to the current ruling one. \nNow with mounting international pressure on the Rakhine State issue, the 72-year old has called on the people\u2019s collaboration again. \nIn the northwest of Myanmar, rehabilitation works are urgently in need after Muslim militant attacks and counter military clearance operations have sent more than 600,000 self-identifying Rohingya Muslims fleeing across the border to Bangladesh and displacing internally nearly 30,000 ethnic Arakanese and others. \nShe encouraged businesspeople to provide input, admitting that measures taken in the past to address the issue were not sufficient. She called for collaboration so as to identify new approaches in solving the problem. \n\u201cBig businesspeople are the strength of the country. The government is also the strength of the country, and so are the people. I assume that the sound foundation of the Union\u2019s project for Rakhine State was laid today with these three strengths,\u201d said Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. \n\u201cRather than financial help or material support, we are asking for mental help\u2014I mean both from your head and heart. I would call it goodwill. I would urge cooperation for the country,\u201d she added. \nThe government formed the Union Enterprise for Humanitarian Assistance, Resettlement and Development in Rakhine on Oct. 15 to engage in humanitarian and rehabilitation works. Businesspeople donated nearly 18 billion kyats on Friday. \n\u201cI\u2019d like to urge the businessmen to provide frank suggestions. We may not be able to accept all the suggestions, but we\u2019d choose the most appropriate ones and implement them. In sorting out priorities, we also have to choose low-hanging fruit, and there are certain things that need to be implemented in the long-run,\u201d she said. \n\u201cWe businesspeople stand by the government. We don\u2019t want to lose democracy from our hands. And we don\u2019t want to lose the Rakhine and border with Bangladesh. The government should adopt a firm plan and we\u2019d like to provide funds for it,\u201d said U Khin Shwe, chairman of Zay Kabar Co. \nU Aung Ko Win, chairman of Kanbawza, made the largest contribution of 3 billion kyats. U Maung Weik, chairman of Sae Paing Co, gave1.5 billion kyats, and other businessmen such as U Zaw Zaw, U Chit Khaing, U Tun Myint Nang, U Htay Myint and U Khing Shwe also made contributions. \nThe event was in response to a request made by the businesspeople at the 2nd anniversary of nationwide ceasefire agreement signing on October 15 in Naypyitaw to provide assistance in Rakhine issue, U Zaw Htay, director-general of State Counselor Office told the reporters. \n\u201cThere are three priorities, first is repatriation and resettlement, second is rehabilitation and the final one is development and ensuring of conflicts in the long-run,\u201d said U Zaw Htay.

Hospital supervisor Kyaw Naing Oo said the men were in a critical condition. \nNorthern Rakhine State has been reeling from violence since Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) attacked police outposts in August, which intensified Myanmar Army operations, causing more than 600,000 self-identifying Rohingya Muslims to flee for Bangladesh. \nEstimates put the death toll of self-identifying Rohingya past 1,000 while about 30,000 Arakanese and Hindus fled militant violence, with reports saying the militants had targeted civilians. \nThudatha Naka, abbot of Aung Tha Pyay monastery, told The Irrawaddy over the phone on Monday that the four Daingnet men\u2014Maung Ngay Hla, Shwe Thein Maung, Sein Hla Maung and Maung Ngay Tun\u2014went hunting for boar in the forest in the Mayu mountain range on Sunday evening. \nThey crossed paths with Muslim militants and were shot, he said. Maung Ngay Hla and Shwe Thein Maung managed to escape and are receiving treatment at the hospital. \n\u201cThe two men who escaped told me a group of Bengali terrorists shot at them and two were killed on the spot,\u201d he said, using a term said locally and across the country to describe the self-identifying Rohingya. \nThe Irrawaddy phoned Buthidaung Township police officers, but they decline to comment and directed calls to border police officials, as the Border Guard Force controls the area.

It was not made of stone or wood or metal. It was made with paper from packing boxes of liver medicine and vitamin supplements, caps of small water bottles, and small batteries. \nHe died at the age of 65 in 2016, having devoted his entire life to art. To mark the one-year anniversary of his death, an art and sculpture exhibition is being held in his remembrance until Oct. 25 at OK Art Gallery. \nTogether with Myanmar\u2019s modernists Win Pe, Kin Maung Yin, Paw Thame and San Min, Zaw Lu Min entered art world in 1970s. \n\u201cKo Zaw Lu Min was art crazy since he was young. He used to draw on various things that came across his eye. He didn\u2019t even spare pots and plates and stones. What is distinct with his creation is that they reflect his craziness for art,\u201d said artist Win Pe. \nThe exhibition also showcases an oil portrait of Zaw Lu Min painted by Kin Maung Yin in 1971. Zaw Lu Min had turned stones into faces, elephants, frogs and so on, and also incorporated calculators, ball pens, water bottles, and dried tree branches into his paintings. \nHis Myanmar-style modernist paintings also attract viewers. There will be over 30 paintings and five sculptures at the exhibition priced between US$ 200 and 700. \nArtist Ko Sai who came to the exhibition said: \u201cWe knew each other some ten years ago. He created the forms and colors in his mind into paintings freely.

we are working with international partners to urge that Burma enables unhindered access to relevant areas for the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission, international humanitarian organizations, and media,\u201d the statement said. \nIn addition, Washington is \u201cconsulting with allies and partners on accountability options at the UN, the UN Human Rights Council, and other appropriate venues,\u201d it said. \nAimed at top generals? \nInterviews with more than a dozen diplomats and government officials based in Washington, Myanmar\u2019s capital, Yangon, and Europe have revealed that punitive measures aimed specifically at top generals were among a range of options being discussed in response to the self-identifying Rohingya crisis. \nSuch measures could include the possibility of imposing asset freezes and prohibiting American citizens from doing business with them. \nWashington has worked hard to establish close ties with Myanmar\u2019s civilian-led government led by Nobel laureate and former dissident Aung San Suu Kyi in the face of competition from strategic rival China. \nForty-three US lawmakers urged the Trump administration to reimpose US travel bans on Myanmar\u2019s military leaders and prepare targeted sanctions against those responsible for the crackdown. \nThe Magnitsky Act, originally passed in 2012, imposed visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials linked to the 2009 death in prison of Sergei Magnitsky, a 37-year-old Russian whistleblower. It has since been expanded to become the Global Magnitsky Act, which could be used against the generals in Myanmar.

Hunched beneath a makeshift tent made of cloth and string, Chalermporn Paebutr, a 72-year-old woman from northern Thailand, described her determination to bid farewell to a much-loved monarch. \n\u201cI traveled here two days ago so that I could be the first to get a good spot,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cWe only have to brave the rain for a few days. This is worth it if we can be near him one last time.\u201d \nAround 1,000 people had camped overnight in the downpour, police said on Tuesday. Some only had their plastic raincoats for protection. \nThailand has suffered floods since Oct. 10. Nine people have died, and 19 of the country\u2019s 77 provinces have been hit affected. \n\u201cThe floods will not affect the cremation ceremony in any way,\u201d interior minister Anupong Paochinda told reporters. \nNew King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the late king\u2019s only son, will lead the cremation ceremony. \nThailand has a harsh law, known as Article 112, against insulting the monarchy, and prosecutions have skyrocketed since the junta came to power following a coup in 2014. \nThe United Nations has voiced concern over the use of the law to clamp down on free speech and has repeatedly called on Thailand to amend it.

The Irrawaddy illustrates the crisis in the following infographics, which show the total death toll of the crisis, high number of abductions, alleged mass killings, and the stream of Muslim refugees fleeing for Bangladesh\u2014now at more than 600,000. \nOutposts Under Attack and Mass Destruction \nThe map below shows the locations of 30 border police outposts attacked by ARSA on Aug 25 in the entire Maungdaw district. It also provides the positions of villages burnt down in the aftermath of the attacks. International organizations, rights groups, and fleeing self-identifying Rohingya say the military and local Arakanese are behind the arson. The military and government says the culprits are militants and even the Muslim homeowners themselves. \nCivilian Deaths Allegedly by Militants \nAlthough ARSA has denied targeting civilians, The Irrawaddy reporters have spoke with Hindus who have given first-hand accounts of an ARSA attack. In addition to Hindus, this bar graph shows the rising number of Muslims and Arakanese reportedly killed by militants prior to the Aug. 25 attacks. Infogram \nAbductions in Northern Rakhine State \nThese are the numbers of Hindus, Muslims and Arakanese believed to have been abducted by ARSA for collaborating with the government from 2016 October to 2017 October. Infogram \nRakhine Crisis Death Toll \nThe death toll among ARSA fighters, civilians and government troops based on statistics collected by the UN and the government. Infogram \nExodus of Muslims and non-Muslims \nMilitant violence has displaced nearly 30,000 non-Muslims in Maungdaw district\u2014mainly Arakanese sub-ethnic groups Mro, Thet and Daingnet as well as Hindus. Meanwhile, more than 603,000 self-identifying Rohingyas\u2014locally known as \u201cBengalis\u201d\u2014have fled to Bangladesh to escape military clearance operations. \nWithin a few weeks of Aug. 25, the total number of Muslim refugees climbed to a half million on the Bangladeshi border. The Irrawaddy visualizes the beginnings of the mass exodus in the following map using UN statistics. \nRefugee Elsewhere \nMyanmar\u2019s problem of internally displaced people (IDPs) and refugees is not only confined to Rakhine State. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre documented in 2014 an increase of 140,000 IDPs after 2012 communal riot in Rakhine State. \nMoreover, civil wars between the government army and dozens of ethnic armed organizations have resulted in at least 500,000 IDPs in Shan, Kachin, Karen, Mon, Kaya, Bago, and Tanitharyi areas in 2014. \nReferences Locations of ARSA attacks on 25 August obtained from a map shared on the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s Office Facebook page.

Thaung Htike Soe argued against the proposal, saying that the current fiscal year has been practised for the past 40 years, and the change would lead to inconvenience. \n\u201cUnder the current fiscal year, we can disburse agricultural loans to farmers, which constitute 70 percent of the country\u2019s population, prior to the cultivation season [before the rainy season],\u201d he said. \n\u201cNow we share the same fiscal year with Japan, one of our donors, and we therefore can receive assistance from it. With the current fiscal year, we don\u2019t need to change the Union budget law,\u201d he said. \nU Thaung Aye, USDP MP in the Lower House, spoke of the risks of scrapping an established system. \n\u201cWhen the new government took office, it reduced the number of existing ministers and combined some ministries. So it was difficult to know the real situation of each department,\u201d he said. \n\u201cPeople now are facing financial hardship, limited job opportunities and climate change so it is not yet a good time to change the fiscal year.\u201d \nAccording to the President\u2019s proposal, the new fiscal year allows construction work to be started immediately after the beginning of the fiscal year and continued for eight consecutive dry months. \nHowever, Maj. Thaung Htike Soe said the current fiscal year keeps balance because construction works can be divided into two periods in a project\u2019s lifecycle\u2014six months for preparation and procurement of materials, and another six months for implementing the operation. \nThe President\u2019s proposal also argued that the beginning of the budget year is immediately followed by Thingyan public holidays under the current fiscal year system. \nHowever, Maj. Thaung Htike Soe said Thingyan public holidays have been reduced to five days as of this year, and that period has no significant impact on functions of the fiscal year. \n\u201cWhen a fiscal year starts doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is people and departments. If departments which are responsible for administration of the country and all the people can perform their duties in unity and in line with rules and regulations, there won\u2019t be any difficulty,\u201d said U Aung Min, chairman of the Lower House Public Accounts Committee. \nCurrently, 12 countries including the United States of America, Thailand and Laos practise the Oct-Sept fiscal year. \nTranslated from Burmese by Thet Ko Ko.
