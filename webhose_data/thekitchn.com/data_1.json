I've made my fair share, to be sure. For the life of me I still can't get that cheek kiss thing right \u2014 how many, and which side was it first? \nHere are some tips to keep in mind from someone who's learned the hard way, plus a few friends who either live in or travel frequently to Europe. 1. Use your library voice. \nPlease, for the love of all that is holy, turn down the volume. I don't know why we talk so loudly in America, but boy do our voices boom in the cathedrals, museums, and cozy restaurants of Europe. \nStop and listen to a conversation between, I dunno, a couple of Brits. Take mental note of their volume on a scale of one to 10. Now go stand by the Americans. See? You don't even have to be close to pick up every word of their conversation. \nJust go more for library voice than gym voice and you'll be fine. 2. Use social niceties when asking where the toilets are. \nMy friend Jesse studied in Paris and shared this tidbit: Americans have the tendency to jump right in a conversation with a stranger and they find this jarring in France. \nAmerican way: \"Hey do you know where the restroom is?\" \nParisian way: \"Excusez-moi, o\u00f9 sont les toilettes?\" (There is always some kind of \"excuse me\" or \"sorry to bother you.\") 3. G reet shopkeepers when you enter a store and say goodbye when you leave . \nIt's quite rude to not acknowledge them, plus, the greeting gives you a chance to strike up a conversation. Chatting with a shopkeeper could lead to any number of wonderful discoveries (such as the best gelato nearby) and it can just be fun! \nWarning: You may find when you come back home that it feels incredibly weird to not do this. 4. Treat your server like a professional. \nThere is a laundry list of rules that vary from country to country. In general, treat your server like a professional, which they are, and never gesture, snap your fingers, or otherwise treat them as subservient. (For that matter, please don't do that anywhere.) (Image credit: Liz Clayman ) 5. Don't ask for substitutions or doggie bags; do ask for the bill. \nIn most countries, don't try to deviate from the menu; a fine Parisian restaurant is not the place to ask for a side of ranch dressing or to sub the chef's vegetable of choice. Diana, a friend in Italy, tells me substitutions are more likely to be acceptable there, if requested politely. \nOh, and don't ask for a doggie bag (although I totally saw my Airbnb host in Paris get away with taking leftovers \u2026 for the chickens at her castle in the countryside!) \nTake note that you do have to ask for the bill; they find it rude to rush you by offering it. Another Italian asterisk here: Diana says, \"It's custom to go to the front desk to pay in Italy \u2014 even in nice restaurants. The staff really does not want to bother you.\" 6. Don't overtip. \nAs weird as this feels to us, big tips are not the norm. \"A small tip is appreciated in restaurants, but it can be just rounding up the bill,\" Diana says. Sure enough, I've seen a family at a restaurant in the French countryside leave 100 euros for a 98 euro tab (I'm not that nosy; the tables are just super close!) 7. Don't touch the produce at the market . \nYes, I know, here at home we touch and caress and poke and prod fruits and veggies within an inch of their life before we commit to buying them. But try that at your own risk at a market in Europe. If you do want to handle something, grocers in Italy will give you a plastic glove, Diana says. 8. Let people exit the trains before entering. \nThis one comes from my friend Iain from Paris, but file it under \"applies anywhere\": Let people exit the trains before entering. Another metro tip: Stay on the right side of the escalator if you are not going to climb. 9. Do not assume everyone speaks English. \nEven better, learn a few phrases before your trip: please, thank you, I'm sorry, you're welcome, excuse me, where is the bathroom, may I have, and do you speak English. \n(And when they say no, but they actually do, they weren't just punking you. Nobody likes to look bad, and though they might \u2014 and probably do \u2014 have amazing language skills, they could be self-conscious and think their English is too poor to use. Compliment them on it and thank them for speaking it.) 10. Try to have the right, or at least close, change. \nThis might seem random, but you're not going to make friends at the checkout when they have to break a 50 \u2014 maybe even a five \u2014 euro bill for your bottle of water. For sure they're going to grumble, and they may even refuse it. \nNow then, you're on your way to being a wonderful ambassador of your country. But what have we missed?

It turns all the flavors of the classic appetizer into a hearty, wholesome chili that'll warm you up on cool fall days. \nThis chili starts with cooked, shredded chicken, so the goal of making it in the slow cooker is to really build deep flavors. Plus, if you're bringing it to a potluck or leaving it out for hungry football fans, it's the perfect vessel for transporting the chili and keeping it warm. \nAll you have to do is add some veggies, spices, the chicken, beer, tomatoes, Buffalo wing sauce, and beans to your slow cooker and let everything cook on low for a few hours. Since you don't have to worry about raw chicken, you can be really flexible with the cooking time. \nThe most important step in this recipe is prepping the toppings, since dressing up a bowl of chili is the fun part, anyway. Set out extra wing sauce, grated cheddar, crumbled blue cheese, chopped green onion and chives, lime, sliced avocado, and tortilla chips and let everyone go wild. \nThe author also makes an ingenious suggestion for the chili: Put it over french fries with some melted cheese for the most delicious chili cheese fries you'll ever eat! \n\u2192 Get the Recipe : Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken Chili from How Sweet Eats More posts in Delicious Links", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "slow cooker buffalo chicken chili", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "buffalo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:37:45.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b1169a63b3dd6bd23e838c49b0170b6ad3eb2487", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRzaw5G.CMYuZ.WO7yRBhdymjpqOCq7CKl9GNQz_r8g2Sga0X9ks.fTOyJFzq6uXDFZk", "site_full": "www.thekitchn.com", "site": "thekitchn.com", "site_section": "http://www.thekitchn.com/main.rss", "site_categories": ["food", "desserts_and_baking"], "section_title": "Kitchn | Inspiring cooks, nourishing homes", "title": "Recipe: Drunken Chicken and Mushrooms \u2014 Wine and Dine", "title_full": "Recipe: Drunken Chicken and Mushrooms \u2014 Wine and Dine", "published": "2017-10-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://atmedia.imgix.net/30200b54fec12682ad1c0e0233b5ebbb76ca53ac?w=1500&amp;fit=max", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 651, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 66, "comments": 0, "shares": 66}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 109}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b1169a63b3dd6bd23e838c49b0170b6ad3eb2487", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRzaw5G.CMYuZ.WO7yRBhdymjpqOCq7CKl9GNQz_r8g2Sga0X9ks.fTOyJFzq6uXDFZk", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sheela Prakash", "published": "2017-10-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Recipe: Drunken Chicken and Mushrooms \u2014 Wine and Dine", "text": "(Image credit: Joe Lingeman/The Kitchn ) \nHere's my proposition to make boneless, skinless chicken breasts a whole lot more interesting: Get them drunk.

These chicken breasts are swimming in a fragrant shallot and tarragon wine sauce and paired with earthy mushrooms for a winning dinner any night of the week. (Image credit: Joe Lingeman/The Kitchn ) A Better Chicken Breast Dinner, Thanks to White Wine \nChicken breasts are a weeknight dinner staple for so many households because of their accessibility and ease, but the unfortunate truth is that more often than not they are cooked up to be dry and tasteless. Here, however, they are moist and succulent. That's because they're cooked in a healthy splash of white wine and chicken broth. The wine in particular helps tenderize the meat while infusing it with rich flavor. The result is a one-pan dinner that brings the ho-hum meat into a whole new light. (Image credit: Joe Lingeman/The Kitchn ) Wine and Dine: What to Drink \nIf you're getting the chicken drunk, you may as well pour a glass of that wine for yourself too. Pick up a bottle of unoaked Chardonnay to make this dish, and save what's left in the bottle after cooking to enjoy at the dinner table. While many think of Chardonnay as a buttery, vanilla-rich white wine, that's actually the style in which it is made rather than the Chardonnay itself. When it's not aged in oak barrels, the Chardonnay grapes make a lean, mineral-driven wine, which is an ideal counterpart to this not-too-heavy dish. 3 Bottles of Unoaked Chardonnay Under $15 Four Vines Naked Chardonnay, California, $9.79 Babich Chardonnay, New Zealand, $10.96 Joel Gott Unoaked Chardonnay, California, $14.99 Drunken Chicken and Mushrooms \n1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut crosswise into 1-inch-thick pieces Kosher salt ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dine", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joe lingeman/the kitchn", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "drunken chicken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "better chicken breast dinner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babich chardonnay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white wine  chicken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joel gott unoaked chardonnay", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:08:36.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "001077767e2b3a4db341cc6705f8d803c3dcb717", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRzaYw_qeAU33dd7_DaM_YKMkz35MUP0qq_GB1MVaI8RvbiE0YMCyM.CyNloxRFShvrtrMcGTUOzDG7BFaUGdjt32A--", "site_full": "www.thekitchn.com", "site": "thekitchn.com", "site_section": "http://www.thekitchn.com/index.xml", "site_categories": ["food", "desserts_and_baking"], "section_title": "Kitchn | Inspiring cooks, nourishing homes", "title": "Microwaving Your Sponge Causes Fires, but This Won\u2019t \u2014 Shopping", "title_full": "Microwaving Your Sponge Causes Fires, but This Won\u2019t \u2014 Shopping", "published": "2017-10-03T16:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://atmedia.imgix.net/af2fa516aa6a03a12405a05ba889df18cb9eec2f?w=1500&amp;fit=max", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 651, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 24, "comments": 0, "shares": 24}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 9}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "001077767e2b3a4db341cc6705f8d803c3dcb717", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRzaYw_qeAU33dd7_DaM_YKMkz35MUP0qq_GB1MVaI8RvbiE0YMCyM.CyNloxRFShvrtrMcGTUOzDG7BFaUGdjt32A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lisa Freedman", "published": "2017-10-03T16:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Microwaving Your Sponge Causes Fires, but This Won\u2019t \u2014 Shopping", "text": "Share \nIf you've heard it once this year, you've heard it a million times: Sponges are disgusting, bacteria-ridden pieces of cellulose. (By some estimates , they are dirtier than toilet seats!) And while you used to zap them in the microwave to kill said bacteria, we all learned this summer that doing so is actually pretty ineffective . While the microwave can nuke weaker bacteria, it has no effect on stronger species. Even more, it's pretty easy to start a fire in there if your sponge isn't wet enough. \nCool. Even cooler? The fact there's basically no good alternative. Microfiber cloths actually suck up more bacteria because they're so porous. Bristled brushes tend to harbor less bacteria, but they're not as effective at getting food off of dishes. \nSo we've just been sticking with our sponges. We try to swap them out every week or so, but they still end up feeling a little gross after a few uses. Which is why we are so excited to learn about this new product. (Image credit: SpongeBath ) \nBuy: SpongeBath System , $39 for a two-month kit \nThe SpongeBath System, touted as the first dual-purpose sponge holder that both cleans and stores your sponge, comes with a holder and a patent-pending concentrated cleaning solution that is said to kill 99.99 percent of odor-causing bacteria like E. coli and Staphylococcus Aureus. (The solution is made with all-natural and food-grade ingredients including citric acid and malic acid.) A quick 10-minute soak gets the job done, although the site suggests letting the sponge soak in the cleaning solution whenever you're not using it. \nSimply fill the holder with one ounce of the concentrate and enough water to cover your sponge. Refill the holder as needed \u2014 it will typically be about once a week. \nWe'd still probably change out our sponges on a weekly basis and then just keep the sponge in the bath the rest of the time. It doesn't kill 100 percent of the bacteria, but 99.99 percent is pretty close. And honestly, we'd be interested in the SpongeBath even if it only killed 60 percent!

File them in a cabinet. \nUse a basic, non-tiered file organizer to turn that cavernous space above the fridge into a neatly organized baking zone.

Here is a step-by-step recipe and guide to help you cook perfect acorn squash every time. (Image credit: Kelli Foster ) How to Cut an Acorn Squash in Half \nAcorn squashes aren't quite as tough and formidable as butternut squashes, but you need to use a chef's knife to cut this squash in half, or at least another heavy-duty knife that has some real heft to it. A paring knife is not going to do the trick. \nHave your chef's knife? Okay, good \u2014 now the trick is to start on one side of the stem and cut straight through the squash (not the stem; don't even try to cut through the stem) until the knife stops meeting resistance and you've cut through to the hollow middle. Continue cutting around the side of the acorn, through the tip, then around the other side, ending up on the other side of the stem. \nThen, grab the squash with your big, strong hands, and pull it apart. As you pull apart the sides, the squash will split to one side of the stem. You can trim the stem out at this point, but I usually just leave it in. (Image credit: Kelli Foster ) Beyond Salt and Pepper \nOnce you've split the squash and scooped out the seeds (which you should definitely save for roasting later ), then all that's left to do is rub the squash halves with a little olive oil or butter and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. \nThis makes a delicious meal all on its own, but you needn't stop at just the standard S&P. Try sprinkling on a few teaspoons of your favorite spice or mix of spices \u2014 garam masala is a favorite of mine. You could also add a scoop of brown sugar, or nestle a few garlic cloves into the bowl of each squash half. \nWant to transform this simple side dish into a full-blown meal? Then stuff it! Leftover vegetables, shredded meat, a scoop of grains or some bread crumbs, and a little cheese \u2014 stuff all that in the bowl of the squash and roast away. Here's more info about how to get in on that squashy action: (Image credit: Kelli Foster ) 5 Things You Can Do with Roasted Acorn Squash \nSure, this makes a great side dish, but once you have that acorn squash roasted, there are a surprising number of ways you can use it. Soup : Scoop all the flesh from the squash and either chop it into large chunks for a brothy soup, or pur\u00e9e it for a creamy soup. Casseroles : Layer the scooped squash into a lasagna or toss it into your favorite casserole, along with the rest of the ingredients. Here's how to make a simple pasta bake with whatever ingredients you have on hand. Hearty salads : Toss big chunks of the leftover squash in with the rest of your salad fixings for lunch tomorrow. Pasta dinner: Squash and pasta are great together. Add some brown butter and sage, and you have the perfect mid-week comfort food. Put it in (or on) a crust: Squash-stuffed calzones ? Squash-topped pizza ? Squash-filled quesadillas ? Don't knock it until you try it. While prepping the acorn squash, heat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Place a rack in the bottom third of the oven.

Enter: the freezer marinade, when you bring that meat home from the grocery store toss it in a marinade first and freeze it right in it. It will absorb the marinade whenever you decide to thaw it, and then all you have to do is bake, saut\u00e9, or grill it. This is a weeknight dinner game-changer. How to Use Freezer Marinades \nThis seriously couldn't be easier. Just combine your marinade ingredients in a zip-top freezer bag, add the raw chicken or pork, seal it, squish things around a bit to coat the meat, and then toss the bag in the freezer. The marinated meat will keep well there for up to nine months . \nWhen you want to us the meat, thaw the meat overnight in the fridge and cook it however you prefer \u2014 baking or grilling both work well. You won't have to tack on extra cooking time for marinated meat \u2014 just follow your preferred method and use an instant-read thermometer to check for doneness. When inserted into the thickest part of the meat, it should register 165\u00b0F for chicken and 145\u00b0F for pork. (Image credit: Joe Lingeman/The Kitchn ) The Formula: Meat + Marinade + Cook It Your Way \nThese five marinades are measured out for 1/2 pound (8 ounces) of boneless, skinless chicken breast or pork tenderloin. That's roughly one serving of meat. Scale up as needed to feed your crowd. (Image credit: Joe Lingeman/The Kitchn ) 1. Maple Mustard \nTangy mustard and sweet maple syrup make for a balanced marinade that's tart and sweet. Combine 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard with 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard, 1 tablespoon maple syrup , 1/2 tablespoon apple cider vinegar , and a big pinch of salt . Serve the meat with mashed potatoes and roasted broccoli to make it a meal. (Image credit: Joe Lingeman/The Kitchn ) 2. Lemon Pesto \nPesto can be a whole lot more than an easy sauce for pasta. As a base of a marinade it delivers an herby, garlicky punch to the meat \u2014 a little bit of lemon juice added to it gives it tang. Just mix 3 tablespoons of store-bought basil pesto with 1 tablespoon lemon juice , 1/2 tablespoon olive oil , and a big pinch of salt . The meat becomes a simple, Italian-slanted meal when served alongside a caprese salad \u2014 and any leftovers are great tucked into a sandwich the next day. (Image credit: Joe Lingeman/The Kitchn ) 3. Chili Garlic \nGive your chicken or pork a hot kick by bolstering a marinade with fiery sambal oelek or Asian chili-garlic sauce , and then tame the heat by serving the cooked meat over rice. Combine 3 tablespoons tamari or soy sauce with 1/2 tablespoon grated or minced fresh ginger , 1 tablespoon sambal oelek or Asian chili-garlic sauce , and 1/2 tablespoon Asian sesame oil . The spicy meat is great over sesame noodles (or these cucumber noodles , if you want to keep things gluten-free). (Image credit: Joe Lingeman/The Kitchn ) 4. Yogurt Garam Masala \nYogurt makes for an incredible base for a marinade, as it tenderizes the meat. And the Indian spice blend garam masala (which contains cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, cumin, coriander, nutmeg, and peppercorns) lends a warm, aromatic touch. Stir together 1/4 cup whole-milk yogurt with 1 teaspoon garam masala , 1/2 tablespoon olive oil , and a big pinch of salt . Serve the meat with naan and something green, like these Kerala spiced peas . (Image credit: Joe Lingeman/The Kitchn ) 5. Sweet and Sour \nForget calling your favorite Chinese restaurant for a takeout order of sweet and sour chicken or pork and make an easy version at home instead. Just mix together 2 tablespoons pineapple juice with 1 tablespoon rice vinegar , 1 tablespoon brown sugar , and 2 teaspoons soy sauce . Then serve the meat over cooked rice and grab the chopsticks.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "samantha bolton", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joe lingeman/the kitchn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yogurt garam masala  yogurt", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kerala", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:32:00.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c2f2e371d6263f9400778196f639a5e044a890f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRza6RzsNi8LU6OY8s2W8ugKCFwC_ZWUeGSgH0qtPbh4a3t6Im65.1NwY8ozBaMZGkk1", "site_full": "www.thekitchn.com", "site": "thekitchn.com", "site_section": "http://www.thekitchn.com/main.rss", "site_categories": ["food", "desserts_and_baking"], "section_title": "Kitchn | Inspiring cooks, nourishing homes", "title": "7 Lazy, Veggie-Packed Dinner Ideas \u2014 Recipes from The Kitchn", "title_full": "7 Lazy, Veggie-Packed Dinner Ideas \u2014 Recipes from The Kitchn", "published": "2017-10-03T22:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://atmedia.imgix.net/679ee626acb27afe3e34df6c04a830c664c7608e?w=1500&amp;fit=max", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 651, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 193, "comments": 0, "shares": 193}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 24}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c2f2e371d6263f9400778196f639a5e044a890f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRza6RzsNi8LU6OY8s2W8ugKCFwC_ZWUeGSgH0qtPbh4a3t6Im65.1NwY8ozBaMZGkk1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sheela Prakash", "published": "2017-10-03T22:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "7 Lazy, Veggie-Packed Dinner Ideas \u2014 Recipes from The Kitchn", "text": "4.

If you're a traveler who uses the platform, you're gonna wanna know about this. \nFor years, hosts like me have assigned star ratings to guests in three categories: cleanliness, communication, and observance of house rules; this is in addition to their overall rating, and of course the review itself. But those star ratings weren't public \u2014 until now. \nHosts who allow instant bookings (Airbnb's favorite toy, although not beloved by many hosts ) now have access to the star ratings of our booked guests. At least, I can confirm that I do, as of last night, and I'm seeing other hosts sit up and take note , too. (Image credit: Dana McMahan ) \nSo, why is this such a big deal? you might ask. \nWhile hosts live in mortal dread of a bad review or anything less than a five-star rating, guests could practically slaughter a pig in the kitchen for dinner with impunity because of this fact: Hosts don't like to leave bad reviews because it could deter future guests from booking with them. \nInstead, we agonize over every word of a review meant to warn future hosts about a bad experience without coming off like a meanie to future guests . Then we ding the troublemaker in the star ratings, which, until now never saw light of day. \nBut the truth is in the stars. Anything less than a five on house rules or cleanliness is going to be a huge red flag.

Fortunately it wasn't an official holiday so my husband was able to run out and get one from Target, but it's a great example of overlooking the obvious in all my holiday preparations. \nMy point? Don't be like me! If you're planning on roasting a turkey for Thanksgiving (or a chicken, or a roast, or really anything else big!) a proper roasting pan with a rack is a fabulous addition to your kitchen. From high (copper, ooh la la) to a seriously great budget option, here are five we love, on sale at Sur la Table right now. Loading Shopping Roundup... High to Low: Thanksgiving Roasting Pans Mauviel M'tradition Roaster , $270 : The ultimate splurge! A classic French-style copper roasting pan. Note that this does not come with a rack, so you'll have to spend even more to buy one separately. Demeyere Industry5 Roasting Pan , $160 : I am a huge fan of Demeyere; their pans are well-weighted and super long-lasting. A splurge, but a pleasure to use every day. Sur la Table Tri-Ply Stainless Steel Roasting Pan , $111 : A handsome mid-price option. Sur la Table Hard-Anodized Roasting Pan with Nonstick Rack and Bonus Lifters , $60 : A solid price for a very solid and practical roasting pan. This is similar to the one I have personally and it has performed beautifully, including on the stovetop for gravy-making. Chicago Metallic Roasting Pan With Rack , $30 : This is a small pan; it probably won't fit a full-sized turkey, but for those of you planning on a turkey breast it's a smaller, more practical everyday size. \nTip : Most of these pans (with the exception of the final option) are at least 16x13 inches \u2014 a standard size for your average 13- to 15-pound bird.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "low", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sur la table tri-ply stainless steel roasting pan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago metallic roasting pan with rack", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sur la table", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:11:24.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad31978f2ff1caf995198606bf40e7e234205dd5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRzaDlcIW6ubSF307KAiTqvUQtNjF2Ey1FWynFwkZ0JU82pOf237fm1SYoyKq9rlE2xz", "site_full": "www.thekitchn.com", "site": "thekitchn.com", "site_section": "http://www.thekitchn.com/main.rss", "site_categories": ["food", "desserts_and_baking"], "section_title": "Kitchn | Inspiring cooks, nourishing homes", "title": "10 Easy Dinners That Are Mostly Vegetables \u2014 Recipes from The Kitchn", "title_full": "10 Easy Dinners That Are Mostly Vegetables \u2014 Recipes from The Kitchn", "published": "2017-10-03T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://atmedia.imgix.net/909ddd136204e804c4659777e53268ff5d580f1a?w=1500&amp;fit=max", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 651, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 194, "comments": 0, "shares": 194}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 12}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad31978f2ff1caf995198606bf40e7e234205dd5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRzaDlcIW6ubSF307KAiTqvUQtNjF2Ey1FWynFwkZ0JU82pOf237fm1SYoyKq9rlE2xz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sheela Prakash", "published": "2017-10-03T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "10 Easy Dinners That Are Mostly Vegetables \u2014 Recipes from The Kitchn", "text": "Open Roundup \nI try to make vegetables the star of the show most of the time when I am thinking about what to make for dinner.

Us? Well, we will basically only consider a costume if it's vaguely food-related. \nWe made these costumes a few years ago for a party we were throwing, and they still totally hold up. \nAll of them were designed to be relatively easy (and not too expensive) to make. None require more than a quick trip to the fabric or hardware store for some super-basic equipment. Take a look. (Image credit: Alexis Buryk ) 1. Sriracha Jumped the Shark \nIt's true: Sriracha has reached maximum cultural saturation. The condiment now flavors everything from potato chips to ice cream. You can be this totally ubiquitous hot sauce with a couple of yards of inexpensive faux leather, a paint pen, and an inflatable shark. Not feeling very crafty? You can also buy an already made Sriracha T-shirt because, well, the condiment has jumped the shark. (Image credit: Alexis Buryk ) 2. Captain Kale \nFaster than a speeding Magic Bullet, more powerful than a stand mixer, he's one of the founding members of the League of Super Foods. He's Captain Kale!

Quinoa Woman \nWhile your friends dress up as Wonder Woman, you can be a more original Quinoa Woman! She's an earthy feminine goddess member of the League of Super Foods. All you need is some burlap, cardboard, and a whole lotta pom-pom trim. (Image credit: Alexis Buryk ) 4. A Funfetti Mug Cake \nWhat's trendier than a mug cake? A Funetti mug cake! You'll need a shower curtain and two feet of plumbing tubing. Beyond that, this costume is actually incredibly easy to pull off. And you don't even need a microwave! (Image credit: Alexis Buryk ) 5.

Cut butternut squash in half at the neck. \nIf you're cubing butternut squash to be roasted or tossed into a soup, the easiest way to tackle this tough squash is by first slicing it crosswise, across the neck. This leaves the squash with two smaller, easier-to-manage pieces to continue working with. 4. For easier cutting, heat squash in the microwave first. \nCutting into harder winter squash, be it butternut, kabocha, or spaghetti squash, always feels a little nerve-racking. The simplest way to make this task a whole lot easier is by scoring the squash around the outside, then microwaving it for five minutes. This little bit of prep softens the flesh and lessens the battle against your chef's knife. (Image credit: Kelli Foster ) 5. If it's just too tough to cut, cook it whole. \nIf cutting any type of hard winter squash feels too troublesome, just cook it whole instead, either in the oven or the slow cooker .

Nuts can be used raw or roasted; roasting will add a toasty, nutty depth to the bars. If desired, roast the nuts at 350\u00b0F for 10 to 12 minutes, until fragrant and golden. Allow to cool before using. (See: How to Roast Nuts in the Oven .) Combine the nuts, dried fruit, and dates in a food processor. Combine all the ingredients in a food processor. Pulse a few times just to break them up. Separate the dates if they start to clump together. Process continuously for 30 seconds. By this point, the ingredients should all have broken down into crumb-sized pieces. Scrape the edges of the bowl and beneath the blade to make sure nothing is sticking. Process continuously until a ball is formed, 1 to 2 minutes. Continue processing for another 1 to 2 minutes, until the ingredients clump together and gather into a ball. Press into a thick square and chill. Lay a piece of plastic wrap or wax paper on your work surface and dump the dough on top. Press the dough with your hands until it forms a thick square, roughly 8\"x8\" in size. Wrap and chill for at least an hour or overnight. Divide into bars. Unwrap the chilled dough and transfer to a cutting board. Cut into 8 large bars or 16 small squares, as desired. Wrap each bar in plastic wrap or wax paper. Store the bars. Store the bars in the fridge for several weeks or in the freezer for up to 3 months. The bars can be eaten straight from the fridge or freezer and will be firm, but chewy. Room-temperature bars are perfectly fine to eat and can be kept in a lunch bag or backpack all day, but will be more soft and paste-like.

And while they tend to be more on the snug side compared to other designs, they're not all that bad. For one, they make it easy to hide your mess (you can't say the same for covetable open-concept kitchens!). They also hold the potential for lots of smart storage. \nIf you happen to be the proud (or not-so-proud?) home cook in a galley kitchen, you might be able to put some of these brilliant ideas to good use. (Image credit: Melanie Rieders ) 1. Use windowsills as shelves. \nIdeally, your galley kitchen has at least one window. It's great for letting light into the room (obviously), but it also creates a makeshift bookshelf. Line up your cookbooks on the windowsill and that'll free up some counter or cabinet space. (Image credit: Apartment Therapy ) 2. Add a breakfast bar. \nWhen you're trying to cook up a storm in a small kitchen, furniture can become a big obstacle. The solution? Turn a shelf into a breakfast bar. It's narrow so it won't protrude too much. You can also consider a fold-out table that can be packed away when not in use. (Image credit: sfgirlbybay ) 3. Take advantage of the tops of your cabinets. \nIf your cabinets are full, look to the tops of them. This kitchen, which was featured on SF Girl by Bay , barely takes advantage, but you get the idea. Keep your large serving platters up there and anything you don't use all that often. (Image credit: Ben Pentreath ) 4. Put storage racks wherever possible. \nThis room by Ben Pentreath has plenty of stuff in it \u2014 without feeling cluttered.

Aside from learning how to be fashionably late and to take pleasure in friendly debate, being an expat has greatly informed my habits and values. The most notable impact has been on my relationship with and approach to food (for which I am extremely grateful). \nHere are five ways living in France has shaped my culinary values. 1. I eat everything in moderation. \nThis oft-bandied-about platitude is, for many, a means of assuaging feelings of guilt after overindulgence. In France, it's heeded the way it was intended. And for me, it meant radically shifting the way I ate. \nWithin a couple months of moving to France 10 years ago, I quickly gained 10 pounds. It was entirely the result of succumbing to temptation one too many times \u2014 several times a day. Everything was novel and enticing, and my brain was operating under the eventuality that my stay would be short-lived. Plus, I needed a break from my eating habits in the States, influenced, consciously or not, by women's magazines, celebrity culture, and a widespread emphasis on dieting. \nEventually, I got my early 20-something self off the croissant-chocolate-steak diet (which flatters no one) and I put un peu de tout (a little of everything) into practice. Thanks in part to living with a Frenchman who lived by that philosophy innately, I barred the word \"sacrifice\" from my food vocabulary. \nThese days, chocolate, butter, salt, and cream are as fundamental to my diet as vegetables, fruit, legumes and meat \u2014 and I can't imagine it any other way. 2. I'm more discerning about where I source my food. \nCall it snobbery or call it appreciating what I consume \u2014 either way, you will no longer find me noshing on mediocre bread, sweets, snacks, or anything just because it's readily available or more convenient. Now not even nostalgia can make Hersey's chocolate taste good again \u2014 especially when I have the work of talented chocolate masters at arm's reach (I'm looking at you, Nicolas Cloiseau, La Maison du Chocolat). \nI learned this directly from my mother-in-law, who would only buy her cheese from a specific cheesemonger at her local farmers market and would travel to the other side of town for top-quality bread. \nI've also spent enough time speaking with food artisans, chefs, and restaurateurs for my work to have an awareness of the impact of making a more discerning choice. Buying from an affineur, a local baker who upholds artisanal traditions, or a greengrocer who is transparent about her sourcing and knowledgeable about her products means making a conscious decision to support small businesses and champion savoir-faire and craftsmanship. Jun 1, 2017 at 5:20am PDT 3. I take the time to eat, \u00e0 table. \nWhile the two-hour lunch break may soon be a thing of legend, the emphasis on quality time around the table outside of work hours has never been more valued. Almost all of my food memories in France have been tied to the table and the joy of being with the people seated around it. \nThose epic, all-day weekend lunches or late-night dinners were daunting initially, but I've come to treat them as escapes (from email, from work, from everything that can and should be put on hold) and necessary reminders to slow down and enjoy what I'm eating and who I am with. And it's from those moments that I'm best able to recall particular dishes and flavors. 4. I shop more often and eat fresher. \nMy husband and I stock up on non-perishables and basics, but always make several stops throughout the week for everything else, from produce to fish to meat. And it's not because our refrigerator in Paris is only marginally larger than the one I had in my dorm room in college; my in-laws, who have a standard-size refrigerator, also make several trips throughout the week (a habit my husband says he remembers as a kid, even when both of his parents held full-time jobs). \nWe do it for optimal freshness and also to reduce waste. When I learned that nearly 10 million tons of food waste are produced in France per year , a large portion of which come from unopened, still-consumable products, I wanted to be sure that our household wasn't contributing to the problem. 5. I eat and enjoy foods that I would never have eaten before. \nWhile my family in the United States bemoan the distance between us, they can't help but applaud my decision to move to and stay in France. To describe my eating habits and food proclivities in the first 20 years of my life as fussy or myopic would be doing me a kindness. I was evidently bad enough that not even my parents managed to enforce change. \nIn coming to Paris, where diving headfirst into gastronomy was key to immersing myself in the local culture (and impressing the man I would later marry), I had no choice but to shake off my issues. From a range of vegetables (you name it, I probably didn't eat it before) to meat, fish, sauces, herbs, spices, and grains, I discovered everything I was missing in life before and with the best school possible. \nThe ingredients in France are largely what attract foreign chefs from all corners of the world to come train and work in the country. Between putting my plate in the hands of some of the country's most talented chefs and trying new (to me) foods in the comfort of friends and family, my palate truly came alive in France. And in no time, food (and pastry) became the object of my enduring fascination.

Encased meats, starchy noodle and potato dishes, and pickled things \u2014 it's not exactly the sexiest food. Although, I might argue, what's not to love about encased meats, starchy noodle and potato dishes, and pickled things? (Not to mention, there's a whole lot more to German food.) \nRegardless of your feelings about German food in general, there is one German food tradition that is completely ingenious: Abendbrot . What Is Abendbrot? \nAbendbrot translates as \"evening bread.\" It used to be \u2014 although not so much anymore \u2014 that the big hot meal of the day was lunch, often served at the office cafeteria (it's still true that many German businesses have their own cafeterias and that they are a much bigger deal here than in the States). Full from a heavy lunch of meat and potatoes, this meant that dinner was an easy fix: bread with butter and sliced meat, cheese, and vegetables. A post shared by Laura (@lauramaryluu) on Sep 27, 2017 at 5:59am PDT \nOkay, this could seem really underwhelming, but hear me out \u2014 there are (at least) three reasons why Abendbrot is so great. 3 Reasons Abendbrot Is the Perfect Dinner It's like going to your favorite neighborhood wine bar. With a great fresh loaf of dark, whole-grain bread, a collection of cheeses, and sliced meats like cured ham and mortadella, Abendbrot feels like ordering the cheese plate at your favorite wine bar and then feeling no guilt about letting that be dinner. It takes the edge off . There's something about assembling your own open-faced radish-and-butter sandwiches that encourages lingering over the dinner table rather than laboring over the stove. Conversations about the day flow easily into the evening. Abendbrot takes the edge off. It makes breakfast a piece of cake (or bread, rather). The other great thing about Abendbrot is that keeping its components in the house leaves you ready for breakfast. \"Continental breakfast\" might conjure images of a croissant and cappuccino, but there is nothing light or hurried about a traditional German breakfast: a huge, packed table of fresh rolls, butter, jams, meat and cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and cut-up vegetables. Maybe, let's be real, a bottle of cheap sparkling wine . Brunch: Yet Another Thing Germans Do Well \nWhich brings me to another thing Germans do really well: brunch. \nI had associated hosting brunch with baking multiple sweet and savory casseroles, but a German brunch keeps the food prep during the bleary morning hours to a minimum (yes!). \nGerman brunch requires nothing more than being able to run to the bakery for rolls and artfully set out boards heavy with Gouda, liverwurst, or smoked trout. Well, maybe you have to do one more thing: equally distribute the dishes so that no one has to fight over the last roll. \nWho would have thought that German food would provide the perfect answer to the perpetual search for quick and easy weeknight and weekend meals?

This version hits all the same notes, but is decidedly much more weeknight- and budget-friendly. Savory ground beef is cooked with mushrooms, onions, and noodles all in one pot, then held together by a tangy, creamy sauce for a dinner you can make in under an hour. Making This a One-Pot Wonder \nIn this dish, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, onions, and ground beef get that iconic hit of paprika and a surprise dollop of Dijon mustard. Then comes the best part: After the beef broth goes in, egg noodles are added and cooked directly in the sauce for both maximum flavor absorption and the glorious knowledge that you don't need to pull out another pot. \nFor the finishing touch, tangy Greek yogurt replaces the standard sour cream to make that creamy sauce we all know and love in stroganoff. It may seem a bit of a strange ingredient in stroganoff, but it still adds the same tang that sour cream does, and it's something I always have in the refrigerator, saving me from having to buy a tub of sour cream just for one recipe. This recipe isn't traditional, but it brings the same comforting flavors all together in one pot. (Image credit: Joe Lingeman/The Kitchn ) Cooking Efficiently \nTo make the cooking process as efficient as possible, start cooking your mushrooms, then use that time to chop up the onion and garlic. After the beef goes in, measure the rest of the ingredients out so they're ready to go when the beef is cooked. Egg noodles cook quicker than most other pastas, so make sure to keep an eye on them and give one a taste at the six-minute mark. If the noodle is just tender, you're ready to add the finishing touch of yogurt! One-Pot Weeknight Beef Stroganoff \n3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, stems trimmed and sliced 1/4 inch thick 1 medium yellow onion, small dice 2 medium garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 pound lean ground beef 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 4 cups (1 quart) low-sodium beef broth 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 8 ounces dried egg noodles 3/4 cup whole milk Greek yogurt 1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves (optional) \nMelt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring rarely, until browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl and set aside. \nReduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. When the butter has melted, add the onion and garlic, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the beef, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook, breaking the meat into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon and stirring occasionally, until just cooked through and no longer pink, 6 to 8 minutes. \nSprinkle in the flour and paprika. Cook, stirring frequently, until the raw flavor has cooked off the flour, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add the broth and mustard and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. \nAdd the noodles and reserved mushrooms along with their accumulated juices and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally and making sure the noodles are always mostly submerged in liquid, until the noodles are just cooked through and tender, about 6 to 8 minutes. \nRemove from the heat and stir in the yogurt until completely incorporated. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. Sprinkle with the parsley if desired and serve immediately.

So, when it came time for us to plan our next girls' trip, we decided on Sonoma. We blocked off four days and flew out to California for eating, drinking, and taking in the breathtaking landscape. \nHere's what we learned along the (delicious) way. Apr 25, 2017 at 4:11pm PDT 5 Tips for Planning the Perfect Wine Weekend 1. There's a right number of wineries to visit in a day. \nAnd that number is three. We learned this from taking Sonoma's wine trolley on our third day. The scenic six-hour tour took us to four different wineries and by the time we arrived at our last destination, VJB Cellars , we were more than ready to go back to our cottage for a siesta. 2. When in doubt, take an Uber. \nEven if you're drinking less than a glass at each tasting, if you're hitting three wineries in a day, that can add up. Luckily, many wine areas offer Uber, Lyft, or other car service options. 3. Ask about tasting fees in advance. \nTasting fees aren't cheap. We paid between $15 and $60, depending on the winery, the number of wines, and whether or not snacks were included. But some wineries will waive the tasting fees if you sign up for their wine club or purchase a certain number of bottles. Apr 26, 2017 at 1:41pm PDT 4. Skip the touristy spots. \nOne of our favorite wineries, Blue Farm , is an off-the-radar spot that was recommended to us by a friend of my mom's who lives in the area. In the quaint blue pump house on the property, we had a two-hour private tasting of delicious Burgundian grand cru-style Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, followed by a tour of the beautiful gardens. \nAnother top pick was Scribe Winery , which required a reservation and was also the most expensive of the trip ($60 per person). But it was totally worth it for our last few sips of wine in Sonoma \u2014 Scribe's Rose of Pinot Noir, Estate Chardonnay, Carneros Pinot Noir, and Cabernet Sauvignon \u2014 and a glorious seasonal spread of food (some of it grown at Scribe!). Apr 28, 2017 at 1:06pm PDT 5. Don't forget about the food! \nYou could fill your days with good wine and artisanal cheese boards, but many wine regions are also amazing food destinations. There's so much good food in Sonoma, but here are a few of my favorite spots. The Girl and the Fig : We loved the smoked trout salad with watercress, fris\u00e9e, cucumber, lemon, horseradish, and (wait for it!) crispy potato chips, and my mom loved her steak frites, prepared with plenty of garlic and butter. Sante : The ritzy restaurant tucked in the historic Sonoma Mission Inn wowed us with scallops with saffron-infused pearl pasta, mussels, manila clams, fennel, pickled peppers, chorizo, and a luscious lobster bordelaise sauce, and oh, dear me, slow-braised boneless Colorado lamb shank. Cafe La Haye : Opt for the specials \u2014 we had the daily risotto and quail with Broccolini and grains \u2014 at this cozy eatery off Sonoma's Napa Street. Oxbow Public Market : If you're up for a detour to Napa, you must visit this sprawling warehouse filled with an array food and wine vendors. We ate lunch at Hog Island Oysters so we could sample some of their famous bivalves. \nHave you been to Sonoma? Where are your favorite spots to eat & drink?

We've got all the recipes and resources you need if you are. And let's start with the basics: What does Whole30 involve, anyway? \nWhen it comes to what you can and can't eat on Whole30, the rules are pretty hard and fast, and there's a lot (including dairy, added sugar, and alcohol, whether for drinking or cooking) on the no-fly list. \nBut wait \u2014 this isn't just another diet. These things aren't considered \"bad.\" Not at all. Trigger Foods: Foods That Make Us Feel Not Great \nThe point is not, as you might assume, to punish you for the excesses of your summer of fun by ridding your diet of everything good and tasty. Nor is the message of Whole30 that these foods (which also include grains and legumes, plus anything that contains carrageenan, MSG, soy, and sulfites) are inherently bad. \nRather, the idea is that some of these foods might be triggers for you. Cheese may be behind your tummy trouble; soy may be the culprit when it comes to your runny nose. \nThe goal is to investigate how your body responds to certain foods, by first eliminating them and then slowly reinstating them after the 30 days are up. \nThe specifics can be a little tricky \u2014 for example, you can't eat peanuts but you can eat almonds \u2014 but it's not as complicated as it seems. To help you navigate your way through the dos and don'ts, here's a short guide to all the foods you can't eat during Whole30 and, more importantly, what you can eat during those 30 days. (You can also always see the rules for Whole30 on the program's website .) This stuff is out! (Image credit: Maria Siriano ) What You Can't Eat on Whole30 \nThis list may feel punitive, but it's not. And it's 30 days! You can do it! 1. Dairy \nThis means no cheese, cow milk, yogurt, cream, sour cream, kefir, and butter. The only exception to this rule is that you can have ghee . 2. Grains \nThis means no corn, rice, quinoa, wheat, rye, millet, sorghum, amaranth, buckwheat, bulgur, or sprouted grains. 3. Alcohol \nNo alcohol for cooking or drinking is to be consumed while doing Whole30. This includes vanilla extract. You can have something like kombucha, however, which does include a very minor amount of alcohol (as long as there isn't added sugar from outside of fruit juice). Read more about Kombucha restrictions here . 4. Legumes \nFor 30 days you can't eat beans of any kind, soy of any kind (including tofu, soy sauce, miso, edamame), chickpeas, peas, lentils, and peanuts. 5. Added Sugar \nDon't consume sugar that is real or artificial during the 30 days. This includes honey, maple syrup, agave, Splenda, xylitol, and Stevia. When it comes to grocery store finds, this one might be the trickiest to avoid. Common household ingredients \u2014 like Sriracha \u2014 include added sugar. You need to check the label on everything. 6. Carrageenan, MSG, and Sulfites \nAvoid processed foods while doing Whole30. If you see these three things on any ingredient list, it's out. 7. \"Junk\" Food \nThis means that you can't recreate your favorite junk food or baked good recipes even if they use Whole30-compliant ingredients. This is less to do with your physical reactions to food, and more to do with the mental side of things. Don't try to recreate \" pizza crust \" out of cauliflower, and don't make \" pancakes \" out of eggs and banana. Eat all this instead! (Image credit: Maria Siriano ) What You Can Eat on Whole30 \nAfter that pretty exhausting list of foods you can't eat, it might seem a little daunting to start the program. But there's still a bunch of delicious ingredients that can comprise a good \u2014 no, a great! \u2014 meal. 1. Vegetables \nEat vegetables \u2014 including potatoes! \u2014 to your heart's content. 2. Fruits \nFruits are allowed, in moderation. Remember that you're trying to limit your sugar intake during the 30 days. 3. Unprocessed Meats \nSausage is still okay, but check for added sugar and other off-limit preservatives. 4. Seafood \nFish and shellfish get the Whole30 nod of approval. 5. Eggs \nEggs will become your new breakfast bestie. 6. Nuts and seeds \nAll nuts and seeds are okay, with one exception: peanuts, because they are a legume. 7. Oils (some) and ghee \nJust say yes to olive oil and coconut oil. Ghee, which is a type of clarified butter, is also allowed. 8. Coffee \nYes, you can have coffee while on Whole30, but you can't add any milk products or sugar to lighten it up. Try making your own almond milk instead (with no sweeteners). The Golden Rule of Whole30 \nThe most important thing to remember when doing Whole30 is to check the label on everything you buy. A lot of everyday condiments and prepackaged goods have added sugar or additives that you might not be aware of. When in doubt, choose whole foods, especially vegetables, but also fruits, nuts, meats, and seafood. \n30 Days of Whole30: Why Whole30? It's not a permanent diet; it's not a prescription for eating. It's just 30 days of eating whole foods and exploring a more purposeful, mindful approach to food. Read more here on what Whole30 is and how to follow along.

And they can do it beautifully, too. Just look at this Airstream trailer, which is home to Natasha Lawyer and Brett Bashaw. Nicknamed the Tin Can Homestead , it's a marvel of smart, stylish storage. \nHere are seven smart storage ideas you should steal from their functional-yet-small kitchen and implement in your own tiny space. (Image credit: Ellie Arciaga Lillstrom ) 1. Use hooks. \nNatasha and Brett got a brass rail and hooks from Schoolhouse Electric to create a versatile hanging space for dish towels, greenery, gadgets, and more. Because the hooks aren't fixed, they can add or subtract them as needed. (Image credit: Ellie Arciaga Lillstrom ) 2. Put shelves in the corner. \nBy using an L-shaped shelf in the corner, the couple added a storage space for everyday bowls and glasses without making the space feel too cramped. Also note: There are more hooks on the bottom of the shelf to store coffee mugs! (Image credit: Ellie Arciaga Lillstrom ) 3. Add drawers to your cabinets. \nCabinets are the standard for kitchens, but it can be hard to reach the things in the way back \u2014 especially if you're in a narrow kitchen where you barely have space to bend down. Enter: pull-out drawers. I especially like these because they're deep (sometimes shallow pull-outs allow your stuff to flop all over). 4. Downsize your fridge. \nIf there are only two people in your house \u2014 and you mostly eat your produce right away \u2014 you might not need a full-sized fridge to store your food. These guys have a mini-fridge that tucks under the countertop. (Image credit: Ellie Arciaga Lillstrom ) 5. Use clips. \nWhile these antique-looking binder clips hold picture frames in this Airstream, they could just as easily hold up a recipe or a bunch of herbs to dry. 6. Corral stuff in trays. \nOkay, the soaps are probably in a little tray to keep them from sliding around when the Airstream is in motion, but they serve a storage duty, too: They keep a collection of items from looking junky. (Image credit: Ellie Arciaga Lillstrom ) 7. Use your stovetop as storage. \nHere's an excuse to splurge: If your cookware is pretty enough, you can totally store (read: display) it on the stovetop. \nTour the rest of the home: A Vintage Airstream Gets a Scandinavian Inspired Remodel at Apartment Therapy \nWhat other smart ideas do you spot in this beautiful Airstream kitchen?

It cooks in one pot, calls for just five ingredients, and makes for very good leftovers. It's simple and delicious and perfect for the change of weather. \nHere's a recipe that takes 30 minutes to make \u2014 a recipe that you can stretch for a few nights if need be, or freeze so you've got another meal waiting in the wings. It might not be the most exotic chili you'll ever try, but it's a truly satisfying and tasty one-pot meal that I've actually made twice in the past two weeks. Since there are only two of us, we'll usually have two meals from one pot of chili and freeze the rest. And I love to doctor it up with fresh cilantro or parsley and a big dollop of sour cream. \nFor this recipe, you can use whichever beans you prefer. I like a mixture of black beans and kidney beans, so I use one can of each. As far as preparation goes, this is a pretty straightforward recipe, but do note that I cook the beef and onion together \u2014 the individual flavors complement each other as they cook. And you'll notice I add the chili powder once the beef mixture is already cooked since it has a tendency to burn or become clumpy if you add it too early. Last, this recipe does call for 1/4 cup of water. Some folks like their chili thicker than others, so start slowly here. It's much easier to add more water than to take it away. 5-Ingredient Chili \n1 pound ground beef or turkey 1 large white onion, diced 1/4 cup water 2 (14-ounce) cans diced tomatoes 2 tablespoons chili powder 2 (15-ounce) cans beans, rinsed and drained \nIn a Dutch oven or large pot, cook the ground beef and onion over medium heat until the beef is browned, about 7 to 8 minutes. Stir every now and then to help crumble up the meat. \nDrain the meat mixture and return to pan. Add the chili powder and stir well. \nAdd the beans, water, and diced tomatoes to the pot and bring to a slow boil. Cover and reduce the heat to low; simmer for 20 minutes. Then uncover and simmer for an additional 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. \nLadle chili into bowls and serve hot. Top with sour cream, cheddar cheese, cilantro or chopped green onion \u2014 or anything else that makes you happy. Chili will keep refrigerated for a good 5 to 6 days. After that, freeze in a freezer-safe container for up to 3 months. Recipe Notes \nYou could certainly make this chili vegetarian by omitting the meat and adding cooked tofu instead. Because tofu doesn't have the fat content that beef or turkey does, you'll need to cook it with some oil so it doesn't stick to the pan. Alternatively, add an additional can of beans and have a chunky bean chili.

The same is true when we're talking about pantries, specifically. The last thing anyone wants to do is spend a ton of money on stuff that's gonna get hidden away in a tiny room that very few people will ever see, right? \nThe pantry solutions at IKEA are affordably priced, smart, and not terrible to look at (should guests end up hanging out in your pantry during your next dinner party). Here are our favorites \u2014 none of them are the RASKOG cart (because you already know about that) and all of them happen to be $10 or less. OBSERVATOR clip-on basket , $3 : Take advantage of the dead space between your pantry shelves by snatching up a few of these clip-on baskets, which are a steal at only three bucks each. VARIERA pot lid organizer , $7 : Eliminate the search for wayward pot lids by using this accordion-style organizer, which will keep up to six lids in order and can be stored in a deep drawer or on a pantry shelf. UDDIG container set , $6 for set of three : Half-open bags of dry goods like coffee, flour, and rice not only make for a messy pantry, but they also don't stay fresh very long after opening. Simultaneously extend the freshness of your pantry staples and keep everything neat and organized with this cute canister set, featuring three tin containers in graduated sizes. VARIERA box , $3 : Great for grouping items together (all your oils or noodles, for example), this box features two handles for easy transport in and out of your pantry, and is bright green to add a pop of color. HUTTEN wine rack , $10 : A small shelf in your pantry might be the closest you'll ever get to having a wine cellar, but with this wine rack you can organize the various bottles you like to keep on hand. The rack can hold up to nine bottles and can be stacked up to hold even more. BEKVAM spice rack , $4 : Crafted out of wood, this simple spice rack will keep your various spices organized and easily reachable. It can be mounted to a wall or even the back of your pantry door. TILLSLUTA dry food bin , $6 : Because the majority of the foods you keep in your pantry are dry goods, these bins will really come in handy to keep things fresh, organized, and easily accessible. Fill them with rice, pasta, cereal, and more \u2014 they're outfitted with clear lids so you can see exactly what's inside (and know instantly if you're running low). Bonus: They're stackable to ensure you use space efficiently. RAJTAN spice jar set , $3 for four : While we don't usually recommend putting your spices into matching jars (read our explanation: You May Be Organizing Your Spices All Wrong ), these transparent glass jars are great when you're looking to downsize containers.

How exactly do you truss a chicken again? That's what the internet is for! But there are a couple things that have become second-nature in the last few years that I owe to this not-so-cheap program I attended: Knife skills are probably the most important lesson I use today, but second is definitely the right way to keep a cooking workspace. \nI am a messy cook by nature, but keeping a scrap bowl and mise bowls nearby while I prep dinner has made me less stressed in the kitchen. Before I start actually cooking anything, I prep all my ingredients and put them into individual bowls so everything is neat and prepared. Cooking becomes a \"dump-and-stir\" situation (for the most part). \nSure, this does require a little more time in the kitchen \u2014 and yes, it definitely means more dishes to clean \u2014 but it is 100 percent worth it to me to not be stressed in the kitchen. (Image credit: IKEA) \nThis is why my most prized possessions in the kitchen are these $2 metal bowls from IKEA . I have the BLANDA BLANK bowls in a few sizes, but the smaller ones I use for mise bowls. I use them every single time I cook; they are easy to clean and they look pretty decent. In fact, recently when I was cooking with a friend at my apartment, she asked me where I got the bowls: They're so nice! she exclaimed. Needless to say, she was pretty shocked to learn they were an IKEA product. \nCheck them out: BLANDA BLANK , $2 on IKEA \nIt should be noted that this summer it was discovered that if you leave these bowls in the sun they could potentially catch on fire .

I learned this when I was in graduate school and living in a tiny studio apartment, doing my best to stick to a budget that was even tinier. The best way for me to stretch my dollars and still enjoy healthy, delicious meals wasn't by eating packets of ramen or rice and beans every night for dinner, but by roasting a whole chicken once a week. My Roast Chicken Budget Strategy \nSticking to a financial plan is still important for me. I'm a writer with a budget that's slightly bigger, but not by much, than the one I lived off of as a graduate student. I generally plan to spend around $200 a month \u2014 or about $50 a week \u2014 on groceries. This covers the majority of my meals in a given week. I bring a packed lunch to work every day, and prepare an average of five meals a week at home. And I still turn to my most trusted budget-friendly meals on a nearly weekly basis. \nMy biggest reason for doing so is because buying a whole chicken is always going to be cheaper than buying any of its individual parts. At Wegmans, the store where I do most of my grocery shopping, roasting chickens are priced at $0.99/pound. The same chicken, once broken down into split breasts, drums, and thighs costs $1.88/pound. If I were to buy boneless, skinless chicken breasts, I would have to pay $3.79/pound. And chicken breast tenderloins cost $4.49/pound. \nRoasting a chicken every Sunday, I've found, is a sure way of guaranteeing I'll maintain my monthly grocery budget. I look for a four- to five-pound roasting chicken, grab a lemon, one onion, and a bulb of garlic, and for less than $10 have almost everything I need. My go-to method of roasting a whole chicken is in my beloved cast iron skillet, in which the bird fits snuggly into \u2014 low-and-slow cooking is key. (Image credit: Christine Han ) Roast Chicken Makes the Best Leftovers \nAfter the bird has cooled and I've eaten the parts of it I wanted to for dinner \u2014including the crispy, crunchy skin, which never tastes as good once reheated \u2014 I break the chicken down and start planning all the ways I'll repurpose the leftover meat. Back in grad school, when I was still learning how to reuse leftovers in ways beyond their original recipe, I ate a lot of reheated chicken and mashed potatoes. I've come a long way since then, and now have dozens of tried-and-tested methods of using up all the leftover scraps of chicken. \nThe first step: I always, always, always make homemade chicken stock with the bird's carcass and whatever vegetables and aromatics I have on hand. (Never dispose of a perfectly useful chicken carcass!) When the weather is cooler or I feel a cold coming on, the stock goes into making chicken noodle soup from scratch. Otherwise, I might use it in a risotto with in-season vegetables later in the week, or I'll just stick it in the freezer for the future. \nThe meat that remains after my Sunday chicken dinner is enough to last me through the week. I mix up what recipes I repurpose the leftovers in week to week, as to not get bored by the routine. The breasts sometimes become some kind of chicken salad, like this version with yogurt and dill or this peak-summer pesto chicken salad , which I'll pack atop a bed of greens or roll into a collard green chicken salad wrap for an easy yet satisfying packed lunch. I've also used leftover meat to make a quick weeknight pasta dish, like in a hearty tomato sauce or an easy one-skillet chicken Alfredo meal. And I always have tortillas on hand for a taco or fajita night. \nIt seems silly, I know, but the simple act of roasting a chicken once a week keeps my budget in check.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brittany purlee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alfredo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine han", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "roast chicken budget strategy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kitchen solutions", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "food budget", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wegmans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roast chicken budget strategy  sticking", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T18:06:53.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af80dc7280b68316b3c1bfaf839aacf512054f1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRza0RZ9wDAp1b_BvDIAnW3833UV0.0.TAHkzP0I9VtGbEONfM98_MgovmEyteNbvSsqhVpgyure31c-", "site_full": "www.thekitchn.com", "site": "thekitchn.com", "site_section": "http://www.thekitchn.com/index.xml", "site_categories": ["food", "desserts_and_baking"], "section_title": "Kitchn | Inspiring cooks, nourishing homes", "title": "Ina Garten Is So Cool She Doesn't Even Watch Her Own Cooking Show \u2014 Kitchen Heroes", "title_full": "Ina Garten Is So Cool She Doesn't Even Watch Her Own Cooking Show \u2014 Kitchen Heroes", "published": "2017-10-04T18:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://atmedia.imgix.net/6900b46eea896fb0ae5bc881229507cc87ead3dc?w=1500&amp;fit=max", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 651, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 175, "comments": 0, "shares": 175}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af80dc7280b68316b3c1bfaf839aacf512054f1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRza0RZ9wDAp1b_BvDIAnW3833UV0.0.TAHkzP0I9VtGbEONfM98_MgovmEyteNbvSsqhVpgyure31c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sarah Rae Smith", "published": "2017-10-04T18:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ina Garten Is So Cool She Doesn't Even Watch Her Own Cooking Show \u2014 Kitchen Heroes", "text": "(Image credit: @inagarten ) \nThere probably isn't a man, woman, or child alive that hasn't seen at least one cooking show in their lifetime.

The UK's Food Standards Agency is now suggesting that reusable grocery bags can harbor harmful bacteria and lead to serious cases of food poisoning. \nTo be more specific, savvy shoppers who carry raw meat or fish in one of their reusable bags could be putting themselves at risk for spreading dangerous, and sometimes lethal, bugs like E. coli and campylobacter. That's because the bacteria can be transferred from the outside of the packaging, even when you don't see any leaks. \nWhat's more, researchers at the University of Arizona found that 97 percent of shoppers rarely, if ever, wash their reusable bags. And more than 75 percent of shoppers do not separate raw meats from other grocery items. After testing 84 bags, the researchers discovered coliform bacteria and E. coli in all but one of the bags. \nThis means there is a high risk for cross contamination that could leave you with stomach cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, or much worse. To avoid unnecessary illness, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in England has suggested that consumers use separate bags for raw meats, fresh produce, and ready-to-eat foods.

Slice the squash in half: Use a chef's knife to cut the spaghetti squash lengthwise from stem to tail. Spaghetti squash are really tough and hard, so be cautious and work slowly. You can cradle the squash in a balled-up dish cloth to keep it steady as you cut. Scoop out the seeds: Use a soup spoon to scrape out the seeds and stringy bits of flesh from inside the squash. Be careful of actually digging into the flesh, though \u2014 we want that! The inside should look clean and fairly smooth. Discard the seeds (or save them and roast them for a snack !). Place the squash in a roasting pan: Place the squash halves cut-side down in a roasting pan. Pour in a little water (optional): Pour a little water in the pan, enough to cover the bottom. Your squash will roast just fine without it, but I find that the water helps the squash steam and become more tender. You can also cover the pan with aluminum foil, if you prefer. Cook the squash for 30 to 45 minutes: Transfer the squash to the oven and cook for 30 to 45 minutes. Smaller squash will cook more quickly than larger squash. Check the squash after 30 minutes to gauge cooking. The squash is done when tender: The squash is ready when you can easily pierce a fork through the flesh all the way to the peel. The flesh will also separate easily into spaghetti-like strands. You can also taste it right now \u2014 if the noodles are still a bit crunchy for your taste, put the squash back in the oven for another 15 to 20 minutes. Scrape out the squash: Use a fork to gently pull the squash flesh from the peel and to separate the flesh into strands. The strands wrap around the squash horizontally \u2014 rake your fork in the same direction as the strands to make the longest \"noodles.\" Serve the squash: Serve the squash immediately, tossed with a little butter or olive oil. Spaghetti squash will also keep refrigerated for up to a week, or frozen for up to 3 months. Additional Notes: Roasting the squash whole: Instead of cutting the squash in half, you can also roast it whole. Roast until a fork can easily pierce through the outer peel and all the way to the interior of the squash, about an hour. Slice in half and carefully remove the seeds and stringy flesh, then scrape the flesh as directed above. Roasting the seeds: Yes, you can roast spaghetti squash seeds just like pumpkin seeds!

They come in brown, green, red, and all shades in between, and we love trying a new kind whenever we come across one! Ever wonder if the color or specific variety really makes a difference? \nIn very broad and general categories, here are the most common kinds of lentils we see in stores. Brown Lentils \nThis is by far the most common variety of lentil, and probably the one that you see at your local grocery store. They can range in color from khaki-brown to dark black, and generally have a mild, earthy flavor. They cook in about 20 to 30 minutes and hold their shape very well. Common varieties are Spanish Brown, German Brown, or Indian Brown. The blackest and tiniest lentils you find are usually Beluga lentils, which have a rich and deeply earthy flavor. Green Lentils \nThese can be pale or mottled green-brown in color with a glossy exterior. They have a robust, somewhat peppery flavor. Green lentils generally take the longest to cook, upwards of 45 minutes, but they keep a firm texture even after cooking. This makes them ideal for salads and other side dishes. Look for Lentilles du Puy, Puy lentils, or French Green lentils. Red Lentils \nWith colors ranging from gold to orange to actual red, these are the sweetest and nuttiest of the lentils (to our mind, at least!). They're somewhere in the middle in terms of cooking time and are usually done in about 30 minutes. They tend to get mushy when cooked through, so they're perfect for Indian dals and other curries, or for thickening soups . A few varieties are Red Chief and Crimson, and you'll often find them in Indian or Middle Eastern markets labeled as masoor (red lentils) or channa (yellow lentils). \nDo you have a favorite kind of lentil?

I'm never going to pop in for a few plates and plastic sandwich bags. (Mostly because one can not simply \"stop by\" an IKEA.) \nSo when the announcement came of the Swedish mass producer's collaboration with Rolf and Mette Hay, the husband-and-wife team behind top Danish design firm HAY , I got excited about the possibilities.

That steel runs underneath the tabletop for added support, so together with solid wood legs, it's durable and weighty. It's IKEA all grown up. \nRolf says he and Mette learned a lot from IKEA about making things better and less expensive, due to the brand's uncomplicated makeup, which is good news for all of us. The table is only $199 and it might as well be on display in a high-end showroom in a fancy-schmancy design center for $1000. \nI'm currently on the market for a new dining table and the flood of options out there sort of make navigating through all of them a maze of its own.

Assess your pantry on a weekly basis. \nKeeping your pantry organized and in good shape doesn't have to be a huge, time-consuming task. Instead, make it part of your weekly meal-planning routine by taking a few minutes to do a quick inventory. Knowing what's in there is the best way to make sure you're cooking and eating what you already have, and avoid buying multiples of the same thing. (Image credit: Faith Durand ) 3. Use sheet pans to group like with like. \nHeavy-duty and multipurpose, sheet pans and hotel pans make especially good organizers. Not only do they make grouping like ingredients together easy, but they're also a great way to contain any inadvertent spills or leaks. (Image credit: Apartment Therapy ) 4. Take 10 minutes every day to keep your pantry clean and tidy. \nA few everyday tasks that take just a few minutes \u2014 like wiping down pantry shelves, keeping package labels facing outward and visible, grouping like items together, and tossing expired items \u2014 will leave you with an always-tidy pantry.

Sourdough starter. Levain. Starter sponge. Mother sponge. Biga. Chef. Poolish. \nYou'll hear many names tossed about in bread recipes. What do they mean? And what exactly is the difference between them all? They're All Preferments! \nAll of these names refer to types of preferments, a mixture of flour, water, and leavening agent (like yeast), combined in advance of making a bread dough. In the preferment, the water hydrates the flour, and fermentation reactions begin. The preferment is a head start for your dough. Using one makes your dough easier to knead and adds flavor to your bread. Why So Many Names? \nDifferent names developed in different locations. For example, \"poolish\" supposedly originated in France, where Polish immigrants introduced the idea of a preferment. These days, however, different people have different definitions for the same words, and there is no consensus or authority. \nSome people say \"levain\" is simply the French term for starter. Some say that \"sourdough starter\" is specific to the starters created on the West Coast of the United States. Some use \"starter\" for the part of the mixture that you keep, and \"levain\" for the part that you mix up to use in your dough, but others use \"storage leaven\" for the keeper and \"starter sponge\" for the part that is used. \"Chef,\" \"mother,\" and \"primary levain\" are also used for the part you keep. And some people say the mixture changes names throughout the bread-making process. Two Main Types of Preferment \nPreferments can be sorted into two main categories. Preferments made with commercial yeast, which are mixed about a day before you mix the dough and used entirely. Preferments that contain wild yeasts and bacteria, which are maintained and then increased when needed for bread, and used over and over. \nThe second type of preferment is what we'll refer to as sourdough starter and what we'll look closer at to understand some of the science of sourdough. (Image credit: Emma Christensen ) Up Close with Sourdough Starters \nA sourdough starter is created by mixing flour and water, and then allowing the microorganisms \u2014 wild yeasts and bacteria \u2014 that live in the flour and air to thrive and multiply. Over time, a stable population of these microorganisms develops. When used in bread, the microorganisms perform fermentation reactions, producing the gas that makes the dough rise and the molecules that give it flavor. These flavor molecules are different than those produced by commercial yeast. Variations in Sourdough Starters Can Change the Flavor of Your Bread \nIn spite of the name, not all sourdough breads have a sour flavor. Time, temperature, and the presence of various types of bacteria can affect the final flavor. Time : A sourdough loaf baked the same day it is mixed will have a milder flavor than one that had a longer fermentation time. Some bakers even recommend using less starter in the recipe to extend the time it takes the dough to rise. Temperature: Different rising temperatures affect the activity of the yeasts and various types of bacteria, resulting in different flavors. Francisco Migoya, head chef and coauthor of Modernist Bread , shared that proofing at cold temperatures (that is, putting your dough into a fridge overnight) generally results in a harsher acidic flavor, while letting your dough rise out of the fridge results in a more mellow acidic flavor. Many bakers use combinations of the two temperatures; experiment with rising temperatures until you find the flavor you like best. Location: It's long been thought that the location where a starter is created affects its flavor. Research now shows that this might not be the case; the flour and conditions used are what's important. (We'll discuss this more in an upcoming post on the myths about sourdough starter.) Flour: Different types of flour can be used to create a starter: white, whole-wheat, rye, and others. The type of flour depends on what kind of bread you plan to make. For example, if you want to make a 100 percent rye bread, you'd need to maintain a rye starter. Sourdough starter made with white flour is the most common type. Wet vs. Dry: Different starter consistencies can be used. A wetter starter, which looks more like batter than dough, is more reactive, while a drier, dough-like starter is better for storing for longer periods in the refrigerator. Some bakers say that a wetter starter has a milder flavor, but Migoya's team found that a wetter starter produced a more acidic bread, with a stronger sour flavor. A wetter starter can more easily be mixed into dough. I found a drier starter easier to work with in the days before I had a scale, when I had to estimate the amount of starter used in dough; the dough-like consistency affected my dough less if my measurement was off. Let's Call the Whole Thing Delicious \nWetter! Drier! Feeding schedules! Variable rising temperatures! Is starter worth it? \nMaintaining a sourdough starter is more work than opening a packet of yeast, but the flavor that develops in sourdough bread is unlike anything else. \nThere's something fulfilling about using a starter to make dough rise. You've harnessed the power of nature, with no help from industry. And creating your own sourdough starter, from nothing but flour and water, can feel almost god-like. Curious? Then check out our recipe and get to work. And call it whatever you want.

Garlicky Parmesan Sweet Potatoes \n3 medium sweet potatoes (about 2 pounds total), cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, divided \nArrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 425\u00b0F. \nPlace the potatoes, oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl and toss to combine. Transfer the potatoes to a rimmed baking sheet and spread into a single layer. Roast for 15 minutes. Flip the potatoes over with a flat spatula and cook until browned and tender, about 10 minutes more. \nRemove the baking sheet from the oven. Set the oven to broil. Sprinkle the potatoes with the garlic and half of the cheese and stir to coat well. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the potatoes. Broil until the cheese is soft and melted, 1 to 2 minutes.

Just one. The same cannot be said for soft, lightly spiced pumpkin muffins. These breakfast treats are especially wonderful right now, as we settle into autumn, but are also perfectly acceptable to eat year-round. Pumpkin Spice Muffins: Watch the Video The Spice in Pumpkin Spice \nA big part of what makes pumpkin muffins so amazing is the spice blend that gives them their warm flavor. The blend of spices used in this recipe are also the primary components of pumpkin pie spice: cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and ground cloves. Rather than using a store-bought spice blend, I really prefer to use the individual spices so I can adjust the amount of spices to my taste. \nRead more: How To Make Pumpkin Pie Spice Pumpkin Pur\u00e9e, Not Pumpkin Pie Filling \nWhen picking up the ingredients for these muffins, be sure to grab plain pumpkin pur\u00e9e, not pumpkin pie filling \u2014 they\u2019re not quite the same thing. Canned pumpkin pur\u00e9e is simply that, cooked and pur\u00e9ed pumpkin; it has very little flavor and isn\u2019t sweetened. Canned pumpkin pie filling, on the other hand, is sweetened and flavored with spices; it\u2019s essentially a shortcut to making pumpkin pie. Check the label on the can before you buy as it\u2019s super easy to grab the wrong one off the shelf. \nMore on pumpkin pur\u00e9e: What\u2019s Actually In Your Canned Pumpkin Pur\u00e9e?

I asked myself as the \"unbuckle seat belts\" sign dinged overhead. \nThis is not what a rational, put-together adult would do , I lectured as I wrestled my carry-on out of the overhead bin. \nI can't believe I'm doing this , I murmured as I rolled it towards Customs, a little sweaty from the spontaneity of the whole thing. \nI had just left a perfectly lovely time in the south of Spain to fly over to Ireland for a whirlwind weekend. Hours before I had been sitting on a piazza in Sevilla, minding a paella dish and sipping on vermouth, when I got an alert that a roundtrip ticket to Dublin was just a crisp 30 dollars. Staring at the push notification, I thought back to those long evenings inside whiskey bars and cozy old-man pubs, and booked it before Reason could show up to my table and wrestle the phone rightfully out of my hands. \nThis is why you never have your credit card numbers saved. (Image credit: Roger Kamholz ) Why I Flew to Dublin (It Wasn't for Love) \nBut rather than visiting a country like Ireland \u2014 with all its legends and rolling hills; fairy tales and heroic seascapes \u2014 for a love interest I left behind, I instead booked my ticket for a glass of whiskey. That's right, for a beverage. \nI ended up taking a bus from Dublin Airport to O'Connell Street, staring somewhat stunned at my suitcase, all to meet up with a cocktail I just couldn't get out of my mind. \nI've been carrying it around with me all through Europe \u2014 as I went from city to city, crossed border after border \u2014 closing my eyes and replaying the time we spent together like I was the starring role in a Lifetime melodrama. And before you think I'm an alcoholic, hear me out \u2014 it was seriously just so good. Sep 24, 2017 at 9:49am PDT The Whiskey That Made a Frugal Traveler Hop a Flight to Dublin \nThe first time I tried it was around the end of November. It tasted like a boozy Christmas morning in a cup, with hints of vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and orange. Seeing how a trip back would cost me the same as a decent dinner in Sevilla, I had to decide: Appease a heartache, or get another grilled fish dinner at midnight? To me, the choice was easy. \nThinking back on my short affair, I wish I could tell you that our \"How We Met\" story was something satisfyingly dramatic \u2014 like I took a wrong turn and discovered this nook tucked into the end of an alley, or ran in from the rain only to find a mom-and-pop pub run for 12 generations, like a proper adventurer. \nAt the risk of making you groan, the drink that made me cross an ocean came from the Jameson Distillery. I know . But before you label me a fanny-pack-wearing tourist, let me explain: When you go to Dublin during the winter it's cold and wet outside, and chances are you're probably going to be trudging into the distillery with a red nose and wet socks, sufficiently grumpy. \nThen you walk in and there's all this whiskey lined up all welcoming on the wall, and the bartender asks you what you want to drink in a brogue I'm sure the Irish are done hearing about but still charms the socks straight off of me. He puts down a napkin in front of you, and you sip on a drink that tastes the way opening presents feels, and you're a goner. You're done for. Your heart is lost. And you will grab every plane out there that clocks in at a modest price to go chase your infatuation. May 20, 2017 at 12:44pm PDT How a $30 Flight for a Glass of Whiskey Changed My Life \nPoetry aside, the real reason I'm sharing this with you is because, when I did it, I thought I lost my mind. I literally bought a plane ticket to go have a drink for an evening, and then booked it back to Spain the next morning. This coming from the woman who is so cheap that she sometimes opts to wash her socks in the bathroom sink rather than paying the hostel to do laundry. \nI didn't think it could be done. I thought it was too whimsical; too much of a movie moment (i.e., not something that I'm allowed to do). \nBut once I did it, it was no longer off-limits. Instead of my knee-jerk reaction being \"no way\" to these impulsive plans, I started to say \"why not?\" If the ticket price was right, why not throw some clothes into a backpack and get hot chocolate and churros in Spain, or a glass of Champagne in France? Why not go for an afternoon of waffles in Belgium, or an evening of fire-breathing vodka in Poland? \nIt's fun to do something ridiculously indulgent and semi-wild once in a while, because in the end it'll probably end up as one of your most favorite memories. I know it's one of mine. \nWhat's the craziest thing you've ever done for a good drink?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger kamholz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "customs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sevilla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jameson distillery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o'connell street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T15:07:37.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "510f00dba9f63b555646c61a6c286dd098e3502a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRzaM7NVDNkyHDNHoGPRCAoq1uu4JJIev93_kW0g1oeECW2q4JfkvPJF1.KBLRC5TdXX", "site_full": "www.thekitchn.com", "site": "thekitchn.com", "site_section": "http://www.thekitchn.com/index.xml", "site_categories": ["food", "desserts_and_baking"], "section_title": "Kitchn | Inspiring cooks, nourishing homes", "title": "The Most Basic Kitchen Cleaning Tool Just Got Reinvented \u2014 Shopping", "title_full": "The Most Basic Kitchen Cleaning Tool Just Got Reinvented \u2014 Shopping", "published": "2017-10-05T15:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://atmedia.imgix.net/1faa820db11e9b6f480476877e7a01711b97293d?w=1500&amp;fit=max", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 651, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 32, "comments": 0, "shares": 32}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "510f00dba9f63b555646c61a6c286dd098e3502a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRzaM7NVDNkyHDNHoGPRCAoq1uu4JJIev93_kW0g1oeECW2q4JfkvPJF1.KBLRC5TdXX", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lisa Freedman", "published": "2017-10-05T15:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Most Basic Kitchen Cleaning Tool Just Got Reinvented \u2014 Shopping", "text": "(Image credit: Skura Style ) \nThere isn't much new news in the world of sponges all that often, so this is pretty exciting: A new subscription sponge service, Skura Style , just launched this week. And it's not just delivering the usual sponges that you already have under your sink. Buy: Skura Style sponges , $12 for four 5 Things We Love About Skura Style Sponges 1. It's a subscription sponge service! \nYou sign up and automatically get four sponges sent to you either once a month or every other month. It's $12 each time you get a delivery and that's that. You never have to think about buying sponges. Ever. Again. 2. The logo fades over time. \nBetween the arrival of new sponges, you will have to remember to change out the ones you have. These sponges will help you do that: The logo on the scrubby side is specially designed to fade with use. When the logo is gone, that's how you know it's time for a swap. 3. The sponges are made of foam instead of cellulose. \nUnlike the standard sponges on the market, Skura Style is made of foam with antimicrobial technology that inhibits odor-causing bacteria, mold, and mildew. It's highly absorbent and does not trap food. 4. It keeps its shape. \nYou know those moments when you reach for a sponge that's dried out over night? It's all curled up and shriveled? This sponge doesn't do that. It will maintain its shape after drying, which helps make it seem a little less, uh, gross. 5. Two women invented it. \nWe'll almost always support female inventors and entrepreneurs! Skura Style is the brainchild of Linda Sawyer and Alison Adler Matz, two marketing executives who have been friends since second grade. Initially, they set out to design a better-looking sponge, but when they realized how much bacteria and grossness is harbored inside a regular sponge, they decided to tackle that problem too. Now, they're taking on 3M, the biggest sponge company out there, for a share of the marketplace. \nWould you sign up for this sponge-delivery service?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "linda sawyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alison adler matz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "skura style", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "3m", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T15:55:50.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ed0250f6df39b256ec0d677198811f4aa9d32577", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRzamA8AVhF8wQlDM0uWXQT3Lp0xHAP2KQS3s7csj9tyVZxjzIqQFrxIRQ_Tg4w7YffiPh0DEEXnTGwD.A91_m1q7Q--", "site_full": "www.thekitchn.com", "site": "thekitchn.com", "site_section": "http://www.thekitchn.com/index.xml", "site_categories": ["food", "desserts_and_baking"], "section_title": "Kitchn | Inspiring cooks, nourishing homes", "title": "This Easy Chicken Chili Comes Together in 20 Minutes \u2014 Delicious Links", "title_full": "This Easy Chicken Chili Comes Together in 20 Minutes \u2014 Delicious Links", "published": "2017-10-05T15:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://atmedia.imgix.net/a9fc41e8484bfe5f1dd0b98234ee678daded440e?w=1500&amp;fit=max", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 651, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 13, "comments": 0, "shares": 13}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 22}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ed0250f6df39b256ec0d677198811f4aa9d32577", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRzamA8AVhF8wQlDM0uWXQT3Lp0xHAP2KQS3s7csj9tyVZxjzIqQFrxIRQ_Tg4w7YffiPh0DEEXnTGwD.A91_m1q7Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lauren Kodiak", "published": "2017-10-05T15:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "This Easy Chicken Chili Comes Together in 20 Minutes \u2014 Delicious Links", "text": "(Image credit: Gimme Some Oven ) \nNow that cool fall evenings have returned, nothing beats a hot bowl of chili for dinner.

And while it may be tough to get excited about food, it's important to nourish the body with something. \nSo, what should you eat while recovering from food poisoning? The Most Important Thing to Do When You Have Food Poisoning \nWhen food-borne illnesses lead to diarrhea or vomiting, one of the most important things to do is to replace lost fluids and salt. Yes, a bite of toast, a handful of Saltines, or a few spoonfuls of rice might help soothe your tummy, but hydration is key! \nLiquid solutions like Pedialyte are effective and might also be the most palatable. Or, if you have the strength, you could make your own sports-type drink by soaking dried fruit in water overnight. \nThe National Institutes of Health also recommends broth, soup, and fruit juices. If you've got a healthy, live-in partner or just a good friend, have them make you a batch of homemade chicken stock . \nAnd, a word to the wise: Sip slowly \u2014 don't chug! What to Eat When You're Recovering from Food Poisoning \nWhen you're ready for \"real\" food, ease into things gently. Avoid foods high in dairy, fat, fiber, and sugar and opt for mild foods instead. \nThe BRAT diet \u2013 bananas, rice, applesauce, toast \u2014 is a good place to start. Bland foods like potatoes, crackers, and cooked carrots may also be gentle on the stomach. \nWe often turn to plain congee , a savory rice porridge that's warming and nourishing. We've also relied on instant mashed potatoes (lapsed locavore alert!) and flat ginger ale \u2014 and some people swear by the curative powers of Coca-Cola for both prevention and treatment of tummy troubles. \nYour turn: Is there anything you prefer to eat and drink while recovering from food poisoning?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T16:12:11.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1336bc4f6a804c16fc7d6addb1f02cf003bb48e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRzaGCOz1SEqyeo71BaPx5Kz2WcefQXzIpdQdpM9I8vHKS1P2ij_ajH4UmynN69JdvjDRc_5m0aXwE3dBVV0WeiKfg--", "site_full": "www.thekitchn.com", "site": "thekitchn.com", "site_section": "http://www.thekitchn.com/feedburnermain", "site_categories": ["food", "desserts_and_baking"], "section_title": "Kitchn | Inspiring cooks, nourishing homes", "title": "This Brilliant Hack Fixes the Only Problem of Owning a Stand Mixer \u2014 Organizing Tips from Kitchn", "title_full": "This Brilliant Hack Fixes the Only Problem of Owning a Stand Mixer \u2014 Organizing Tips from Kitchn", "published": "2017-10-05T16:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://atmedia.imgix.net/e36fb81c3d8995bf3c15892278fd80cdbc50acc4?w=1500&amp;fit=max", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 651, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 241, "comments": 0, "shares": 241}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 11}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1336bc4f6a804c16fc7d6addb1f02cf003bb48e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRzaGCOz1SEqyeo71BaPx5Kz2WcefQXzIpdQdpM9I8vHKS1P2ij_ajH4UmynN69JdvjDRc_5m0aXwE3dBVV0WeiKfg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ayn-Monique Klahre", "published": "2017-10-05T16:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "This Brilliant Hack Fixes the Only Problem of Owning a Stand Mixer \u2014 Organizing Tips from Kitchn", "text": "Share \nA lot of small appliances are ugly and need to be hidden away in a cabinet. But if you are among the lucky ones who have a beautiful KitchenAid stand mixer, you know that baby's meant for display! The color! The sculptural feel! Plus, if you keep it out, you're just that much more likely to start spontaneously baking cupcakes, right? \nWhile the stand mixer is great-looking, the long electrical cord, however, is not. You don't want to leave the machine plugged in all the time (boo, vampire power!) and you don't want the cord all piled up at the base of the mixer, either. What to do about this? \nSteal this idea, which we found over at Dreaming in DIY . All you need is a pack of Command Cord Bundlers . (Image credit: Dreaming in DIY ) \nThey simply stuck a hook on the back of the sand mixer. Then, when not in use, the cord can be gathered up and strapped into the hook. This way, you can't even see the cord from the front! The strap can be opened and closed whenever you need to unravel the cord. And like other Command hooks, the cord bundler will come cleanly off your machine, should you decide you no longer want it on there. \nAlthough you wouldn't want to use this trick on an appliance that heats up (like a toaster or toaster oven), it would be fine for anything else. Try it on a blender or your juicer, for example. I'm even looking at the little Sonos speaker I have at the corner of my countertop with wires winding around it \u2014 this would be great! \nBrilliant, right?

If you ask us, though, the seeds are the main attraction. Whether you coat them with savory spices or go with something sweet, roasted pumpkin seeds are just so perfectly \"fall.\" Plus, they are a great alternative to sugary Halloween candy, and just as festive. \nSo how do you pick a pumpkin that's guaranteed to have plenty of seeds? We consulted some pumpkin professionals to get the inside scoop. 3 Ways to Pick the Best Pumpkins for Roasting the Seeds 1. Choose a large pumpkin. \nYou might think that a heavier pumpkin means more seeds \u2014 but that's not always the case. Several experts told us that larger, not heavier, pumpkins will yield more seeds. Just double check with a pumpkin patch staffer before you haul the thing to your car: Glenn Cook of Cider Hill Farm in Amesbury, MA, agrees that although seed count typically does go up with the size of the pumpkin, some of the really big varieties \u2014 like the Atlantic Giant \u2014 have surprisingly few seeds. 2. Pick a pumpkin with hull-less seeds. \nThe experts at Fleitz Pumpkin Farm in Oregon, OH, suggest picking a pumpkin that has hull-less seeds \u2014 these are ideal for roasting because they don't have an outer shell, and you can easily eat the whole seed. These might be marked as \"Seed Pumpkins,\" with common varieties being Styrian and Kakai pumpkins. The workers at the patch should be able to point you in the right direction! 3. Tap on your potential pumpkin. \nWhen you're choosing a Kakai (or other seed pumpkin), pick one that sounds hollow \u2014 this indicates a large seed cavity with plenty of space for delicious seeds.

Now there are single-varietal beans alongside those tubs and cans your grandparents drank, but with all that choice comes the dilemma of what to buy. \nTo help you zero in on your perfect cup, we sampled 15 of the most readily available coffees usually found at supermarkets nationwide and ranked them. How We Picked and Brewed the Coffee \nThere are a lot of brands, and a lot of variety even within those brands, so we narrowed the playing field by choosing only dark roast beans, and pre-ground whenever possible for consistency. \nAlthough some brands recommend using one tablespoon of ground coffee for six ounces of hot water, that is never, ever enough. Two rounded tablespoons is the way to go, and that's the measurement we used across the board. To ensure consistency, we used a digital scale to measure the grounds (13 grams of coffee per cup), a temperature-controlled electric kettle for the water (205\u00b0F), and a metal pour-over filter. Here's how they stacked up. The Grocery Store Coffee Taste Test \nIn order from worst to best, here's our grocery store coffee ranking. Note that I tried to link to the correct coffee on Amazon for purchase, but it's not always an exact match. (Image credit: Danielle Centoni ) \n15. Yuban , $18 ($.41/ounce): This was a slightly lighter roast than the other tubs, because that's all we could find. Lighter roasts usually yield more complex and discernible flavor and aroma notes, but that wasn't the case with this one. The smell of latex paint was detectible from the moment we opened the tub, and only got stronger with brewing. Overall, we don't recommend this coffee. (Image credit: Danielle Centoni ) \n14. MJB , $12 ($.53/ounce): Save for the whiff of latex paint (again), there was very little aroma when unsealing the tub. And it brewed up slightly sour with wet paper and woody pulp as the most pronounced flavor characteristics. (Image credit: Danielle Centoni ) \n13. Maxwell House , $6 ($.2/ounce): You can sum this one up with two words: bitter and burnt. Throw in some creamer and it would likely go down just fine, but I still felt like I was standing in a freshly painted room while I was drinking it. We're not sure where these chemical notes are coming from, is it off-gasses from the plastic tub, or something related to how the beans are processed? Either way, we're not in favor. (Image credit: Danielle Centoni ) \n12. Folgers Classic Roast , $8 ($.21/ounce): If you like classic \"diner\" coffee (think: mild and balanced, but forgettable), then you're going to like this tub of coffee. There were faint chocolate notes in the aroma, and no disconcerting latex paint notes. (Image credit: Danielle Centoni ) \n11. Caf\u00e9 Bustelo , $5 ($.46/ounce): The bright-yellow tin (or vacuum-packed brick) of \"espresso\" is a staple of corner bodegas, and for good reason: For inexpensive coffee, it's really not bad. Although it's not very complex, it gets the job done. It's simply dark, bold coffee, heavy on bitter notes, which is why it's no surprise that it's traditionally consumed Cuban-style with ample sugar. If you're on a budget and need a really strong coffee to stand up to the sugar and cream you want to throw at it, this one's for you. (Image credit: Danielle Centoni ) \n10. Gevalia Kaffe French Roast , $6 ($.54/ounce): The aroma was harsh, but the coffee brewed up relatively smooth at first, with a bitter finish and a hint of toasted almonds. This would have been a decent cup of coffee if it weren't for the discernible chemical notes. (Image credit: Danielle Centoni ) \n9. Seattle's Best 6th Avenue Bistro , $6 ($.48/ounce): Starbucks in Seattle and Peet's in Berkeley seem to have defined the West Coast roast as unabashedly bold and bitter. Well, Seattle's Best seems to have taken that style even further. Although we appreciated the toasty-buttery notes of graham crackers or caramelized baked goods in the aroma, the overwhelming bitterness made the coffee simply taste burnt. There was some nice acidity on the finish, though. (Image credit: Danielle Centoni ) \n8. Dunkin' Donuts French Roast , $7 ($.58/ounce): Dunkin' Donuts coffee has a rabid following, and it can't be due to the not-so-great packaging. We suspect it's familiarity \u2014 and not just for those who have grown up going to the donut mega-chain. The flavor is so generic it would be familiar to everyone. This is simply coffee-flavored coffee. There are no discernible notes of anything \u2014 no bitterness, no acidity, and no complexity. (Image credit: Danielle Centoni ) \n7. McCafe Colombian , $6 ($.49/ounce): You know how McDonald's does something to their fries to make everyone on the planet crave them? They're doing that with their coffee. That's not to say this is crave-worthy, but there's something going on, some amped-up flavor enhancer, that makes this really very different from all the other coffees, and yet it's not unwelcome. \nLet's start at the beginning. It's Columbian coffee (said to be the most familiar in flavor to Americans) and it's a medium-dark roast (which satisfies both medium and dark roast drinkers). So right off the bat this brew is truly aimed at the majority of American coffee drinkers. It brews up rich with nutty tones and a lively brightness and acidity. Where things started to get a little weird, is when we sampled it again, after drinking other coffees. It was almost juicy, maybe even a little salty in comparison. None of the other 15 coffees had this juicy-salty mouthwatering thing going on. Again, not unpleasant, just not, well, not normal. (Image credit: Danielle Centoni ) \n6. Illy Dark Roas t , $15 ($1.70/ounce): When you pull the tab on the can it opens with a satisfyingly audible gasp. The beans are ground espresso-fine and there are hints of bright fruit in the aroma, although they don't come through in the cup. It's not complex, but the coffee brews up mellow and rich, with a hint of smoke, a touch of acidity on the finish, and no trace of bitterness. Even cream-lovers could skip it with this brew. (Image credit: Danielle Centoni ) \n5. Lavazza Gran Selezione , $11 ($.92/ounce): Freshly brewed, this coffee smells like toasted bread, or maybe poundcake. In other words, it's perfect for breakfast, no? The flavor is smooth and rich, although not complex, with a bracing acidity on the finish. (Image credit: Danielle Centoni ) \n4. Peet's French Roast , $11 ($.55/ounce): Full disclosure: I grew up drinking Peet's, so I know there's a very characteristic super-dark, almost-burnt-but-not quality about all of Peet's coffees. No matter the bean or the level of roast, a Peet's coffee is easy to identify (although hard to describe). This French Roast is no different. It's a little chocolatey, a little smoky. The bitterness is strong, but there are enough complex sweet notes and acidity to offer some balance. You must be a fan of bold coffees to like this one, but if you are, you will. \nTellingly, Peet's prints its roast date and its preferred brew-by date on the package, recommending you use the coffee within 90 days. Every other brand recommended consuming within about a year or more. (Image credit: Danielle Centoni ) \n3. Starbucks Caffe Verona , $13 ($1.12/ounce): Even though it was a dark roast, and Starbucks is known for taking its roasts to the edge of burnt, this coffee brewed up deliciously balanced. It was smoother than the French Roast from Peet's, its West Coast rival, with pronounced hints of fruity berries complemented by dark chocolate notes. (Image credit: Danielle Centoni ) \n2. Caribou (Mahogany Dark Roast) , $7 ($.58/ounce): There was hardly any acidity to this one, but very pronounced smoky notes and a touch of bitterness, all balanced deliciously by honey-floral tones. Like the Green Mountain Sumatran (see below), it was actually smooth and balanced enough to drink black. (Image credit: Danielle Centoni ) \n1. Green Mountain Organic Sumatran Reserve , $14 ($1.42/ounce): This brand seems to have cornered the market on K-cup pods, but it was harder to find just a plain bag of ground dark roast beans, until we spotted this organic variety on the natural foods aisle. It was only available in whole bean, which we ground in a burr grinder. Surprisingly, the beans weren't very aromatic at all, but once brewed their flavor was deliciously complex. It was earthy with fruity-cherry notes and a hint of vegetal greenness. The coffee was smooth and not bitter, with a bit of balancing acidity. It was so well-balanced, in fact, that we would happily drink it black. \nAnd that's it! Did your favorite grocery store coffee make the list? Let us know in the comments!

A post shared by Auntie Anne's (@auntieannespretzels) on Aug 26, 2017 at 2:58pm PDT \nIn an interview with New York Magazine's The Cut , Winfrey revealed that she recently discovered Auntie Anne's while on set for A Wrinkle in Time , where writer-producer-director Ava DuVernay introduced her to pretzel-wrapped hot dogs. \"She'd never had one before, and now she loves them,\" the fashion and culture site notes. \nThese sweet and savory bites are perfect for on-the-go snacking.

Either way, dipping them in mustard is the only way to go. \nStill, I'm shocked Oprah would be as excited about this unlikely snack.

While it's generally governed by the Environmental Protection Agency , there is no national agency that manages the day-to-day recycling for every town in the country. That responsibility is actually handled by a mix of local government agencies and private companies, depending on where you live. \nFor your own personal recycling purposes, that means two things: That exactly what you can recycle will vary quite a bit, and then how you recycle it can vary greatly, too. \nSome counties have frequent curbside recycling, while others only do it occasionally \u2014 or not at all. Some places need you to hyper-sort your recyclables into bins, while others encourage you to mix them all up. \nHow do you know what's best based on where you live? Keep reading. \nIf you want to do recycling right, you've got to do two things: First, research your county laws to see what you can recycle at home versus what you have to take to a recycling facility, and then, find the recycling facility itself. Most government websites have pretty explicit and easy-to-find rules about recycling. What's even easier, though? Almost every one \u2014 including the EPA site itself \u2014 directs you to one website to find about your local recycling center. The Best Way to Find a Recycling Center Near You: Earth911.com \nThis is a great resource! In addition to having a ton of information about recycling initiatives, it has a tool that lets you search the item you want to recycle, by zip code. And it will let you get pretty detailed \u2014 for example, if you type in batteries, it will give you options (car batteries, alkaline batteries, etc.) so you can figure out exactly the right spot to go, then will give you the name, address, and phone number of the location you can bring it to. If it's something your county will pick up, it tells you that, too. It makes something that can be complicated so easy!

Not only is it messy (all those guts and seeds!) but thanks to Pinterest, designs are also becoming more and more complicated. Gone are the days of the simple goofy-looking jack-o'-lantern, Now everyone's all about gruesome faces, intricate designs, and even carved quotations. \nWhile we love a good masterpiece as much as the next person, there's something to be said for a design that can be done quickly \u2014 and easily. In that spirit, we've rounded up 10 carving ideas that won't take you a (witching) hour to complete. Here's what you should do. 1. Turn it into an ice bucket. \nIf you can draw a circle, you can turn a pumpkin into an ice bucket. You just have to cut the top off and line it with a bowl. It's totally carved (you took a knife to it!) and you turned it into something practical, too. (Image credit: Design Sponge ) 2. Carve a constellation. \nThese celestial designs from Design*Sponge were created using a small drill bit (for the \"stars\") and a v-chisel (you could use a paring knife) to connect the constellation. You'll want to empty out the interior of the pumpkin so you can light it from within. Add a coat of black paint to help your glow-y creation really stand out. (Image credit: Martha Stewart ) 3. Add fangs. \nThese cheeky fanged guys from Martha Stewart make us LOL. For a playful take on a spooky vampires, carve a rectangle into mini pumpkins to form a \"mouth.\" Then, fill it with plastic fangs (found at any dollar or costume store) and add thumbtack \"eyes.\" \nSee more: Fanged Pumpkins at Martha Stewart (Image credit: Jessi Burrone ) 4. Use cookie cutters as stencils. \nInstead of stressing out over a free-handed design or keeping a stencil in place, just use a cookie cutter. The folks over at Refinery29 prove it couldn't be easier: Simply select your shape, then hammer it into your pumpkin until it cuts all the way through. (Image credit: Heartwood Tribe ) 5. Make it a terrarium. \nCarve a big circle on the side of your pumpkin, then core out the guts and you have an instant terrarium, like this one from Heartwood Tribe. If only caring for succulents were just as easy. (Image credit: Kara's Party Ideas ) 6. Use marquee lights. \nTerrible at drawing bubble letters? Just use marquee lights instead. Kara, from Kara's Party Ideas , suggests tracing the letter onto your pumpkin first. Carefully cut it out out and then push the light into the opening. The shorter the word, the less time it will take you, obviously. We vote for boo . (Image credit: Shelterness ) 7. Drill a few holes. \nAnother idea from Martha Stewart , this mouse motel calls for just a few holes. Core out the inside and add a few (plastic!) pet rodents. \nSee more: Mouse Motel at Martha Stewart (Image credit: BHG ) 8. Make something playful. \nBetter Homes & Gardens supplies a stencil so you can make the hands for this cheeky pumpkin, but you can trace your own hand or just use a pair of old gloves. Cut off the top, core out the pumpkin, add some googly eyes and you're done. (Image credit: Food Network Magazine ) 9. Add lots of candy. \nCarve out any shape mouth you want and then use toothpicks to attach candy, which will be come the \"teeth\" and \"eyes.\" Food Network Magazine nailed it with these silly expressions. (Image credit: Women's Day ) 10. Turn pumpkins into candle holders. \nThis eerie display from Women'sDay is basically the world's easiest jack-o'-lantern. What? It's a pumpkin and it has a candle! At the top of the pumpkin, carve a circle wide enough to fit your chosen pillar candle. As the candle wax melts down, the spooky scene will only get creepier \u2014 even more so if you choose black candles! \nRead more: Halloween Craft How-to: Candle Pumpkins at Women'sDay \nHow are you planning to carve your pumpkins this year?

(Image credit: Lior + Lone/Stocksy) Share \nIt's jack-o'-lantern season, and you probably want to preserve your carved pumpkin and keep it fresh as long as you can, right? Pumpkins are organic, so there's no way to stop the rotting process indefinitely. But there are smart, thrifty ways to keep your carved pumpkin fresh and extend its life through Halloween and beyond! \nHere are the five best ways to preserve your carved Halloween pumpkin and keep it looking great. \nI spoke to Mat Franken, CEO of natural cleaning product company Aunt Fannie's . Here's Mat's advice for making those carved pumpkins last through Halloween and beyond! 3 Tips for Picking a Long-Lasting Pumpkin \nThe best way to ensure the longevity of your jack-o'-lantern is to pick a healthy pumpkin to begin with. While there's no such thing as the \"perfect\" pumpkin, there are several things you can look for to make sure your jack-o'-lantern is off to a great start. 1. Inspect the skin. \nWhen you select a pumpkin, keep an eye out for gouges or blemishes. While dings and dents may give a pumpkin character, they also invite pests and encourage rotting. 2. Poke and prod. \nIf a pumpkin is even a little soft to the touch, the rotting process is already underway. What begins as a small, soft spot can grow into a large, caved-in mess overnight. Look for a pumpkin with even color and firm flesh. Poke around to find one that doesn't give when pressed gently. 3. Pick local. \nPurchasing from a local pumpkin patch means your pumpkin has been spared the bruising and battering that comes along with being shipped across the country in the back of a truck. Check out Local Harvest for a listing of pumpkin growers and U-pick farms in your area. (Image credit: Anjali Prasertong ) Avoid What Makes a Pumpkin Rot \nBefore you start carving, it's important to understand the factors that lead to pumpkin rot. Pumpkin skin provides a protective layer from the elements. Once the skin is broken, organisms like fungi, bacteria, mold, and insects are able to enter and begin breaking it down. Oxidation and dehydration also contribute to the rotting process, which means from the moment you make the first cut, the clock starts ticking. (Image credit: Coco Morante ) 5 Natural Ways to Make Your Pumpkin Last Longer \nMany methods for sterilizing and preserving pumpkins involve the unnecessary use of harsh chemicals and environmentally unfriendly solutions. Common tricks include using bleach or apple cider vinegar, but Mat says no to both of these. Bleach is dangerous and apple cider vinegar will only attract bugs. 1. Scrape and discard the pumpkin guts. \nWhen prepping your pumpkin for carving, be sure to scrape and discard as much of the pulp (aka pumpkin guts) as possible. The cleaner and drier the pumpkin interior, the slower the rotting process. 2. Clean with peppermint dish soap. \nDilute one tablespoon of peppermint dish soap such as Peppermint Castile Soap in a quart of water. Pour the mixture into a clean spray bottle and lightly spray the inside of your pumpkin. Peppermint is antifungal and will slow the decomposition process, significantly extending the life of your pumpkin. 3. Refrigerate overnight. \nIf it's still warm in your neck of the woods, consider placing your carved pumpkins in the fridge at night instead of leaving them on the porch. Spray your pumpkins with the Castile soap-water mixture and wrap each one in a trash bag prior to placing in the fridge. This process will rehydrate your pumpkins each night. (Image credit: Maria Siriano ) 4. Soak the pumpkin overnight. \nAnother way to rehydrate your pumpkins is to fill a large bucket, bin, or tub with cold water and soak the pumpkins overnight. Typically, pumpkins set out for less than a week won't need rehydration, especially if you live in a cool climate. If you notice yours beginning to wilt, however, take them for a dip! 5. Guard your carved pumpkin with a fruit fly trap. \nMuch like any other produce you bring into your home, pumpkins attract fruit flies . Drawn to rotting fruit and vegetables, fruit flies will expedite the process, leaving a damaged pumpkin and an infestation behind. Natural fruit fly solutions, like Aunt Fannie's FlyPunch! or this DIY mixture , are poison-free ways to prevent fruit flies from settling in to do damage. Your pumpkin lives to see another day, and your home remains free from invaders.

You may just find a new favorite cocktail, and at worst you'll end up chatting with a bartender. You may even learn something. \nSo one night, while visiting Cleveland (which really rocks!), I stationed myself at the bar at Society Lounge , a swanky joint in the happening East Fourth Street part of downtown, and settled in for conversation. Bourbon is always the topic of choice (me being from Louisville, and all) and as much as I try to get outside my whiskey world when I travel, it is my true spirit love so I remain on the hunt for new ways to enjoy it. And the bartender, Ben, was game. (Image credit: The Liquor Barn ) \nI rattled off a list of things I like \u2014 bourbon and bubbly chief among them. \"Do you like St. Germain?\" Ben asked. I love St. Germain. He grabbed a gorgeous, peacock blue and gold, art nouveau-style bottle: Pavan . \"You have to try this,\" he said, pouring a sip. This was everything I love about elderflower liqueur, but more delicate, more complex, less candy-sweet, and with a lovely note of orange blossom. And it's French. I was smitten. Buy: Pavan , $30 for 750 milliliters at The Liquor Barn \nBen got to work, and a few pours and stirs later, presented me with his creation. Dubbed the Louisville Slugger (how sweet, in honor of my hometown!) the drink was simple but stunning: a slug of bourbon, a little simple syrup, lemon juice, a kiss of Pavan, and a splash of sparkling ros\u00e9 with orange peel to garnish. One sip and I knew I'd found my new go-to cocktail. \nSure enough, these Sluggers are my new house cocktail (when I can find the cans of sparkling ros\u00e9 in stock at Trader Joe's that is, or have enough people over to make opening a bottle make sense). But our new friend Pavan can do so much more! \nI got in touch with the bar owner, Joseph Fredrickson, who I'd also chatted with the night of this fabulous discovery. The general idea I took away from this guy who seriously knows his cocktails? Pavan is basically the perfect liqueur for cocktails. \n\"You're looking at more of a fortified fruit juice than just a liqueur that's been sweetened and flavored and watered down,\" he explains. \"It's cool that they age it for a year or two \u2014 most liqueurs skip that.\" This fortified muscat grape juice keeps a natural acidity, and for Joseph, that makes it ideal for mixing. \n\"When you talk cocktails, the balance between acidity and sweet is a main topic of conversation,\" he says. Pavan is so naturally balanced, \"you don't get palate fatigue from too much sweetness \u2026 I can add it to almost anything.\" \nAlthough it was pretty perfect in my bourbon cocktail, he also recommends it with gin drinks \u2014 the floral notes being just right for one another. Anything in the sour family, he says, would be good too \u2014 a Tom Collins, maybe, or a pisco sour. A French 75 would be great. Or you can keep it super simple and just mix Pavan with Champagne over ice, maybe with a little lemon or orange peel. (Bonus: There's no need to break out the spendy bubbles for this one, he says.)

We originally wanted to know which packing material he preferred for bagged lunches: plastic zip-top bags, aluminum foil, or plastic wrap. (He picked the bags as long as we all promised to use each bag at least five times before tossing them \u2014 and that when washing them between uses, we use just a little bit of not-too-hot water.) \nBut then he said two things about dishwashers that stood out to us even more than his unpredictable pick (we thought for sure he'd pick the foil, but that came in second place). Here are the two dishwashing mistakes we've been making. Are you making them too? 1. Running the dishwasher half-full. \n\"The heating of dishwashing water is one of the most environmentally costly things we do,\" says Lindeman, adding that it falls after driving instead of biking. So if you're gonna do it, you've gotta make sure the thing is full. Washing just a few dishes with all that hot water? Well, that's just really not worth it. 2. Using the dry cycle. \nA dishwasher is far, far more efficient, if you air dry your dishes instead of putting them through the drying cycle. In fact, Lindeman cites an old study on coffee cups that found that one use of a dreaded Styrofoam cup is far more efficient than a ceramic coffee mug \u2014 unless you use effective washing methods in a dishwasher (without hot water and no drying cycle) and re-use it over and over and over again. \nOf course these facts are not news to us in any way, but it's the way he explained them that stopped us in our tracks.

But just because getting your daily caffeine fix has turned into a well-worn routine doesn't mean you have to drink the same ol' coffee every day. There are so many different coffees to try! \nWith literally thousands of roasts from all over the world, however, attempting to be adventurous with your coffee selections can get a little overwhelming. Which ones do you try? Where do you start? Easy. Sign up for a coffee subscription and let the experts do all the work for you. They scour the best roasts and deliver them to your door on a recurring basis. Here are three of our favorite coffee subscriptions \u2014 and a bonus one for espresso obsessives! \u2014 that will turn you into a coffee aficionado, rather than just a caffeine junkie. 1. Atlas Coffee Club , from $9 for 6 ounces \nPriding itself on offering up \"coffee you can't find on the shelves,\" Atlas Coffee Club is comprised of a team of coffee addicts and globetrotters who travel the world in search of the best roasts. Subscriptions start at just $9, and features a new variety of coffee each time (from places like Costa Rica, Peru, Ethiopia, Guatemala, and more), all packaged in beautiful, brightly colored bags. You can opt to receive your subscription monthly or every two weeks, choose the quantity you want (half, a full bag, or two bags), and can even customize your roast and grind preferences. (Image credit: Counter Culture ) 2. Counter Culture Coffee , from $30 for two (12-ounce) bags \nStarted in 1995, Counter Culture Coffee has more than 20 years of experience finding the most delicious coffees from all over the world. Their subscription plans start at around $30 and you can pick and choose from six different coffees, or opt to get surprised by their rotating selections. How you get it is also customizable \u2014 you can choose the quantity you want to receive, and the frequency in which you get shipments (weekly, biweekly, monthly, etc.). 3. Nomad Coffee Club , from $20 for 8 ounces \nThe Toronto-based Nomad Coffee Club bills itself as \"not coffee snobs, just coffee lovers,\" providing a coffee adventure that's approachable and fun rather hoity-toity and exclusive. Subscriptions are pricey, however, starting at $24 a month. But you get a new bag of ethically sourced, whole-bean coffee delivered to your door each time. (Image credit: LaMarzocco USA ) Bonus: La Marzocco , $39 for two bags \nFor espresso obsessives, this subscription plan from La Marzocco will be a godsend, especially on your wallet (espresso from coffee shops is expensive!). At $39 a month, you'll get two bags of espresso (different each time) along with recommended brew parameters and tips directly from the roaster. Developed by the legendary espresso machine maker, the subscription service is created with the same attention to detail that goes into the high-end machines they've been crafting since 1927. \nDo you get a coffee subscription?

It's so simple that it feels like there should be a catch. \nNo, there's no catch \u2014 it's really that good \u2014 but there is one very important thing you need to do before putting the bird into the slow cooker. The Chicken Needs Height \nBefore adding a whole chicken to the bowl, it's important to create a base in the slow cooker that will elevate the chicken \u2014 just high enough so that it's not resting on the bottom of the bowl (about an inch will do). How to Create a Base \nThe simplest way to do this is to use three or four packed balls of aluminum foil. You can also use a small metal rack or trivet, like the kind that came with your electric pressure cooker or multi-cooker . \nIt's an extra step that's well worth the effort. As the chicken cooks, it releases a good amount of liquid, more so than what's produced when roasting in the oven. Raising the chicken prevents it from sitting in a pool of liquid for an extended period of time, which might make it soggy. \nBetween the small, closed space of the slow cooker and all the liquid that's released, the air inside the slow cooker is hot and humid; it's the reason why the chicken turns out so tender and juicy. Keeping the bird raised allows this humid air to flow around the whole chicken \u2014 not just the top and sides.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T00:01:02.903+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "422a504dd3f92a898616060e49c0ed1304af7f77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgywSGFRr1P9oEjgZMI2INYQ188w4WEFXNXhQ.uhA538zS2QRTgbSuKc5HV3YimT4h_R9uIDTABxQ04r33EdZdE8ubxAFXFWo.2XS8Tg6oT8w4.bzw7jDLRs", "site_full": "feeds.thekitchn.com", "site": "thekitchn.com", "site_section": "http://www.hifow.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Hifow \u2013 Quick & Easy Recipes", "title": "Recipe: Tomato Rasam | Kitchn", "title_full": "Recipe: Tomato Rasam | Kitchn", "published": "2017-10-06T00:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DK", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.hifow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/7852af9b4502275c391701a214345ea15e2b1bc1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 651, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "422a504dd3f92a898616060e49c0ed1304af7f77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgywSGFRr1P9oEjgZMI2INYQ188w4WEFXNXhQ.uhA538zS2QRTgbSuKc5HV3YimT4h_R9uIDTABxQ04r33EdZdE8ubxAFXFWo.2XS8Tg6oT8w4.bzw7jDLRs", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T00:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Recipe: Tomato Rasam | Kitchn", "text": "1 cup fresh cilantro leaves, divided 3 cups water \n1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon chaat masala 1/2 cup diced cucumber \nRoast the tomatoes: Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 375\u00b0F.

That's not to say it can't be both, but the latter is one of the reasons I fell in love with an unlikely Midwestern city. In fact, I fell so hard I bought a big, old house that had plenty of soul, but needed a lot of TLC. Jun 16, 2014 at 11:09am PDT How I Fell in Love with Detroit & Its Food \nMy Michigan husband and I bought a triplex in a neighborhood near the Motown museum, after I'd gone to Detroit to write a travel story, and \u2014 like so many others since \u2014 fell under its spell. \nArmed with tidy to-do lists, Pinterest boards, and dreams of opening the home to fellow Detroit dreamers, we tipped into a gauntlet of endless work. The summer of riveting possibility turned into an autumn of angst as costs exploded and problems mounted, then into a winter of worry. The cold blowing off the Detroit River threatened to seep the last scraps of joy we'd started out with. \nBut always just out there, the promise of Detroit awaited. We'd pry ourselves from plaster repair and just drive the vast city and remember what we loved. \nWe met an employee at a hardware shop who sold us homemade chicken pot-pies to sustain a single-digit Valentine's night of windows-open floor sanding. We slurped noodles in the blissfully warm and steamy confines of a ramen joint. \nOn a day of almost comically bad proportions \u2014 Friday the 13th, no less \u2014 we had to flee the four walls, and found solace with a drive through falling snow, only our headlights illuminating the flakes skidding across the broken glass and graffiti on the wide, empty streets.

So I mused over what I would really like to eat right now and came up with all the fall vegetable flavors. Onions, garlic, mushrooms, sweet potato \u2014 preferably dark and caramelized, built from the ground up in one big skillet, browning, caramelizing, and saut\u00e9eing until you're left with a big pile of chewy orzo and dark, delicious fall vegetables. (Image credit: Joe Lingeman ) \nAfter the pasta is cooked, you only use one more big saut\u00e9 pan to put this dish together. It takes some hands-on time, but it's very satisfying, layering each component and flavor on top of the previous. You really see how flavor is built and where each taste in the dish comes from. \nThis is also a satisfying dish to eat. There's no meat, and it's even vegan if you leave off the final sprinkle of Parmesan cheese, but I would happily serve this to a crowd of dedicated meat-eaters; it's one of those dishes that really spans a group of various preferences. \nA few technical notes on this dish: It's best to use your biggest stove burner and your biggest saut\u00e9 pan. I used a great big six-quart saut\u00e9 pan, although a four-quart should work as well. If you don't have a straight-sided saut\u00e9 pan, just use your widest, deepest skillet. Orzo Caramelized with Fall Vegetables & Ginger Serves 4 as a main dish, 6 as a side dish \nSalt Grapeseed, peanut, or vegetable oil 1 large sweet potato (about 12 ounces), diced 2 medium onions (about 1 pound total), finely diced 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 tablespoon peeled and grated fresh ginger 6 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems removed and caps diced 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons soy sauce 3 big leaves Swiss chard or kale, stalks removed and leaves finely chopped (about 2 cups) Freshly ground black pepper Shaved Parmesan cheese (optional) \nHeat a large pot of water to boiling and salt it generously. Cook the orzo until barely al dente, about 6 to 7 minutes. Drain and toss with a generous drizzle of oil so that the grains of orzo are lightly coated with oil; set aside. \nHeat a large saut\u00e9 or frying pan (the largest you have \u2014 you want plenty of room and hot surface) over high heat. Drizzle in a little grapeseed or vegetable oil (not olive oil \u2014 you want an oil with a high smoke point) and heat until very hot. Add the sweet potatoes and arrange them in a single layer. Cook over high heat until they begin to caramelize and turn brown, about 4 minutes. Flip the sweet potatoes and cook for 3 minutes more. \nTurn the heat down to medium and push the sweet potatoes up in a pile against one side of the pan. Add the onions to the center of the pan and season lightly with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are beginning to turn brown. Add the garlic and ginger and stir them into the onions. Push the onions off to the side of the pan, next to the sweet potatoes, where they will continue to caramelize. \nAdd the mushrooms to the hot center of the pan and cook for 4 minutes without turning them. Stir the mushrooms and cook for 4 minutes. At this point everything should be getting well-cooked; the onions should be quite dark brown and the garlic should be golden and soft. The potatoes should be softening. \nWhisk together the vinegar, soy sauce, and 2 tablespoons of oil. Pour this into the pan with the vegetables and mix everything together, scraping the bottom as you go. Cook for 3 minutes. \nTurn the heat up to high, as high as it will go. Add the orzo gradually, shaking in a cup at a time, and stirring and scraping constantly. Cook, letting the orzo get browned on the bottom of the pan, then scraping it up, for about 5 minutes. You are developing a little more color and flavor on the pasta, and helping all the flavors combine. \nAdd the greens and cook until they're barely wilted, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat, taste, and season as needed. Serve hot, with shavings of Parmesan if desired. Recipe Notes For vegans: Leave off the cheese. For omnivores: If desired, render a little bacon, sausage, or guanciale fat in the beginning, and use this to cook the vegetables. Keep the meat in too. Storage: Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.

Most apartments come only with a mini refrigerator, like the one you probably had in college. My current refrigerator isn't tall enough to ride a roller coaster. \nIs it because kitchens are smaller? Is it the fact that Germans don't refrigerate a lot of things that Americans do? Who knows why, but it means that the few items that earn a permanent place in the fridge are chosen all the more carefully. \nHere are five things nearly every German has in her (tiny) fridge. 1. K\u00e4se und Wurst: Cheese and Sausage \nReally and truly at number one, cheese and sausage do triple duty on any given day. You might pull out the sliced meat and cheese for breakfast, sandwiches for lunch, or a light dinner. 2. Senf: Mustard \nNot only does every German fridge have mustard of some sort, but it's also not uncommon to have several different types of mustard. After all, different sausage calls for different mustard. \nBrand loyalty matters, too. A vegetarian friend who grew up in East Germany confessed that she keeps a tub of Bautz'ner mustard in her refrigerator at all times because her mother would kill her if she visited and it wasn't there. 3. Butter: Butter \nIt is hard to overstate the heights to which Germans take their love of butter. Bread and butter is a legitimate open-faced sandwich option. Expect to find high-fat European-style butter, the spreadable kind in a tub, or a homemade compound butter with plenty of fresh herbs. Suddenly the bread and butter sandwich sounds pretty good, actually. 4. Gurken : Pickles \nIt's probably more accurate to say Schraubglas mit undefinierbarem Inhalt , or a glass jar with unidentifiable content. It's safe to assume that the content is often gherkins or some kind of pickled vegetable, although we had a glass jar of homemade elderflower cordial tucked at the back of our fridge for the better part of a year before we gave up and threw it out. Something pickled or preserved is basically inevitable in this pickle- and preserve-heavy lifestyle. 5. Flaschenbier und Mineralwasser: Beer and Sparkling Water \nVisit your German friends and you'll likely be offered some cold bottled beer from the fridge or some sparkling water. Despite the fact that tap water is very good across Germany, almost every household will stock several bottles of mineral water. I'd go for the beer, myself; hopefully your host has stocked up on a beer from their hometown in Bavaria! \nA caveat : Keep in mind, though, that while certain cultural stereotypes are true, Germany is a big and increasingly diverse country of over 80 million people. For every sausage in a German fridge, there is a jar of kimchi next to the mustard or Belgian endive in the crisper. For the most part, though, bet on the Wurst.

While it's super fun to mix up cookies, pies, gingerbread, and all those holiday treats, it can also get pretty expensive. Between fancy baker's chocolate, nuts (nuts!), several types of flour, and vanilla extract, you can spend a small fortune stocking up your pantry. \nLuckily, there's one ingredient you don't have to splurge on. (Image credit: Kelli Foster ) \nSugar! Buy the cheapest sugar you can find at your grocery store and you'll still get the same results as if you had splurged. \nSugar is ever consistent, always reliable \u2014 no matter what brand you buy and how much you pay. That's what makes it your best bet for finding savings. You could spend $4.50 on a four-pound bag of granulated sugar, or $2 on something the same size from a different brand and you'll get the same results when your recipe comes out of the oven. If you're not impressed by the savings, consider this: According to the National Grocers Association , the average person spends around $150 a year on sugars for use at home. \nAllow me to explain. All-purpose flours vary significantly from one company to another (an in-house brand versus a national brand, for example), as each will have a different amount of protein, gluten, color, and more. Different all-purpose flours yield different results. Not so with sugars. Sugars \u2014 including organic and vegan sugars \u2014 may be processed differently, but the results are always identical. You'll get the same thing from Granulated Sugar A as you would from Granulated Sugar B. Same for Brown Sugar A versus Brown Sugar B. \nIs there a difference between brands within categories of specialty sugars (think: muscovado and demarara)? It's hard to say with complete confidence, because most come from countries other than the U.S., which often allow far more impurities in their sugars. Even more, they often don't have the labeling we're used to, so there really could, at least theoretically, be more variation among them. \nBut when it comes to our standard sugars (granulated sugar, light and dark brown sugar, and confectioner's sugar), you can save money without worrying about brand-to-brand differences.

One of the best ways to take charge of your financial life is through food and cooking. This column from TFD founders Chelsea Fagan and Lauren Ver Hage will help you be better with money, thanks to the kitchen. \nGetting the most out of a modest food budget is tricky. I don't know about you, but I feel like I spend an inordinate amount of time researching recipes that are cost-effective yet tasty \u2014 and still end up spending more than I thought I would. If I'm really not careful or diligent about my food budget, my bank statement looks like I may as well have been eating Chipotle for every meal, because that's how much I spent at the store. And let's face it \u2014 living in one of the most expensive cities in the country (New York) probably doesn't help. \nWhat I find the most helpful is reading about what other people have done to trim their own food budgets, and then straight-up steal their ideas. Below are some of my favorite blog posts for food budgeting from The Financial Diet. Even if you're not necessarily looking to go vegan or completely stop eating at restaurants, each offers a few insightful tidbits that can help anyone looking to cut back on food spending. Enjoy! 1. 15 Foods That Definitely Aren't Worth the \"Organic\" Price Tag (& 8 Foods That Are) \nEver since reading The Omnivore's Dilemma in college, I'm a bit wary of buying anything labeled \"organic\" or \"all natural.\" The industry just isn't that regulated, and sometimes that means you end up spending a hell of a lot more than you should on avocados because you thought there'd be a significant difference between the organic and conventional ones (spoiler alert: there's not). This article gives a super-helpful breakdown of which conventional fruits and vegetables are \"clean,\" and which ones are worth the extra splurge to buy organic. 2. A Complete Guide to Vegan Grocery Shopping on a Budget \nBefore you roll your eyes and move on to the next post, hear me out. You don't need to be vegan (or want to be vegan) to learn from this post. The writer gives an extremely thorough breakdown of where to shop when you're following a vegan diet, including bulk stores, produce stands, and even a home garden. For non-vegans , it also offers some helpful hints on spreading your shopping across different stores, so you know you're always getting the best deal. 3. Everything You Need to Own to Stop Wasting Money on Office Lunches \nI work from home about three days a week, and by far the biggest benefit has been the way it's improved my food budget. I'm no longer tempted to ditch my sad desk lunch for a $12 salad because my fridge full of leftovers is right there. On the days I do go into an office, however, I'm so glad I have the right supplies to make sure I'm never without lunch (looking at you, stacks on stacks of perfectly sized Tupperware containers). If you work in an office, definitely check out this post for everything you need to make sure each weekday lunch is so good, you don't even miss the overpriced gourmet sandwich shop down the block. 4. Exactly How I'm Planning to Spend Less than $3,000 on Food This Year \nAs someone who budgets $500 a month for food and can't seem to knock that number down anymore, this post title sends chills down my spine. Spending $3,000 for an entire year of food? Amazing. Now, the writer includes the caveat that she limits the restaurant, bar, and coffee portion of that budget to $400 a year, or about $30 per month. I'm sure that wouldn't work for me personally, but hey, if going out to eat isn't that important to you, it's worth it to consider if your money would be better spent elsewhere. This post also details the writer's actionable steps for how she's lowering her food spending, including the super-specific way she treats herself every once in a while. 5. 4 Ways My Empty-Fridge Challenge Helped Me Fix My Wasteful Habits \nI grew up in a suburban American household where a fully stocked fridge was a sign of a healthy home, financially and otherwise. And you know what that meant? A lot of wasted food \u2014 produce that went bad and lunch meat that got moldy before anyone ever got around to eating it. In order to get better about my own food spending habits, I needed to change my mindset in regards to what constitutes a \"healthy\" fridge. This post gives some great tips for eliminating waste and getting the most out of what you already have \u2014 something we can all work on, I imagine. \nWhat are the food budgeting articles that have helped you the most?

You don't want to go through all that effort, only to have the paint start chipping off a few months later. To make sure that doesn't happen, we talked to three bloggers who painted their kitchens a while ago. Here's the one thing they each did, which they credit to keeping their cabinets looking brand new. (Image credit: Bigger Than Than Three of Us ) 1. Clean, clean, clean! \nFor Ashley Mayes, the blogger behind Bigger than the Three of Us who painted her kitchen almost a year ago, the secret was in all the cleaning before she even busted out a single paint brush. \"The cabinets were in good condition, so I just cleaned them thoroughly first,\" she says. \nYou want to make sure your cabinets' surfaces are as squeaky clean as possible \u2014 even a trace of residue or grease will make it tough for paint to cling to the foundation. Once you've sanded, give all the wood an additional wipe-down (you can even vacuum them!) to avoid any dust particles mixing with the fresh paint. (Image credit: Polka Dot Chair Blog ) 2. Don't skip the primer! \nPrimer is a must, according to Melissa Mortensen, of Polka-Dot Chair . If you want to fully hide whatever is below the paint (especially if its a darker wood), this is not a step you can skip. It makes a visible difference down the road and it helps give the paint something to hold on to. (Image credit: Kassandra Dekoning ) 3. Consider adding a clear coat. \n\"My biggest advice would be to take an extra day to apply a clear top coat for a stronger durability on the cabinetry,\" says Kassandra DeKoning, of Little DeKonings . \"Overall our cabinets have held up incredibly well over the past two years. We touch up an area here or there, but other than that, it's a DIY that's so worth doing.\" Bonus tip: Use felt feet instead of rubber ones! \nThe professional painters who painted an entire kitchen for us at the end of the summer (Chris and Lexi Dowding of Michigan-based SwatchOut ) have one last tip: Use felt feet on the cabinet doors and drawers instead of rubber ones. Rubber could stick to the paint and peel it off, which could lead to bigger flakes over time.

It used to be that you could basically only recycle cardboard and aluminum cans \u2014 but not, say, cartons made from laminated paper or aluminum foil. Fortunately, technology has improved and people have created a market for items made from recycled materials, so these days we can recycle more and more things. \nBut there's one thing that hasn't changed from the dawn of recycling: You must, must wash out your containers before you put them in the recycling bin. \nIt's a pain in the butt, I agree. Many a time I've looked at that mostly empty pasta sauce jar and thought \u2026 e h, do I really have to ? The answer is yes . \nHere's the deal: When the recycling truck picks up your stuff, it's brought to a big warehouse where the materials are sorted. Each company has different capabilities in terms of what they can take and how they can process it. But one thing that's across-the-board tricky is cleaning the recyclable material before it's processed. If there's a teeny bit of food debris in the system, the recycling center can handle it. But if you're leaving chunks of caked-on food, you can literally gunk up the works. In some places, if there's one \"contaminated\" item in a bin of recyclables, the whole lot will go to a landfill instead. That's terrible! Always rinse out your containers before you recycle. \nYour recyclables don't have to be squeaky-clean (check with your local recycling center for their exact requirements), but we all have to do our part. Scrape leftover food in the trash can and, at the very least, use super-hot water to rinse out containers before you chuck 'em.

I love noodle cups. You love noodle cups (you know you do). But none of us really loves the weird artificial ingredients or the flavorless nubs of dehydrated vegetables that come along for the ride. \nLet's fix this situation. Rather than give up our torrid noodle-cup affair (as if!), the obvious solution is to make our own DIY cups \u2014 and you'll be surprised at how easy that really is. Easy Instant Noodle Cups: Watch the Video (Image credit: Emma Christensen ) Do-It-Yourself Noodle Cups \nThe idea with noodle cups, or pot noodles as the Brits call these, is to pack all your favorite noodle soup components into a jar or other heatproof vessel, but nix the broth. When you're ready to eat, pour hot water over the top, let things warm up for a few minutes, and lunch is served. \nYou can pack these jars days ahead and stash them in the fridge. Since the noodles aren't immersed in liquid, they stay chewy and fresh instead of getting soft and waterlogged. Same for the rest of the ingredients, which we'll talk about in a second. Once you add water, that's when everything gets mixed together and becomes a true soup. Pack your noodles in pint-sized widemouth glass jars with lids, or other heatproof containers (Image credit: Emma Christensen ) The \"Cup\" for Your Cup of Noodle \nYou can really use any container with a lid to hold your soup ingredients. Since nothing gets microwaved and the liquid isn't added until just before eating, you don't even have to worry about the container being microwave-safe or leak-proof. As long as it holds a serving of food, you're good. \nPersonally, I like using pint-sized wide-mouth canning jars. These hold a good amount of food and still allow enough headroom to swirl everything around when mixing the soup together, plus they're easy to throw into the dishwasher and clean. \nYou can eat straight from the jar, but if you're in the mood for a more civilized approach, grab a bowl and pour your warmed soup inside. Use 1 to 3 teaspoons flavor base \u2014 soup stock paste (like Better Than Bouillon), miso paste, curry paste (Image credit: Emma Christensen ) The Flavor Base for Your Soup \nNow, these homemade noodle cups would just be a jar of noodles and veggies hanging out in hot water if it weren't for one crucial ingredient: soup stock paste. You might know this as \"Better Than Bouillon,\" although you can find it being sold by many companies, all with varying degrees of preservatives (or lack thereof), sodium (or lack thereof), organic ingredients, \"real\" ingredients, and so on. Since half the reason we're making these noodle cups is to avoid ingredients we don't want, read the labels carefully before you buy. (My favorite brand is made by Penzeys .) \nThis paste is what dissolves in the water and transforms it into a savory broth. Nifty! \nYou needn't stop at bouillon, however \u2014 or even use it at all. Miso paste, curry paste, and anything similar will work here. And don't forget to round out your soup with a few extras. A squeeze of Sriracha, a dash of soy sauce, some coconut milk, or a spoonful of chili-garlic sauce will all take your noodle cup up a few notches and make your lunch all the more satisfying. Use 3/4 to 1 cup noodles \u2014 cooked udon, cooked yakisoba or ramen, cooked soba noodles, cooked spaghetti or fettuccine, cooked rice noodles, cooked shirataki noodles, dry vermicelli or maifun noodles (Image credit: Emma Christensen ) The Noodles for Your Soup \nThis may come as a surprise, but you can use whatever noodles you like. Spaghetti from last night's dinner, rice noodles, udon noodles, soba noodles \u2014 heck, even ramen noodles stolen from their packet. \nMaifun noodles, vermicelli noodles, and your pilfered ramen noodles are all truly \"instant,\" and can be packed into noodle cups un-cooked. For other noodles that require some cooking, go ahead and cook them beforehand; the hot water you add to the cup won't be hot enough to really cook them after the fact. Use 1/4 to 1/2 cup filler ingredients \u2014 frozen corn, frozen carrots, frozen peas, diced tofu, leftover cooked meat, dried or thinly-sliced mushrooms, thinly sliced spinach or other hearty greens, kimchi (Image credit: Emma Christensen ) Filling Out Your Soup \nI totally respect a noodle cup that consists entirely of noodles, but if you'd like a little more substance to get you through the afternoon, be sure to pack some extra stuff in there. For lack of a better, more appetizing term, I call these \"fillers.\" \nFor vegetables, I like to use frozen corn, frozen peas, and frozen carrots. They thaw by the time you mix your soup and they're easy and cheap. You can also add dried or thinly sliced mushrooms, or any leftover cooked vegetables from your dinner. \nFor protein, use whatever you have around. These noodle cups are a great place to use up the last bits of chicken, pork, or steak that you might have around \u2014 or cook an extra chicken breast when you make dinner so you have enough for your noodle cups. Tiny cubes of diced tofu make an excellent vegetarian noodle cup. You can even pack yourself a soft-boiled egg for a truly authentic bowl of ramen. \nRemember that the hot water you add will not actually cook any of these ingredients, so make sure that anything that needs to be cooked (like chicken) gets cooked before it goes into the jar. Hard vegetables, like fresh carrots, broccoli, and beans, are also best if cooked ahead of time. Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup fresh ingredients \u2014 fresh herbs, sliced green onions, bean sprouts, sliced lime or lemon (Image credit: Emma Christensen ) Fresh Ingredients to Top Things Off \nLast but not least, throw a few truly fresh ingredients into your cup. These are things that don't require cooking, but add a lot of flavor. I always like a big handful of cilantro and some sliced spring onions or bean sprouts. You could also shred some spinach or other hearty green. (Image credit: Emma Christensen ) Packing Your Noodle Cup \nWhen packing up your soup components, add everything in layers \u2014 not only does this keep dry and wet ingredients separate until you're ready to mix, but it looks pretty and makes an easier assembly line. \nI usually put the flavor base and flavor extras on the very bottom where they'll stay separate. If you're just using a paste like bouillon, it doesn't really matter if it gets mixed with other components, but soy sauce, coconut milk, or other liquids can start to make the noodles soggy if they get mixed. \nOn top of the flavor base, I add the filler ingredients, and then the noodles. Fresh ingredients go on top where they won't get crushed. You can also pack the fresh ingredients in a separate baggy, which you can pull out before you add the water. This is helpful for things like slices of limes or eggs that you don't necessarily want mixed into the soup. \nPacked like this and with a tight lid, these noodle cups will stay fresh and ready in your fridge for about a week. Gluten-Free, Vegan, Paleo: As You Like It! \nThese noodle cups are an incredible boon for anyone with special food needs or if you follow a particular diet. There are noodles that fit just about any diet (even a weight-loss diet ), and the other components are easy to adapt to suit your particular needs. (Image credit: Emma Christensen ) Noodle Cups for Lunch! \nI spent an extra-long time explaining all the components for these cups only because the actual assembly is so fast and easy. Once you've decided on your components, all you need to do is line up the jars and fill them up. Don't forget to cook any noodles that require cooking before you start \u2014 other than that, it's a cinch. \nWhen you're ready to eat your noodles, just add enough boiling water (or at least, very hot water) to cover, put the lid back on, and let the cups stand for a few minutes so everything gets warmed. I'll leave it to you to source your own hot water \u2014 using a tea kettle, water microwaved in your coffee cup in the office microwave, or the hot water tap on the coffee machine are a few options. When you stir the noodles, be sure to get all the way down to the bottom with your fork or chopsticks so you mix all the flavoring base into the soup. \nBefore I release you to your own devices, a few shout-outs. It would never have occurred to me to try making my own noodle cups if it weren't for Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who included a recipe for pot noodles in his book River Cottage Veg . J. Kenji Lopez-Alt also did a great service to Cup O Noodle lovers everywhere with his thorough explanation of Make Your Own Just-Add-Hot-Water Instant Noodles on Serious Eats \u2014 also inspired by Hugh F-W's earlier work. Thanks, guys! Start with pint-sized widemouth glass jars with lids, or other heatproof containers How To Make Instant Noodle Cups What You Need Ingredients for each noodle cup \n1 to 3 teaspoons flavor base \u2014 soup stock paste (like Better Than Bouillon), miso paste, curry paste \n1 to 3 teaspoons flavoring extras, optional \u2014 chili-garlic sauce, soy sauce or tamari, coconut milk, sesame oil, Sriracha or other hot sauce \n1/4 to 1/2 cup filler ingredients \u2014 frozen corn, frozen carrots, frozen peas, diced tofu, leftover cooked meat, dried or thinly sliced mushrooms, thinly sliced spinach or other hearty greens, kimchi, soft-boiled or hard-boiled egg \n3/4 to 1 cup noodles \u2014 cooked udon, cooked yakisoba or ramen, cooked soba noodles, cooked spaghetti or fettuccine, cooked rice noodles, cooked shirataki noodles, dry vermicelli or maifun noodles \n1/4 to 1/2 cup fresh ingredients \u2014 fresh herbs, sliced green onions, bean sprouts, sliced lime or lemon \nEquipment Pint-sized widemouth glass jars with lids, or other heatproof containers Measuring cups and spoons Chopsticks or a fork, for eating Instructions for Assembling the Noodle Cups Place flavor base and flavor extras in the bottom of the cup: If it's a paste, like soup stock or miso paste, spread it around a little so it dissolves more easily once you add the hot water. Also add any flavoring extras. Top with filler ingredients: Scatter your filler ingredients over the top of the paste. It's OK if they get mixed in with the flavor base and extras. Add the noodles: Pack the noodles down so they're fairly compact. It's fine if they stick together \u2014 they will un-stick once you add the water. Finish with the fresh ingredients: If you'd like to keep these from getting mixed into the hot soup, pack these into a baggie that can be removed just before you add the water. Seal and refrigerate: Place the lid on the container and refrigerate for up to a week. Use a dry-erase marker or masking tape label to write the contents of each jar so you can easily grab whichever combo of ingredients you want that day. (It's best to keep the jars refrigerated until you're ready to eat, but it's OK to stash them in your bag for up to two hours.) Instructions for Cooking the Noodle Cups Top with hot water: When you're ready to eat, unscrew the lid and pour enough boiling water over the top of the noodles to cover. Cover and steep: Place the lid back over the container. Let the soup steep for 2 to 3 minutes. The ingredients should be warmed through, but the soup is still nicely hot.

At just one farm stand, there could be more than a half-dozen options. How can you pick the very best pumpkin for carving? We turned to some gourd-growing professionals to get expert opinions. (Image credit: Coco Morante ) The Difference Between Pie Pumpkins and Carving Pumpkins \nHave you ever seen signs for \"Pie Pumpkins\" and \"Carving Pumpkins?\" Farm stands will often label the pumpkins for you to help remove some of the guesswork. What's the difference? Carving pumpkins are typically thinner and easier to saw into. They also have less guts on the inside, which are also grainier and stringier, making them easier to clean. Pie pumpkins, meant for baking, are usually smaller and more rounded. \nYou're bound to find a jack-o-lantern variety at any pumpkin patch you visit, and will likely have an assortment of shapes and sizes to choose from. \nRelated : The Best Pumpkins for Baking and Cooking Pumpkin Varieties That Are Good for Carving \nIf you're looking for specific varieties to hunt for, the ladies of The Peterson Sisters Pumpkin Patch in Chico, CA, suggest the Hobbit pumpkin, especially popular on the West Coast, or the Autumn Gold. Hobbits are 10- to 12-pound pumpkins, and are considered a medium-sized variety. Autumn Golds are a very manageable variety, weighing between seven and 10 pounds. They turn a beautiful golden-orange color before fully ripe and are easy to carve, compared to other varieties. \nChristy Lehner of Lehner's Pumpkin Farm in Radnor, OH, says that the Gold Rush and Wolf varieties are popular for people who want larger jack-o'-lanterns. Both of these types of pumpkins weigh between 15 to 35 pounds, although they're not necessarily the easiest to carve. If you're looking for a statement-making pumpkin and aren't afraid of using a little elbow grease, give one of these a try. \nBeyond this knowledge, there are a few things you can do when looking for a carving pumpkin at the patch. Follow these steps and you'll start with a healthy pumpkin that will last long after you've carved it. How to Pick a Pumpkin for Carving Pick it up and tap it : It should feel sturdy. When you tap it, you should hear a hollow sound. Check the coloring : Choose one that has consistent coloring throughout. Look for bad spots : Try to choose a pumpkin without any scratches, bruises, or dark spots. Apply pressure : Flip the pumpkin upside down and apply pressure with your thumbs. If it's not completely sturdy, the pumpkin isn't fresh and will rot quickly. Set it down : Make sure it sits flat! (Unless you want your jack-o'-lantern to sit a little crooked.) Carry it from the bottom : Don't carry it by the stem \u2014 instead, cradle it from the bottom or tote it home in a bag.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christy lehner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coco morante", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wolf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lehner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "peterson sisters pumpkin patch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "radnor", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T21:02:26.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9233f4fb1abc63bd534d04c4832460be2305a2f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRza.czfCIt3Gt8eeYs7V3P6ycqgzVYi44pjXHJsV6a2OWw-", "site_full": "www.thekitchn.com", "site": "thekitchn.com", "site_section": "http://www.thekitchn.com/index.xml", "site_categories": ["food", "desserts_and_baking"], "section_title": "Kitchn | Inspiring cooks, nourishing homes", "title": "What Is a Buddha Bowl Anyway? \u2014 Food Trends", "title_full": "What Is a Buddha Bowl Anyway? \u2014 Food Trends", "published": "2017-10-06T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://atmedia.imgix.net/7ce23b5552ed3c2970c64dd8c612e6f3b4262270?w=1500&amp;fit=max", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 651, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 0, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9233f4fb1abc63bd534d04c4832460be2305a2f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7Ye2KLKdB8OepK90yjRza.czfCIt3Gt8eeYs7V3P6ycqgzVYi44pjXHJsV6a2OWw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jelisa Castrodale", "published": "2017-10-06T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "What Is a Buddha Bowl Anyway? \u2014 Food Trends", "text": "Share \nIf you've spent more than 30 seconds on Instagram, you've definitely scrolled past a Buddha Bowl (or 200). The brightly colored, artfully arranged bowls seem to be the go-to food source for every amateur yogi, the kind of people who alternate between taking pictures of their plates and pictures of their feet (because the rest of us wouldn't be able to make it through the day without knowing #whereIstand). \nBut even if you know more about Count Chocula than you do about your chakras, you can still make and enjoy one of these single-serving meals. There are no hard-and-fast rules for what actually constitutes a Buddha Bowl, and despite what the 152,317 pics with the hashtag #buddhabowl would have you believe, it doesn't even have to be attractive enough to warrant the Amaro filter.

(And, because these things have more nicknames than Puff Daddy, you don't even have to call them Buddha Bowls; they're also known as grain bowls, hippie bowls, macro bowls, and power bowls.) \nAccording to Dan Zigmond, a Zen priest and the author of Buddha's Diet , the name Buddha Bowl might have a very literal origin. \"Buddha woke up before dawn every morning and carried his bowl through the roads or paths wherever he was staying. Local people would place food in the bowl as a donation, and at the end he would eat whatever he had been given,\" he told Epicurious . \"That was the original Buddha Bowl: a big bowl of whatever food villagers had available and could afford to share.\" Oct 4, 2017 at 2:03pm PDT How to Make a Buddha Bowl \nSince you probably won't be knocking on your neighbors' doors, the basic formula is to start with the base ingredient of your choice \u2013 often grains, leafy greens, or both \u2013 and then add a variety of toppings, which usually include diced and sliced vegetables. The final components are a source of protein, like chickpeas, tofu, or lean meat, and a light drizzle of dressing. \nIf that sounds vague, it's OK. It's also OK if you don't feel blissed out or #blessed while you're slicing avocados. \nAlthough you can find plenty of Buddha Bowl recipes online (complete with perfectly lit pictures, obvs), this is really one meal that is made for improvisation and customization based on what you have on hand and what combination of ingredients you like.

Dry ice is the frozen form of carbon dioxide, which is why, instead of melting into a liquid when heated, it turns into a gas. As it sits at an exceptionally cold temperature of -109.3\u00b0F, handling it properly is a top priority. \nHere are five mistakes to avoid when using dry ice. 1. Buying it more than a few hours before you need it. \nThis is less about safety and more about the fact that dry ice doesn't last very long. It takes about 24 hours for five pounds of dry ice to turn from solid to gas \u2014 even when stored in a cooler. So if you buy it a few days in advance of your Halloween party, it won't last. \nFollow this tip :Plan for a dry ice run right before you need it. Just a few hours before your party or gathering will be perfect. 2. Getting it anywhere close to your bare skin or mouth. \nAs mentioned, dry ice sits well below freezing, at -109.3\u00b0F. If your skin comes in contact with it for more than 10 seconds, you risk serious frostbite. The same goes for your mouth \u2014 if you come in contact with it while enjoying a smoky cocktail , you could even risk internal frostbite. \nFollow this tip :Use heavy gloves, tongs, or both when handling it. And when using it in drinks, remind those sipping not to let their lips touch the ice. Since it's extra dense, it will sit at the bottom of the glass and shouldn't get in the way of enjoying it, but it's still important to be aware. 3. Storing it in the freezer or an airtight container. \nOnce you bring dry ice home, it's important to store it properly before you use it. If you keep it in the freezer, it will not only melt into a gas quickly, since the freezer is so much warmer than the temperature of dry ice, but it could also cause the freezer to shut down. And if you store it in an airtight container, when it turns into a gas it could cause the container to explode. \nFollow this tip :The best place to store dry ice is in a styrofoam or insulated cooler with its lid ajar. That will help maintain its temperature while allowing it to have some ventilation for the gas to escape. 4. Using it in an area that's not well-ventilated. \nBecause dry ice is made of carbon dioxide, as it turns to a gas you don't want that gas to build up and replace the oxygen in the room. That could be dangerous. \nFollow this tip : Be sure you're using dry ice in a room that's well-ventilated. Keep a window open to be sure that there is air circulating. 5. Tossing leftovers in the sink or trash. \nAgain, dry ice is very cold. Tossing any that you didn't use at the end of the night in the sink to melt could cause serious damage to your sink and drains. Also dumping it in the garbage, which isn't a ventilated space, could cause gas buildup and the trash can could possibly explode. \nFollow this tip : Let any remaining frozen dry ice melt into a gas in a well-ventilated space. Pouring warm water will help speed the process up.

This is especially true for smaller labels trying to sway the average consumer to purchase their product. \nThis was the case with Nashoba Brook Bakery 's granola, which lists an ingredient on its bag that makes a consumer's heart go pitter-patter: love ! But the FDA has something to say about that. (Image credit: Nashoba Brook Bakery ) \nOver the last decade, the way food is packaged has become an integral part of the way we shop. Many of us are checking labels more thoroughly to confirm that what we're eating is what we think we are! \nSeveral companies (that I can think of) do funny things with the wording on their packaging. It might be little things like bios of people who made the product, stickers with their faces, funny little phrases, and, in the case of Nashoba Brook's granola, the word \"love,\" according to Bloomberg. \nIt seems completely harmless, as I'd wager that most of us realize that this ingredient is merely the spirit of the company and the manner in which it's made and not a physical ingredient being added to the final product. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, however, didn't take too kindly to this small addition and said it's a deception to customers and is asking that it be pulled from the label. \nAlthough I understand that there could be some confusion for a very small amount of people pertaining to this phrase on the packaging (say those looking to account for specific ingredients due to allergies or illness), I'd wager that most average Americans get a little smile by reading the word and that it makes them feel good for supporting the product with their purchase. \nHas the FDA gone too far or do you think there should be clear lines drawn when it comes to clever marketing and heartwarming sentiments on your favorite breakfast snack?

The best part is knowing that it's being remade because the structure and feeling of the movie are so fantastic, not because it kept missing the mark. \nThis version looks to be packed with many of the trials and tribulations that the first movie went through (with slightly less crude humor) and an upbeat soundtrack that should be great family fun. The relationship that is built between family members and food is an important one in any language. \nAlthough there's no release date scheduled yet for the United States, I have my fingers and toes crossed that we'll see one soon!

That's why, when I set off on a two-week bike trip at the end of summer, I brought along a pretty serious coffee setup. Taking a normal ritual and doing it somewhere entirely different is special, which is why I'm such an advocate of making coffee outside. \nSo what do you need to make good coffee outside? Well, there's one secret you should definitely know \u2014 plus a few more tips and tricks of the trade. (Image credit: Anna Brones ) The Secret to Brewing Good Coffee Outside \nThe main secret to good coffee outdoors is the same secret for coffee indoors: good beans . You can have all the fancy outdoor coffee-brewing gear in the world, but if the beans are bad, the cup of coffee will be too. Bring along beans from your favorite roaster, or use your trip as an excuse to find beans from a roaster you've never tried before. \nOf course, it also helps to have good gear, but I've brewed cowboy coffee on numerous occasions, and as long as you are using good coffee beans, you'd be surprised at how good of a cup you can brew. All you need is coffee, water, a pot, and a stove. \nThere are two camps on making coffee: those who add the coffee grounds before boiling the water , and those who add the grounds in after . With both methods, after a few minutes of brewing time, you can sprinkle a little cold water on the grounds (which helps them settle) and then pour slowly so as to not get too many grounds in your cup. (Image credit: Anna Brones ) The Right Gear for Brewing Coffee Outside \nIf you already brew coffee at home in anything other than an electric coffee maker, you probably already have gear that can be used to make coffee outside. I've seen plenty of people gently wrap a French press in a towel and take it on car camping trips. Moka pots are also popular with the espresso-loving crowd. \nBut if you're planning on making coffee outside often, having durable, lightweight gear that's intended for travel can be worth the investment. Of course, the right gear depends on how you like to brew your coffee. Here are my top picks, according your method of choice. If you like pour-over coffee ... \nPour over is an easy method to pull off outside (and also to clean up) since the filter holds all of the grounds. If you're making single cups of coffee, you can brew directly over the coffee cup, but if you are making coffee for a crowd, consider having a Thermos or larger vessel that you can brew a batch of coffee into. \nMSR makes a pour-over filter that fits directly into your coffee cup, GSI Outdoors has a collapsible one made out of silicone , and Snowpeak makes a collapsible coffee dripper that folds down flat and is pretty lightweight (this is the one I travel with).

A few simple steps at home can restore rusted cast iron cookware to cook-ready condition! How To Restore a Rusty Cast Iron Skillet: Watch the Video \nRegardless of the extent of rust, there are options beyond throwing out rusted cast iron. For severe rust that covers most of the cookware surface, take the piece to a machine shop to have it sandblasted and restored to raw cast iron, then season immediately. You can start with step four here, or use the following tutorial: How To Season a Cast Iron Skillet \nMost commonly, neglect or moisture results in what's called \"profile rusting,\" which can be seen and felt on the cookware.

Not only do those chintzy orange knives break too easily, but they'll also never give you very detailed results. They're not always the sharpest, and you know what they about using dull knives (they're more dangerous than sharp ones!). \nInstead, McMahon says there are only two tools you need to carve a pumpkin safely. The Only 2 Tools You Need for Pumpkin Carving 1. A Serrated Vegetable Knife \nThe best tool for cutting the eyes, mouth, and nose out of your jack-o'-lantern is something that's probably already sitting in your kitchen: \"I use a fruit and vegetable knife with a serrated edge,\" says McMahon, who notes that his is eight inches long. \"You want one with a thin blade so you can turn it easily, which will give you a more precise shape.\" \nJust as when you're cutting fruits and veggies to eat, a sharper knife is a safer knife (because you won't have to hack at the gourd with a dull instrument). \"You want to saw through the pumpkin with it,\" says McMahon, explaining that the motion should be a slow back and forth \u2014 not a pushing one. This way, the knife has a better grip on the pumpkin and makes easier cuts, which means you're less likely to have an accident. 2. A Hacked Soup Ladle \nYou know how those plastic pumpkin-carving kits always come with a scooper meant for scraping out the seeds? McMahon has a much better suggestion: \"I go to the 99 cent store and get a soup ladle \u2014 and then I break off the handle,\" he says. It's deeper than those kit scoopers and it can hold a lot more pumpkin guts at once. Note: You don't have to break the handle off; doing so just makes it easier to really get in there. \nBonus tip: McMahon actually likes to cut a hole in the bottom of the pumpkin (instead of the top, as is more traditional) and scoop from there. \"Then you can hide the electric cord to a light, and it keeps the shape of the pumpkin better,\" he says. Extra-Credit Tools \nYou really don't need any extra tools, but if you're looking to create a super-intricate design this year, there are two other instruments that will come in handy. (Image credit: Maria Siriano ) 1. An X-ACTO Knife \nThe best way to take your carving skills up a notch is to invest in an X-ACTO knife (you can buy them at any art-supply store) for detail work. McMahon says he uses these artist's knives when he wants to cut into \u2014 but not all the way through \u2014 the pumpkin's skin. \nA word of warning, though: It is much easier to accidentally poke yourself with an X-ACTO knife than with a paring knife, so you'll want to be extra careful. That said, a sharp paring knife could also be used. 2. Clay Sculpting Tools \nWire-end modeling tools (similar to the one seen here ; these are also available at art-supply stores) are meant for sculptors \u2014 and you are kind of sculpting a jack-o'-lantern when you carve it. Most at-home carvers probably won't need the level of precision that this tool gives you, but McMahon says he scrapes it against pumpkin skin to smooth it after he's cut into it with an X-ACTO knife. \nA note on safety : No matter which tools you're using to make your jack-o'-lantern, you'll want to clear off a large workspace and keep all of the instruments you're using in one place, so you know where they are at all times. \"What you don't want is to be blindsided by a sharp point when grabbing something,\" says McMahon. Because the only thing you should be cutting is your pumpkin. \nWhat do you use to carve pumpkins?

(For instance, toddlers that can do anything an average adult can't usually manage to accomplish.) This video follows the same vibe, but leaves us wondering how one learns they can catch apples when hurled at their face? \nDaniel Hartman probably enjoys things normal folks do, but he has one special quirk that the internet just can't get enough of: This college student is totally ace at catching apples in his mouth. \nNow, I'll give you a few seconds to think about that. Hard apples, when thrown his direction, are caught between his teeth the way one might do with cheese puffs, olives, or other snack foods! Apples, you guys! My mouth hurts from just thinking about it, but then again my own personal levels of grace and coordination lend themselves to falling down stairs that are still 20 feet away. I'm just that good!

If you miss, it's going to hurt. Taking an apple to the snout doesn't come with the same war stories when folks ask how you got your black eye. \nWithout consulting with a scientist we're assuming that it works because the apple is heavy enough to continue on its path into his mouth instead of bouncing off when he bites down. If you want to give it a go, maybe work your way up the food ladder first with cereal, broccoli florets, rolls, cake donuts, and kiwis. We should probably also add that the possibility of any of these shenanigans can be a choking hazard so please, please practice with care. \nIf you're going to leave this skill to the college professionals, you're welcome to join me and pull up a chair as I watch it for the fifth time in a row in amazement!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-08T00:01:36.000+03:00"}], "totalResults": 657, "moreResultsAvailable": 557, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=1eee5ef1-4d51-497e-9e88-ed86353bcda9&format=json&ts=1507410096000&q=language%3Aenglish+site%3Athekitchn.com&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 885}
