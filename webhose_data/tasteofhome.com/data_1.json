Ingredients 1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, softened 1 cup unsalted butter, softened 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 cups finely chopped peeled tart apples 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter FINISHING: Coarse sugar and cinnamon-sugar Directions In a large bowl, beat cream cheese and butter until smooth. Combine flour and salt; gradually add to butter mixture until well blended. Divide dough in half. Shape each into a ball, then flatten into a disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour. Combine the sugar, cinnamon and allspice; set aside. Divide each portion of dough into 12 balls. On a lightly floured surface, roll each ball into a 4-in. circle. Place a tablespoonful of chopped apples on one side. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon sugar mixture; dot with 1/4 teaspoon butter. In a small bowl, whisk egg yolk and water. Brush edges of pastry with egg wash; fold pastry over filling and seal edges well with a fork. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Brush remaining egg wash over tops. Cut slits in pastry. Sprinkle with coarse sugar and cinnamon-sugar. Bake at 425\u00b0 for 11-14 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool. Yield: 2 dozen. To Make Ahead: Pastry can be prepared and rolled out a day in advance. Stack pastry rounds between floured sheets of waxed paper. Test Kitchen Tips Don't worry if your dough looks a little dry and crumbly before you pop it in the fridge. It will come together beautifully after it rests. Avoid blowouts! Cutting slits in pastry allows steam to escape. This dough isn't sweetened, so it works well with savory fillings, too. Use about a tablespoon of filling per pie, and finish with a grind of coarse pepper instead of sugar.

I used Pink Lady apples and found they had the perfect combo of sweet/tart. They're not very juicy apples though and the result was that there was no \"sauce\" in this filling. When I asked my boyfriend how he liked the pies he said \"they're kind of dry\". I knew what he meant--not over baked but they didn't have the gooey filling you expect in an apple pie . The crust is really delicious though. I thought the sweetness level and spice level could have been kicked up a notch so next time I'll add more sugar and spices. I thought I had chopped the apples finely enough but next time I'll cut them even smaller so they don't protrude through the fine dough. A couple of the pies were failures so I just scrunched them up into balls, flattened them out a bit, baked them and they were every bit as delicious as the other pies--so it seems you can't really screw this up!

A mousse? Angel food cake? You'll need to learn how to separate egg whites from the yolks. Our Test Kitchen makes it easy. By Lisa Kaminski, Associate Digital Editor and Sue Stetzel, Food Editor Taste of Home \nIn cooking and baking, there\u2019s nothing more versatile than an egg. We use them to make cakes, cookies, delicious breakfasts and more. Sometimes, though, a whole egg won\u2019t do. Airy meringue cookies need the lift that only egg whites alone can provide, and the perfect hollandaise sauce (for my all time favorite breakfast: eggs Benedict ) requires just the yolks for maximum richness. \nSo how do you go about separating the two? Our Test Kitchen shows you that it\u2019s simple to separate the egg white from the yolk. You just need a little patience and a super simple tool. \nLet\u2019s get cracking! Taste of Home Method 1: Use an Egg Separator \nThe easiest way to separate an egg is to use an egg separator. This inexpensive gadget helps you separate the egg from the yolk perfectly every time. To use, place the tool over a dish and crack the egg into the separator. The egg white will slip through the slots and the yolk will remain in the cup portion. Super simple! Taste of Home Method 2: Try a Slotted Spoon \nIf you don\u2019t have an egg separator, grab a slotted spoon. Like the separator, just set it over the top of a dish and crack the egg into the spoon. The whites will slide through leaving you with the yolk. You also can crack the egg into a bowl and carefully scoop the yolk out with the slotted spoon. Just let the whites drain through. \nTaste of Home Method 3: Dare to Use Just the Shell \nTo separate eggs, I typically rely on this method because it requires no tools at all \u2013 and the fewer dishes the better! For this technique, simply give the egg a good crack right in the middle. Then, over a bowl, tip the yolk back and forth between the shells allowing the white to fall to the dish below. \nSeparating eggs this way can be a bit tricky \u2013 the yolk might slip right out of the shell, or it might catch on the edge and break. Work slowly and be sure to use cold eggs \u2013 cold yolks are less likely to break. If your recipe calls for room temperature egg yolks or whites, separate the eggs while they\u2019re cold and leave the yolks and whites out on the counter until they warm up a bit. \nWhat to Do With Extra Egg \nIf you find yourself with extra egg whites or yolks, feel free to freeze them for another time. You can pop whites or yolks into a freezer container and store. If I find myself with extra egg whites, I like to whip up a fluffy omelet like this one . And extra egg yolks? Well, they go straight into a homemade pudding. \nIf you\u2019re looking to freeze whole eggs, whisk the whites and yolks together and then pop in the freezer. Frozen eggs can keep for up to a year. To use, let the eggs come up to room temperature and then use as normal. Two tablespoons of this mix equals one large egg. \nReady to separate? Ty some of our favorite lemon meringue pie treats ! The fillings use just the yolks, and the meringue makes use of the whites. They\u2019re all super tasty to boot.

Larisa+Blinova/Shutterstock \nThe INSIDER Summary: Food brand Welch's recently launched frozen avocados. Having a freezer-aisle product for endless guacamole and avocado toasts seems convenient so we put the product to the test. At first glance, the frozen avocado chunks have a bright green hue. But after letting it thaw for 30 minutes, the frosty avocado tasted cold and sour. \nAh, avocados. When ripe, they're the perfect topper for toast or dip for a chip. If you\u2019ve found yourself scooping an armful into your shopping cart lately, you\u2019re not alone. The bumpy-skinned fruit has seen a surge in popularity over the past decade. Today, Americans buy a whopping 4 billion avocados each year. Just imagine how much guacamole that would make! \nRecently, food brand Welch's (known for its grape juice and gummy snacks) jumped into the fanaticism for the fruit. The product? Frozen avocados. Yep, your fav fruit is now being peeled, chopped and quick-frozen in 2-pound pouches, sold nationwide. The brand states that its freezer-aisle product tastes as if the avocados were \"just picked.\" \nDidn't realize avocados could be frozen? These freezable foods may surprise you, too. \nAs an avocado aficionado (and, ahem, brunch-going millennial), I decided to put this claim to the test. A taste test, that is. I nabbed a pouch from the store and gave it a try. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Welch\u2019s Frozen Avocado Review \nWelch's new frozen avocados. Nicole Doster/Taste of Home \nWhen first examining this product, I was excited for a number of reasons. The packaging promised perfectly ripe avocados\u2014something that\u2019s certainly a feat to find fresh\u2014that are hand-cut. Ordinarily, fresh avocados have a small window for ripeness. Wait a day too long, and the firm green flesh turns a mushy brown. Also, a ready-peeled avocado means less time prepping! (Or so I thought.) The Prep \nThe package's instructions read: \"Place avocados on a plate and thaw at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes. For best flavor and texture, serve while still slightly frozen.\" \nHmm. Slightly frozen avocado doesn't have the same allure as creamy, fresh fruit. I could hardly imagine layering Popsicle-like slices on a juicy burger or in our Southwest Hash . Nevertheless, I dumped some avocado into a bowl to defrost. At First Glance \nTo my surprise, the avocado chunks retained their bright green hue. If you\u2019ve ever placed sliced avocado in the fridge, you know that it turns brown quickly. The Taste of Home Test Kitchen taught me an easy trick to help keep avocados green: Squeeze lemon (or lime!) juice onto the flesh of the avocado before refrigerating. \nI quickly checked the ingredient list on the back of the pouch to see if Welch\u2019s used that same trick. Instead of lemon juice, the list included citric acid and ascorbic acid \"to promote color retention.\" Chemical-like ingredients always prompt a good Google session. Here's the breakdown. Citric acid is the acid that occurs naturally in citrus fruits like lemons or limes. It's often used as a preservative or to add a sour taste to sodas and food. And ascorbic acid? It\u2019s another name for vitamin C. That doesn't seem too bad after all! The Taste Test \nI'll be honest. The plain chunks of frosty avocado did not seem especially appealing. (Especially to a gal with sensitive teeth!) But I forked one up for a bite. Instead of creamy avocado, this chilly fruit was cold and sour. And not candy-sour or even lemon-sour, but the acidic sour that sticks to your palate after you've had something that's well, off. \nFor a while, I was in disbelief. I wanted so badly to love this product. I let the avocados defrost for 20 minutes longer, thinking the frozen texture had been a factor. I took another bite. Now it was slightly sour mush. \nTakeaway: For me, the product on its own was a fail. I'd chance the ripeness of a fresh avocado any day to get the sour taste out of my mouth. However, in a last-ditch effort to make this product successful, I had another Hail Mary test. The Toast Test \nAvocado toast. jenifoto / iStock \nEnough salt, pepper and toast might save this avocado from complete catastrophe, I thought. I mashed the fruit and spread it on. The seasoning and carbs did make the avocado taste a tiny bit better, but it was still an inadequate imitation of the real thing. I imagine that layering enough ingredients on top might mask the sour taste of the frozen avocado, though. The Final Verdict \nThe answer was clear. Though Welch's pre-peeled avocados are super convenient, the fruit tasted far too sour for my liking. I can see the product working well if blended into a fruit smoothie or thawed and sliced into my favorite Chunky Mango Guacamole recipe , as the citrus flavor wouldn\u2019t be as noticeable. But for avocado toast in the near future, I\u2019ll opt for fresh ingredients over frozen. Read the original article on Taste of Home . Copyright 2017. Follow Taste of Home on Twitter .

But not giving them the TLC they deserve can be hazardous for your health. Here's how. By Kelsey Mulvey, Freelance Writer Photo: Shutterstock / Sean Locke Photography \n\nWant to make the world a better, greener place ? Use a reusable shopping bag. \nTrotting your veggies and cream cheese home in an eco-friendly cloth bag cuts down on waste and\u2014since some stores now charge for paper or plastic\u2014saves you money. \nBut have you ever thought about how clean those totes are? We hadn\u2019t. Now that we\u2019re faced with the cold, hard facts, we know that neglecting them can be hazardous to our health. \nFact: Your Reusable Shopping Bags Are Dirty \nAnd we mean really dirty. In a study conducted by researchers at the University of Arizona and Loma Linda University, almost all the reusable shopping bags tested were jam-packed with bacteria. Half the bags had traces of coliform bacteria, while 12 percent tested positive for E. coli. To make matters worse, a recent study by the United Kingdom\u2019s Food Standards Agency reported that totes used to carry raw meat or fish can spread bacteria that can lead to fatal food poisoning. \nWhen you think about it, it\u2019s not that shocking. You put your grocery bags virtually everywhere: in a public shopping cart, the back of your car (you know, where Fido sits during long car rides) and on your counters, which are wiped clean with a mind-bogglingly unsanitary sponge. To make matters worse, your bags are filled with unwashed vegetables and possibly broken eggs and leaky meat packages. If you don\u2019t clean your reusable shopping bags, you run the risk of getting sick\u2014or worse. \nHow to Clean Your Reusable Shopping Bags \nThe good news is your reusable shopping bags can be salvaged. Simply washing your bags will kill more than 99.9 percent of harmful bacteria. Phew . You can throw cloth and canvas bags in the laundry\u2014we suggest you wash and dry them separately from your clothes, and with a lot of warm, soapy water\u2014but you\u2019ll need to wash polypropylene bags by hand. Once you\u2019ve cleaned your bags, store them in a dry, cool place until your next trip to the grocery. \nAs for how often you should wash your bags? For ultimate peace of mind, we recommend cleaning them after each grocery trip. Better safe than sorry! \nKnow When to Use Disposable \nSince the deadliest bacteria come from raw food, we suggest packing foods like burger patties, salmon fillets and, yes, even egg cartons separately. You could bring a separate reusable bag for your proteins, but if you want to err on the side of caution, place them in a disposable paper or plastic shopping bag. It\u2019s not the most environmentally or economically sound option, but avoiding cross-contaminated food could be a matter of life or death. So we think both Mother Nature and your wallet will forgive you. \nFor more ways to make your next trip to the grocery store a breeze, check out our genius hacks for grocery shopping like a pro.

My freezer had left-over roast pork so I used it for this recipe. I also added sliced onions with the pineapple to soften it a little bit.

Ingredients 2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided 1/4 cup lemon juice 1/2 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts 3/4 cup chopped green pepper 3/4 cup chopped sweet red pepper 1 loaf (1 pound) frozen pizza dough, thawed 1-1/2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese 1/4 teaspoon salt Directions Whisk together 2/3 cup oil with next six ingredients. Reserve 3 tablespoons marinade for pizza. Add chicken to remaining marinade; toss in a shallow dish to coat. Refrigerate, covered, 2 hours. Preheat oven to 375\u00b0. Place chicken mixture in a greased 8-in. square baking dish. Bake until a thermometer reads 165\u00b0, 22-27 minutes. When chicken is cool enough to handle, cut into bite-size pieces. Meanwhile, in a small skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat. Cook and stir peppers until tender, 4-6 minutes. Increase oven heat to 450\u00b0. Divide pizza dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll each half into a 12x9-in. rectangle. Transfer one rectangle to a greased baking sheet. Brush reserved marinade over rectangle to within 1/2 in. of edges. Top with chicken, peppers and cheese. Sprinkle with salt. Place second dough rectangle over pizza and pinch edges to seal. Using a kitchen scissors, cut out eyes and mouth. Cut bottom to form a jagged edge; pinch edges of dough to reseal. Brush with remaining oil. Bake 10-15 minutes or until golden brown. Yield: 6 pieces.

I weighed out exactly 2 pounds of peeled, sliced apples (Rome is what I had), added the 1 cup water and cooked until very tender. When I measured, it was exactly 4 1/2 cups! There were NO apples or any water left. Added the 5 cups of sugar and 1/2 tsp. butter, boiled and added a 1.75 oz. box of Sure-Jell pectin with the spices. Continued with the water bath and got exactly 7 half pints! I agree that it's a bit sweet, for my taste, but other than my not having the liquid pectin, everything in the recipe was spot on.

It's surprisingly flavorful for the lack of spices (I also forgot to add parsley and sage at the end). I highly recommend!\" MY REVIEW Summy User ID: 1386846 236356 Reviewed Nov. 4, 2015 \n\"Wow...a cold and blustery fall day in Arizona (yup, a bit of rain, sleet and snow), and I wanted to make butternut squash soup . But the store was out of butternut squash. Okay, so roasted autumn vegetable soup ...but, alas, the store didn't have parsnips. So, I bought an acorn squash to replace the parsnips. Long story short, I had carrots, but forgot to roast them. I left the garlic in the skins to roast with the other veggies (because then you can just pop them out of the skins). Used an immersion blender, realized I had no evaporated milk on hand (or milk of any kind, except half and half which I wanted to save for my coffee), so I used extra vegetable broth (no chicken broth on hand)...and the result was absolutely delicious. I did add about 1/2 tsp of rubbed sage and only made half the recipe as other reviewers suggested, and I'm glad I did. Even half a recipe made alot. I know, I know...I didn't follow the recipe exactly (and I am someone who needs a recipe to follow) but I thought I'd post my review anyway. I'll bet this recipe is awesome no matter what autumn root veggies you roast. It's a keeper in my recipe file.

Where do you begin? What are you even looking for? With racks and racks of clothes, housewares, shoes, toys and more, it\u2019s easy to lose track of what brought you through those doors to begin with\u2014and it\u2019s hard to tell the difference between the junk and the good stuff. 12 PHOTOS 10 things to never pass up at Goodwill See Gallery 10 things to never pass up at Goodwill Vintage Canning Jars \nMason jars aren\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. And those blue-tinted vintage Ball jars? Well, those can sell for a pretty penny to collectors. Whether you\u2019re looking to resell them, repurpose them as home decor or\u2014dare I say\u2014actually use them for canning, you\u2019ve got countless reasons to scoop up a few if you spot them on a thrift store shelf. (Get inspired by these totally genius ways to use glass jars in your home.) \n(Getty) Dishware \nMismatched dishware is very on trend right now, so if you find a few dishes short of a set or a pretty bowl here and there, it\u2019s easy to build a shabby-chic collection of mix-and-match dishes that give your table depth, character and a fun color palette. \n(Getty) Picture Frames \nTry your best to ignore that garish clown face staring at you from the velvet canvas. If the artwork\u2019s iffy but the frame is stunning, just pop out the picture and use that ornate frame to hang something you really love. Even outdated wood or metal frames can be painted a fun color to give them new life\u2014and a new sense of style. \n(Getty) Wooden Furniture \nSolid wood furniture can be quite expensive when purchased new. But thrift stores are loaded with wooden desks, dressers, chairs and benches that have timeless style and a teeny price tag. Look for clean lines and good construction\u2014if it\u2019s simple and sturdy, it\u2019ll fit in with any style home. And those unsightly brass knobs? They\u2019re easy and inexpensive to replace to give outdated furniture a modern makeover. \n(Getty) Colored Pyrex \nIf you see a vintage pink Pyrex bowl sitting on a thrift store shelf, stop what you\u2019re doing and put it in your cart instantly. Collectors go crazy for the pretty colors and bold patterns, and their resale value is off the charts. Even if you\u2019d like some of your own, the cute factor and durability make them stylish, timeless kitchen workhorses. Learn more about vintage Pyrex dishes, here. \n(Getty) Cast-iron Cookware \nWhen purchased new, heavy-duty cast-iron skillets, pots and pans can carry price tags nearly as hefty as their weight. But if you find them at a thrift store, you can bring home these beloved kitchen staples for a serious bargain. Even if they\u2019re in rough shape, it\u2019s easy to restore cast-iron cookware to like-new, food-safe conditions. And once you\u2019ve reseasoned your pan, go ahead and whip up any of these amazing cast-iron skillet recipes . \n(Getty) Books \nUnless they\u2019re building a library, people often get rid of books first when trying to declutter the house. That means thrift stores are loaded with popular page-turners for prices often 10 times lower than bookstores. So whether you\u2019re looking for a summer read, historical fiction or your favorite sports star\u2019s autobiography, if you don\u2019t mind doing some digging, you can find a whole collection of books just waiting to sweep you away. \n(Getty) Silverware \nEven if it\u2019s a big tarnished, solid silver items can be polished and restored to like-new condition fairly easily\u2014and they can be sold for a great price, depending on the current value of silver. Check to see if the piece is solid by tapping on the surface and listening for a high-pitched ringing sound. \n(Getty) Holiday Decor \nFaux greenery, plastic pumpkins, heart-shaped dishes and other holiday decor sometimes have their own sections in thrift stores. While some of it might be a little gaudy (and who are we to judge?), you can usually find holiday staples with timeless appeal\u2014Christmas-tree stands, festive dishware and ornaments\u2014for mere cents. \n(Getty) Board Games \nBelieve it or not, Cards Against Humanity can get a little tiresome after you\u2019ve played it for the hundredth time. A trip to the thrift store can mean stumbling upon a new game-night classic for super cheap. Just make sure to open the box and check that all the pieces are there and intact. If it\u2019s missing directions, do a quick search on your phone to see if they\u2019re available online. \n(Getty) Jadeite \nSeafoam green jadeite\u2014popular in the 1930s\u2014is making a big comeback in home decor. And while its retro style is reason enough to add it to your collection, it\u2019s also really valuable if you ever want to resell. Look for McKee, Jeanette or Fire-King logos on the bottom of each piece\u2014they\u2019re among the most valuable brands of jadeite, with items reselling for as much as $100 apiece. \n(Getty) SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE \nBut there are always a few diamonds in the rough. If you know what to look for, it\u2019s easy to score a vintage-chic coffee table, a glamorous picture frame or a summer page-turner just waiting to be taken to the beach. These gotta-have-it items can be found at any thrift store for a steal, and their timelessness makes them near impossible to pass up. And the savings you\u2019ll rack up from buying them secondhand? Well, that\u2019s definitely a money-saving tip that would make Grandma proud . \nWhether you\u2019re just looking for yourself or you\u2019re looking to flip a vintage item, thrifting can pay off big time when you know what to buy. Of course, follow your own sense of style and taste, and you\u2019ll walk out of the store with a bargain you\u2019ll be proud of for years to come. \nRELATED: The places in your home with the most germs: 19 PHOTOS 18 things in your home that are covered with germs See Gallery 18 things in your home that are covered with germs \nSink: It\u2019s where all your kitchen dirt goes (we hope). In fact, it\u2019s home to as many as 500,000 bacteria per square inch. Spray it down often, clean out your food trap, and scrub with scouring powder like Bon Ami at least once a week. \n(Getty) \nCutting boards: Whether you\u2019re chopping meat, veggies or fruit, your cutting board could be Ground Zero for foodborne illness. Prevent cross-contamination by dedicating one board to meats and another to produce. And always wash your board ASAP after using it\u2014especially if you were working with raw meat. Researchers at UC Davis also recommend plastic cutting boards over wood, because they\u2019re easiest to sanitize\u2014they can go in the dishwasher. Clean a wooden cutting board with soap and warm water, dry it quickly, and seal it with butcher-block oil whenever you notice the wood is drying out. \n(Getty) \nCountertops: All the action\u2014chopping, mixing, drink-pouring\u2014happens here, so of course they\u2019re covered with little particles of everything. First off, cut the clutter to give crumbs and germs fewer places to hide. Then wipe them with a damp microfiber cloth after every meal. \n(Getty) \nFridge shelves and drawers: Your refrigerator is home to both raw and cooked foods, and if it\u2019s disorganized, they probably come in contact now and then. Store raw meat in a plastic bag to serve as an extra barrier, and stop spoiled food from turning into science experiments by throwing it away as soon as you notice it. Another cool trick we use at our house: Empty and wipe down the shelves and drawers whenever you do a big grocery shop. \n(Getty) \nSponges: They\u2019ve been banned from commercial kitchens\u2014ban them from yours, too. But if you must use a sponge, rinse it with hot water after every swipe. At the end of every day, get it wet and nuke it in the microwave for a minute. Toss it after a few weeks (one week if you\u2019re missing the daily sanitizing routine). \n(Getty) \nDish towels: If you rush through washing your hands, some germs may still be hanging out on them and you\u2019ll transfer those germs to the dish towel. Change dish towels a few times a week, and wash them with hot water when you do the laundry. \n(Getty) \nMakeup brushes: They touch your face every day, coming in contact with oils, bacteria and dead skin cells. Wash them with mild soap whenever you notice makeup buildup. \n(Getty) \nTowels: Like dish towels, they pick up any germs left after a shower. Plus, if your bathroom has poor air circulation, towels may get musty if they stay damp too long. Wash them in hot water at least once a week. \n(Getty) \nTub: The equivalent of the kitchen sink for your bod, the tub takes in a lot of grime. Wipe it down with a microfiber cloth every day and get rid of mold spots with baking soda or vinegar. (Find dozens more ways to clean with baking soda here.) \n(Getty) \n\u200b\u200b\u200b Floor around the toilet: It gets splashed, plain and simple. For starters, make sure to put the lid down every time you flush. Clean up noticeable spots right away and scrub with bathroom cleaner at least once a week. \n(Getty) \nFaucet handles: You touch these before your hands are clean. \u2018Nuff said. Wipe them down with a damp microfiber cloth. \n(Getty) \nToothbrush holder: It\u2019s all about gravity: Many of the germs on your toothbrush drip into the holder. Rinse it out daily\u2014do double-duty while you\u2019re brushing your teeth with the other hand. Then sanitize your toothbrush holder in the dishwasher (if it can take it) or give it a good scrub with soap and water. \n(Getty) \nElectronics: Smartphones, keyboards, mice, the remote control (OK, let\u2019s be real: 17 remote controls)\u2014germy fingers come in contact with them all the time. In fact, the National Institutes of Health recently found that cellphones are 10 times dirtier than toilet seats. Wipe them with a damp microfiber cloth as often as possible. Don\u2019t forget to remove any cases so you can clean underneath. \n(Getty) \nDoorknobs, handles and light switches: Even if your hand only touches these items for a fraction of a second, that\u2019s enough time to transfer bacteria. Once again, a quick wipe-down with a damp microfiber cloth will do. \n(Getty) \nShoe rack: Footwear is a huge culprit for bringing germs into your home, so it\u2019s no surprise that their storage unit is a bacterial breeding ground. Put some elbow grease into cleaning this one and wipe it with bathroom cleaner\u2014you never know what somebody stepped in. \n(Getty) \nCarpets and rugs: Even if you\u2019re using the no-shoes rule , carpets suck up every crumb, dead skin cell and germ that hits them. Vacuum weekly and spritz high-traffic areas with a carpet sanitizer. If you can toss rugs into the laundry, do it. \n(Getty) \nBags: Your purse holds money (super dirty!) and your kid\u2019s lunch bag holds food (raise your hand if you ever forget to clean it out over the weekend). Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions on cleaning these to keep them in the best shape. \n(Getty) \nToys: No matter whose toys they are\u2014your kid\u2019s or the dog\u2019s\u2014they probably spend a lot of time in somebody\u2019s mouth. Consider what they\u2019re made of, then clean accordingly, tossing them in the laundry, dishwasher, or wiping with a cloth. \n(Getty) ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nuff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeanette", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bon ami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mckee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "goodwill", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "goodwill taste of home", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "aol", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cards against humanity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty) books  unless", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goodwill see gallery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty) wooden furniture  solid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goodwill vintage canning jars  mason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institutes of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uc davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ground zero", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T15:31:05.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e1a17a3a116b3908e44fd9266181ecc73f8df1b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRgKtwgxFmAZyOy5RuuZjp6L9KRwqBILclkEdOGV4AGksYEST8emFSzHMhRyTfimHoItiKQFpjSMken5ITmg9zZ", "site_full": "www.tasteofhome.com", "site": "tasteofhome.com", "site_section": "http://rss.tasteofhome.com/feed-recipe-of-the-day.rss", "site_categories": ["food", "cocktails_beer", "barbecues_and_grilling", "italian_cuisine", "desserts_and_baking"], "section_title": "Taste of Home - Recipes of the Day", "title": "Nutty Apple Streusel Dessert", "title_full": "Nutty Apple Streusel Dessert", "published": "2017-10-18T07:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn2.tmbi.com/TOH/Images/Photos/37/1200x1200/exps8124_THAT2453289C12_14_2b_WEB.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3297, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 75, "comments": 0, "shares": 75}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 399}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e1a17a3a116b3908e44fd9266181ecc73f8df1b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRgKtwgxFmAZyOy5RuuZjp6L9KRwqBILclkEdOGV4AGksYEST8emFSzHMhRyTfimHoItiKQFpjSMken5ITmg9zZ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-18T07:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nutty Apple Streusel Dessert", "text": "Nutty Apple Streusel Dessert   Nutty Apple Streusel Dessert   4.5 9 15 Many people don't think of using a slow cooker to make dessert, but I like having this hot, scrumptious apple treat waiting to be served when we finish up our dinner.

This was a truly amazing wonderful, ooey-gooey recipe! Why the 4 stars then? The baking instructions need some drastic alterations. 15 minutes at 400 degrees was way too hot. My oven does bake quite accurately to temperature but before the 15 minutes was up, the tops of the buns were way too dark. The frozen roll package instructions had the rolls baking at 350 degrees. Next time I will try that or 375 degrees (cast iron does retain temperature) and loosely covering with foil during the initial baking time. The 2nd round of baking needs adjusting too. It took about 25 minutes for the filling to completely heat through. I did have a gap before adding the filling while I was prepping other food, which allowed my skillet to cool off. Next time, I'll immediately fill and bake to try to less the 25 minute cooking time.Despite my rolls turning out overly cooked and dark, the dip was the star of the show.

You can substitute fresh onions and celery in this recipe if you prefer, but using the dried version makes it easy to throw together on a weekday morning. \u2014Colleen Delawder, Herndon, Virginia Prep: 15 min. Cook: 5 hours Ingredients 3 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes (about 8 cups) 2 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon dried minced onion 1 teaspoon dried celery flakes, optional 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper 6 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth Sour cream and pepitas, optional Directions In a 4- or 5-qt. slow cooker, combine all ingredients except sour cream and pepitas. Cook, covered, on low until potatoes are tender, 5-6 hours. Puree soup using an immersion blender. Or, cool slightly and puree soup in batches in a blender; return to slow cooker and heat through. If desired, top servings with sour cream and pepitas. Freeze option: Freeze cooled soup in freezer containers. To use, partially thaw in refrigerator overnight. Heat through in a saucepan, stirring occasionally and adding a little broth or water if necessary. Yield: 8 servings (2-1/2 quarts). Test Kitchen Tips Use 1 medium onion and 2 celery ribs, chopped, if you want to use fresh instead of dried. If you prefer fresh herbs, use 3/4 tsp. minced fresh thyme in place of the 1/4 tsp. dried. The potatoes will be tender in 5-6 hours, but they can be cooked longer since they'll eventually be pureed. Chipotle pepper adds a touch of smoky heat, but it can be omitted.

It was rich and creamy.\" MY REVIEW i_like_pie User ID: 1201160 236199 Reviewed Nov. 2, 2015 \n\"I really liked the flavor of this soup , and it is very creamy even without cream! I wondered if the sweet potato and carrot could have just been roasted with the squash. I was a little leery of it being made with water rather than broth, but I didn't miss it in the final product. Mine was a little thick, but it's probably because I halved the recipe, but used a whole sweet potato. I do not have either an immersion blender or regular one, so I used the food processor. It was probably not as smooth, but still delicious.\" MY REVIEW nsalb User ID: 1493919 235167 Reviewed Oct. 18, 2015 \n\"This has received rave reviews!

By Rachel Seis, Senior Editor Photo: Taste of Home \n\nWhen you have visitors staying with you\u2014for the weekend or an extended stay\u2014a few simple comforts left in their guest room can make a world of difference in making them feel welcome. Aside from making sure there are fresh sheets on the bed and the WiFi password on the nightstand (plus these other genius tips for hosting out-of-town guests ), take an extra step and leave out a \u201chometown pride\u201d tray. Load it up with local goodies, guides and comforts that will help your guests feel right at home. Here\u2019s what to stock it with: \nCity Guides \nIf your guests have time to set out and explore on their own, set out a city map or local visitors guide to give them a taste of what you town\u2019s all about. Or leave a list (plus addresses and contact information) of your favorite restaurants, coffee shops, stores and recreation destinations. Make sure to point out what\u2019s walkable from your home. \nPostcards \nWho doesn\u2019t love receiving a postcard? Even if the guests have visited your town before, or they\u2019re only there for a day or two, they\u2019ll appreciate sending an old-fashioned postcard to loved ones, rather than a text. Even if they don\u2019t send the postcard, they can take it home as a souvenir! \nLocal Treats \nDoes your hometown or state have a special local delicacy? Leave a bag or box of it for guests to snack on (and rave about to friends when they get home). Not sure what to offer? Check out this guide to the most iconic foods from every state . \nWater Bottles With lots of visiting, walking and eating, guests will work up a big thirst. Help them stay hydrated by including a couple water bottles on their guest tray. That\u2019ll save them the midnight shuffle to the kitchen, looking desperately for a glass to fill. (Feeling fancy? Try any of these delicious infused water ideas . Your guests will feel so pampered!) \nCoffee Mug \nOne of the first things guests will want in the morning is a fresh cup of coffee. Make them feel at home by giving them their very own coffee mug they can use throughout their stay. It can double as a guest gift and souvenir if the mug represents your hometown. \nFresh Fruit \nNothing\u2019s worse than waking up before the host and being famished. Let guests chomp on something light and healthy in their room before breakfast is served. A banana or apple will be a welcome treat to stave off early-morning tummy rumbling. \nHeadache or Stomach Relief \nLate nights, lots of food and an unfamiliar setting can often lead to monster headaches and stomach issues. Save guests a fumble through your medicine cabinet and stock the guest tray with headache medicine and stomach relief to help them feel better in no time. \nNotepad and Pens \nWhether they want to remember the name of that quaint diner, jot down a few memories or doodle first thing in the morning, guests will appreciate having some paper and pens in the room. And after all your hospitality, don\u2019t be surprised if they use them to leave a heartfelt thank-you note. \n\nFrom holiday gatherings to summer trips to just-because visits, these little touches of hospitality will make your guests feel right at home when they\u2019re on the road.

By Julie Blume Benedict, Content Director Photo: Shutterstock / Lester Balajadia If you can get over how odd it is to hang hosiery on your mantel once a year, you can usually get away with a pretty good haul: fun trinkets, candy canes , chocolate truffles and an orange. An orange? Why would there be an orange in Christmas stockings? There\u2019s quite a bit written about Christmas stocking traditions and a few bits about where oranges came into the mix. Here are a few sources that could explain why we put oranges in our socks. \nAncient Asian Myths (Spoiler: Someone Dies) Oranges are native to Southeast Asia, and the Chinese have cultivated them since antiquity. The Chinese believed oranges brought joy, good luck and warded off evil. Ancient people considered orange and red fruits as magical, likely because of their vibrant colors, so it was an honor to receive one as a gift. Oranges are also known as the fruit of life in Japan. There\u2019s even a Japanese myth that an emperor sent one of his heroes to \u201cthe Eternal Land\u201d\u2013likely southern China\u2013to obtain an orange so he could gain eternal life. Unfortunately, the emperor died before the hero returned. Sad story, but it wasn\u2019t the orange\u2019s fault. \nSt. Nick & Three Poor Husbandless Girls There\u2019s a more modern religious connection. It is said that St. Nicholas, a wealthy and generous bishop, heard of a poor, widowed father of three girls who was worried his three daughters would never find husbands. Saddened by this tale, St. Nick sneaked into the widower\u2019s house and put bags of gold in each of the girl\u2019s stockings, which were set out to dry by the fire (it must have been laundry day). The next morning, the girls discovered the treasures and rejoiced: They could now afford to pay dowries and marry! Today\u2019s orange offering is said to represent the gold that St. Nick shared. \nScarcity and a Little Help from the Adman Today we can get oranges whenever we want, but fresh oranges were once considered treasures. Before fast transit and refrigeration, the fruit was scarce and expensive, only available in larger cities along the railroads. Laura Ingalls Wilder referenced her delight in receiving an orange at least twice in her autobiographies of pioneer life. Then the Sunkist brand was created in 1908, making oranges the first produce to have its own ad campaign. The demand for oranges exploded across the country, and they became a symbol of sunny California prosperity. \nSo Spread the Sunshine Practically speaking, orange segments are already gift-packaged and ready to share. And we all know they are good for you. But did you know they are an excellent source of potassium and vitamins A and C, which help skin and hair cells grow? So no matter what legend you believe, when you share an orange, you\u2019re giving the gift of beauty. It sure beats a lump of coal. \nNeed some more vitamin C in your life?

If you're going to eat cheese puffs, don't even bother getting the healthy ones. Healthy cheese puffs just taste like rice cakes. \nWe all have those guilty pleasure snacks\u2014you know, those maybe-not-so-healthy treats that you just can\u2019t stop eating. ( Take a page from our junk food copycat recipes .) For me and a lot of Taste of Home staff, the guilty pleasure is cheese puffs. Salty, crunchy, cheesy\u2014these snacks embody the addictive junk-food spirit. But it turns out that many of us had differing opinions about the best puff out there. Some of us argued for classics like Cheetos, while others claimed that natural brands put a healthier and tastier spin on this classic. \nWell, there was only one way to settle the debate: a blind taste test. Grabbing five different brands, we decided to settle this as objectively as possible. With hand wipes at the ready to combat our cheese-coated fingers between bites, we took this challenge on. See how the puffs stacked up. 5. Chester\u2019s Cheese Flavored Puffcorn \nvia Taste of Home \nAverage rating: 5.9/10 \n\u201cIf someone said to go out and buy cheese puffs and you got these, you did it wrong.\u201d \nEdging out Chester\u2019s by a slim margin was Pirate\u2019s Booty. This brand markets their puffs as being better for you, with no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives. The panel definitely picked up on this\u2014there was a more natural cheese flavor and color to these puffs, but the taste was mild and short-lived. The aftertaste was not unlike rice cakes (which makes sense since rice is a main ingredient here), but it lacked the punchy cheese flavor we desired. In the end, this one didn\u2019t fully satisfy our cheesy cravings. 4. Pirate\u2019s Booty Aged White Cheddar Puffs \nvia Taste of Home \nAverage rating: 6/10 \n\u201cIf someone said to go out and buy cheese puffs and you got these, you did it wrong.\u201d \nEdging out Chester\u2019s by a slim margin was Pirate\u2019s Booty. This brand markets their puffs as being better for you, with no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives. The panel definitely picked up on this\u2014there was a more natural cheese flavor and color to these puffs, but the taste was mild and short-lived. The aftertaste was not unlike rice cakes (which makes sense since rice is a main ingredient here), but it lacked the punchy cheese flavor we desired. In the end, this one didn\u2019t fully satisfy our cheesy cravings. 3. Utz Cheese Balls \nAverage rating: 6.8/10 \n\u201cI could go through a whole tub of these.\u201d \nWhile Utz Cheese Balls didn\u2019t quite get top marks, they were by far the most fun snack we tried all day\u2014they\u2019re just infinitely poppable. We also found them to be one of the crunchiest options, which won them a lot of points. Flavor-wise, these puffs were pleasantly cheesy but had some buttery notes as well, making them a pleasantly savory treat. We didn\u2019t have too many negative opinions about these petite puffs, but they ended up in the middle of the rankings due to some exceptionally cheesy competition. 2. Great Value Cheese Puffs \nvia Taste of Home \nAverage rating: 8.4/10 \n\u201cThese have a robust, cheesy flavor.\u201d \nThese generic cheese puffs almost eked out a victory. They have that signature cheese puff shape (long and finger-like), plus the neon orange color that makes this snack so fun. Great Value also boasted a hefty crunch and a nice punch of cheese the second we took our first bites. The flavor of these puffs was definitely intense, but it didn\u2019t stick around too long. Overall we loved the crispness and the airiness of this puff. Our major criticism was that these were just a bit too salty\u2014knocking them down that tenth of a point they would\u2019ve needed to tie with our winner. 1. Cheetos Puffs \nAverage rating: 8.5/10 \n\u201cThis has the most orange residue\u2014the sign of a true cheese puff.\u201d \nBarely edging out our generic brand for the win was Cheetos Puffs. This classic snack got high marks for the ultra cheesy taste. Unlike Great Value, Cheetos had a subtle corn flavor, as well, making what I think was a more complex (yes, we\u2019re talking about snack foods) and well-rounded puff. Testers also noticed that these were the biggest puffs of all, providing us with more crunch per bite. In the end, the old favorite reigned supreme. \nTo recap this puff panel, our rankings are as follows (from favorite to least favorite): Cheetos Puffs, Great Value Cheese Puffs, Utz Cheese Balls, Pirate\u2019s Booty Aged White Cheddar Puffs and Chester\u2019s Cheese Puffcorn.

I was low on sour cream, so I added a couple of spoons of cream cheese to make up the difference. Tasted great, so I think I'll add the cream cheese everytime I make this recipe. So glad I gave this one a try!\" MY REVIEW TracieD User ID: 1894731 241868 Reviewed Jan. 16, 2016 \n\"My whole family loved these!!
