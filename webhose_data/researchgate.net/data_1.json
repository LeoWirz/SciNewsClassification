The project is financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation and is based at the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL in Switzerland. A team of circa 7 researchers investigates different aspects concerning how strategic planning contributes to the development of urban regions. In this paper, we argue that urban regions in Europe and beyond are currently encountering a range of challenges, such as providing a varied and efficient transportation network, affordable housing, green infrastructure, public spaces, and attractive investment conditions (Albrechts et al., 2017). In addition, a number of urban regions have been experiencing dynamic changes in the scale and scope of metropolitan governance (Zimmermann and Getimis, 2017), and new forms of flexible territorial governance arrangements have emerged (Oliveira, 2017). These economic, social and governance driven challenges unfold in a context of limited financial, human, infrastructural, land and ecological resources. 1File ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anna hersperger", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "getimis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oliveira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimmermann", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federal institute for forest", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "swiss national science foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swiss federal research institute wsl", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T13:21:18.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ab8aacf3dc84d6bf0570391c6d228b4cdf51bac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZxHCjAc8EdOfXkDPYVV5taGW7yaYc9e_.0VkQtN4CXUvdTSDCF4z.aWvX4m.WZtR4FOnC7ljwtb5GFvbMR5nhBfCZbqZc1xY-", "site_full": "www.researchgate.net", "site": "researchgate.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Neandertal DNA could impact how you look", "title_full": "Neandertal DNA could impact how you look", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.02, "main_image": "https://i1.rgstatic.net/blog/files/2017/03/dna-banner-1-1400x470.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 644, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 39, "comments": 0, "shares": 39}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8ab8aacf3dc84d6bf0570391c6d228b4cdf51bac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZxHCjAc8EdOfXkDPYVV5taGW7yaYc9e_.0VkQtN4CXUvdTSDCF4z.aWvX4m.WZtR4FOnC7ljwtb5GFvbMR5nhBfCZbqZc1xY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Neandertal DNA could impact how you look", "text": "Neandertal DNA could impact how you look 5th October 2017 by Maarten Rikken Neandertal DNA found to affect skin tone, tanning ease, and hair color. Human and Neandertal interbreeding has left us with about two percent Neanderthal DNA in non-African people. Neandertal DNA was recently linked to human immunity and modern ailments . Now researchers have found that it also contributed to other characteristics, including skin tone, hair color, sleep patterns, mood, and even a person's smoking status. The new findings also suggest that Neandertals could have differed in their hair and skin tones to the same extent as people today. We spoke to one of the authors, Janet Kelso at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, about the work. ResearchGate: What inspired this study? Janet Kelso: A 2016 study looked specifically at the influence of Neandertal alleles on disease phenotypes by using medical records for over 25,000 people. They identified a number of really interesting associations between Neandertal DNA and disease risk. We were interested in extending this idea to include non-disease phenotypes in order to determine what influence Neandertal DNA might have on ordinary variation in people today. Because Neandertal alleles are rather rare in people today, we need to have a really large number of people to do this kind of analysis. The UK Biobank pilot study now provides such an extensive resource including genetic information as well as information about hundreds of common phenotypes in more than 100,000 individuals. We were therefore able to investigate the impact of Neandertal alleles on common phenotypes in modern humans. RG: Can you tell us what you found? Kelso: The main conclusion from our work is that Neandertal DNA contributes to non-disease phenotype variation in present-day people. Neandertal DNA affects skin tone and hair color. We also see effects of Neandertal DNA on height, sleeping patterns, mood, and smoking status in present-day Europeans. Interestingly, multiple Neanderthal alleles at different loci contribute to skin and hair color in present-day Europeans, and these Neanderthal alleles contribute to both lighter and darker skin tones and hair color, suggesting that Neanderthals themselves were possibly variable in these traits. It\u2019s very important to point out that we are not saying that Neandertals DNA alone is responsible for these traits. Most traits are complex, and there are many different variants in our genomes that contribute to each of them. In fact, we show that for most of these traits Neanderthal DNA variants do not contribute more than variants that have their origin in modern humans. Neandertal DNA is just one source of genetic variation that also contributes to these traits. RG: How did you discover this? Kelso: In each individual from the UK Biobank we start by identifying all the genetic variants that may have come from Neandertals. For each of these individuals we also have a few hundred different phenotypes (height, weight, ease of tanning, smoking status, exercise habits etc.) And we can then test for each Neandertal variant to see whether there is a significant association with any of the phenotypes. RG: How does this differ from previous studies looking at the effect of Neandertal DNA? Kelso: Our findings are rather consistent with previous inferences that genes involved in skin and hair biology were strongly influenced by Neandertal DNA. However, in those previous studies it wasn\u2019t possible to determine precisely what aspect of skin or hair biology was affected. By using the very large number of individuals from the UK Biobank for whom we have direct phenotype information, we can now show that it is skin color, and the ease with which one tans, as well as hair color that are affected. RG: How many people are influenced by Neandertal DNA in things like skin tone, ease of tanning, or hair color? Kelso: This of course varies for different traits. For example, in one of the regions we identified in this study Neandertal DNA is quite common, with up to 80 percent of the Europeans tested having Neandertal DNA. For other regions Neandertal DNA is less common and affects much fewer people. RG: Is it possible for a person to tell by their appearance if they've been influenced by Neanderthal DNA? Kelso: It\u2019s not possible to tell simply by looking at someone which of their traits are influenced by Neandertal DNA! This is because almost every trait (such as hair color, or smoking risk) is influenced by many variants in our genomes. For each trait, only some of these variants come from Neandertals, many other variants do not. Featured image courtesy of Mehmet Pinarci .

If you run the same IC50 determination on the system which is half saturated ([substrate]=Km, and [ES]= half of total enzyme) then the concentration of inhibitor required to reduce rate by 2 will have to displace half of the substrate bound to enzyme which represents only a quarter of total enzyme. So IC50 would be less in the latter case. In summary you need more competitive inhibitor to reduce velocity from Vm to Vm/2 than from Vm/2 to Vm/4.

Presently in the United States, one in four high school students is dropping out of high school which translates into 2,500 students per day. Research studies have found that students drop out of high school because they encounter apathetic teachers, poor curricular offerings, unfriendly school environments, and ineffective administrative leadership. Historically, magnet schools evolved from \"schools of choice\" in the 1970s. Defined as public schools dedicated to providing quality education while reducing, preventing, or eliminating racial segregation, they offered curricula unique enough to attract or magnetize students to a particular school from the entire district. The magnet schools of today are usually located in urban areas, possess highly qualified teachers, and provide an enriched curriculum built into a theme selected by the school community. However, magnet schools are costly to implement and require money to maintain the unique curricula. The question is how effective are high school magnet programs in supporting students' academic success and how costly are the thematic magnet programs to implement and maintain? This study investigated magnet high schools in an urban District in a Midwestern state. All four high schools in the District contain a school-within-a-school magnet model and offer magnet themes of: (1) International Baccalaureate and Global Studies, (2) Visual and Performing Arts, (3) Engineering and Technology, and (4) Medical and Allied Health Sciences. The District received a federal magnet grant to implement and maintain the magnet high schools four years ago and now must decide how effective the program has been and if it should continue in its present form. This mixed-methods research study design began with the quantitative portion. Archived data were examined to determine if the magnet program had impacted student achievement as measured in standardized test scores. In addition, the data were used to examine the budget over the past four years and to compare the cost of the different thematic programs for variation. To add richness to this study, the qualitative portion was added using the theoretical framework of phenomenology to understand the lived experiences of the high school magnet students. The quantitative research findings provide insight into the academic achievement of magnet versus non-magnet students as based on the State's standardized English and mathematics ISTEP+ test scores using three levels of comparison: (1) a district-wide comparison of the magnet students versus non-magnet students' 10th grade ISTEP+ English and mathematics scores, (2) a comparison of magnet student versus non-magnet students' 10th grade ISTEP+ English and mathematics test scores, and (3) a comparison of the rise in English and mathematics ISTEP+ test scores between 8th and 10 th grade by matching magnet and non-magnet students within each high school by their free/reduced lunch status, gender, race, and 8th grade ISTEP+ test scores. In addition, the per student cost among the four magnet programs was compared. The qualitative portion of this study includes interviews of six students, who shared their stories about their magnet school experiences. These findings provide answers to the cost effectiveness of magnet programs, most necessary to those planning on implementing a magnet program. Second, the findings provide information to how effective magnet programs are in improving student achievement. Finally, rich information is provided on effective design and implementation of magnet programs as students share their stories telling why they enrolled in a magnet program and how the program has impacted their lives.

William Rutherford Imperial College London , Department of Life Sciences, London, UK Correspondence to: t .cardona@imperial.ac.uk Abstract Oxygenic photosynthesis is driven by Photosystem II, the photochemical reaction centre that oxidises water to oxygen. Water oxidation is catalysed at the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster of Photosystem II, but how or when this catalytic cluster evolved is poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that anoxygenic photosynthesis originated in the early Archaean and that it predates oxygenic photosynthesis by hundreds of millions of years.The availability of structural information of photochemical reaction centres from both anoxygenic and oxygenic phototrophic bacteria allows the refinement of evolutionary models for the origin of water oxidation at an atomic level . We note here that the homdimeric Type I reaction centre of Heliobacterium modesticaldu m has a Ca 2+ - binding site with structural homology to the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster of Photosystem II. In addition, we show that the primary sequence of this homodimeric Type I reaction centre also contains a vestigial \u2018 special pair \u2019 sequence motif with homology to that of Type II reaction centres , in addition to a standard Type I special pair sequence motif . This indicates that major structural rearrangement s occurred at the divergence of Type I and Type II reaction centres. The evolutionary implication of such structural parallels is that the divergence of Type I and Type II reaction centres , one of the earliest events in the evolutionary history of photosynthesis, is likely linked to the origin of water oxidation. Molecular evolution of ph otochemi c al reaction centres Photosystem II catalyses the light - driven oxidation of water to oxygen 1 . How and when photochemical reaction centres originated and how and when one of these evolved the capacity to oxidise water is still unknown. Evolutionary and structural analyse s of reaction centre proteins have shown that one of the earliest events in the molecular evolution of photosynthesis is the divergence of Type I (TI) and Type II (TII) reaction centres 2 . M ultiple independent lines of evidence indicate that this early divergence occurred before the diversification of the major groups of bacteria 3 : therefore, very early in the evolutionary history of life. A discovery of particular importance f o r the understandi ng of the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis is that the divergence of TI and TII reaction centres was closely followed by the diversification of oxygenic and anoxygenic reaction centres 3,4 : in other words, by the divergence of water - splitting P hotosystem II from anoxygenic TII reaction centres ; and of P hotosystem I from the anoxygenic homodimeric TI reaction centres . 2 The presence of water - splitting P hotosystem II and standard oxygenic photosynthesis in all extant Cyanobacteria highlight the fact that their most recent common ancestor was already capable of highly - efficient water oxidation chemistry 1 . W e have recently shown that the divergence of Photosystem II and anoxygenic TII reaction centres was due to the acquisition or loss of structural domains required to support water oxidation and photoprotection against reactive oxygen species 4 . Furthermore, using a Bayesian approach we have calculated that this initial divergence, linked to th e production of oxygen, is likely to have started shortly after the origin of photosynthesis and long before the most recent common ancestor of the phylum Cyanobacteia 4 . There are two very peculiar traits about oxygenic photosynthesis. The first one is the structure of P hotosystem II and its unique Mn 4 CaO 5 oxygen - evolving cluster: unlike all other reaction centres P hotosystem II is chimeric, made of a core originating from a TII reaction centre, and the antenna originating from a TI reaction centre 5 . Both the core and the antenna are needed to coordinate the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster 6 and their conserved structural traits indicate that the close inter action of an ancestral TI and TII reaction centre s has been continuous since the origin of photosynthesis 5 . The second trait is that oxygenic photosynthesis requires both types of reaction centre , P hotosystem II and P hotosystem I, to work in series allowing electron transfer from water to ferredoxin and NADP + . On the other hand, a ll anoxygenic phototrophs use a single type of reaction centre. In consequence and although it would seem counterintuitive, the origin of the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster, the chimeric structure of P hotosystem II, and the energetic coupling of two photosystems can be better explained if the divergence of TI and TII reaction centres was linked to the origin of water oxidation . A novel Ca 2+ - binding site in the Type I reaction centre from Heliobacterium modestical dum T he recent structure of the homodimeric Type I reaction centre 7 from a basal anoxygenic photo hetero trophic Firmicu tes 8,9 , Heliobacterium modesticaldum , revealed a previously unknown Ca 2+ - binding site with a number of intriguing parallels to the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster of Photos ystem II (Figure 1). Firstly, this Ca 2+ - binding siteis positioned at the donor side of each monomer of the reaction centre exactly where the hydrogen bond of the redox Tyr - His pair is found in D1 and D2 of Photosystem II. Secondly, the C a 2+ - binding site is connected to the C - terminus of the reaction centre protein, PshA, by L605 and V608 . L605 coordinates the Ca 2+ via the backbone carbonyl and V608 via an oxygen from the C- terminal carboxylic group , which was not modelled in the released structure 7 , but can be clearly s een in the electron density map (Figure 1E). This is paralleled in Photosystem II, where the C - terminus of D1 offers direct ligands to the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster: namely, D342 and A344. Remarkably, A344 the last amino acid of the processed D1 is a ligand not only to Mn , but also to the Ca 2+ via the carboxylic terminus . Thirdly, the Ca 2+ - binding site has a connection to the antenna domainof PshA , via N263, which is located within the 5th and 6th helices. N263 connects to the Ca 2+ via two water molecules. In P hotosystem II, the CP43 antenna residue E354 offers a ligand to two Mn atoms and it is in the loop connecting the 5thand 6th helices of the antenna protein. The situation is mirrored in an unusual cluster of phenylalanine residues 3 from D2 and CP47located at a homologous position to the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster in the immediate vicinity of the redox active Tyr -H is pair 4,10 . The structural parallels of the C a 2+ - binding site in the homodimeric Type I reaction centre and the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster in Photosystem II strongly indicate that the most ancestral photochemical reaction centre at the dawn of photosynthesis and before the divergence of TI and TII reaction had a divalent cation binding - site , at the donor side and near the special pair pigments, with all the structural elements already in place for the origin of a water - oxidising cluster . If this cation was Ca 2+ it would explain why the water - oxidising cluster has a Ca 2+ in that particular position, it would explain why the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster has a ligand from the C - terminus of the core protein and why the antenna protein is involved in the coordination of the cluster : these are characteristics that would otherwise have no credib le evolutionary explanation. The se parallels are also in line with the view that the emergence of water - oxidation occurred in an ancestral homodimeric photosystem 10 , which also explains the presence of a rudimentary me tal - b inding site in D2 and CP47 . A major implicat ion of a metal - binding site in an ancestral reaction centre, which was preserved and further developed in Photosystem II into the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster , is that the anoxygenic Type II reaction centres found in phototrophic Pro teobacteria and Chloroflexi likely emerged from an ancestral loss of structural domains required for water oxidation , such as the metal - binding site, the core TI antenna, and the C - terminal extension of the reaction centre protein . Several independent studies have suggested that the two ty pes of reaction centres originated after a gene duplication event 11 - 13 , and this observation has been interpreted as pho tosynthesis emerging in a n ancestral cyanobacterium or protocyanobacterium. The observations prese nted here are in line with those views, but with two modifications: 1) the gene duplication event did not occur in a protocyanobacterium , but in an ancestral bacterium predating the radiation event that led to the diversification of most phyla of bacteria , as indicated by the phylogeny of reaction centre proteins 2,3 ; and 2) the gene duplication event was linked to the development of water oxidation catalysis 5 . This is consistent with the fact that the most recent common ancestor of Cyan oba cteria, which likely predated the Great Oxidation Event, existed already at a very advance d stage after the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis 1 . Structural rearrangements at the origin of water oxidation Little sequence identity remains between TI and TII reaction centres 3 and it is well below the twilight - zone. Nevertheless, a low level of sequence identity has been preserved around the coordination site of the peripheral chlorophylls, ChlZ D1 and ChlZ D2 of Photosystem II and the homologous position in TI reaction centres 3,5 . It is noteworthy that althou gh there is structural similarity in the position of the redox cofactors and the special pairpigments (P), a structural overlap of the reaction centre proteins showed that the histid ine ligand s to P are not at homologous positions 3,14 , which suggested that a swap of ligands occurred at the divergence of TI and TII reaction centres. S tructural comparisons in combination with manual sequence alignmen ts clearly show that within the PshA primary sequence a vestigial TII P - binding 4 site is found distinct to its functional TI P - binding site (Figure 2). This TII P - binding site is found within an additional alpha - helix parallel to t he membrane plane in between the 3 rd and 4 th helices of the core domain, which is now reduced in size in all other TI reaction centres. Using such an alignment as guide, sequence homology can be retrievedbetween the 4 th helix of the core domain of PshAand the 5 th helix of TII core proteins, and between the 5 th helix of the core domain of PshA and the C - terminal alpha helix of D1 and D2 (Figure 2) . In fact, the PshA sequence between position 532 and 608, which includes the last two transmembrane helices, can be reconstructed almost entirely from the sequence of Type II reaction centres. These structural comparisons suggest a molecular mechanism for the divergence of TI and TII reaction centre s in which a shift in the arrangement of alpha - helical domains oc curred (Figure 2C) . The shift could account \u2014 in a single swift step \u2014 for : 1) the swap of histidine ligands to P that might have resulted in an increase in its oxidising potential 14,15 ; and 2) the redesign of the ligand sphere around the metal - binding site that allowed for the oxidation and trapping of multiple Mn atoms , further increasing the oxidising potential of P 14 and allowing the accumulation of positive charges , a key step towards the evolution of water oxidation . A paradigm shift It is now a well - established paradigm that anoxygenic photosynthesis predates oxygenic photosynthesis by hundreds of millions o f years 16 , if not a billion years 17 : even though e vidence for non - negligible levels of oxygen has been proposed throughout the entire Archaean period 16,18 - 22 starting 3.8 billion years ago. What is more , metabolic processes associated with the earliest putative microfossils in deep hydrothermal vents, 3.77 billion years ago,also require oxygen 23 . Such long delay between the origin of anoxygenic and oxygenic photosynthesis is also inconsistent with the molecular evolution of photochemical reaction centres 3-5 . The evolution of Photosystem II and its peculiar structural characteristics strongly argue in favour of a scenario in which some of the earliest stages in the emergence of the photosynthetic machinery were driven by the origin of water oxidation. Both the appearance of the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster and the establishment of couple photosystems, the hallmark of oxygenic photosynthesis, are better explained if water oxidation drove the early split of TI and TII reaction centres 5 . If the earliest stages in the evolution of Mg - tetrapyrrole - based photoautotrophy can be tra ced back to the early Archaean , then so can be the evolution of water oxidation chemistry. This age is so close to the root of life that it likely predates the diversification events that led to the major gro ups of bacteria that characteris e the oxygenic w orld we live in 24,25 . From this perspective, it may have been the origin of water oxidation coupled to the simultaneous emergence of aerobic metabolism what led to the Archaean expansion of bacterial diversity 24 . Therefore, the phylum Cyanobacteria should be regarded as the only clade of bacteria to have retained the capacity to split - water using light. An early evolution of water oxidation could also account for the apparent antiquity of respiratory terminal dioxygen reductases, an issue that has led to a debate on whether aerobic respiration p redates oxygenic photosynthesis 26,27 ; the very early emergence of enzymes to 5 handle r eactive oxygen species 28,29 and of oxygen - using enzymes required for the catabolism of tyrosine and phenylalanine and the oxidation of aromatic rings and phenolic compounds 29 .

It is based on monitoring studies carried out in rave nightclubs and qualitative research (participant observation, informal interviews) conducted at illegal raves. It includes an account of the response of police and health authorities to the North-West rave scene, and concludes with a 10-point harm-reduction strategy.

Thus it rationalised US casualties in Afghanistan as work of Al Qaeda and other non state actors which were less than 10 % of all insurgents and continued to disperse US soldiers in penny packets doing pointless sentry duty. In President Bush tenure for 7 years US soldiers were not unnecessary and pointlessly exposed and total US fatal casualties due to real fighting were less than 400. Afghanistan was safer till 2008 and one could drive safely all 1050 km from Kabul To Herat.

In this post we try to give a response to the following question ''Why BitCoin was born in 2009 (conceived in the summer of autumn 2008)???''. https://www.researchgate.net/post/Why_BitCoin_was_born_searching_for_socio-financial_causes The recognized key elements were: - Economic-Financial Collapse. - Quantitative Easings Financial Ecosystem. - Bank Defaults and EuroArea Crisis. - Anti-System Party-Movements. - First Social Media Explosion. From the elements listed above it is easy to see that BitCoin and its revolutionary blockchain, was born and spread in a historical, socio-economic, democratic, and costume change of Western societies. From the B-Money and Bit-Gold informatic ashes, BitCoin (by means of blockchain) was conceived as a coin democratic, secure, widespread, mass-driven, not linked to centralized systems, but linked by a widespread and potentially expanded mechanism to the entire population, perfectly married to the ''social media invasion'' of 2008-2010. This crypto-currency is the perfect response from an over-enlarged base of the total population vs. the massive and centralized bureaucratic, political, financial structures (regular financial markets and central banks included). In this way the digital crypto-currency was the natural, revolutionary and protest-oriented response to the persistent and violent crisis; a crisis that was of financial-economic type in a first step, then bankinsurance-governative, and then institutional and representative, traveling in perfect tandem with the anti-system party-movements that starts-strengthening throughout the Western world. One point to not underestimate is the following: <> + <<a perceived (correct in part) of the high risk of the traditional systems of bank-insurance deposits>>. \u27141\u2714Introduzione. In questo post si tenta di fornire una risposta all'interrogativo seguente: ''Perch\u00e9 BitCoin nacque nel 2009 (concepito nell'estate-autunno 2008)??'' Tale post \u00e8 nato da una ''quest'' accademica rivolta in rete su un noto social network per ricerca e ricercatori https://www.researchgate.net/post/Why_BitCoin_was_born_searching_for_socio-financial_causes Ovviamente risulta arduo e forse impossibile stabilire realmente quali siano state le cause che hanno portato alla nascita del BitCoin proprio in quel momento. Nonostante questo, si tenta comunque di fornire una preliminare ricostruzione degli elementi socio-economici chiave che vigevano in quella fase storica dei mercati monetari e finanziari globali. Segue qualche cenno storico. \u27142\u2714Cenni Storici sul Valore del BitCoin. In agosto 2008 venne registrato il dominio BitCoin.org. In novembre 2008 fu pubblicato un articolo tecnico da parte di Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonimo) nel quale si illustrava questo nuovo protocollo P2P per la generazione di questa criptomoneta. In gennaio 2009 Satoshi Nakamoto produsse i primi 50 BitCoin (BTC mining) mediante il suo protocollo informatico. Le prime transazioni avvennero proprio tra Satoshi Nakamoto e alcuni informatici che nel decennio precedente avevano gi\u00e0 creato prototipi di criptomonete che per\u00f2 avevano avuto una scarna diffusione: Hal Finney (il primo a ricevere BitCoin da S. Nakamoto); Wei Dai (creatore di B-Money); Nick Szabo (creatore di Bit-Gold). Nakamoto dopo aver prodotto (mining) circa 1 milione di BitCoin o pi\u00f9, lasci\u00f2 tutta la faccenda criptomoneta a Gavin Andresen che divenne il n.1 della Bitcoin Foundation. Le quotazioni ufficiali del BitCoin partirono su alcuni exchanges che oggi non esistono pi\u00f9 a causa di chiusura fallimentare e/o melt down dei loro sistemi di sicurezza informatica. Nell'intero 2009 il valore teorico del BitCoin espresso in Dollari USA era stimabile tra 0.00001 e 0.001. Nell'anno successivo (2010) le prime rilevazioni sul defunto exchange BitCoinMarket, diedero come price start 0.003 US$ tra il 26 ed il 27 aprile 2010. In quello stesso anno venne registrata anche la prima operazione fisica di pagamento con BitCoin: due pizze = 10000 BTC https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0 Tutto quanto accadde dal 2010 in poi \u00e8 storia grafica scritta sugli exchanges ora defunti BitCoinMarket e MtGOX e dal 2011 sugli altri exchanges ancor oggi operativi. Incredibile e di degna menzione fu la prima esplosione rialzista del BitCoin, che vide passare le quotazioni da zero a 0.17US$ in due strappi consecutivi https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319965271 }- valore stimabile 0.0001 al 01/04/2010 a 0.003 del 26/04/2010 }- 0.003 del 26/04/2010 a 0.17 del 15/09/2010 per un movimento complessivo di 17000X o 17 %. I successivi eventi grafici chiave possono facilmente essere desunti dalla cronaca delle evoluzioni sia del BitCoin, sia dei vari exchanges, sia delle innumerevoli ICO che si sono susseguite. Ora per giungere ad una grossolana e preliminare risposta al quesito oggetto di questo post, risulta necessario delineare lo scenario che vigeva nel 2008/2009 sul fronte mondiale socio-economico-finanziario. \u27143.1\u2714Collasso Economico-Finanziario. Risulta particolarmente interessante la notevole coincidenza di alcune date chiave per il BitCoin durante la sua nascita (agosto/2008 - novembre/2008 - gennaio/2009 - aprile/2010) con alcune date di rilievo della violenta e virulenta crisi economico finanziaria, prima US e poi globale, come ad esempio: }- Dafaults sequenziali di Fanni Mae, Freddie Mac, WaMu, Lehmann Brothers ed in parte di MBIA, a fine estate 2008; }- Primo minimo catastrofico dei mercati azionari mondiali in autunno 2008 e secondo minimo nel primo trimestre 2009; }- Flash Crash storico nel 6 maggio del 2010 sui listini azionari US https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash I perni mondiali dei mercati finanziari si rivelarono parzialmente marci e decisamente poco resistenti rispetto ad eventi di crisi globali e sistemiche; gli stessi listini azionari sembravano decisamente meno stabili di quanto comunemente si riteneva fino a pochi trimestri prima. \u27143.2\u2714Ecosistema Finanziario dei QE. Proprio in autunno 2008, in piena tempesta finanziaria, parte il moderno Quantitative Easing americano col piano Paulson (vedi mappa in https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282002813), al fine di arginare la catena di collassi finanziari-bancari. Questo diede il via all'attuale ecosistema finanziario caratterizzato da: }- bassissima volatilit\u00e0; }- assets rischiosi in continuo apprezzamento; }- tassi dei bond governativi schiacciati progressivamente verso soglie dal valore zero o addirittura negativo rispetto l'inflazione. In buona sostanza si crea un ambiente perfetto per l'investimento in capitale di rischio o anche di forte rischio, a causa dell'ombrello protettivo fornito dai QE sistemici volti a proteggere la stabilit\u00e0 dei mercati finanziari stessi. Conseguentemente i rendimenti dei cosiddetti porti sicuri (bond governativi o privati ''investment-grade'') vengono progressivamente polverizzati, causando l'azzeramento della remunerazione che finora veniva elargita sul cash e/o equivalenti di cash, particolarmente in EuroArea. \u27143.3\u2714Bank Defaults e Crisi EuroArea. Dopo la prima violenta e massiccia ondata di fallimenti bancari US, che per\u00f2 fu diligentemente ordinata e rapidamente assorbita dal sistema bancassicurativo USA, il quale ne riesce ad emergere addirittura potenziato https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313846667 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294579609 e rafforzato, si giunge al 2011-2012 con una vera e propria perfetta tempesta bancaria e governativa ''made in EuroArea'', con protagonisti Grecia, Cipro, Portogallo, Spagna, Italia, Irlanda, e per concludere con una seria minaccia sulla stabilit\u00e0 ed esistenza stessa dell'Euro. Questa fase fu caratterizzata da spread interni tra i bond governativi dei paesi di EuroArea che saltarono alle stelle; in concomitanza, numerosissime banche presentavano bilanci fallimentari e/o pre-fallimentari. In pratica, all'interno dell'Europa e particolarmente di EuroArea, dopo diversi decenni di fortissima (ed in parte cieca) fiducia verso stati e sistema finanziario, si assistette letteralmente alla polverizzazione della fiducia sia nella solidit\u00e0 di banche e sistema bancassicurativo, sia nella solvibilit\u00e0-solidit\u00e0 di interi gruppi di paesi chiave della EuroArea. Tale livello di fortissima sfiducia perdurer\u00e0 per l'intero 2016 e per alcuni paesi anche fino al primo trimestre 2017 (vedasi sistema bancario Italia). Proprio a fine 2011, in piena esplosione Euro-crisi, BitCoin termina una sua lunga correzione partita dai massimi del giugno 2011 ed inizia una inesorabile ascesa che ancor ora deve arrestarsi, risalendo da area 2.5US$ (novembre-dicembre 2011) a oltre 1150US$ (dicembre 2013), per poi subire una lunga correzione fin verso area 200US$ (2015) e poi un decollo fragoroso tuttora in atto verso 5800US$. Tutto il movimento 2.5-5800US$ risulta perfettamente sovrapposto alla fase di violenta sfiducia sul sistema EuroArea, Euro, Bond periferici europei e sistema bancario UE. Bisogna menzionare anche un ulteriore e tardivo elemento di fortissima sfiducia-disaffezione da parte degli investitori retail in Europa che avvenne nel 2015 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271137015). A met\u00e0 gennaio la Banca Nazionale Svizzera fu artefice di un collasso storico dell'Euro vs. Franco Svizzero, causando ingentissime perdite diffuse sui conti di numerosissimi operatori ForEx, anche professionisti, sganciando improvvisamente le due monete che invece fino a quel momento risultavano rigidamente fissate in tandem. Fondamentalmente il sistema bancario europeo venne percepito come fragile ed insicuro, quasi come fraudolento. Inoltre il sistema di moneta unica UE e il comportamento delle Banche Centrali europee venne percepito come un pesante fardello burocratico opprimente e non come una opportunit\u00e0 di crescita e miglioramento. \u27143.4\u2714Movimenti Partitici Anti-Sistema. In concomitanza allo sgretolamento della fiducia in EuroArea verso la UE, Euro e relativo sistema bancassicurativo (post 2009 e con forte incremento dal 2012 in poi) si assiste, in numerosi stati dell'unione, alla nascita e/o rafforzamento progressivo di movimenti partitici anti-sistema dotati di una tipologia di democrazia alternativa a quella finora vigente e decisamente allargata alla base, con una partecipazione diffusa e maggiormente attiva della cittadinanza. Tali movimenti, in numerosi casi sono diventati importantissimi player nazionali politici, trasformandosi in reali concorrenti delle tradizionali forze politiche. \u27143.5\u2714Prima Social Media Explosion. L'ultimo elemento, perfettamente sovrapposto al ''concepimento'' del BitCoin, fu la prima esplosione massiva dei social media moderni. Difatti proprio il passaggio 2008/2009 risulta caratterizzato da un incremento a gradino senza precedenti nella partecipazione sia alla rete globale sia alla contenutistica del web stesso, dando luogo ad una vera rivoluzione globale di costume e sociologica. In buona sostanza anche in tal caso si assiste ad un imponente allargamento alla base nella partecipazione al web da parte della popolazione mondiale, la quale si sta affrancando definitivamente dagli statici desk-pc, passando progressivamente ad una vera e piena connettivit\u00e0 ad alte prestazioni e mobile. \u27144\u2714Considerazioni. Dai punti elencati sopra si evince agevolmente che il BitCoin e la sua rivoluzionaria tecnologia informatica alla base, nacque e si diffuse in un momento storico di cambiamento socio-economico-democratico e di costume delle societ\u00e0 occidentali. Dalle ceneri informatiche di B-Money e Bit-Gold, e mediante blockchain (la vera novit\u00e0) venne concepito il BitCoin come strumento democratico, sicuro, allargato alle masse, non emesso e regolamentato da sistemi centralizzati ma da un meccanismo diffuso ed ampliato potenzialmente all'intera popolazione e perfettamente sposato con la '''social media invasion''' che ha caratterizzato il 2008-2010. Questa cripto-moneta (e la miriade di altre che si son succedute) costituisce la perfetta risposta proveniente da una base iper-allargata alla massa di popolazione tutta, verso le imponenti strutture burocratiche, politiche e finanziarie centralizzate (mercati finanziari regolamentari e banche centrali incluse). In tal modo la cripto-moneta digitale costituiva la risposta naturale, rivoluzionaria e di protesta alla perdurante e violenta crisi che imperversava; crisi che dapprima fu di tipo finanziario-economico, poi bancassicurativo-statale e poi istituzionale e di rappresentanza, viaggiando in perfetto tandem coi movimenti partitici anti-sistema che si stavano costituendo-rafforzando in tutto il mondo occidentale. Un punto da non sottovalutare risulta essere la coppia seguente: <<inesorabile e continuata spinta verso assets rischiosi a causa degli effetti dell'ecosistema finanziario dei quantitative easing>> + <<<percezione, in buona parte corretta, della elevata rischiosit\u00e0 dei tradizionali sistemi di deposito bancassicurativi>>>. \u27145\u2714Riferimenti.

Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the four strains formed a new lineage related to the genus Rhizobium and the sequence similarities between the isolate and the most related type strain Rhizobium giardinii was 96.5%. These strains also formed a distinctive group from the reference strains for defined Rhizobium species based on housekeeping gene sequences (atpD and recA), BOX-PCR fingerprinting, phenotypic features and symbiotic properties. The representative strain CCNWGS0238(T) has DNA-DNA relatedness of less than 33.4% with the most closely related species R. giardinii.

The results came as a surprise to the researchers. \u201cI had assumed there would be no relationship, or even a negative one, similar to that seen for smoking tobacco,\u201d said urologist Michael Eisenberg , the study\u2019s senior author. Marijuana users have 20 percent more sex Instead, Eisenberg found that marijuana users are having about 20 percent more sex than people who abstain from the drug. The study also suggests the effect is dose-dependent: more frequent use was associated with more frequent sex. What\u2019s more, the link was found across all kinds of demographic groups. \u201cThe overall trend we saw applied to people of both sexes and all races, ages, education levels, income groups and religions, every health status, whether they were married or single, and whether or not they had kids,\u201d said Eisenberg. The trend also held up when the researchers accounted for survey respondents\u2019 use of other drugs, like cocaine and alcohol. Eisenberg says this suggests the connection goes beyond less inhibited personalities being both more sexually active and more likely to use marijuana. But he also cautions that his results don\u2019t necessarily mean that marijuana causes people to have more sex. \u201cThere are arousal pathways that are stimulated by marijuana that could explain the results,\u201d he said, \u201cbut for this study, it\u2019s important to know that correlation does not mean causation.\u201d Doctors seek answers to patients\u2019 questions According to a recent Gallup poll , one in eight Americans say they currently use marijuana, and 45 percent say they\u2019ve tried it at least once. That\u2019s a record high and a number likely to grow as more states legalize the drug for recreational or medical use. That means more patients are asking their doctors about how using marijuana might impact their health\u2014questions doctors aren\u2019t always able to answer. \u201cI see patients come in with a variety of sexual complaints,\u201d said Eisenberg. \u201cAs we examine health and lifestyle related factors that may impact sexual function, marijuana has come up more and more frequently. As I looked in the literature, there was not a lot of data available. I wanted to fill that gap.\u201d The findings will be published today in the Journal of Sexual Medicine .

Ternyik really grateful for your time and your interest 6d ago Stephen I. Ternyik 21.29 \u00b7 Techno-Logos, Inc., since 1985 You know yourself that this is an oversimplification , but as you really used very few words for your analysis, you have captured a lot of decisive facts !Around 1890, the USA werde designated to become a world power: industrial capacity, great hinterland, population growth, etc. I add 2 important economic facts: A) Higher wages could be paid, because rent was lower than in Europe; B) The esablishment of the Fed. The governing mentality of the central powers was a backward feudalist state of dealing with people, while the US was an emerging democratic magnet for the masses. pdf ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephen i. ternyik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hitler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ussr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-30T14:26:21.001+02:00"}], "totalResults": 33, "moreResultsAvailable": 0, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=1eee5ef1-4d51-497e-9e88-ed86353bcda9&format=json&ts=1509366381001&q=language%3Aenglish+site%3Aresearchgate.net&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 575}
