Hoping to capitalize on this coffee craze, bartenders are creating cocktails paying homage to Starbucks\u2019 pumpkin-pie-in-latte-form. Here are six boozy takes on the fall favorite. \nPumpkin Pie Martini at Fog Harbor Fish House , San Francisco, California This sweet seasonal special will give you all the fall feels. Vanilla vodka is mixed with pumpkin-spiced cream to create a velveteen sipping sensation. Crumbled speculoos cookies on the rim add just a touch of crunch.   Fog Harbor Fish House . \nPumpkin Spice Martini at Eden , Chicago, Illinois Yo-ho-ho, and two bottles of rum! Goslings Black Seal and Parce fuel this fall fave. Pumpkin spice syrup in the glass and sugar-roasted pumpkin seeds on the rim add autumnal accents.   Eden . \nPumpkin Souffl\u00e9 Martini at Sugar Factory , Arlington, Virginia You deserve dessert and a cocktail. This two-for-one proposition gets its punch from Stoli vanilla vodka and Godiva white chocolate liqueur. Pumpkin pie spices, whipped cream, and pumpkin spice-flavored Hershey\u2019s Kisses will give you the impression that you\u2019re enjoying a slice of something sweet from the dessert buffet at Thanksgiving.   Sugar Factory . \nThe Pumpkin Patch at Alexander\u2019s Steakhouse , San Francisco, California There\u2019s history in this glass. The September-minded sipper features a distilled pumpkin lager based on a recipe by Thomas Jefferson. It\u2019s joined by applejack forged from heirloom fruit, WhistlePig barrel-aged maple syrup, Clear Creek Douglas fir brandy, and allspice dram.   Alexander\u2019s Steakhouse . \nSpiked Pumpkin Spice Chai at Chiya Chai , Chicago Illinois There are more than 150 possible chai combinations here, including this one that\u2019s awesome for autumn. Organic Nepalese tea is mixed with the usual suspects \u2013 cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves \u2013 along with some less-expected ingredients: ginger juice, ground ginger, and ground black cardamom. Then it\u2019s spiked with vodka and served either hot or cold, depending on whether you want to cool down or warm up.   Chiya Chai . \nJack-O-Lantern at CityGate Grille , Naperville, Illinois Carve out some time to really savor this spiced up libation. It\u2019s a triple threat treat: Jack Daniel\u2019s Fire whiskey, RumChata cream liqueur, and pumpkin liqueur. Guaranteed to jack you up in the best way possible.

The tasty taproots work well as an accent element, but they truly shine when used as the centerpiece ingredient. Here are seven delicious beet dishes starring the rustic root vegetable. \nRoasted Heirloom Beet Stack at Rx Boiler Room , Las Vegas, Nevada Tower of power. A foundation of goat cheese supports two floors of gold and red beets with a rooftop forged from matchstick Bosc pears. It\u2019s finished with a flourish of Banyuls vinaigrette and pistachios.   Rx Boiler Room . \nHaru Bito at Uchi , Dallas, Texas Eat the rainbow. This kaleidoscopic preparation features a trio of beets: dark red, rich gold, and ones with pink and white concentric circles. Plus there are red strawberries and bright green avocado to add further splashes of color.   Uchi . \nCarrot & Beet Tartare at The Sarsaparilla Club , Miami Beach, Florida No cows were harmed in the making of this tartare. That\u2019s because it\u2019s created with a colorful array of beets and carrots dressed with black garlic aioli, capers, and mustard. Wavy root chips are perfect for scooping.   The Sarsaparilla Club . \nPlancha Seared Baby Beets at Farmer & The Seahorse , San Diego, California That\u2019s gold, Jerry! Gold! Well, golden beets anyway. Auric chunks of the root vegetable are dressed up with ricotta salata, hazelnuts, herb oil, and sea salt.   Farmer & The Seahorse . \nKenny\u2019s Gnocchi at Pazzo Ristorante , Portland, Oregon One of chef Kenny Giambalvo\u2019s most beloved dishes is his namesake gnocchi. The tender knuckles are poached and simmered in an extravagantly rich sauce of black truffles, cream, and gorgonzola dolce, which gets its rich pink color from red beets. It\u2019s finished off with a drizzle of black truffle oil.   Pazzo Ristorante . \nBeet Tartin at Acacia House , St. Helena, California Move over apple tarte tatin because you\u2019ve got some savory competition. This flaky nest is filled with beets, smoked mascarpone, watercress, and pistachios. Simple and sublime.   Acacia House . \nBeet Home Fries at Lonesome Dove , Fort Worth, Texas Not your usual home fries. That\u2019s because these are made with red beets instead. Don\u2019t worry; they still taste great dunked in ketchup or hot sauce.   the Lonesome Dove . \nLet us know where you\u2019re sampling the most delicious beet dishes of the season   credits: Tim Love (Lonesome Dove); Sabin Orr Photography (Rx Boiler Room); Becca Batista (Farmer & The Seahorse); Heather Hawkins (Uchi); tjphotonotions.com (The Sarsaparilla Club).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "beet tartin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenny giambalvo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim love", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pazzo ristorante", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sabin orr photography", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "becca batista", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heather hawkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haru bito", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenny", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pazzo ristorante", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the sarsaparilla club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "acacia house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarsaparilla club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plancha seared baby beets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carrot & beet tartare", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seahorse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uchi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fort worth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada tower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. helena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california move", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T01:24:34.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "65cca555239b70067b53592299f51392146569b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpZU33Gl7KhhlhTBUxVl1KGZWLWw.ZsS6T11HFoIbrb9QunDHOxbeQ7yz2JBv5YwMH3H5Hdxj607_2X8h5_pWjyw0Bgq.FbpL8FhxZrLDknAfNOh63Jw0y4D1NTj9605y2r4XW7lJtHUQ--", "site_full": "blog.opentable.com", "site": "opentable.com", "site_section": "http://blog.opentable.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "OpenTable Blog", "title": "Fall Inn Love: Top New England Restaurants for Autumn Dining + Colorful Foliage", "title_full": "Fall Inn Love: Top New England Restaurants for Autumn Dining + Colorful Foliage", "published": "2017-10-10T20:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://blog.opentable.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Hidden-Pond-Earth-Restaurant-Exterior.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1304, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 23, "comments": 0, "shares": 23}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "65cca555239b70067b53592299f51392146569b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpZU33Gl7KhhlhTBUxVl1KGZWLWw.ZsS6T11HFoIbrb9QunDHOxbeQ7yz2JBv5YwMH3H5Hdxj607_2X8h5_pWjyw0Bgq.FbpL8FhxZrLDknAfNOh63Jw0y4D1NTj9605y2r4XW7lJtHUQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Carley Thornell", "published": "2017-10-10T20:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fall Inn Love: Top New England Restaurants for Autumn Dining + Colorful Foliage", "text": "LinkedIn \nWhether it\u2019s a leaf-peeping drive, an excuse to go apple-picking, or a romantic weekend away, there are plenty of reasons to visit New England\u2019s coziest inns \u2014 but most of them have to do with food. Farm-to-table dining and regionally sourced produce, along with hearty and sometimes historic recipes, are all as comforting as beautiful settings. Here are top New England restaurants for autumn and a front seat to fall foliage. \nThe Red Lion Inn , Stockbridge, Massachusetts The centerpiece of Norman Rockwell\u2019s quintessential Americana, The Red Lion has anchored the setting of his iconic \u201cStockbridge Main Street at Christmas\u201d painting since 1773 with 125 antique-filled rooms and suites. Today, there\u2019s wifi, a year-round heated pool, yoga classes, and more, while its restaurant menu steadfastly remains one of locally sourced comfort food. Roast native turkey and clam chowder are favorites, along with mouthwatering Lila\u2019s Mountain Lamb and fresh greens sourced from Equinox Farm. There are plenty of activities nearby, including Rockwell\u2019s home and studio, myriad art galleries, Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center, a Kripalu yoga center, hiking, shopping, orchards, farms, wineries, and brewers \u2014 all worth visiting. Make a reservation at The Red Lion Inn . \nThe Mayflower Grille at The Mayflower Grace , Washington, Connecticut Every season is different at Mayflower, where executive chef Isaac Olivo updates the menu quarterly using seasonal ingredients from local farms in addition to those from his own garden that produces crops such as eggplant, heirloom tomatoes, and watermelon radishes. Olivo also works with a forager to seek out quality ingredients that are readily available but not widely used in the Northeast, including spruce shoots, stinging nettles, and fiddlehead ferns, to incorporate unique flavors guests may not have yet experienced. It\u2019s not difficult to imagine them growing in the 3,000-acre nature preserve surrounding The Mayflower Grace, which offers up bright, airy common areas in soothing creams and whites \u2014 including a spa \u2014 and more intimate areas to relax, including the library, a garden room with a view, and an indoor pool. Make a reservation at The Mayflower Grille at The Mayflower Grace . \nSALT Kitchen + Bar , Wentworth By the Sea, New Castle, New Hampshire Nearby Portsmouth may catch most of the buzz for its culinary scene, fun boutiques, bars, and waterfront charms, but majestic Wentworth By the Sea and its SALT restaurant also feature views that are just as breathtaking on the outside as the inside. A recent renovation brought this 1874 Victorian grand dame into the 21st century, but the mural in the soaring dome of the dining room is just as much of a conversation starter as it was in the 19th century. Back then, the lively chef\u2019s bar, another recent addition, didn\u2019t exist to serve up charcuterie and local cheese boards or the craft cocktails offered today. The full menu also made its way into the modern era with handmade pastas, locally caught seafood, and steaks. Make a reservation at SALT Kitchen + Bar . \nPINE at the Hanover Inn Dartmouth , Hanover, New Hampshire PINE is worth the drive to New Hampshire for the roaring fireplace alone, but James Beard Award-winning chef Michael Schlow\u2019s restaurant across from the Dartmouth College campus is in a class of its own. The 125-seat space is warm and intimate with urbane d\u00e9cor featuring pieces by Vermont\u2019s Simon Pearce studio and Vermont-based Pompanoosuc Mills (the Green Mountain State is just over the border). Executive chef Justin Dain sources his meats, dairy, and produce from area farms whenever possible, making the cheese plate just about impossible to pass up. Make a reservation at PINE at the Hanover Inn Dartmouth . \nArtistry on the Green , Inn at Hastings Park, Lexington, Massachusetts From Top Chef to sleepy Lexington, Massachusetts, chef Stacy Cogswell\u2019s got a different kind of spotlight now in her first executive chef role. The historic 54-seat Inn at Hastings Park recreates regional favorites with inspired twists, and Cogswell is intimately familiar with New England\u2019s seasonal bounty and palate as a native who grew up learning how to cook in her grandma\u2019s kitchen. After world travels to East Asia, Europe, the Caribbean, and Central America, she returned to her home state to whip up entrees like five-spice duck with local butternut squash, in a warm setting that pays homage to Lexington\u2019s role in the early battles for British independence. Make a reservation at Artistry on the Green . \nEarth at Hidden Pond , Kennebunkport, Maine Chef Justin Walker\u2019s menu changes constantly with ingredients exclusive to Hidden Pond\u2019s sprawling chef\u2019s garden, surrounding woods, the coastal Maine waters, and, most importantly, his own farm where he and his family raise goats, chickens, and ducks along with fruits and vegetables. Justin, who runs the restaurant and farm with his wife Danielle Walker (Earth\u2019s general manager and beverage director), first discovered his love of farming and food at an early age while foraging for herbs and mushrooms and spending the winter making cheese with his grandfather. Danielle\u2019s father, Ted Johnson, has been fishing the Maine waters for decades on his 38-foot lobster boat, the \u201cJessie Dan,\u201d (named after Danielle and her sister Jessica); he supplies Justin with 200-300 pounds of lobsters each week, which are brought in right after they\u2019re caught and never tanked to retain the purest salty and briny flavor. Make a reservation at Earth at Hidden Pond . \nMain Dining Room at the Omni Mount Washington Resort , Bretton Woods, New Hampshire A haven for skiers and outdoorsmen, Omni Mount Washington is renowned for its views of the White Mountains and its elegant main dining room, a unique octagonal room appointed with crystal chandeliers, Tiffany stained glass, and Currier & Ives prints. Menu selections include stuffed New Hampshire mushrooms, maple-braised short rib, and a New England lobster boil. You\u2019ll have to trade in your snow pants for a blazer to enjoy live music nightly or afternoon tea on Fridays and Saturdays. No jacket? No problem. The Omni is also home to Stickney\u2019s, a more casual eatery, offering pub and steakhouse fare with an extensive wine list and creative cocktails including the Mount Washington Apple Martini.

Their father, Tony, owned The Four Seasons, a classic Greek diner, in Alexandria, Virginia. As the older brother, Nicholas started in the kitchen when he was in second grade; George followed a year later. Both were self-proclaimed \u201ctoast boys,\u201d manning the industrial grade toaster on the weekends to put out thousands of slices over the course of a shift. For their efforts, they would take home up to $60 each \u2013 big money for little kids. They spent it on sports equipment, Nintendo games, and Starter jackets. \u201cWe never had to shake our parents down or wait for our birthdays,\u201d says George. \nIn middle school though, their paths diverged. George started working the line, while Nicholas began manning the host stand and the register. This split between the front of the house and the back of the house would define their career arcs, while setting them up for a perfect partnership years down the road as the team behind a burgeoning Greek empire in the Washington, D.C. area, which includes Kapnos in the District, Kapnos Kouzina in Bethesda, Maryland, Kapnos Taverna in Arlington, Virginia, and the newly opened Kapnos Taverna inside the Hotel at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland. \nThe brothers ultimately attended the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia, which was close enough to home that they could go back to fill in for a weekend shift if their parents needed it. Both considered following careers outside of the restaurant industry but ultimately chose to stick with the family business. In fact, their first plan was to open a next-level Greek diner they planned to call the Finer Diner. \nGeorge attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park and then moved down to New York City to take a line cook position at Le Cirque . Unfortunately, the stock market crashed in 2008 and work dried up, so he moved back to D.C. for a job at Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s\u2019s white-hot Greek restaurant, Zaytinya . The kitchen was headed up by rising star chef Mike Isabella. It was a fortuitous intersection for both of them. \nMeanwhile, Nicholas had started managing the family diner full-time. \u201cMy father told me, \u2018You\u2019re going to work six days a week,\u2019\u201d he remembers. \u2018I\u2019ll give you Sundays off to watch football.\u2019\u201d \nHe followed that up with a gig as a manager for Chili\u2019s in the Capital Region and Mykonos Grill in Rockville, Maryland, which is owned by his uncle. His brother introduced him to the team at Andr\u00e9s\u2019 Think Food Group, who placed the older Pagonis in their management training program, where he became friends with Isabella as well. \nIsabella ultimately went from well-loved local chef to a nationally recognizable figure after appearing on Top Chef and Top Chef All-Stars , where he had been the runner-up. After leaving Zaytinya, he opened up the wildly successful Italian-inflected Graffiato \u2013 and he tapped Nicholas as a manager. Isabella wasn\u2019t done yet though. Next up on his to-do list? A Greek restaurant. \nGeorge was working as a sous chef at Charlie Palmer\u2019s Aureole in New York City at the time, but he and his brother wanted in on Isabella\u2019s next project. They ended up partnering with him to create Kapnos. George would handle the cooking, while Nicholas would be the general manager. \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want it to be blue and white with Zorba the Greek music in the background and the same traditional dishes,\u201d says Nicholas. \nSo they went with a green-and-brown color scheme, cranked up alternative tunes on restaurant\u2019s playlist, and put out a forward-thinking menu steeped in tradition. When it opened in the summer of 2013, it was an unqualified hit, earning rave reviews and boasting packed reservation books. That set off a wave of openings. The portfolio of Kapnos-related eateries now boasts five locations. \nThe brothers\u2019 next undertaking is the QSR foray Kapnos Marketa at Isabella Eatery, which opens later this fall inside Tysons Galleria mall in McLean, Virginia. Expect gyros, the spreads, and filo pies. \u201cIf we ever go fast casual, this is what it will look like,\u201d says Nicholas. \nAfter that, who knows? In the meantime, here are four tips from the Pagonis brothers on how to build a Greek restaurant empire. Elevate your wine and cocktails game. \n\u201cI would go to Greek restaurants and they\u2019d only have Greek table wines, really cheap stuff,\u201d says Nicholas. \u201cBut when we would go on trips to Greece, we discovered that there are so many great wines that we wanted to showcase. And we worked hard to bring flavor profiles from Greece into the cocktail program.\u201d Beverage director Taha Ismail highlights unique spirits from the region, like ouzo (an anise-flavored aperitif) and mastika (a resin-flavored liqueur). Travel for inspiration. \n\u201cWhen you\u2019re always in your own restaurants, you get stuck in a box,\u201d says George. Ever since they were children, the boys have made annual pilgrimages back to Greece to see their extended family, practice their Greek, and learn about the culture. Now those trips double as research expeditions for their restaurants. George makes a point of going somewhere new in the country each year \u2013 Crete and Santorini were recent stops \u2013 to ensure he is experiencing the width and breadth Greece\u2019s culinary culture. Remember Greek food isn\u2019t monolithic. \nThe food varies depending on geography. In the town of Skoura, where the brothers\u2019 parents grew up, there\u2019s an emphasis on traditional dishes, like oven-roasted leg of lamb with potatoes, red wine-braised rabbit, and stuffed peppers. In the islands and along the coastline, seafood is the focus. And in the northern mountain region, filo pies and casseroles are common fare. George strives to pay homage to the country\u2019s broad array of regional cuisines across the various Kapnos concepts. Twist up tradition. \n\u201cWe wanted to separate ourselves from everyone else,\u201d says George. \u201cYou have to have the Greek flavors but reinterpret the dishes.\u201d Caviar complements the traditional carp roe in the taramosalata, which features a base of cauliflower, rather than the usual bread or potatoes. Rather than offering straightforward pita, Pagonis puts out a puffy, soft round that\u2019s more similar to Israeli laffa bread. And beef souvlaki gets marinated in a mix that includes Korean gochujang sauce. \nPhoto credits: Greg Powers (food); Nevin Martell (Nicholas and George Pagonis); Januari Jai Media (Kapnos exterior).

The cushy couches around the bar add to a laid-back feel for a brand that could easily throw people off for their reputation as a destination for solely luxury clientele. \u201cYou have even a tiny TV on the wall and you\u2019re going to have a full bar and start really selling food. Our deviled eggs or Jamaican jerk chicken wings satisfy a lot of people who really (then) take a look at the menu.\u201d \nRound it out with a bar program that puts special emphasis on local distillers, such as Boston-born Bully Boy\u2019s handcrafted rum, vodka, and whiskies, and there are lots of repeat local customers (Renberg estimates 40 to 50 percent of diners are not hotel guests). \nWhereas the Bristol\u2019s scenic spot right on Boston Common park appeals to a lot of passersby in sneakers, Sixteen \u2019s magnificent views of Chicago are marketed in a different way, says General manager Adam Stark . \u201cYou can\u2019t miss us. There\u2019s the Sears Tower and then there\u2019s us\u2026. We have a brand that exudes this \u2018destination\u2019 idea, and visually standing out is a pretty big asset.\u201d \nWith a higher price point and two-star Michelin chef, Sixteen\u2019s dinner experience is more of a special occasion destination versus an after-work drive-by, but that exclusivity can also pay off when it comes to keeping up with the Joneses on social media. Plus, having the backing of a brand name for two feeds ramps up the excitement. \u201cChef Nick Dostal is coming up with new dishes every other day, and I\u2019m constantly snapping pictures. But there are some other ways, too, like advertising your dishwashers or servers who have been there for years to promote the idea of longevity in the staff.\u201d \nHis advice? While most dinner clients are an even mix of hotel guests and \u201csuburban guests making it a special destination\u201d for a $200 per person experience, offering up a bar burger to take in the view is a great way to keep all of the seats full, says Stark. \nOther hotel restaurant how-to\u2019s: Capitalize on your environment with a \u201cniche\u201d experience. \nOverlooking the Pacific Ocean in Palos Verdes, California, guests at Terranea can dine on dishes with locally harvested sea salt and participate in a harvesting class. Guest education also includes on-site chickens and oil, honey and product harvesting. Try something outside the box. \nOak Bar in Nashville, at Hermitage Hotel, recently launched a reverse happy hour to attract late-night visitors after a show the nearby Ryman Auditorium or Tennessee Performing Arts Center, promoting one of the largest collections of whiskey in the state in its \u201cBourbon Library.\u201d FireLake Grill House in downtown Minneapolis sees a lot of repeat clients in town for nearby performing arts events, which are promoted on social media. Participate in community events. \nKansas City-based Hotel Phillips general manager Mark Krtek says local events, like the World Series of Barbecue, and hosting live music, help ramp up excitement for trying new places. FireLake runs Movember promotions during the month of November, celebrating mustaches and men\u2019s health, and Galentine\u2019s Day (from Parks and Recreation ), for single ladies around Valentine\u2019s Day. Focus on what makes you unique. \nTavernonna Italian Kitchen at Hotel Phillips is a play on the Italian word for grandmother \u2014 nonna \u2014 and chef Bryant Wigger\u2019s menu combines Kansas City flavors with those of his ancestral roots to tell diners a personalized story.

They were usually steamed and served without seasoning, rendering them mushy and bland. Thankfully, chefs have learned how to prepare the leafy green veg so they\u2019re tasty and toothsome. Here are seven new Brussels sprouts dishes for the fall. \nZentan , Washington, D.C. The name \u201cPeas & Sprouts\u201d is a little misleading, but you\u2019ll be more than happy with what arrives at the table. Brussels sprouts and chickpeas are lightly fried, tossed with shiso-mustard vinaigrette, and topped with garlic chips. Full of contrasting crunches and umami tones, it\u2019s a deeply satisfying dish. Make a reservation at Zentan . \nBO-beau , San Diego, California Humble Brussels sprouts get elevated. Pancetta, Parmesan, and balsamic port reduction add salty and sweet accents to the green globes. A stirring reminder that pork and cheese can turn even the simplest dish into a rare delight.

The verdant spheres are dressed up with fish caramel, lemon juice, and chilies. Make a reservation at Uchiko . \nCane Rosso , Dallas, Texas We yearn for this comforting dish in the autumn. Creamy Crescenza cheese, gloriously swine-y guanciale, crunchy pecans, and sweet balsamic add a diverse array of flavors and textures. Just what we need when our seasonal affective disorder starts kicking in. Make a reservation at Cane Rosso . \nSearsucker , Austin, Texas Even if you grew up thinking Brussels sprouts could never be delicious, these will convert you into a believer. Deep-frying them creates crisp crunch, which is magnified by the inclusion of walnuts. Anchovy-amped vinaigrette adds acidic punch with a briny undercurrent. Make a reservation at Searsucker . \nTupelo Honey , Charlotte, North Carolina What a charming couple! Honey-roasted Brussels sprouts are paired up with hominy. The results are as savory, sweet, and scrumptious. Make a reservation at Tupelo Honey . \nThe Bazaar by Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s , Los Angeles, California Of course, the Brussels at Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s\u2019 modernist-minded gastro playground are finished with a cloud of lemony foam.

Oh-so-tender tentacles star in the sizzling sensation. The meaty curls sit atop fingerling potatoes and spicy garlic sausage dressed with lemon aioli. Make a reservation at Urbana . \nButtermilk Biscuits at Meril , New Orleans Louisiana A good biscuit is hard to find. This is a great one. Plus, it comes topped with foie gras butter (Hey, Emeril, can you please ship us some of that?) and blackberry preserves. Make a reservation at Meril . \nMussels a La Plancha at Lulu Kitchen & Bar , Sag Harbor, New York Simple and succinct. New Zealand mussels are dressed with sea salt, crushed pepper, and lemon-parsley butter. The starry presentation makes them perfect for Instagramming. Make a reservation at Lulu Kitchen & Bar . \nBreakfast Hoecake at Cane Rosso , Houston, Texas This is the cure to your next hangover. Rich jalape\u00f1o cheese corn cake arrives topped off with sorghum butter and green onions. A cheery sunny-side up egg completes the headache-banishing brunch standout. Make a reservation at Cane Rosso . \nBourbon Peach Crumble at Searsucker , Austin, Texas Bourbon makes everything better. Case in point is this booze-boosted take on the Southern classic. Fresh peaches are topped with blueberry jam, ginger oat crumble, and vanilla bean ice cream. Make a reservation at Searsucker . \nFlorida Cheddar and Chive Biscuits at Bird & Bone , Miami Beach, Florida Flakey four-corner biscuits have a crisp layer of cheese on the bottom, courtesy of the cast iron\u2019s searing heat. Don\u2019t overlook the side of homemade strawberry preserves. Crack a biscuit open to reveal the accordion-like layers and slather it on. Make a reservation at Bird & Bone . \nCrepa de Puerco at Cuba Libre , Washington, D.C. Pulled pork and queso a\u00f1ejo come swaddled in a roasted crepe. It\u2019s lavished with corn and truffle crema, rocoto pepper oil, and an herb salad. The perfect way to start the day after a long night.

This stellar rendition gets a boost from gooey raclette cheese and a touch of truffle. Intensely indulgent \u2014 just as it should be. Make a reservation at Maple & Ash. \nWhole White Fish Puerto at PM Fish and Steak House , Miami, Florida Simply seasoned with salt, cayenne, and lemon, a fresh-from-the-depths filet gets golden on the grill.

Think again. Southern hospitality extends to an air of refinement when it comes to the jackets-encouraged dining scene, and there\u2019s no shortage of fine French fare in the Big Easy, especially in and around the aptly named French Quarter. Check out these top French restaurants in New Orleans for an elegant experience that\u2019s full of flavor. \nRestaurant August With platings every bit as stunning as August\u2019s crystal chandeliers, soaring ceilings, and lush fresh floral arrangements, the setting is every bit a feast for the eyes as what comes out of chef John Besh\u2019s kitchen. The Louisiana native and James Beard Award winner \u2014 whose staff has also has been nominated for outstanding service \u2014 wows those who come here for special occasion dinners with locally-grilled peach salad, the most refined of shrimp etoufees, and, from the degustation menu (items from which can be ordered a la carte), the charred lamb with grilled eggplant, which may be worth the trip to New Orleans alone. Make a reservation at Restaurant August . \nWilla Jean Want to get a taste of one of the city\u2019s most famed toques without a hefty price tag? Stop in at Willa Jean\u2019s, where Kelly Fields and Lisa White, who design all the baked goods for John Besh\u2019s restaurant empire, have put together a menu with both unforgettably fluffy biscuits but also a few healthy nibbles to start the day off right, like avocado toast and grain bowls with poached eggs. There are also juices and slushies to temper the toasty NoLa temps, but the desserts here are the real superstars \u2014 don\u2019t miss the cookies with vanilla-infused milk and key lime and strawberry shortcake with pistachio and cornmeal. Make a reservation at Willa Jean . \nP\u00eache Looking for an alternative to the heavier, sauce-laden cuisine for which Nola is famed and a more modern space? P\u00eache\u2019s locally caught, sustainable seafood, all artfully embellished with colorful herbs and zesty accoutrements, fits the bill. Jumbo Gulf shrimp get a reboot with a chili glaze and butter beans, and grilled tuna steak with olive relish wins over the locals who frequent here for either a sit-down meal or to enjoy the breeze at the first-come, first-served bar. Oysters (rotating daily) are also a popular treat for those who want to grab a quick bite before strolling through this charming neighborhood and its art galleries. Make a reservation at P\u00eache . \nSouBou Crescent City may be all about the service, but at SoBou (South of Bourbon Street), the self-service wine bar is worth cheers\u2019ing for. The all-star team of the Commander\u2019s Palace family of restaurants here likes to say, \u201cFood is always center stage, but stage right are the cocktails and stage left is the wine,\u201d and there\u2019s no shortage of visual or edible treats here. Don\u2019t miss your chance to indulge in sweet potato beignets with foie gras fondue, stuffed quail, or bourbon-braised short ribs. Of course, anything in the Commander\u2019s family needs to include brunch, and SoBou\u2019s adds an extra kick in the form of (artful) burlesque with live music. Make a reservation at SouBou . \nCriollo at Hotel Monteleone It\u2019s tricky to figure out whether to keep your eyes peeled inside to the indoor merry-go-round that makes for the city\u2019s only revolving bar at Carousel Bar & Lounge or peek outside at the tourists streaming by on Royal Street here. But it\u2019s all a feast for the senses, with live jazz music at night and noshes at Criollo, where Louisiana seafood takes the crab cake. Think baked, stuffed Creole redfish, shellfish pot au feu pasta, and grilled grouper with a warm tomato and bean salad. You\u2019ll need something to line your stomach for a Sazerac at the bar \u2014 New Orleans\u2019 (and the Carousel Bar\u2019s) signature whiskey cocktail. Make a reservation at Criollo at Hotel Monteleone . \nBrennan\u2019s Brennan\u2019s is one of the few that could make bacon better, especially when it\u2019s coffee-cured for brunch, a simple morning becomes a party. It\u2019s difficult to decide but this centerpiece of the Eggs Hussarde, with hollandaise, marchand de vin sauce, and housemade English muffins is a close second to the made-tableside black truffle soft-scrambled eggs with black truffles and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. The Bananas Foster also carries a \u201cwow\u201d factor, with a flame-filled presentation setting brown sugar, cinnamon, rum, locally made ice cream and fruit aglow. Don\u2019t miss the chicory coffee, a New Orleans staple roasted just for Brennan\u2019s. Or those here for an evening can check out one of thousands of bottles of vintages from the restaurant\u2019s extensive wine catalog. Make a reservation at Brennan\u2019s . \nDTB DTB may stand for \u201cdown the bayou,\u201d but the craft cocktails and composed small and large plates are anything but backwoods. Andouille p\u00e2t\u00e9, cornmeal gnocchi, and crispy duck confit with pecan vinaigrette all scream Louisiana but are as artfully plated as the atmosphere, where Spanish moss hangs from modern light fixtures and the shotgun-style building pays homage to owners Jacob Naquin\u2019s and chef Carl Schaubhut\u2019s Cajun roots. Worth the trip alone are Lu Brow\u2019s creative cocktails, including the brown-butter-infused bourbon for the Old-Fashioned and the Silver Dollar\u2019s fresh watermelon juice with tequila, ginger and lime.

However, professional chefs see them as inspiration for defining and refining their own culinary philosophies. In honor of National Cookbook Month, here four chefs share the cookbooks that changed their lives. \nJulia Sullivan of Henrietta Red , Nashville, Tennessee \u201cThe one that had the biggest impact on me was Judy Rodgers\u2019 The Zuni Caf\u00e9 Cookbook . It\u2019s such a comprehensive book in the sense that it really dives deep into technique. It\u2019s really a textbook. It\u2019s not a cookbook for the faint of heart. It\u2019s a cookbook for chefs. It demonstrates how she cooked seasonally and product-driven, Cali-style cuisine. Each dish has so few ingredients, yet they all come together beautifully. She taught me that if you rely on really good ingredients and solid technique, you don\u2019t need much else. Also, I worked at Per Se for a couple of years, and I love Thomas Keller\u2019s The French Laundry Cookbook . You see how he can be tongue in cheek and have fun, even though there\u2019s seriousness and finesse. He inspired a sense of inventiveness and playfulness.\u201d   Henrietta Red . \nHamilton Johnson of Honeysuckle , Washington, D.C. \u201cI started reading Charlie Trotter\u2019s four cookbooks \u2013 Seafood , Meat & Game , Desserts , and Vegetables \u2013 while I was in culinary school at Johnson & Wales. I focused on them instead of what I was supposed to be reading for class. My teachers weren\u2019t too happy about that. I loved that he came up with all sorts of crazy combinations and used interesting ingredients. I remember him using barnacles on a dish and featuring so many different cuts of meat. There was a lot of emphasis on textures and the need for different variations. Trotter drove home [that] you need to think outside the box and push the limits. Never be too scared to try something.\u201d   Honeysuckle . \nAnthony Lamas of Seviche , Louisville, Kentucky \u201cWhen I graduated from high school in 1987, I moved to San Diego. There I met Jeff Tunks \u2013 who now owns restaurants such as PassionFish in Bethesda, Maryland, and TenPenh in Tysons, Virginia, \u2013 at Loews Coronado Bay Resort. He took me under his wing, so I always helped out when his chef friends came by to do guest dinners. I did one with Jean-Louis Palladin, who gave me his cookbook, Jean Louis: Cooking with the Seasons . This was before farm-to-table became trendy. He really challenged American chefs to source locally. It made an especially profound impact because I could hang out with him and work with him. He was so passionate and intense. That was the first cookbook that said something to me. It was like listening to a Beatles album for the first time. I still have my autographed copy from 25 years ago.\u201d   Seviche . \nJoe Palma, formerly of Bourbon Steak , Washington, D.C. \u201cThe easy answer is Thomas Keller\u2019s The French Laundry Cookbook . My parents gave it to me while I was in high school and working for Boulder Creek Dining Company on the side, but I was still planning on going to school to be an investment banker. It was one of the first times that American food \u2013 albeit very French influenced \u2013 looked so sexy. It wasn\u2019t a full break from the past, but it was the next step in the evolution. More recently, David Kinch\u2019s Manresa: An Edible Reflection did a nice job using molecular gastronomy elements, while still hewing to naturalist traditions to enhance and focus dishes, while providing different textures. You see a lot of people doing an amalgam of 20 other chefs, but his food is very much his.\u201d   Bourbon Steak . \nTell us what cookbook has most inspired you here or over on Facebook   \nNevin Martell is a Washington, D.C.-based food and travel writer and the author of several books, including Freak Show Without A Tent: Swimming with Piranhas, Getting Stoned in Fiji and Other Family Vacations .

Owners and operators share their thoughts on their recent experiences \u2013 and what awaits you during your next visit. \nAcacia House , St. Helena Renowned chef Chris Cosentino, winner of Top Chef Masters , and his staff at Acacia House have been overwhelmed with gratitude and emotion as they were able to reopen last week with full operating hours for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Located in the Las Alcobas Hotel, the restaurant recently earned 3.5 stars from critic Michael Bauer for Cosentino\u2019s bold-yet-luxe flavors, found notably in the Hamachi crudo and the Iberico pork schnitzel. As the team works together to help rebuild the community, they are offering a special three-course menu for $50 ($10 from each meal sold will directly benefit the Napa Valley Community Disaster Relief ).   Acacia House . \nCaf\u00e9 La Haye , Sonoma Located in the heart of Sonoma, cozy Caf\u00e9 La Haye is easy like a Sunday morning. The atmosphere is relaxed, the hospitality is warm, the menu is elegantly simple, and the food is superb. The beef carpaccio with fried oysters and the buttermilk-brined, crusted pork chop regularly win raves, and the chocolate silk cake is legendary. The wine list, which emphasizes local producers, is ample enough for oenophiles yet not overwhelming. \u201cSo many wonderful people are asking how they can help, and I\u2019d like to say that there is still so much beauty here in Sonoma \u2014 and we\u2019re open again and ready to welcome them back,\u201d says owner Saul Gropman.   Caf\u00e9 La Haye . \nCompline , Napa Compline is quintessential new Napa dining. You\u2019ll find the best of the local bounty on its menu, which features refined seasonal dishes, both large and small, including grilled whole fish, a lamb duo, and mushroom confit \u2013 and there\u2019s also a superb Wagyu burger and a brownie for dessert, mirroring the restaurant\u2019s laid-back ambiance. \u201cDining out in Napa has always been centered around great wine, good food, locally sourced ingredients, and a close community. We\u2019ve watched friends, neighbors, and visitors come to our valley to raise a glass together and enjoy a bite, even in a time of crisis,\u201d says co-owner Matt Stamp. \u201cOur kitchen is open late, the wine is always flowing, and we can\u2019t wait to show off our downtown Napa hospitality,\u201d adds Ryan Stetins, also a co-owner.   Compline . \nThe Girl & The Fig , Sonoma You\u2019ll find country food with a French passion at this homey spot in the Sonoma Hotel. The plat du jour menu (a thrifty $54 for three satisfying courses plus pairings) changes weekly, but you\u2019re going to want to save room for cheese \u2013 in particular, the Fromage Tower, which includes six cheese selections, seasonal fruit, spiced nuts, olives, Mano Formate cured meats and charcuterie, FIG FOOD condiments, and baguette. Other dishes of note include the wild flounder meuni\u00e8re and the duck leg confit. Proprietor Sondra Bernstein says, \u201cOur hearts remain with the many people who were affected by the California wildfires, and we do want our guests to know that our restaurants are open and we are trying to get the Fig Family back to work. The weather is beautiful in Sonoma, the skies are clear and blue, and our food is homegrown. \u200b\u200bCome visit us soon! We look forward to serving you.\u201d   The Girl & The Fig . \nMiminashi , Napa This standout Japanese pub serves killer sashimi in addition to robatayaki and yakitori, like bonjiri (chicken tail) and kama (salmon collar). Geek out on the deep wine list featuring hard-to-find sake, bubbles, and local and global wines. Chef Curtis DiFede says, \u201cIzakayas are all about relaxed dining in a warm, casual atmosphere. It\u2019s a place for people to come together to eat and enjoy life. We\u2019ve really seen that in the past couple weeks \u2014 the local community is united and stronger than ever. We can\u2019t wait to welcome you here.\u201d P.S.: Don\u2019t skip dessert! All soft cream proceeds will be donated to the Napa Valley Community Foundation for Disaster Relief .   Miminashi . \nOenotri , Napa The entr \u00e9 es at this downtown gem are absolutely on point, but the pizza and the pastas are not to be missed. We know everyone says that, but we really mean it. Offerings such as torchietti with Niman Ranch short rib, horseradish crema, and chives and the classic Margherita belong on your Instagram. The restaurant, which just earned a Bib Gourmand from Michelin, has a wood-fired oven from Acino that has cooked thousands of pizzas to perfection in more than six years, and it is renowned for its housemade salumi. Co-executive chef Tyler Rodde says, \u201cThe Napa Valley community is one of strength and resilience, as displayed by the recent events. Yet, what this community is best known for is hospitality \u2014 graciously welcoming millions of guests into our dining rooms and tasting rooms, seven days a week, fifty-two weeks a year, year after year. While our communities are really good at bouncing back from setbacks, what we do best is taking care of our guests, and that will never change.\u201d   Oenotri . \nTorc , Napa They\u2019re all about community at Torc, whose globally inspired menu features an array of dishes meant to be shared, including the Bengali sweet potato pakora, as well as mains, like the Bellwether Farm ricotta cheese ravioli with chanterelle mushroom bolognese and duck crackling. They work with local farms, foragers, and fishers and highlight ingredients \u201cproduced and harvested by like-minded individuals.\u201d Owner and chef/wine curator Sean O\u2019Toole notes, \u201c Napa is a unique farming and hospitality based-community, and right now our amazing wineries and restaurants need your support more than ever. Please come join us for a day, evening, or weekend in downtown Napa and the surrounding valley.
