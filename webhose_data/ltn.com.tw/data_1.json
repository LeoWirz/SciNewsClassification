\nCHANGING WORLD: Sticking to past practices and ways of thinking would make it hard for Taipei and Beijing to deal with volatile regional situations, the president said \n/ Staff writer, with CNA \nPresident Tsai Ing-wen \uff08\u8521\u82f1\u6587\uff09 has reiterated her proposal that Taipei and Beijing create a new model to handle cross-strait relations, which have been at a standstill since her inauguration in May last year. \nTaiwan hopes that both sides can begin to think about the matter after the conclusion of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s 19th National Congress, at which the party\u2019s new leadership is to be elected, Tsai said in an interview with the Central News Agency published yesterday. \nThe week-long congress is scheduled to begin on Oct. 18. \nThe two sides of the Taiwan Strait have for many years dealt with their ties based on an established model and guidelines, which to a certain extent have helped maintain cross-strait stability, Tsai said. \nHowever, in view of new international situations, they should consider whether there is a need to examine such old practices and mindsets, she said. \n\u201cIf we keep sticking to these past practices and ways of thinking, it will probably be very hard for us to deal with the volatile regional situations in Asia,\u201d Tsai said. \nUnhappy that Tsai\u2019s government has refused to recognize the so-called \u201c1992 consensus,\u201d Beijing has suspended official dialogue with Taipei since she took office. \nThe \u201c1992 consensus,\u201d a term former Mainland Affairs Council chairman Su Chi \uff08\u8607\u8d77\uff09 in 2006 admitted making up in 2000, refers to a tacit understanding between the Chinese Nationalist Party \uff08KMT\uff09 and the Chinese government that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge that there is only \u201cone China,\u201d with each side having its own interpretation of what \u201cChina\u201d means. \nBeijing has insisted that the Tsai administration explicitly accept the \u201c1992 consensus\u201d \u2014 which in effect says that Taiwan is part of China \u2014 as the political foundation for the continuation of relatively warm relations under her predecessor, former president Ma Ying-jeou \uff08\u99ac\u82f1\u4e5d\uff09. \nHowever, Tsai has only been willing to say that she respects the historical fact that cross-strait talks took place and that some understanding was reached. \nBoth sides have made considerable efforts to maintain cross-strait stability over the past 16 months, Tsai said, but added that on major political issues, \u201cthey feel we have not reached their expectations, but we have already shown the utmost goodwill.\u201d \nShe reiterated that the viewpoints outlined in her inaugural address would remain her principles in dealing with cross-strait ties. \nIn her inauguration speech, Tsai promised that her administration would work to maintain the existing mechanisms for dialogue and communication across the Taiwan Strait and would conduct cross-strait affairs in accordance with the Republic of China Constitution, the Act Governing Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area \uff08\u81fa\u7063\u5730\u5340\u8207\u5927\u9678\u5730\u5340\u4eba\u6c11\u95dc\u4fc2\u689d\u4f8b\uff09 and other relevant legislation. \nShe also recognized that \u201cthere was joint acknowledgement of setting aside differences to seek common ground\u201d in the 1992 talks between representatives of Taipei and Beijing. \nIn the interview, Tsai said she did not see Premier William Lai\u2019s \uff08\u8cf4\u6e05\u5fb7\uff09 comments in open support for Taiwanese independence at the Legislative Yuan on Tuesday last week as affecting cross-strait relations. \nLai is fully aware of the government\u2019s overall policy goals and understands very well \u201cwhat the limits are,\u201d she said. \nRegarding the nation\u2019s military readiness, Tsai said the government would increase its defense spending gradually over the next few years to provide the armed forces with stable financial resources to support efforts to develop a plan to increase the nation\u2019s combat capacity in the next decade. \nPresident Tsai Ing-wen gestures during an interview with the Central News Agency in Taipei yesterday.

China: Shanghai-Taipei Music Festival\u201d was organized by the Taipei Department of Cultural Affairs and therefore not a commercial activity, National Taiwan University \uff08NTU\uff09 said yesterday. \nThe controversial concert abruptly ended on Sept. 24 amid student protests. Scattered incidents of violence were reported, including three students allegedly injured by members of the Chinese Unity Promotion Party. \nThe university said that it had twice denied a request from the department and Mu Chieh Ta Co \uff08\u5e55\u5a55\u5854\uff09, the company commissioned by the city to organize the event, to use the school\u2019s athletic field for the concert. \nThe school was informed that Non-Partisan Solidarity Union Legislator May Chin \uff08\u9ad8\u91d1\u7d20\u6885\uff09 had expressed concern over the denial and the school subsequently allowed the concert, NTU said. \nThe university presented documents showing that the department had organized the event in past years, proof that the event was a government-sanctioned one and not a commercial activity. \nTaipei Mayor Ko Wen-je \uff08\u67ef\u6587\u54f2\uff09 on Monday said that it was not the city government, but the Mainland Affairs Council \uff08MAC\uff09 and the National Immigration Agency, that authorized the concert. \nResponding to comments from Democratic Progressive Party \uff08DPP\uff09 Taipei City Councilor Yan Juo-fang \uff08\u984f\u82e5\u82b3\uff09 that the event was a \u201cvirus,\u201d Ko said: \u201cThis virus was brought here by the Ministry of the Interior.\u201d \nThe universtiy said it had apologized to students and teachers for the disruption to classes caused by the requisition of the athletic field, and that it would further investigate the matter and make improvements. \nThe department denied any negligence or effort to pressure the school over the event. \nTaipei Department of Cultural Affairs Deputy Commissioner Lee Li-chu \uff08\u674e\u9e97\u73e0\uff09 said the department had no contact with the company prior to being asked for assistance, and that it did not get involved with securing the school\u2019s field as the venue. \nThe city government had no oversight, and Mu Chieh Ta Co was chosen by the Shanghai organizers, Lee said. \n\u201cWhat I am saying is the facts. I am absolutely not making stuff up,\u201d she said. \nTaipei Department of Cultural Affairs\u2019 Creative Development Division head Wu Chun-ming \uff08\u5433\u4fca\u9298\uff09 said he received a call on Sept. 12 regarding concerns over potential noise from the concert site, and a colleague did a follow-up to clarify the situation, not to intervene. \nMeanwhile, DPP Taipei City Councilor Hsu Shu-hua \uff08\u8a31\u6dd1\u83ef\uff09 said the ultimate blame lies with Lee, saying that she was the most senior official in the Department of Cultural Affairs that authorized the event. \nIf the ministry did not get involved and try to facilitate the process, then the university would not necessarily have agreed to lend out the space, Hsu said, adding that Taipei Department of Cultural Affairs Commissioner Chung Yung-feng \uff08\u937e\u6c38\u8c50\uff09 is being made a scapegoat. \nThe department should make information about the whole process of organizing the concert open to public scrutiny just as NTU did, she said. \nNTU student body representative Hsu Hsuan-wei \uff08\u8a31\u8ed2\u744b\uff09 said that although Chung has always denied that the city is responsible for the concert, Mu Chieh Ta Co has already said it was commissioned by the city to organize the event. \nThe company and the city had been working together for a long time, he said, adding that Ko tried to shift responsibility by saying the city was simply providing the company with assistance. \nAdditional reporting by Shen Pei-yao \nWorkers dismantle the \u201cSing!

It is on such a basis that ethnic differences can be dissolved with democratization and anti-democracy politicians can no longer deceive the public with the fabricated \u20181992 consensus,\u2019\u201d he said. \nThe so-called \u201c1992 consensus,\u201d a term former Mainland Affairs Council chairman Su Chi \uff08\u8607\u8d77\uff09 in 2006 admitted making up in 2000, refers to a tacit understanding between the Chinese Nationalist Party \uff08KMT\uff09 and the Chinese government that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge there is \u201cone China,\u201d with each side having its own interpretation of what \u201cChina\u201d means. \nThe prosperity of a nation depends on a powerful leadership, a set of clearly defined goals and internal solidarity, Lee said. \nThe Democratic Progressive Party \uff08DPP\uff09 for the first time won both the presidency and legislative majority in last year\u2019s general elections, but its administration has been mired in growing public dissatisfaction, giving rise to the fear that a local administration might be replaced. \nTo prevent the \u201creinstatement of a Chinese administration,\u201d such as the KMT regaining the government in 2008, the DPP government should ensure a properly functioning democracy and party system, prevent social division and proceed with reforms, Lee said. \nHe commended Premier William Lai \uff08\u8cf4\u6e05\u5fb7\uff09 for his insistence on Taiwanese independence, saying it is rare that a premier has the boldness to openly insist on independence. \nLai\u2019s appointment has helped boost President Tsai Ing-wen\u2019s \uff08\u8521\u82f1\u6587\uff09 approval rating by 16 percentage points, and he is expected to lead economic development, Lee said. \nHe also called on Tsai to explain the DPP\u2019s constitutional reform initiative to familiarize the public with the complicated issue, as DPP lawmakers have launched a proposal to amend the Constitution to pave the way for a pure presidential system. \nFormer president Lee Teng-hui yesterday gives a speech at a seminar on national awareness held by the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan\u2019s branch in Tainan.

2017-10-05 03:00 \nSAFETY GUARANTEED: The Presidential Office would not comment on an assertion that China would invade, or on the reliability of research fellow Ian Easton\u2019s sources \nBy Nadia Tsao / Staff reporter in Washington, with CNA \nChina has finalized a clandestine plan to invade Taiwan in 2020 by launching missile attacks, blocking the nation\u2019s air and sea space, and carrying out amphibious landings, Washington-based think tank Project 2049 Institute research fellow Ian Easton said. \nEaston, a former student at National Chengchi University, made the \u201crevelation\u201d in his new book, The Chinese Invasion Threat, released on Tuesday. \nThe two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been two different nations since 1949, and most analysts believe that as long as Taiwan does not declare de jure independence, the \u201cstatus quo\u201d across the Strait would be maintained, Easton said. \nHowever, conflict could still arise no matter what Taiwan or the US does to prevent it given the unstable situation in the Taiwan Strait, just like a levee that has been under enormous pressure and ultimately breaks, he said, adding that Washington should focus on formulating new thinking that would accentuate that Taiwan is a sovereign and free nation. \nThe US\u2019 arms sales to Taiwan was the biggest factor helping Taiwan to be involved in international politics, but it is unwise for Taiwan and the US to continue increasing arms sales in bilateral relations, Easton said. \nUS military officials holding a two-star rank or above should make regular visits to Taiwan so that Washington could make useful assessments in the event of a crisis, he said, adding that the two sides should conduct bilateral port-of-call stops, hold joint military drills and engage in defense industry exchanges to streamline efforts in providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief, and in counterterrorism and cyberwarfare. \nIt would be difficult for the US to maintain a military edge over China in the long term, unless it includes Taiwan in its strategic planning, Easton said, adding that it would likewise be impossible for Taiwan to ensure its security without maintaining the US\u2019 support. \nTaiwan\u2019s counterattack capabilities pose a threat to the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army \uff08PLA\uff09, but it should expand its arsenal of long-range and shoulder-launched missiles, drones, fighter jets and cannons, and deploy weapons with lower lethality in areas closest to China, he said. \nEaston also highlighted the need for Taiwan to understand the complexity of PLA tactics for launching an assault in its outlying Penghu, Kinmen and Lienchiang islands and for it to boost its abilities to engage in electronic warfare. \nThe US and China are engaged in a long and tense strategic race in the Asia-Pacific region, in which the US would quickly lose its advantage over China if Beijing\u2019s growing prominence in the region is not curbed, Easton said. \nPresidential Office spokesman Sidney Lin \uff08\u6797\u9db4\u660e\uff09 yesterday said the office had no comment on Easton\u2019s assertions that China would invade in 2020, nor does it have any comments on the reliability of his sources. \nThe Ministry of National Defense has been closely monitoring movements of the Chinese military, Lin said. \n\u201cThe public can rest assured that the nation\u2019s safety is guaranteed\u201d he said. \nChinese Nationalist Party \uff08KMT\uff09 Legislator Ma Wen-jun \uff08\u99ac\u6587\u541b\uff09 said the threat of the PLA \u201cliberating\u201d Taiwan by force is ever-present, but added that Beijing\u2019s setting of a time frame for annexing the nation through an armed assault could signal that China\u2019s agenda has changed. \nDemocratic Progressive Party Legislator Lo Chih-cheng \uff08\u7f85\u81f4\u653f\uff09 raised doubts over the time frame Easton asserted, saying that he did not think it is very precise. \nChina might be ready militarily to invade Taiwan in 2020, but that would not necessarily mean that it would also be \u201cpolitically ready,\u201d Lo said. \nChina also needs to assess its chances of launching a successful invasion and the consequences of an attack, which are reasons that there could be variables to a possible invasion, he said. \n\u65b0\u805e\u4f86\u6e90\uff1a TAIPEI TIMES

The feeling is so tough and disappointing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou work so much, you dedicate so much of your time, you have so many people around you, and sometimes it doesn\u2019t work according to plan, so you start asking questions, but then once you work, you keep going, keep fighting through it, the rewards are very incredible and special.\u201d \n\u201cThey have nothing to do with finance, they have nothing to do with trophies, it\u2019s really internal,\u201d she added. \nHalep, the second seed on Beijing\u2019s outdoor hard courts, is the first woman into the China Open quarter-finals. \nHaving turfed out Sharapova and with world No. 1 Garbine Muguruza exiting in the first round with a virus, the 26-year-old Halep is now favorite in the Chinese capital. \nIn men\u2019s singles, Nick Kyrgios said he wanted to make up for his notorious meltdown in Shanghai last year as he beat Mischa Zverev in the second round in Beijing. \nA year ago, the supremely talented, but combustible Kyrgios was suspended for his petulant behavior at the Shanghai Rolex Masters, where he swore and argued with the crowd and appeared to give away points in caving in to the German. \nThe enigmatic Australian, seeded eighth in the Chinese capital, smashed his racket on the floor in anger, bending the head in half, when he conceded the opening set yesterday. \nThat earned the world No. 19 a warning from the umpire and raised the specter of one year ago. \nHowever, the 22-year-old returned for the second set with renewed determination and errors began creeping into Zverev\u2019s game. \nZverev, ranked No. 27 in the world and the older brother of rising star Alexander, surrendered his first service game of the second set and Kyrgios was never in trouble after that, surging into the quarter-finals 3-6, 6-2, 6-2. \nKyrgios said facing Zverev a year after Shanghai, and again in China, was the perfect opportunity to show how far he has come. \n\u201cI just wanted to go out there today and kind of redeem myself a little bit from last year,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted to prove to myself how much I have improved.\u201d \nDuring one changeover, the Australian appeared so relaxed that he sat back on his chair, arms behind his head, and sang along with a pop hit being played over the stadium loudspeakers. \n\u201cNothing really, just chilling out,\u201d Kyrgios said afterward, when asked about his behavior. \nHe is next to play Belgian qualifier Steve Darcis in the last eight. \nRussia\u2019s Maria Sharapova returns to Romania\u2019s Simona Halep in their China Open women\u2019s singles match in Beijing yesterday.

or the dividend being taxed as part of their personal income while enjoying an 8.5 percent deduction on dividend earnings, with a maximum deductible of NT$80,000. \nAn option to render 37 percent of an investor\u2019s dividend income tax-free, while the remaining 63 percent would be taxed as part of their personal income, was dropped. \nTaxpayers could be spared an estimated NT$59.9 billion every year under the proposed system, meaning people would have more disposable income, Hsu said. \n\u201cThe tax reform package can be described as \u2018feeding the poor without robbing anyone\u2019 and a reasonable redistribution of wealth that benefits all citizens,\u201d Executive Yuan spokesman Hsu Kuo-yung \uff08\u5f90\u570b\u52c7\uff09 said. \nThe drop in tax revenue would be made up with an increase in the corporate income tax, which would be increased from 17 percent to 20 percent, with an expected additional NT$65.4 billion return in tax revenue, Hsu said. \nTotal tax revenue, factoring in other tax adjustments, would drop by NT$6.9 billion, the Cabinet said. \nAlthough the reform package would reduce the \u201crich man\u2019s tax\u201d from 45 percent to 40 percent, it would not cause social inequity, as the more affluent taxpayers, usually business owners, would see their incomes reduced with the increase in corporate tax, Hsu said. \n\u201cIf things proceed smoothly, the draft could pass the committee review in a month and become law ahead of the budget review,\u201d Minister of Finance Sheu Yu-jer \uff08\u8a31\u865e\u54f2\uff09 said. \nCompanies and interest groups have voiced support for the flat rate because it is easier to carry out, Sheu said. \nHowever, opposition lawmakers raised doubts over the revision\u2019s fairness, arguing that the planned tax cut would benefit the rich more than average people. \nThe tax cut would save more than NT$3 million in dividend income tax for people in the 30 percent bracket, but only NT$5,000 for people in the 20 percent and lower bracket, Chinese Nationalist Party \uff08KMT\uff09 Legislator Alex Fai \uff08\u8cbb\u9d3b\u6cf0\uff09 said. \n\u201cOnly the wealthy would benefit from the tax cut, as 37 percent of Taiwanese do not pay any tax due to their low income,\u201d Fai said. \nKMT Legislator William Tseng \uff08\u66fe\u9298\u5b97\uff09 questioned the need and desirability of tax cuts in times of economic growth. \nSheu defended the tax revision, saying that it is better to look at the matter by the ratio of tax savings for all because tax cuts always look larger for the rich in absolute amounts. \nThe tax reform package is to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval on Thursday next week. \nAdditional reporting by Crystal Hsu \nMinister of Finance Sheu Yu-jer speaks during a question-and-answer session at a meeting of the legislature\u2019s Finance Committee in Taipei yesterday.

and Chen Wei-han / Staff reporters with CNA \nBeijing has been mobilizing overseas political parties who advocate unification across the Taiwan Strait to visit Taiwanese political parties under the guise of economic exchanges, while \u201cdiscouraging independence and promoting unification,\u201d Overseas Community Affairs Council \uff08OCAC\uff09 Minister Wu Hsin-hsing \uff08\u5433\u65b0\u8208\uff09 said yesterday. \nWu made the statement during a question-and-answer session at a meeting of the legislature\u2019s Foreign and National Defense Committee. \nChina has been very active in Asian overseas communities, working through multiple organizations, such as the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification, to quash suggestions of Taiwanese independence, Wu said. \nPropaganda that seeks to divide and undermine overseas compatriot groups friendly toward Taiwan has been distributed at various events, Wu said. \nThe efforts were aimed at downsizing the scale of Taiwanese overseas compatriot organizations, as well as undermining support for the Republic of China \uff08ROC\uff09 and unity over Taiwanese identity, Wu said. \nJust as Beijing has sought to undermine solidarity of Taiwanese overseas compatriot groups, so to have Taiwanese groups toward Chinese compatriots, Wu said. \nTaiwan has been countering continued Chinese \u201cUnited Front\u201d tactics and there is a growing number of overseas Chinese attending Taiwanese events and proudly waving the Taiwanese flag, he said. \n\u201cThe number of overseas Chinese is growing and they are finding that the China they knew while living in it is not necessarily the same China other nations see,\u201d Wu said. \nMany Chinese compatriots yearn for Taiwan\u2019s democracy and are often seen attending national events, he said. \nCross-strait relations is a competition between democracy and communism, Wu said, adding: \u201cThe people will choose for themselves\u201d which system is better. \nThe OCAC has great faith in overseas Taiwanese compatriots and believes that their support for the nation is unwavering and strong, Wu said. \nMeanwhile, legislators expressed concern that members of the China Council may be meeting with \u201cUnited Front\u201d sympathizers inside Taiwan. \nDemocratic Progressive Party \uff08DPP\uff09 Legislator Liu Shih-fang \uff08\u5289\u4e16\u82b3\uff09 asked Wu if the OCAC was aware of which political parties the council met with when they visited. \nMembers of the council met with members of the Chinese Nationalist Party \uff08KMT\uff09, the New Party, the Alliance for the Reunification of China, the China Unification Promotion Party \uff08\u4e2d\u83ef\u7d71\u4e00\u4fc3\u9032\u9ee8\uff09 and other pro-unification political groups, Wu said, adding that the OCAC had expressed its disavowal for local political parties to receive members of the council, but they continue do so. \nNo OCAC members on the China council and no OCAC officials, including those holding honorary titles, attended China\u2019s National Day celebrations this year, Wu said. \nThe greatest concern the China Council\u2019s visit poses is whether it is seeking to disrupt Taiwan\u2019s democracy through non-democratic means, New Power Party Legislator Hsu Yung-ming \uff08\u5f90\u6c38\u660e\uff09 said. \n\u201cWhile unification is a political view that people are free to express in Taiwan, it is a concern that Taiwan\u2019s democracy might be compromised by non-democratic means, such as violence and offshore funding,\u201d Hsu said. \nHe called on the government to look into the financing of the council, which could reveal the purposes of the organization. \n\u201cIt is difficult to regulate overseas organizations with Taiwanese laws and what we could do is to alert the public to these organizations\u2019 hidden agenda,\u201d Hsu said. \nHowever, laws can be amended to deal with domestic organizations allegedly networking for Beijing, such as the China Unification Promotion Party, Hsu said. \nWhile Taiwan is a democracy where people are free to express their political beliefs, measures have to be taken against Beijing seeking to influence the nation\u2019s democracy, Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Huang Wei-cher \uff08\u9ec3\u5049\u54f2\uff09 said. \nNational security could be compromised if Beijing is actively approaching and inciting Taiwanese, Huang said. \nChinese councilors should be banned from entering Taiwan if the purpose of their visit is different from what is stated on their visa application, the lawmaker said. \nThe National Immigration Agency should reject their entry and deport them if necessary, he added. \nOverseas Community Affairs Council head Wu Hsin-hsing speaks during a question-and-answer session at a meeting of the legislature\u2019s Foreign and National Defense Committee in Taipei yesterday.

I cannot pretend that I didn\u2019t see anything because it was done in the past,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThis is like an exam; until Farglory takes the test, we will not know the results,\u201d Ko said, adding that the reviews will provide transparency and that Farglory should take preparations for it seriously. \nEarlier, Ko\u2019s former chief campaign executive director Yao Li-ming \uff08\u59da\u7acb\u660e\uff09, who is now a political commentator, had criticized his old boss in an interview. \nYao said the city government\u2019s legal team was poised to dissolve the Dome contract with Farglory, but that Ko overruled the decision, saying: \u201cHave you forgotten that I have an election campaign to run?\u201d \nYao also claimed that Ko ordered a turnover of his legal team after the meeting. \nAsked to comment on Yao\u2019s claims, Ko said that he is not opposed to dissolving the contract, but such an action must be clearly planned, as he is a responsible politician. \nThe mayor also denied Yao\u2019s allegation that he sent his chief of staff Tsai Pi-ju \uff08\u8521\u58c1\u5982\uff09 to take part in under-the-table talks with Farglory Group chairman Chao Teng-hsiung \uff08\u8d99\u85e4\u96c4\uff09. \n\u201cTsai is innocent in this. If I have stuff to hash out with Chao, I would not send a person who knows nothing. Why should I do that when I have a Department of Finance commissioner for the job? Tsai was just delivering paperwork and making telephone calls,\u201d Ko said. \nTaipei City councilors from the Education Committee yesterday inspect rust removal work carried out on the Taipei Dome\u2019s roof by contractor Farglory.

If you mix this a little, not too much, you get Ishiguro in a nutshell,\u201d Swedish Academy Permanent Secretary Sara Danius said. \nIshiguro began to gain attention in the 1980s for works such as A Pale View of the Hills and won global fame for The Remains of the Day, a story of a fastidious and repressed butler in post-World War I Britain. \nThe movie version starred Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. \nIshiguro takes his place beside Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Doris Lessing and Ernest Hemingway as winner of the world\u2019s most prestigious literary award. \nCritics said the decision to give last year\u2019s prize to Dylan was a snub to more deserving candidates and strayed beyond what is traditionally deemed literature. \nBritish author Kazuo Ishiguro arrives for the Evening Standard British Film Awards at County Hall in Westminster, London, on Feb 7, 2011.

2017-10-06 03:00 \nDOUBLE TEN TALK: The AIT chairman told a Washington event that peaceful and stable cross-strait relations are beneficial to Taiwan and China, as well as in the US\u2019 interest \nBy Nadia Tsao and Jonathan Chin / Staff reporter in WASHINGTON, with staff writer \nPresident Tsai Ing-wen \uff08\u8521\u82f1\u6587\uff09 is a pragmatic and responsible leader and the US thanks Tsai for maintaining stable cross-strait links even as Beijing ratchets up its pressures on Taiwan, American Institute in Taiwan \uff08AIT\uff09 Chairman James Moriarty said on Wednesday at an event marking Double Ten National Day in Washington. \nIt is apparent that cross-strait relations are affected by the lack of trust and the US is to actively encouraging constructive dialogue that seeks to avoid miscalculations and reconcile differences through patience, flexibility and innovation, Moriarty said in a prepared speech for the event held at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office\u2019s Twin Oaks Estate. \nThe US will continue to help China and Taiwan to find a peaceful solution that is acceptable to both peoples, he said, adding neither side should attempt to change the \u201cstatus quo\u201d unilaterally. \nPeaceful and stable cross-strait relations are beneficial to both sides and are in the US national interest, he said. \nMoriarty declined to comment on Premier William Lai\u2019s \uff08\u8cf4\u6e05\u5fb7\uff09 recent comments about Taiwanese independence, saying he would not discuss cross-strait relations on the basis of any individual comment. \nHowever, the US does wish to see constructive dialogue across the Taiwan Strait, he said. \nIn response to questions from reporters, Morarty said \u201conly time will tell\u201d whether Beijing would change direction in cross-strait relations, adding this was an issue decided by Beijing, and over which the US has no control. \nTrust between Taiwan and the US should begin with effective communications and Tsai has showed pragmatism and innovation in her conduct with China, he said. \nHowever, Taiwan and China must conduct exchanges in that spirit if the relationship is to develop, he said. \nAsked about US President Donald Trump\u2019s scheduled trip to China next month, Moriarty downplayed the possibility that Trump would make major policy changes during his visit. \n\u201cI do not anticipate the occurrence of anything surprising,\u201d he said. \nThe relationship between Taiwan and the US has solid foundations and it is a mature relationship that is supported powerfully by the efforts of both sides, he added. \nMoriarty also said that he was not aware of any specific Chinese plans to invade Taiwan, but each nation must take its security seriously, adding that all militaries make plans. \nTaiwan should develop a powerful military for defense and deterrence against attacks, he said. \nAs Taiwan and the US develop a relationship, it is also necessary to pursue stability across the Strait to achieve stability and prosperity in the broader region, Moriarty said. \nTaiwan\u2019s safety is highly important to the greater security of the Asia-Pacific region and no one should take its security as a given, he said. \nThe US believes that a safe, confident and non-coerced Taiwan would be better for the development of constructive relations with Beijing, therefore, it supports Taiwan\u2019s participation in international affairs, economic ties and security cooperation, he said. \nWhile the US will continue the sales of arms and other services necessary for Taiwan\u2019s capacity for self-defense, the relationship between the two nations are not limited by arms sales alone, he said. \nThe US will do its utmost to promote Taiwan\u2019s participation in international affairs, Moriarty said, adding that he was please Representative to the US Stanley Kao \uff08\u9ad8\u78a9\u6cf0\uff09 took part in the last month\u2019s Community of

I think this was wise, because recognizing the Iran deal itself could have been seen as giving support to the Iranian state.\u201d \nICAN, based in Geneva, Switzerland, has actively campaigned for the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons adopted by the UN in July, but which needs ratification from 50 countries. Only three countries have ratified it so far. \nThe group organized events globally in 2015 to mark the 70th anniversaries of the World War II atomic bombings of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \nLast month in Berlin, ICAN protesters teamed up with other organizations to demonstrate outside the US and North Korean embassies against the possibility of nuclear war between the two countries. Wearing masks of Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, protesters posed next to a dummy nuclear missile and a large banner that read: \u201cTime to Go: Ban Nuclear Weapons.\u201d \nThe group \u201chas been a driving force in prevailing upon the world\u2019s nations to pledge to cooperate ... in efforts to stigmatize, prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons,\u201d Norwegian Nobel Committee chairwoman Berit Reiss-Andersen said in the announcement. \nThe prize \u201csends a message to all nuclear-armed states and all states that continue to rely on nuclear weapons for security that it is unacceptable behavior. We will not support it, we will not make excuses for it, we can\u2019t threaten to indiscriminately slaughter hundreds of thousands of civilians in the name of security. That\u2019s not how you build security,\u201d ICAN executive director Beatrice Fihn told reporters in Geneva. \nShe said that she \u201cworried that it was a prank\u201d after getting a telephone call just minutes before the official announcement was made. \nFihn said she did not believe it until she heard the name of the group announced on TV. \nICAN leaders later opened champaign to celebrate the prize and held up a banner with the name of the organization in their small Geneva headquarters. \n\u201cWe are trying to send very strong signals to all states with nuclear arms, nuclear-armed states \u2014 North Korea, [the] US, Russia, China, France, [the] UK, Israel, all of them, India, Pakistan \u2014 it is unacceptable to threaten to kill civilians,\u201d Fihn said. \nReiss-Andersen said that similar prohibitions have been reached on chemical and biological weapons, land mines and cluster munitions. \n\u201cThrough its inspiring and innovative support for the UN negotiations on a treaty banning nuclear weapons, ICAN has played a major part in bringing about what in our day and age is equivalent to an international peace congress,\u201d Reiss-Andersen said. \nInternational Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons executive director Beatrice Fihn holds a banner with the group\u2019s logo in Geneva, Switzerland, yesterday.

The terminal is to supply natural gas to Taiwan Power Co\u2019s Datan Power Station from July 2022. \nDue to the project\u2019s ecological conflict, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Yang Wei-fu \uff08\u694a\u5049\u752b\uff09 last month said the ministry would consider the Port of Taipei in New Taipei City\u2019s Bali District \uff08\u516b\u91cc\uff09 as an alternative site for the terminal. \nHowever, Minister of Economic Affairs Shen Jong-chin \uff08\u6c88\u69ae\u6d25\uff09 said in a question-and-answer session at the Legislative Yuan on Thursday that the project would remain at the same location while the coral would be transplanted elsewhere. \nTransplanting coral \u201cis almost impossible\u201d given its particular living requirements, Academia Sinica biologist Allen Chen \uff08\u9673\u662d\u502b\uff09 said, adding that the ministry should weigh its statement against scientific evidence. \nNo study has proved that transplanting coral is feasible, he said, whose own study, \u201cUnprecedented calcareous algal reefs in northern Taiwan merit a high conservation priority,\u201d was accepted by the journal Coral Reefs in August. \nReceiving the group\u2019s petition on behalf of the council, Forestry Bureau\u2019s Conservation Division director Hsia Jung-sheng \uff08\u590f\u69ae\u751f\uff09 said she could not comment on Shen\u2019s remark, as the ministry had not presented any plan regarding transplanting the coral. \nThe bureau would protect the coral in line with the Wildlife Conservation Act \uff08\u91ce\u751f\u52d5\u7269\u4fdd\u80b2\u6cd5\uff09, she said, adding that the Taoyuan City Government is dealing with the conservation area issue and would announce a decision soon. \nAccording to the act, those who hunt or kill protected species face fines between NT$200,000 and NT$1 million \uff08US$6,584 and US$32,921\uff09 along with a prison term of between six months and five years. \nShen had been misled by Taiwan Wetland Society researchers, Taoyuan Local Union director-general Pan Chong-cheng \uff08\u6f58\u5fe0\u653f\uff09 said, adding that they had said local wildlife was sparse to cover up for CPC, who had commissioned their research. \nThe project passed an environmental impact assessment \uff08EIA\uff09 in 1999, but CPA was required to file an environmental difference analysis with the Environmental Protection Administration \uff08EPA\uff09, as it had not started construction three years after passing the EIA. \nThe EPA in June convened an ad hoc committee to review the report, but asked CPC to present a strategy to minimize the project\u2019s impact on the local ecosystem. \nThe company has responded by filing a strategy report with the EPA, which is to convene another review meeting later this month. \nTaoyuan Local Union and other environmental groups hold a news conference outside the Council of Agriculture in Taipei yesterday to urge the government to designate the Taoyuan habitat of Polycyathus chaishanensis coral as a conservation area.

[the system] is just not suitable for Taiwan,\u201d he said. \nDepartment of Household Registration Affairs Director Wanda Chang \uff08\u5f35\u742c\u5b9c\uff09 said that even with public support, the department would not use biometrics. \nThe new cards will have the ability to incorporate personal identity verification data, which would be independent of the individual\u2019s personal records, but the function would need to be turned on by cardholders, she said. \nThe ministry has strict plans to protect privacy and ensure information security, she added. \nThe new cards would move some information onto the chip to reduce the card\u2019s size, such as the names of the user\u2019s parents, which are printed on current identification cards, Chang said. \nHowever, spousal information would still be printed on the back of the new cards, she added. \nThe integrated chip is to support active and passive authentication, as well as basic and assisted access functionality, Chang said, adding that they would have laser etchings on the surface to prevent forgery and modification. \nAssisted access functionality would require users to enter personal passwords, she said. \nNational Chiao Tung University computer science professor Lin Ying-ta \uff08\u6797\u76c8\u9054\uff09 said the cards should be as small and simple as possible to limit damage in the worst-case scenario of the system being hacked. \nNational Cheng Kung University Department of Electrical Engineering professor Lee Chung-hsien \uff08\u674e\u5fe0\u61b2\uff09 said the ministry is taking the right design direction by not incorporating biometric information. \nHe said spousal information should also be removed from the cards. \n\u201cThere are a lot of people in modern society who remain single or are divorced. This private information should be protected,\u201d Lee said. \nTaiwan Association for Human Rights chairman Weng Kuo-yan \uff08\u7fc1\u570b\u5f65\uff09 said that despite the ministry omitting biometrics, the design of the new cards must still be carefully examined by the Legislative Yuan before its details are finalized. \nPersonal information will still be stored on the card, regardless of its simplification, and information security concerns must therefore be scrutinized, he said. \nA mockup of the new identity card is pictured in a handout photograph.

mayoral election primaries 2017-10-09 03:00 \nBy Lai Hsiao-tung, Tseng Wei-chen and Shih Hsiao-kuang / Staff reporters \nFormer Taipei county commissioner Chou Hsi-wei \uff08\u5468\u932b\u744b\uff09 has become the first Chinese Nationalist Party \uff08KMT\uff09 member to throw his hat in the ring for next year\u2019s New Taipei City mayoral election, starting a competition that could see a continuation of the party infighting that overshadowed last year\u2019s presidential race. \nTaipei County was in 2010 changed into a special municipality and renamed New Taipei City. \nNew Taipei City Councilor Lin Ching-chieh \uff08\u6797\u91d1\u7d50\uff09 of the KMT confirmed Chou\u2019s intent to run for the mayoral seat, after a banner reading \u201cChou Hsi-wei, [make] New Taipei City the World\u2019s Hub\u201d went up near the Tucheng Interchange \uff08\u571f\u57ce\uff09 on Highway No. 3 on Saturday. \nLin, who hung the banner on behalf of a group of city councilors who support Chou\u2019s candidacy, said the former county commissioner would officially announce his bid at an opportune time. \n\u201cAlthough no other KMT members have expressed an interest in running for New Taipei mayor next year, our party\u2019s city councilors wanted to recommend a worthy candidate to the people,\u201d Chou said, adding that Lin had consulted him before having the banner erected. \nChou served as a lawmaker for two terms before being elected as commissioner of then-Taipei County in 2005. \nNew Taipei City Deputy Mayor Hou You-yi \uff08\u4faf\u53cb\u5b9c\uff09, who was previously seen as the KMT\u2019s most likely pick for the next mayoral race, told reporters that he welcomed anyone who is competent and willing to make a difference in the city to join next year\u2019s election. \nMeanwhile, there are speculations that former KMT chairwoman Hung Hsiu-chu \uff08\u6d2a\u79c0\u67f1\uff09, who has been making frequent visits to the city\u2019s military dependents\u2019 villages, could be another potential challenger. \nDemocratic Progressive Party \uff08DPP\uff09 Legislator Wu Ping-jui \uff08\u5433\u79c9\u53e1\uff09, who also plans to run for New Taipei City mayor, said he was unclear about whether the former KMT chairwoman is also interested in the post, despite having run into her at several grassroots-level events in the city. \nDPP Legislator Lin Chun-hsien \uff08\u6797\u4fca\u61b2\uff09 has said that Hung\u2019s potential bid could be motivated by a desire for vengeance and could further increase uncertainty in the KMT\u2019s primary election for the mayoral post. \n\u201cHou is the left hand to New Taipei Mayor Eric Chu \uff08\u6731\u7acb\u502b\uff09, who orchestrated Hung\u2019s ouster and replaced her as the KMT\u2019s presidential candidate less than three months before the 2016 race,\u201d Lin Chun-hsien said. \nLin Chun-hsien said that Chou is allied with KMT Chairman Wu Den-yih \uff08\u5433\u6566\u7fa9\uff09, who has made an all-out effort to diminish Hung\u2019s influence within the KMT after winning the party chairmanship in May. \nHowever, DPP Legislator Julian Kuo \uff08\u90ed\u6b63\u4eae\uff09 said that cross-strait relations, rather than next year\u2019s local elections, would likely be Hung\u2019s choice of battlefield for revenge. \n\u201cBeijing apparently is not fond of Wu Den-yih, considering he has yet to be given a chance to meet with China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office Minister Zhang Zhijun \uff08\u5f35\u5fd7\u8ecd\uff09 when KMT Vice Chairman Hau Lung-bin \uff08\u90dd\u9f8d\u658c\uff09 already has,\u201d Kuo said. \nHung office spokesman Lee Chang-chi \uff08\u674e\u6636\u5fd7\uff09 declined to comment on the speculations. \nAdditional reporting by Lee

2017-10-09 03:00 \nNEW WIND: Premier William Lai has used the word \u2018China\u2019 exclusively to describe the other side of the Taiwan Strait since replacing Lin Chuan, who used more cautious terms \nBy Chung Li-hua / Staff reporter \nLawmakers and academics are calling on the government to refrain from using the term \u201cmainland\u201d in reference to China in official documents in an effort to put an end to the \u201cone country, two areas\u201d framework that the former Chinese Nationalist Party \uff08KMT\uff09 government had envisioned. \n\u201cChina\u201d has been an internationally recognized term used to refer to China by countries like the US and Japan, which do not call the country of 1.3 billion the \u201cmainland,\u201d New Power Party Legislator-at-large Hsu Yung-ming \uff08\u5f90\u6c38\u660e\uff09 said. \n\u201cOut of respect, Taiwan should also use the term \u2018China.\u2019 If we call the other side of the Taiwan Strait \u2018Mainland\u2019 or \u2018Mainland China,\u2019 we are subjecting ourselves to the \u2018one country, two areas\u2019 framework and recognizing that Taiwan is a part of China,\u201d he said. \nUnlike former premier Lin Chuan \uff08\u6797\u5168\uff09, who referred to China either as \u201c the mainland\u201d or \u201cMainland China\u201d in his public remarks, Premier William Lai \uff08\u8cf4\u6e05\u5fb7\uff09 has been using \u201cChina\u201d exclusively, even after assuming the premiership, Hsu said. \nHe suggested that government agencies follow Lai\u2019s example and use \u201cChina\u201d as the unified appellation for China in their official language. \nEchoing Hsu\u2019s views, Democratic Progressive Party \uff08DPP\uff09 Legislator Lin Chun-hsien \uff08\u6797\u4fca\u61b2\uff09 said that addressing China as \u201cChina\u201d conforms to reality, while using \u201cmainland\u201d or \u201cMainland China\u201d constitutes a continuation of the KMT\u2019s ideology. \n\u201cThe government has the right to decide on the type of language it prefers to use in official documents, a decision that should be free of Chinese restriction,\u201d Lin Chun-hsien said. \nIf such a minor term change would end up stirring the water in the Taiwan Strait, that would only expose China\u2019s hegemonic mindset, Lin Chun-hsien said, adding that the government\u2019s benevolent gesture of calling Beijing \u201cMainland China\u201d has only been met with continued suppression efforts from China. \nThe need to rectify the government\u2019s designation for China was also expressed by academics. \nNational Chengchi University Graduate Institute of Taiwanese Literature professor Chen Fang-ming \uff08\u9673\u82b3\u660e\uff09 said he agreed with the way Lai addressed China and did not see it as a dereliction of duty. \nIt is natural for former president Ma Ying-jeou \uff08\u99ac\u82f1\u4e5d\uff09 of the KMT to refer to China as \u201cthe mainland\u201d given that he is an adamant champion of the so-called \u201c1992 consensus,\u201d Chen said, referring to a tacit understanding purportedly reached between the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party in 1992 that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge that there is \u201cone China,\u201d with each side having its own interpretation of what \u201cChina\u201d means. \nFormer Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Su Chi \uff08\u8607\u8d77\uff09 in 2006 said he had made up the term in 2000. \n\u201cAs president Tsai Ing-wen\u2019s \uff08\u8521\u82f1\u6587\uff09 administration does not recognize the \u20181992 consensus\u2019 and Lai is using the term \u2018China,\u2019 the government should change what it calls China in official documents to avoid being seen as saying Taiwan is part of China, like Ma,\u201d Chen said. \nOn the other hand, if Tsai wishes to establish relations with the other side of the Taiwan Strait, she should \u201ctake into consideration\u201d the issues that China pays attentions to, National Chengchi University Institute of International Relations director Arthur Ding \uff08\u4e01\u6a39\u7bc4\uff09 said. \nHe advised the government to \u201ctemporarily hold off\u201d on making changes to its designation for China in official documents, or else it might only augment China\u2019s mistrust of the DPP. \nA high-level government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the Presidential Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have adhered to the principles of sovereignty, dignity and equality in their references to China, despite the use of different terms. \n\u201cWhich terms they choose to use depends on the rhetorical context. There are \u2018the other side,\u2019 \u2018Mainland China,\u2019 \u2018Beijing government\u2019 and \u2018China.\u2019 Similarly, we also use \u2018Washington,\u2019 the \u2018US side\u2019 or the \u2018US\u2019 in different contexts,\u201d the official said. \nThe government\u2019s use of China\u2019s full state name in the aftermath of several diplomatic crises, such as Panama\u2019s severance of ties with Taiwan, suggests that it takes the principle to heart, the official added. \n\u65b0\u805e\u4f86\u6e90\uff1a TAIPEI TIMES \nThe Republic of China Honor Guard takes part in a dress rehearsal for tomorrow\u2019s National Day celebrations along with cheerleaders from Shih Hsin University and Fu Jen Catholic University, at the plaza in front of the Presidential Office Building in Taipei yesterday.

Taiwanese history, but public museums still largely ignored it \nBy Yang Yuan-ting and Jake Chung / Staff reporter, with staff writer \n\u201cTaiwan cannot not be found among the collections of the National Museum of History in Taipei, nor is there Taiwanese history in the collections of the National Museum of Taiwan History,\u201d said Lin Yu-fang \uff08\u6797\u4e8e\u6609\uff09, founder of the recently closed-down Formosa Vintage Museum Cafe \uff08\u79cb\u60e0\u6587\u5eab\uff09 in Taipei\u2019s Daan District \uff08\u5927\u5b89\uff09, in a recent interview with the Liberty Times \uff08the Taipei Times\u2019 sister paper\uff09. \nThe cafe, which showcased the nation\u2019s history through Lin\u2019s collectibles that were displayed throughout the shop, closed on Sept. 30. \nLin, a former dentist in Japan, said he chose to quit a teaching job in Japan and return to Taiwan in 1998 as \u201cthe motherland beckoned.\u201d \nAfter his return to Taiwan, Lin said that when friends visited Taiwan from overseas, they would ask him to take them on tours to \u201cmuseums with Taiwanese characteristics.\u201d \nIt was then that he discovered that public museum exhibits were China-centric, and Taiwan\u2019s historic artifacts and history were nowhere to be found in Taipei, Lin said. \nThe discovery made him wish to learn the history of the land so he could better display the glory of Taiwan to foreign friends, he said, adding that that simple thought had started him on the irreversible track of 20 years of collection. \n\u201cCollection is a curious thing and sometimes it is the item that finds you,\u201d Lin said, recalling his visit to the National Palace Museum in 2003 for the Ilha Formosa \u2014 the Emergence of Taiwan on the World Scene in the 17th Century exhibition and how he was enamored with the piece Generic paintings of Taiwan\u2019s Aboriginal peoples \uff08\u756a\u793e\u91c7\u98a8\u5716\uff09. \nSeveral months later, an auctioneer carried the very same piece to his house, as it was well-known in the auctioning sector that Lin was \u201cwilling to take anything that is related to Taiwan.\u201d \nLin\u2019s willingness to purchase any and everything related to Taiwanese culture, history and society has brought over 10,000 pieces together in his warehouse. \nOnce he had amassed enough for an exhibition, he said he started opening up his warehouse to private tours for his friends, but soon became bothered once more. \nLin said he simply could not accept that Taipei, being the capital of the country, did not have even one museum or exhibition regarding Taiwanese history. \n\u201cIt is a failure of education when local residents are not concerned about local history,\u201d Lin said, adding it was then that he decided to make his collection public. \n\u201cHistory should not be locked in a warehouse, and these pieces of art and culture should be in closer contact with people,\u201d Lin said. \nTaking a character each from the names of his father and mother, Lin seven years ago established the museum on Taipei\u2019s Yongkang Street, next to dumpling chain Din Tai Fung. \nWhen they entered the former museum, visitors would be immediately greeted with the many drawings reflecting the early ages of Taiwan\u2019s development, ranging from the first Chinese settlers to paintings of Taiwan under Dutch and Spanish rule, Lin said. \nLin said he also collects other relics, such as propaganda from the Nationalist government after it took over the island from Japan, adding that these collections served to record Taiwanese history under its many different rulers. \nThe goal was to collect and exhibit historic records of everything that had happened in Taiwan through the ages, and the most ancient item he had was an official document dating back to the rule of Emperor Shunzhi \uff081638-1661\uff09 of the Qing Empire openly declaring Cheng Cheng-kung \uff08\u912d\u6210\u529f\uff09, also known as Koxinga \uff08\u570b\u59d3\u723a\uff09, to be a rebel and ordering military action against Cheng. \nCheng, whose father supported Zhu Jinjian, the claimant to the Ming throne at the time, founded the Kingdom of Tungning on Taiwan after defeating the Dutch. Taiwan would not fall under Qing rule until 1681. \nThe Formosa Vintage Museum Cafe also collected souvenirs and mementos from private companies, as well as registered marks and plaques from the then-Taiwan Tobacco & Liquor Public Sales Depot and the organization that later became Taiwan Power Co. \nDuring the highly politicized transition from Japanese colonial rule to the Nationalist government, state-owned businesses did not pay much attach great value to documents or paperwork from the Japanese era, Lin said, adding that he had bought most of these documents from second-hand bookstores. \nWhile he was reluctant to part with his collection, Lin has either donated or loaned his collection, which is estimated to value NT$1 billion \uff08US$32.9 million\uff09, to the National Museum of Taiwan History in Tainan. \nLin said he is hopeful, as a growing number of young people are now paying attention to their own history and culture, but added that he is still saddened about the complete absence of Taiwanese history from public museums such as the National Palace Museum. \n\u201cI truly wish that the government would give Taiwanese cultural relics a place,\u201d Lin said. \n\u65b0\u805e\u4f86\u6e90\uff1a TAIPEI TIMES \nLin Yu-fang, founder of the Formosa Vintage Museum Cafe in Taipei\u2019s Daan District, speaks during an interview at the cafe in Taipei\u2019s Daan District on its closing day, Sept. 30.

Taiwan is already a nation with sovereignty, but some people in the US do not even know where Taiwan is,\u201d Hung told a news conference in Taipei yesterday. \nThe direction of President Tsai Ing-wen\u2019s \uff08\u8521\u82f1\u6587\uff09 economic policy is correct, but she is more concerned about research and development while paying little attention to traditional industries, Hung said, urging Tsai to \u201cwake up.\u201d \nAccording to data released by the MOEA last month, there were 1,408,313 small and medium-sized enterprises in the nation last year employing 8,810,000 people. \nAccording to the data, 97.73 percent of the nation\u2019s businesses are small or medium-sized, but their total revenue last year \u2014 about NT$11.7 trillion \uff08US$385.2 billion\uff09 \u2014 made up only 30.71 percent of all business revenue. \nThe government should not leave those businesses to fend for themselves, because they are the nation\u2019s \u201clifeblood,\u201d Hung said. \nHsu Ya-chin \uff08\u5f90\u96c5\u7434\uff09, vice president of the San Francisco branch of the Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce of North America, serves as the program\u2019s chief executive officer. \nShe pledged to connect different generations, especially younger businesspeople, through the program. \n\u201cYoung people know better about consumer behavior and they can smell where the market is heading,\u201d she said. \u201cThousands of young businesspeople worldwide are glad to join the program.\u201d \nThe platform would be more effective if the government directed more resources and helped young businesspeople understand the needs of local businesses, Hsu said. \nThe nation\u2019s exports rely on foreigners purchasing Taiwanese goods, but if the buyers are overseas Taiwanese compatriots, they would develop closer relations with the local economy, MOEA Small and Medium Enterprise Administration Director-General Wu Ming-ji \uff08\u5433\u660e\u6a5f\uff09 said. \nThe program\u2019s first goal is to promote the nation\u2019s 50 companies from the \u201cgreen\u201d industry and the circular economy, he said, adding that ministry officials have had the opportunity to talk to overseas representatives at Saturday\u2019s forum. \nThe program\u2019s participants are planning to set up a headquarters in Silicon Valley and other cities in the US, Europe and Japan, Council Vice Minister Leu Yuan-rong \uff08\u5442\u5143\u69ae\uff09 said. \nThere were about 1,911,000 overseas Taiwanese compatriots last year, with about 1,202,000 in the US and 613,000 in Asian nations, council data showed in July. \nHung Shun-wu, center, an adviser to the US-based Friends of the Democratic Progressive Party, speaks at a news conference in Taipei yesterday.

It suppresses the ROC while ostensibly supporting it,\u201d Chang said. \u201cWe have to rescue the ROC from being taken over by Taiwanese independence.\u201d \nThe DPP does not accept the so-called \u201c1992 consensus\u201d and has been trying to remove Chinese history from school curricula, and if it is re-elected in the general elections in 2020, military tension in the Taiwan Strait would escalate, a situation that the school seeks to avoid, he said. \nThe \u201c1992 consensus\u201d \u2014 a term former Mainland Affairs Council chairman Su Chi \uff08\u8607\u8d77\uff09 in 2006 said he made up in 2000 \u2014 refers to a tacit understanding between the KMT and the Chinese government that both sides acknowledge there is \u201cone China,\u201d with each side having its own interpretation of what \u201cChina\u201d means. \nThe foundation aims to achieve peace and reconciliation with Beijing and improve identification with China, with the goal of signing a peace treaty or an armistice with Beijing to end decades of military hostility, he said, echoing the \u201cpeace platform\u201d proposed by Hung. \nThe peace platform was a clause added to the KMT charter last year proposing to negotiate a peace treaty with China, but it was revoked on Aug. 20 after Wu Den-yih \uff08\u5433\u6566\u7fa9\uff09 took office as KMT chairman. \nThe school also aims to resuscitate the KMT using the philosophy of ROC founder Sun Yat-sen \uff08\u5b6b\u9038\u4ed9\uff09, Chang said. \n\u201cThe KMT should return to Sun\u2019s Three Principles of the People, which is the most important factor with which the KMT could garner the support of Taiwanese,\u201d he said. \nThe KMT has been losing some of its core narratives since former president Lee Teng-hui\u2019s \uff08\u674e\u767b\u8f1d\uff09 term, and although it was able to fund its election campaigns with party assets, the party is losing that edge as it is being challenged over the party assets issue, Chang said. \nSun Yat-sen School principal Chang Ya-chung talks about the school\u2019s founding principles at a banquet in Taipei yesterday.

This flag has borne the ideas, feelings, struggles, humility and dignity of millions of Chinese people over the past 100 years. It has become the symbol recognized, affirmed and supported by 23 million people in Taiwan as well. Surely we should bring our national flags out and raise them high at important occasions like National Day celebrations,\u201d Ma said. \nFormer KMT chairwoman Hung Hsiu-chu \uff08\u6d2a\u79c0\u67f1\uff09 said \u201cour love for the national flag and our use of the ROC as the name of the nation should not be hidden inside.\u201d \n\u201cTo us, addressing our nation as the ROC and respecting our flag is just as natural as facing the sun and walking on the land. We neither have to fabricate nor hide those feelings,\u201d she said. \nFormer representative to the US Shen Lyu-shun \uff08\u6c88\u5442\u5de1\uff09 said that he was invited to attend the pan-blue event because during his time in Washington the ROC flag was raised at Twin Oaks \u2014 the estate owned by the ROC government and used for official receptions \u2014for the first time in 2015, 37 years after the US and Taiwan severed diplomatic ties. \nKMT Chairman Wu Den-yih \uff08\u5433\u6566\u7fa9\uff09 said that seeing the national flag should strengthen the faith and reignite the hope of party supporters that the KMT would soon rule the nation again. \nWu asked KMT supporters to unite and work together to help it to win next year\u2019s \u201cnine-in-one\u201d elections for special municipality mayors, county commissioners and city and county councils. \n\u201cLet our flags fly in more cities and counties than they do now. If we make significant progress next year, it would open up a chance for us return to power,\u201d he said. \nMa said that he was deeply concerned with the direction in which the DPP administration is heading. \nThe KMT needs to seize any opportunity it can to convince the public that it has the most effective solution to achieve cross-strait peace and prosperity, he said. \nA man waves a huge Republic of China flag in front of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei yesterday during an event organized by the Chinese Nationalist Party \uff08KMT\uff09 to commemorate Double Ten National Day.

We must be more prepared for growing threats in cybersecurity and espionage, and be more capable of protecting our critical infrastructure,\u201d Tsai said. \nShe pledged to continue to build up Taiwan\u2019s indigenous defense industry through technical exchanges, including a commitment to build the nation\u2019s own fighter jets and submarines. \nThe purpose of military reform is not to seek war, but to safeguard Taiwan\u2019s freedom, democracy and way of life, as well as to ensure the right of the Taiwanese to decide their own future, Tsai said. \nShe said that cross-strait relations is an issue that affects the nation\u2019s future and the long-term welfare of its 23 million people, adding that \u201cwe have exerted maximum goodwill\u201d to safeguard the peaceful and stable development of such ties. \nAlthough political differences between the two sides of the Strait have led to some complications, Tsai said that her administration has \u201cnevertheless worked to maintain the basic stability of cross-strait relations.\u201d \nBeijing has cut off channels of communication between the two sides and pressed two of the nation\u2019s diplomatic allies to switch recognition to China since Tsai took office in May last year. \nTsai reiterated her oft-stated position that \u201cour goodwill will not change, our commitments will not change, we will not revert to the old path of confrontation and we will not bow to pressure.\u201d \n\u201cThis has been my consistent position on cross-strait relations,\u201d she said. \nAs this year marks the 30th anniversary of cross-strait exchanges since Taiwan lifted a ban on veterans visiting China in 1987, the president said that over the past 30 years, hostility between the two sides has been replaced by peaceful development and a new chapter has been written in cross-strait ties. \n\u201cKey to this was that both sides were able to put aside political differences in order to be pragmatic and realistic,\u201d Tsai said, adding that in the course of exchanges and interactions, both sides accumulated goodwill and established new interactions and ways of thinking. \nShe called on Beijing to treasure these hard-fought results and the accumulated goodwill from the past 30 years. \n\u201cOn this existing basis, we hope for more breakthroughs in the cross-strait relationship,\u201d Tsai said. \nEnumerating the areas in which progress has been made over the past year, she said her administration would continue to work hard to fulfill its commitments and push reforms to provide a better life for Taiwanese. \nAmong the commitments she mentioned were transforming the nation\u2019s economy and industrial structure, investing in infrastructure, reforming the tax code, expanding long-term care services and reforming the pension and judicial systems. \nTsai, who is also chairperson of the Democratic Progressive Party, invited political party leaders to exchange views on constitutional reform and other issues, such as safeguarding the nation\u2019s democracy. \nPresent at the National Day ceremony were Chinese Nationalist Party \uff08KMT\uff09 Chairman Wu Den-yih \uff08\u5433\u6566\u7fa9\uff09, People First Party Chairman James Soong \uff08\u5b8b\u695a\u745c\uff09, New Power Party Executive Chairman Huang Kuo-chang \uff08\u9ec3\u570b\u660c\uff09 and Republican Party Chairwoman Hsu Hsing-ying \uff08\u5f90\u6b23\u7469\uff09. \nTsai said the issues she spoke about in the speech, including domestic reforms, safeguarding the nation\u2019s democracy and freedom and finding a place for the nation in the international community, \u201call also require that Taiwan come together.\u201d \n\u201cI hereby formally invite the leaders of our political parties to meet to discuss issues of concern. As long as we are united, we can show the world the pride we take in our democracy, freedom and prosperity,\u201d Tsai said. \n\u65b0\u805e\u4f86\u6e90\uff1a TAIPEI TIMES \nPresident Tsai Ing-wen delivers a speech during the National Day celebrations in front of the Presidential Building in Taipei yesterday.

The ROC is an illegal occupying force that took over our island against the wishes of the people,\u201d Chen said. \n\u201cEvery year on Oct. 10, the government holds rallies and parades to celebrate the so-called Double Ten National Day of the ROC. This is a repugnant religious cult worshiping the ROC\u2019s corpse, which imposes the alien Chinese ideology on us. We must end this deception starting today by performing a proper funeral, and cremate the corpse and send it to the underworld,\u201d he said. \nChen asked people in the crowd to pay their \u201clast respects,\u201d after which wooden sticks were driven into the effigy. \nMembers of the Free Taiwan Party, the Taiwan Independence Party, the 908 Taiwan Republic Campaign, the Taiwan Independence Reformation Association and the Alliance of Referendum for Taiwan were also at the event. \nFree Taiwan Party Chairman Tsay Ting-Kuei \uff08\u8521\u4e01\u8cb4\uff09 said the Democratic Progressive Party government must do away with the \u201cgreat lie of the ROC in Taiwan,\u201d because it has led to a dead end and will give China reason to invade Taiwan. \n\u201cIt is good to see students and young advocates taking the initiative to put on today\u2019s event. With their efforts ... I see hope for building a new Taiwan nation in the near future,\u201d he said. \nChen and Tsay led the crowd in a funeral procession, singing Taiwanese songs and carrying the effigy to Liberty Square. \nA small scuffle with the police broke out at the square when the group lit a fire to burn the effigy. \nPolice doused the fire, leading to pushing and shoving. No arrests were made and the scuffle ended without further incident. \nPolice said it is against the law to light a fire at the square and to gather for an illegal assembly, to which some of the advocates responded: \u201cThe ROC is dead and we do not recognize your illegitimate laws.\u201d \nA small group of about a dozen people from the pan-blue camp and pro-unification groups held a counterprotest on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but a heavy police presence prevented them from reaching the funeral event. \nMembers of the Free Taiwan Party and other pro-Taiwanese independence groups stand around an effigy representing the Republic of China at a mock funeral on Ketagalan Boulevard in Taipei yesterday.

Over the years, we have been a source of capital, technology and technical know-how,\u201d she said, adding that the nation has also built up enduring economic and industrial links with Southeast Asian countries, as a leading source of foreign direct investment and trade. \nEconomic, social and political changes in the region are bringing new opportunities and challenges, so Taiwan must adapt, redefine its role and play an even more active and prominent part in the interactions of the region, Tsai said. \n\u201cThe New Southbound Policy is our new \u2018Regional Strategy for Asia\u2019 which is aimed at deepening and broadening our presence in South and Southeast Asia,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of our foremost objectives is to strengthen cooperation in resources, talent and market development.\u201d \nThe policy is inclusive and does not come at the expense of other regional initiatives, Tsai said, adding that it is designed to complement, rather than compete with, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative and the India and Japan Freedom Corridor. \nTaiwan has expanded scholarships and financial assistance for students from New Southbound countries, is encouraging more bilateral trade and investment through the establishment of six investment windows in Southeast Asian countries and India, and relaxed visa restrictions on several countries covered by the policy, Tsai said. \nIn the past year, tourist numbers have increased by 36.7 percent, trade has grown by about 20 percent, and overseas student numbers have increased by about 10 percent from New Southbound countries, Tsai said. \nThe next phase is the five flagship programs, directed at development in five major areas: Human resources, innovation-based industries, regional agriculture, medical cooperation and industrial supply chains, she said. \nTo fulfill the region\u2019s needs and bolster its sense of inclusiveness and community, Taiwan is prepared to make five commitments to New Southbound countries, Tsai said. \nThe commitments include helping nurture and empower talents needed in the region, by providing scholarships and educational opportunities and expanding work-study course offerings to 5,000 students each year, and sharing experiences to help New Southbound countries establish domestic demand-driven industries, such as in the fields of petrochemicals, information and communications technology, and the medical sector, she said. \nOther commitments include helping New Southbound countries with their infrastructure and major development projects by establishing a US$3.5 billion fund managed by the Official Development Assistance program; and helping small and medium enterprises and nongovernmental organizations \uff08NGOs\uff09 share their insight and experiences with New Southbound countries, with an emphasis on job creation at the local-level, Tsai said. \nThe nation has also made a commitment to join forces with other like-minded countries to improve Taiwan\u2019s common presence in the region, which would benefit peace, stability and prosperity in the region and the world, she said. \nTsai said that a \u201cTaiwan-Asia Exchange Foundation\u201d would be established to act as the main organizing and administrative body of the Yushan Forum and serve as an exchange platform for leaders, youth representatives, NGOs and think tanks in the region. \nThe two-day forum has two sub-themes: \u201cPartnership of Commitment\u201d aimed at highlighting Taiwan\u2019s commitment to the New Southbound Policy, and \u201cPartnership for Connectivity,\u201d which demonstrates how Taiwan\u2019s vibrant civil society is connected with people and groups for social well-being in Southeast and South Asia. \nThe forum invited more than 40 speakers from 15 South and Southeast Asian countries, as well as Japan, South Korea, the US and Europe. \nPresident Tsai Ing-wen, center, shakes hands with former Philippine vice president Teofisto Guingona Jr yesterday at the opening of the Yushan Forum in Taipei.

Currently, the most advantageous tender can only be accepted if a contractor can provide construction work or services that are different from other contractors, or only if it is determined that the lowest tender should not be accepted. \nAs there is no clear criteria in the act to define how construction work is \u201cdifferent\u201d or why the lowest tender should not be accepted, government officials tend not to choose the most advantageous tender to avoid legal issues, Public Construction Commission Minister Wu Hong-mo \uff08\u5433\u5b8f\u8b00\uff09 said. \n\u201cIn the past, less than 10 percent of public construction projects accepted the most advantageous tender, but the percentage has grown to more than 50 percent as the government has encouraged the adoption of the most advantageous tender in major infrastructure projects,\u201d Wu said. \nThe lowest tender does not necessarily guarantee quality work, Wu said. \nThe amendment also prohibits contractors from participating in government tenders for three years if they are found guilty of bribery. \nMinister of Finance Sheu Yu-jer speaks at a news conference at the Executive Yuan in Taipei yesterday.

Courts should not use it to overturn a verdict by a local registration office,\u201d Tseng said. \nAdditional reporting by CNA \nLawyer Hsu Hsiu-wen, fourth left, yesterday speaks at a news conference in Taipei after a request by her clients, a homosexual couple, to get legally registered as a married couple was dismissed by the Taipei High Administrative Court.

Should the amendments not be passed within the allotted time, same-sex couples may use extant Civil Code regulations to register their marital status at household registration offices. \nChi said that he was overjoyed to hear the announcement of the interpretation, which has been viewed as a significant milestone not only by Taiwanese LGBT rights movements, but also those across Asia. \nHowever, he said he was saddened to hear on Thursday that the Taipei High Administrative Court rejected a case filed by lesbian couple Fang Min \uff08\u65b9\u654f\uff09 and Lin Yu-li \uff08\u6797\u4e8e\u7acb\uff09 to request that household registration offices should accept their marriage registration. \nThe court said it could not grant the couple\u2019s request, as \u201cthe legal framework for same-sex marriage has not been promulgated into law\u201d and the two-year deadline stipulated by the constitutional interpretation has not lapsed. \nWhile the interpretation stipulated that amendments should be made before May 24, 2019, it also declared that limitations on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional, so courts should approve such requests instead of rejecting them, Chi said. \nHe said that his efforts to legalize same-sex marriage are not just for himself, but for many others who, like him, are not afforded legal protection to join hands with their loved ones, adding that while receiving the award would be a great honor, it is not fair that he alone is to enjoy the limelight. \nIf possible, he would exchange the award for the right of same-sex couples to register their marriage immediately, Chi said. \nHe called on the government to expedite the handling of the issue, saying that the nation\u2019s LGBT community has been waiting a long time and should not be kept waiting any longer. \nVeteran gay rights advocate Chi Chia-wei holds up a rainbow flag in an undated photograph.

The court has not yet made them public. \nThere is little or no precedent for a Chinese court taking such action at the request of a US company, Canaccord Genuity Inc analyst Mike Walkley said. \nChinese regulators would also be concerned that a halt of iPhone production would cause layoffs at Apple\u2019s suppliers, such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co \uff08\u9d3b\u6d77\uff09, which are major employers. \nConversely, supporting Qualcomm might help Chinese smartphone manufacturers, such as Guangdong Oppo Electronics Co \uff08\u5ee3\u6771\u6b50\u73c0\uff09, to gain market share against Apple, Walkley said. \nQualcomm and Apple are months into a legal dispute that centers on the former\u2019s technology licensing business. \nHowever, the latest suits come at a crucial time for Apple, as suppliers and assemblers in China are rushing to churn out as many iPhone 8 and iPhone X models as possible ahead of the holiday season, so any disruptions would likely be costly. \nThe Greater China region accounted for 22.5 percent of Apple\u2019s US$215.6 billion sales in its most recent financial year. \nThe legal battle started earlier this year when Apple filed an antitrust suit against Qualcomm arguing that the chipmaker\u2019s licensing practices are unfair, and that it abused its position as the biggest supplier of chips in phones. \nQualcomm has countered with a patent suit and argued that Apple encouraged regulators from South Korea to the US to take action against it based on false testimony. \nEarlier this week, Qualcomm was fined a record NT$23.4 billion \uff08US$775 million\uff09 by Taiwan\u2019s Fair Trade Commission, a ruling the company is appealing. \nA woman looks at an Apple iPhone 8 Plus at an Apple store in Shanghai on Sept. 22.

So far they have been more reassuring than frightening in terms of continuity \u2014 no big changes,\u201d Paal said on the sidelines of a meeting of Asia-Pacific think-tank leaders in Taipei organized by the Institute for National Policy Research. \nHowever, it remains to be seen whether the officials\u2019 view is in line with that of Chinese President Xi Jinping \uff08\u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73\uff09, whose mandate is expected to be renewed at the congress in Beijing, he added. \nThere has been wide speculation regarding how Xi intends to proceed with the Taiwan issue. Some have predicted a hard-line shift, while others have floated the possibility of a military invasion. \nIn comparison, Paal seemed sanguine about cross-strait development, saying that he hopes Beijing would be willing to work patiently with Taipei and that the Taiwanese government could find a political basis for resuming some of the semi-official connections that were established by the previous Chinese Nationalist Party \uff08KMT\uff09 administration. \n\u201cBut this takes two sides to cooperate and we have to see how [China] develops its leadership and policy during and after the party congress,\u201d he said. \nChina is overdue in developing better relations with its neighbors, having spent the past 15 years brawling with Japan, Vietnam and most recently India, Paal said. \nWhen asked whether it is feasible for both sides of the Taiwan Strait to engage in friendly interactions and cooperation under the APEC framework, as President Tsai Ing-wen \uff08\u8521\u82f1\u6587\uff09 has suggested, Paal did not give a direct answer. \nHe instead said he was confident that Xi will \u201cafford respect\u201d to People First Party Chairman James Soong \uff08\u5b8b\u695a\u745c\uff09, who is set to attend next month\u2019s APEC summit in Da Nang, Vietnam, on Tsai\u2019s behalf. \n\u201cIt is an opportunity for Taiwan to be represented with all the other nations participating, including [US President] Donald Trump,\u201d he added. \nA Taiwanese president has not attended the APEC leadership meeting since the nation became a member of the bloc in 1991 due to obstruction by Beijing. \nThe highest-level officials to represent the nation\u2019s president at the annual summit were former vice presidents Lien Chan \uff08\u9023\u6230\uff09 and Vincent Siew \uff08\u856d\u842c\u9577\uff09 of the KMT. \nCarnegie Endowment for International Peace vice president for studies Douglas Paal talks to reporters in Taipei yesterday.

Fang \uff08\u65b9\u632f\u4ec1\uff09 admitted that weather conditions are worse at the industrial park than at the Port of Taipei. \nHowever, if the terminal is to be built at the Port of Taipei, the company would have to reclaim land from the sea and complete a new environmental impact assessment, Fang said, adding that such a terminal would begin to supply gas in 2028 instead of 2022. \n\u201cAlthough there is no algal reef issue at the Port of Taipei, local residents [in Bali] are opposed to the terminal project,\u201d he said. \nWith Datan as its priority location, the company plans to transplant the algal reef on Datan\u2019s coast to the Guansin \uff08\u89c0\u65b0\uff09 reefs ecological conservation area to the south, he said, adding that CPC would continue to evaluate the feasibility of transplanting the endangered coral. \nThe forum, which aimed to find a \u201cwin-win solution\u201d to the issue, was jointly organized by the Academia Sinica Biodiversity Research Center, Taoyuan Local Union, Environmental Jurists Association, Wild at Heart Legal Defense Association, Taiwan Environmental Protection Union and Taipei Bar Association at the Chinese Culture University in Taipei and was attended by about 20 speakers and 100 people attending. \nPolycyanthus chiashanensis, an endagered coral species that can only be found in Taiwan, is shown in Taoyuan\u2019s Guanyin District in an undated photo.

Bush\u2019s pledge to sell the nation eight diesel-electric submarines, the source said. \nThe US Department of State is expected to send officials \u201cof some weight\u201d to the conference, who are likely to meet with a Taiwanese delegation on the sidelines to talk about weapons procurement, the source added. \nThe conference is to focus on the US administration\u2019s Northeast Asia policies and their potential effects on Taiwan\u2019s defense. \nIt would also discuss the threats facing Taiwan and its response options, as well as how the nation could exploit China\u2019s weaknesses in traditional and emerging domains \u2014 air, land, sea and cyberspace \u2014 according to information on the conference\u2019s Web site. \nNow in its 16th year, the conference is considered an important platform for dialogue on Taiwan\u2019s national security needs, weapons procurement and defense cooperation with the US. \nThe Taiwanese delegation to the three-day conference is led by Deputy Defense Minister General Chang Guan-chung \uff08\u5f35\u51a0\u7fa4\uff09, who is to deliver a keynote speech today. \nChang is scheduled to speak after introductory remarks by American Institute in Taiwan Chairman James Moriarty. \nUS Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs David Helvey is also to give a keynote speech later in the day. \nThe discussions at the conference are to include input by Ian Easton, research fellow at US-based think tank Project 2049 Institute and author of The Chinese Invasion Threat. \nBusiness representatives from Taiwan\u2019s information security, shipbuilding and aviation industries are to join the discussions tomorrow. \nThe participants are to examine the potential implications of the Trump administration\u2019s policies for developing business opportunities in the defense and security industries in Taiwan and the US. \nThe conference has been hosted by the US-Taiwan Business Council since 2002. \nDeputy Defense Minister General Chang Guan-chung, left, attends the opening of an exhibition in Taipei on July 7.

We must make a renewed effort to confront history and to understand roles of the Taiwanese and their changing identities over the past centuries,\u201d Chia said. \nThe US military deployed B-29 bombers on Oct. 14, 1944, to target installations around Kaohsiung Harbor, and the \u201c61st Aircraft Factory of Okayama\u201d run by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service. \n\u201cOkayama\u201d was the Japanese name for what is now Kaohsiung\u2019s Gangshan District \uff08\u5ca1\u5c71\uff09. \nThe exhibition opened with a minute of silence for the people who were killed in the bombing, followed by testimonies from survivors and speeches by government officials and others. \nLiang Chi-hsiang \uff08\u6881\u555f\u7965\uff09, 89, gave an eyewitness account of the air raid, which took place when he was a high-school student working at the 61st Aircraft Factory as an apprentice. \n\u201cWhen the air raid siren sounded, I was on my way to work, but people and vehicles outside the factory had been stopped by military officers. We saw the bombs fall and explode at a distance,\u201d he said, adding that the factory and many houses were burned down in the ensuing fires. \nWhile some anti-aircraft artillery tried to knock out the US bombers, there was no sign of Japan\u2019s Zero fighters, Liang said. \n\u201cThe Japanese military had already suffered a lot of damage from previous bombings and could no longer defend itself against the US military. So at the time, I and other locals knew that Japan had lost the war and would have to surrender soon,\u201d Liang said. \nSouthern Taiwan Society chairman Chang Fu-chu \uff08\u5f35\u5fa9\u805a\uff09 said he felt awful about how history of that time has become distorted. \n\u201cWhen I talk about the wartime air raids, some people thought it was the Japanese who bombed Kaohsiung and other cities in Taiwan, killing locals,\u201d Chang said. \nOnly by confronting the past can we learn the lessons from it and have a better future, he said. \nDemocratic Progressive Party \uff08DPP\uff09 Legislator Chiu Chih-wei\u2019s \uff08\u90b1\u5fd7\u5049\uff09 family is from Gangshan and he said he had grown up listening to stories about the raids. \n\u201cWe have to teach this history at school to the younger generation so it will not be forgotten, Chiu said, adding that he would work in the legislature to push for such educational programs. \nThe exhibition, which runs through Nov. 12, include maps and photographs from the national archives and declassified military files from the US and Japan, along with materials from recently published books by wartime journalists as well as researchers. \nKaohsiung residents on Saturday look at maps and reproductions of photographs in an exhibition at the Gangshan Cultural Center commemorating the 73rd anniversary of the World War II bombing of the city and surrounding area.

Chung filed a countersuit for false charges. \nAfter Huang Lu was informally declared the winner, by 1,011 ballots, Chung withdrew his charges. \nTainan City Councilor Hsieh Lung-chieh \uff08\u8b1d\u9f8d\u4ecb\uff09 appears to have won in Tainan, Hualien County Medical Association director Chou Yung-hung \uff08\u9112\u6c38\u5b8f\uff09 won in Hualien, Taitung County Councilor Wu Hsiu-hua \uff08\u5433\u79c0\u83ef\uff09 won in that county and former KMT legislator Tsao Erh-chang \uff08\u66f9\u723e\u5fe0\uff09 won in Lienchiang County. \nFive races had only a single candidate, including the former mayor of then-Taipei County\u2019s Sanchong City \uff08\u4e09\u91cd\uff09 Lee Chien-lung \uff08\u674e\u4e7e\u9f8d\uff09 in New Taipei City; Hsinchu County Councilor deputy speaker Chen Chien-hsien \uff08\u9673\u898b\u8ce2\uff09 in that county, and the incumbent branch directors in Taoyuan, Pingtung County and Kinmen County: Yang Ming-sheng \uff08\u694a\u654f\u76db\uff09, Liao Wan-ju \uff08\u5ed6\u5a49\u6c5d\uff09 and Lin Fang-hsuan \uff08\u6797\u82b3\u65cb\uff09. \nThe list of winning candidates will be formally announced after it is reviewed by the KMT\u2019s Central Standing Committee on Wednesday, the party said. \nTaipei saw the lowest turnout rate among the KMT\u2019s 10 administrative areas, with just 19.09 percent, while Kinmen had the highest voting rate at 64.9 percent. \nFormer president Ma Ying-jeou \uff08\u99ac\u82f1\u4e5d\uff09 was accompanied by Huang Lu when he cast his ballot at Nanmen Elementary School in Taipei, but he did not speak to reporters. \nWu also cast his ballot at the school, saying the competition overall was intense, but he hoped to see \u201cfair play.\u201d \nAfter polling closed and the provisional winners were announced, Wu said that he hopes the new directors will be faithful to the party, help collect grassroots opinion and unify local supporters. \nHe said he would not ask the new directors not to enter next year\u2019s municipal elections because they can each weigh their own options. \nThe newly elected branch directors are to be sworn in on Wednesday next week. \nChinese Nationalist Party \uff08KMT\uff09 Chairman Wu Den-yih casts his vote in a classroom at Nanmen Elementary School in Taipei, which was a polling station yesterday for the KMT\u2019s election for local branch directors.

It expects revenue contribution from smartwear solutions to increase over the coming years. \nAsked about the company\u2019s strategy to differentiate itself from its competitors, Hsu said that FENC aims to develop smart clothing with a focus on functionality and comfortableness instead of smart wearable devices. \n\u201cAs a textile maker, we have a totally different mindset, compared with those who are in the electronics industry,\u201d Hsu told the Taipei Times. \nThe firm\u2019s products have longer wash cycles and higher resistance to chemical oxidizers than those of its competitors, he said. \nHsu said that FENC is also planning to tap into the growing sleep-testing services market with its smartwear technologies through cooperation with hospitals and telecom providers to help physicians and other healthcare professionals monitor patients\u2019 sleep quality. \nThe Taipei Innovative Textile Application Show runs through tomorrow. \nModels wear \u201csmart\u201d clothing yesterday at the opening of the Taipei Innovative Textile Application Show at the Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center Hall 1 in Taipei.

We believe the merger will create a competitive business model,\u201d Neo Solar chairman Sam Hong \uff08\u6d2a\u50b3\u737b\uff09 told a news conference at the Taiwan Stock Exchange. \nBy melding each company\u2019s capabilities, the new firm is to offer vertical integration services from solar cell and module manufacturing, to photovoltaic systems assembly, Hong said. \nThe new entity would also have a more competitive cost structure, given its larger scale, he said. \nThe new company would have a total installed capacity of 5 gigawatts \uff08GW\uff09 of solar cells \u2014 about 10 percent of the global market based on the projected worldwide installed capacity of 500GW this year, Hong said. \nThe companies also plan to expand their combined annual production capacity of solar modules to more than 3GW two to three years after the merger, compared with their current 1GW, Hong said. \nThe firms also aim to sell 1GW of photovoltaic systems annually within five years, he said. \nBased on the letter of intent, Gintech shareholders will be able to swap each of their shares for 1.39 common shares of Neo Solar, while Solartech shares can be swapped for 1.17 Neo Solar shares, the companies said. \nAfter Gintech and Solartech are absorbed into Neo Solar, the company is to be renamed United Renewable Energy Co \uff08UREC, \u806f\u5408\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\uff09, the statement said, adding that Hong is to be the chairman and Gintech president Pan Wen-whe \uff08\u6f58\u6587\u8f1d\uff09 is to serve as chief executive officer. \nThe deal was granted the government\u2019s verbal support ahead of the announcement, as it is in line with the administration\u2019s policy of developing the nation\u2019s renewable energy industry and increasing the contribution of \u201cgreen\u201d power to the nation\u2019s energy grid to 20 percent by 2025, Hong said. \nThe firms are to soon apply for capital injections from the National Development Fund and government affiliate Yao Hua Glass Co \uff08\u8000\u83ef\u73bb\u7483\uff09, Hong said. \nIt is too early to say how much UREC will receive from the government and whether it would hold a seat on the company\u2019s board, Hong said. \nThe National Development Council said it has not yet received the application, but added that it supports the consolidation of solar firms to increase production capacity and competitiveness. \nIn a separate announcement, Neo Solar yesterday said it is to acquire 46.1 million shares, or 24.11 percent, of General Energy Solutions Inc \uff08\u6c38\u65fa\u80fd\u6e90\uff09 for NT$20.7 per common share in the open market from today to Nov. 6. \nThe company is making the move in a bid to increase its ownership in General Energy from 75.89 percent to 100 percent. \n\u201cWe believe we can provide better renewable energy solutions via Neo Solar\u2019s manufacturing strength and General Energy\u2019s power plant building and managing capabilities,\u201d Neo Solar said in a news release. \n\u65b0\u805e\u4f86\u6e90\uff1a TAIPEI TIMES \nFrom left, Neo Solar Power Energy Corp chariman Sam Hong, Gintech Energy Corp president Pan Wen-whe and Solartech Energy Corp president Liu Kang-hsin join hands during a news conference yesterday in Taipei to announce their merger.

Chinese local government \nBy Chen Wei-han / Staff reporter \nThe Cabinet would dissolve a multibillion-dollar contract to build minesweeper ships with financially troubled Ching Fu Shipbuilding Co \uff08\u6176\u5bcc\u9020\u8239\uff09 if necessary, Premier William Lai \uff08\u8cf4\u6e05\u5fb7\uff09 told lawmakers yesterday. \nChing Fu, one of the nation\u2019s largest private shipbuilders, won a NT$35.85 billion \uff08US$1.19 billion at the current exchange rate\uff09 contract with the Ministry of National Defense in October 2014 to build six minesweepers as part of the nation\u2019s indigenous shipbuilding and upgrade program, but it is suspected of using the money to invest in projects in China and of defrauding banks. \nProsecutors in August questioned company executives about NT$3 billion in loans that are suspected of having been obtained under false pretenses. \nChing Fu secured a NT$20.5 billion loan from a consortium of nine banks headed by First Commercial Bank \uff08\u7b2c\u4e00\u9280\u884c\uff09 after having already received about NT$15 billion. \nThe money might end up being written off as a bad debt if the shipbuilder declares bankruptcy. \nSpeaking during a legislative sitting, Lai said that the government would \u201ccut its wrists\u201d \u2014 or terminate the contract \u2014 if necessary to prevent further losses, but first it would investigate if Ching Fu has the financial and technical abilities to complete the project. \nThe Cabinet is to form an investigative task force and take steps to ensure that the project\u2019s first minesweeper, which is being built in Italy, would be transferred to the government and not mortgaged by Ching Fu\u2019s debtors, Lai said. \nIt is to also take disciplinary action against any official found to have been negligent in awarding the contract to Ching Fu, he said. \nThe ship under construction in Italy is a 700-tonne vessel being built by Intermarine SpA, with the US firm Lockheed Martin providing support for the mine detection hardware and weapons systems. \nNew Power Party Executive Chairman Huang Kuo-chang \uff08\u9ec3\u570b\u660c\uff09 asked Lai how Ching Fu, which signed an investment deal with a Chinese local government before the minesweeper project was announced, could have been able to secure the contract. \n\u201cThe shipbuilding technology we learn from the Italian manufacturers will end up in the hands of a contractor that has signed an investment agreement with a Chinese local government,\u201d which could compromise national security, Huang said. \nChing Fu bought a sonar system designed for minesweepers from a Chinese company before it won the Ministry of National Defense tender, as if it knew it was going to win the bid, Huang said, asking if anything illegal was involved in the deal. \nChing Fu in 2001 delivered four patrol boats to the Coast Guard Administration, but 338 mechanical problems were found with the boats and the Control Yuan issued a correction to the Cabinet over the procurement process, the lawmaker said. \nHe asked Lai why the ministry awarded another multibillion New Taiwan dollar contract to an apparently unqualified contractor. \n\u201cHow could we entrust a contractor that could not properly build a patrol boat with the important indigenous shipbuilding program?\u201d Huang said. \nThe government allocated a budget of NT$3.47 billion between 2013 and last year for the shipbuilding project, but it overspent by NT$1.36 billion, officials said. \nAbout half of the NT$3.87 billion budget allocated this year has already been paid to Ching Fu, Minister of National Defense Feng Shih-kuan \uff08\u99ae\u4e16\u5bec\uff09 told lawmakers. \nThe ministry failed to obtain information about Ching Fu\u2019s purchase of the sonar system before the contract was awarded, Feng said. \nHe also said he did not know how much of the minesweeper under construction in Italy had been completed. \nA

It started long before May 20 last year [when President Tsai Ing-wen \uff08\u8521\u82f1\u6587\uff09 was inaugurated]. It has always been like this. Sometimes China exerts more pressure, but it is relatively stable now,\u201d Lee said. \nMeanwhile, Lai said that Taiwan would interact with China on the principles of equality and mutual respect during the APEC summit, after KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao \uff08\u8cf4\u58eb\u8446\uff09 questioned if Taiwan\u2019s participation under the name \u201cChinese Taipei\u201d might damage the nation\u2019s dignity. \nCiting Tsai\u2019s statement that her administration is willing to have friendly interactions with Beijing under the APEC framework, Lai said that it might be an affront to Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty because the nation cannot join APEC as a state. \nThe public should support Tsai\u2019s proposal, which seeks to achieve a common ground with Beijing to develop cross-strait relations on the right track, Lai said. \nTaiwan and China are to interact as separate APEC members and economies, Lai said, avoiding the question if the interaction should be defined as a state-to-state. \nPremier William Lai answers lawmakers\u2019 questions in the Legislative Yuan in Taipei yesterday.

However, the airline will have to suspend operations of B-28035 because its horizontal stabilizer was damaged,\u201d Lin said. \nThe agency is investigating the cause of the incident, and if it is determined that the airline violated aviation regulations, it could be fined between NT$600,000 and NT$3 million, and the airline\u2019s ground crew could be fined between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000, he said. \nFar Eastern Air apologized to its passengers for the inconvenience. \nIt promised to provide food, water and other supplies to passengers whose flights were delayed and help them transfer to flights on other airlines if there were seats available. \nLin added that the airline has an older fleet, and the agency has capped its flight hours for safety reasons. \nFAT has eight MD-80s, six of which are 20 years old or older, with the other two almost as old. \nThe airline\u2019s flights would be suspended if it has trouble maintaining flight safety, Lin said. \n\u201cThe company has standardized operating procedures about how to tow an aircraft out of the hangar. You have one person who is charge of towing the aircraft, and ground crew on both sides of the aircraft to look out for other airplanes while it is moving out of the hangar,\u201d he said. \u201cThe collision must have happened because of human error. How the collision happened will be the focus of our investigation.\u201d \nAt issue is whether a lack of training or or a disciplinary issue contributed to the incident, the CAA said. \nAdditional reporting by CNA \nA Far Eastern Air Transport airplane is parked on the apron at Taipei International Airport \uff08Songshan airport\uff09 yesterday as it undergoes inspection following a minor collision with another aircraft early in the morning.

Rather, artificial obstructions and divisions have been the main causes of the worsening deadlock,\u201d the council said. \nThe council urged Beijing to accept that it is unlikely for its unilateral and heavy-handed \u201cone China\u201d principle and \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formulation to gain the support of Taiwanese. \n\u201cRespect and communication are the only keys to narrowing the differences between the two sides,\u201d the council said. \nIn his three-and-a-half-hour report, Xi mentioned the so-called \u201c1992 consensus\u201d four times, saying it embodies the spirit of Beijing\u2019s \u201cone China\u201d principle and clearly defines the nature of cross-strait relations. \nThe \u201c1992 consensus\u201d \u2014 a term former Mainland Affairs Council chairman Su Chi \uff08\u8607\u8d77\uff09 admitted to making up in 2000 \u2014 refers to a tacit understanding between the Chinese Nationalist Party \uff08KMT\uff09 and the CCP that both sides acknowledge there is \u201cone China,\u201d with each side having its own interpretation of what \u201cChina\u201d means. \nThe \u201c1992 consensus\u201d lies at the center of the cross-strait stalemate. Beijing has been persistent in its stance that it is the prerequisite for exchanges and dialogue, while the Democratic Progressive Party \uff08DPP\uff09 government has refused to accept it, instead calling for a \u201cnew pattern of engagement.\u201d \nMeanwhile, Xi said that China over the past five years has firmly opposed and prevented Taiwanese independence, and that Beijing has achieved a historical meeting between the two sides\u2019 leaders. \nHe was referring to his meeting with then-president Ma Ying-jeou \uff08\u99ac\u82f1\u4e5d\uff09 in November 2015, the first meeting between the top leaders of Taiwan and China since the KMT\u2019s retreat to Taiwan in 1949. \nChina has \u201cthe resolve, confidence and ability to defeat separatist attempts for Taiwanese independence in any form,\u201d Xi said. \n\u201cWe will never allow any person, organization or political party, at any time or in any form, to separate any part of Chinese territory from China,\u201d he said. \nThe congress is seen as the most significant political gathering in China since Xi came to power in 2012. His remarks on cross-strait relations are to serve as important indicators of Beijing\u2019s policy toward Taiwan. \nThe council, expressing the hope that China could work to adopt policies that promote \u201cdemocracy, peace, fairness and justice\u201d as it endeavors to become stronger and carry out systematic reform, called on Beijing to adopt \u201ca new mindset and healthy attitude\u201d toward cross-strait relations. \n\u201cWhen dealing with cross-strait issues, President Tsai Ing-wen \uff08\u8521\u82f1\u6587\uff09 and her government have a rational and pragmatic attitude, and have refrained from any forms of provocation,\u201d the council said, adding that joint efforts should be made to explore a new model for interactions and to promote pragmatic communication to move cross-strait relations forward. \nThe Presidential Office issued a mild response compared with that issued by the council. \n\u201cThe government has endeavored to maintain cross-strait relations based on public opinion and domestic consensus, and has continuously extended a friendly hand in the hope of resolving our divisions and differences through virtuous interactions,\u201d the office said, adding that it believes the international community understands and has noticed those efforts. \nThe DPP government\u2019s policy to strive for regional peace and stability has always been clear and persistent, the office said. \nIt also reiterated Tsai\u2019s \u201cnew four noes\u201d for cross-strait ties. \n\u201cOur goodwill remains unchanged. Our promise [to maintain the \u2018status quo\u2019] remains unchanged. We will not return to the old path of conflict and we will not succumb to pressure,\u201d it said. \nLocal residents walk past a monitor showing a broadcast from Beijing of Chinese leader Xi Jinping speaking at the 19th Communist Party Congress, in Taipei yesterday.

Active efforts are needed to build a new model of cross-strait interaction as President Tsai has called for,\u201d he said. \nThe obstacles to building such a model are largely the result of ongoing restructuring of the CCP\u2019s power structure, which will stabilize following the congress, Chao said, adding that Beijing is expected to interact with Taipei in a more predictable manner while mutual trust is gradually built up. \nThe two sides could begin to build this new model of interaction by engaging through think tanks before a formal dialogue, he added. \nThe so-called \u201c1992 consensus\u201d refers to a tacit understanding between the Chinese Nationalist Party \uff08KMT\uff09 and the CCP that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge there is \u201cone China,\u201d which each said having its own interpretation of what \u201cChina\u201d means.

There are also limits on how long an officer can serve without promotion. \nFor example, an officer cannot serve for more than 10 years as a lieutenant or more than 15 years as a captain. \nOfficers who reach the service length limit appropriate to their rank before being promoted would be discharged without receiving full benefits. \nAfter discussions with the Ministry of National Defense, the committee resolved to increase the length of service for field-grade officers. \nAccording to the proposed amendment, lieutenants would see their service limit increased from 10 years to 12 years and captains from 15 years to 17 years. Majors, lieutenant colonels and colonels would see their service raised from 20 years, 24 years and 28 years to 22 years, 26 years and 30 years respectively. \nIn response to reports that the military is not retaining enough officers, the committee proposed several schemes to increase the maximum length of service. \nDemocratic Progressive Party Legislator Lo Chih-cheng \uff08\u7f85\u81f4\u653f\uff09 proposed to increase for lieutenants and captains from 10 years and 15 years respectively, to 15 committee and 17 years. \nDDP Legislator Wang Ding-yu \uff08\u738b\u5b9a\u5b87\uff09 and Chinese Nationalist Party \uff08KMT\uff09 Legislator Lu Yu-ling \uff08\u5442\u7389\u73b2\uff09 proposed the maximum length of lieutenants increase to 15 years and captains to 20 years. \nWang and Lu proposed an additional increase the service limit of majors, lieutenant colonels and colonels from 20 years, 24 years and 28 years to 22 years, 26 years and 30 years. \nIn a report to the committee, the ministry\u2019s Director of Resource Planning Chen Cheng-chih \uff08\u9673\u6b63\u68cb\uff09 told lawmakers that extending the length of service for captains to 20 years would cause a bottleneck in the career paths. \nChen recommended a compromise that would incorporate Lo\u2019s proposal for lieutenants and captains, while using Wang and Lu\u2019s proposal for majors and colonels. \nThe committee also passed an additional resolution that would allow lieutenants and captains to apply for merit-based deferments on forced retirement. \nThe measure is necessary for maintaining the size of the military and its institutional knowledge, the committee said. \n\u65b0\u805e\u4f86\u6e90\uff1a TAIPEI TIMES \nFrom left, Deputy Minister of National Defense Bo Hong-hui, ministry Department of Resource Planning head Chen Cheng-chi and Deputy Chief of General Staff for Personnel Fu Cheng-cheng take part in a question-and-answer session at the Legislative Yuan in Taipei yesterday.

For example, you cannot build whatever you want on private land, you have to comply with construction and land-use laws,\u201d he said. \nChinese Nationalist Party \uff08KMT\uff09 and People First Party lawmakers have criticized the proposal as \u201cauthoritarian\u201d and \u201cdetrimental to democracy.\u201d \nThe amendment is to be sent to the legislature for review. \nAccording to the Cabinet, 580 hectares is needed for industrial purposes and the government is working to make 604 hectares available in two years. \nMeanwhile, Minister of Economic Affairs Shen Jong-chin \uff08\u6c88\u69ae\u6d25\uff09 yesterday said the ministry would order the Industrial Development Bureau to speed up the drafting of policy on how to handle idle land, and to propose a grace period between fines and forcible auction. \nThe bureau also needs to draft a countermeasure to prevent land owners building nonoperational plants on land to deceive the government, Shen said. \n\u201cWe have to hurry as the Executive Yuan wants us to draft the policy with more details and implement it as soon as possible to alleviate the shortage of land,\u201d Shen told reporters before the ministry\u2019s weekly meeting. \nAdditional reporting by Lauly Li \nMinister of Economic Affairs Shen Jong-chin speaks to reporters in Taipei yesterday about proposals to draft policy addressing a shortage of industrial land.

To the CCP, they are meaningless. To Taiwanese, they are the butt of jokes. The KMT is the only party in the world that buys into that shibboleth about \u2018one China\u2019 and each side having its own interpretation,\u201d Hsu said. \u201cThis letter shows that attempt to pry the name \u2018China\u2019 from the CCP is a nonstarter. Our path is to normalize Taiwan as a nation.\u201d \nDemocratic Progressive Party \uff08DPP\uff09 Legislator Lin Chun-hsien \uff08\u6797\u4fca\u61b2\uff09 said on Facebook that the absence of the ROC in the letter belies the KMT\u2019s patriotic rhetoric of respecting the ROC and the flag. \n\u201cThe KMT\u2019s flattering self-characterization of what it did as in \u2018the spirit of the 1992 consensus\u2019 is utter nonsense. The \u20181992 consensus\u2019 is the KMT\u2019s own deception. There was no consensus,\u201d Lin said. \nHowever, former presidential office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang \uff08\u7f85\u667a\u5f37\uff09 said the Tsai administration did not use the ROC calendar or refer to the nation in its letter of condolence to China in August after an earthquake in Sichuan. \n\u201cWhere is the ROC in the correspondence sent by the DPP-run Straits Exchange Foundation? Why was \u2018our nation\u2019 substituted with \u2018our side\u2019? Is Tsai the chief executive of an area or a side?\u201d Lo said. \nThe \u201c1992 consensus,\u201d a term former Mainland Affairs Council chairman Su Chi \uff08\u8607\u8d77\uff09 in 2006 admitted making up in 2000, refers to a tacit understanding between the KMT and the CCP that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge there is \u201cone China,\u201d with each side having its own interpretation of what \u201cChina\u201d means. \n\u65b0\u805e\u4f86\u6e90\uff1a TAIPEI TIMES \nThe Chinese Nationalist Party\u2019s \uff08KMT\uff09 congratulatory letter to the Chinese Communist Party ahead of its 19th National Congress, omitting the phrase \u201cYear of the ROC\u201d before the ROC calendar year at the end of the letter, is pictured on Wednesday.

If people in Kinmen [County] also choose to veto the legalization of gambling, it would de facto abolish Article 10-2 of the Offshore Islands Development Act [\u96e2\u5cf6\u5efa\u8a2d\u689d\u4f8b], which forms the legal basis for opening a casino on outlying islands,\u201d he said. \nArticle 10-2 stipulates that before an offshore island can permit the establishment of tourist casinos, a local referendum must be held in accordance with the Referendum Act \uff08\u516c\u6c11\u6295\u7968\u6cd5\uff09, with more than half of valid votes cast in favor of allowing casinos. \nThe island that survived artillery attacks in the 1949 Battle of Guningtou and in the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis is now facing an attack from casinos, Buddhist master Shih Chao-hwei \uff08\u91cb\u662d\u6167\uff09 said. \nPeople in Kinmen have reached a crossroad again, she said. \n\u201cMacau and Singapore have showed that locals, rather than tourists, quickly become victims of gambling,\u201d she said, adding that gaming is a sinful industry. \nYang Tsai-ping \uff08\u694a\u518d\u5e73\uff09, founder of the Anti-Casino Movement in Kinmen, said he had urged the government to lift all military regulations imposed on Kinmen many years ago, but it had never occurred to him that one day he would be opposing the establishment of casinos on the island. \nPeople on Kinmen have lived through wars, Yang said, adding that future generations on the island should not have to live through disasters caused by gambling. \nNot voting in the referendum would allow casino operators to reap the benefits, he said. \nGreed is the root of all evil, Presbyterian Pastor Lin Wei-lien \uff08\u6797\u5049\u806f\uff09 said, adding that the government should not use the Offshore Islands Development Act or boosting the economy as excuses to build casinos on the outlying islands. \nLegalizing gambling would set a bad example for children and cause the crime rate in Kinmen to rise, Lin said, adding that people in Kinmen need to think twice before they vote and must not pursue short-term benefit. \nCatholicism teaches that people need to work for a living, said Father Ollevier Willy of the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. \nCasinos allow people to make money without having to earn it themselves, Willy said, adding that Kinmen should develop and progress normally. \nThe government should increase flights and shipping services for people to return home and vote in the referendum, Taiwan Private School Employee Union chairman Wang Hong-nan \uff08\u738b\u5b8f\u7537\uff09 said. \nMembers of a coalition of civil groups urge Kinmen County residents to vote against legalizing gambling in the county during a protest at the Legislative Yuan in Taipei yesterday.

Both men had damaged skin and smoke coming off their bodies,\u201d one witness said. \nThe injured were taken to hospital. \nChang was pronounced dead at the scene. \nThe attack appears premeditated, as Chang had a knife, glass vials containing sulfuric acid and a stun gun in his backpack, police said. \nAs of press time last night, Hsieh was in a critical condition. \nHe sustained serious cuts and acid burns on more than 60 percent of his body, doctors said. \nLuo and Ku\u2019s conditions were not critical, because they were only partly burned, they added. \nProsecutors yesterday investigated the crime scene and interviewed witnesses, two of the victims and their family and friends. \nAn autopsy was performed on Chang to determine if he had consumed alcohol or drugs prior to the attack. \nAccording to media reports and discussion threads on Professional Technology Temple \uff08PTT\uff09, the nation\u2019s largest online academic bulletin board, Chang was romantically involved with Hsieh, with some citing as evidence that both men shared information in support of same-sex marriage on Facebook. \n\u201cOne of the men wanted to break up, but the other did not,\u201d Ku told reporters. \n\u201c[Hsieh] had told his mother about his sexual orientation.

Of those, 28 were executed, Control Yuan member Kao Feng-hsien \uff08\u9ad8\u9cf3\u4ed9\uff09 said. \nKao initiated the 18-month probe of the Luku Incident. \nKao said Chinese Communist Party \uff08CCP\uff09 member Tsai Hsiao-chien \uff08\u8521\u5b5d\u4e7e\uff09 came to Taiwan in 1946 to establish the Taiwan Provincial Work Committee. \nIn 1949, Tsai\u2019s subordinates created a Luku-based militia called the Northern Region Armed Committee that coerced local villagers into joining its ranks. One year later, Tsai was arrested and the militia was renamed the People\u2019s Armed Guard, she said. \nIn 1952, the bureau laid siege to Luku and subsequently executed 28 people, with another 19 people sentenced to \u201cre-education\u201d as then-bureau officer Ku Cheng-wen\u2019s \uff08\u8c37\u6b63\u6587\uff09 slaves, Kao said. \nThe Luku Incident is considered the largest crackdown of the White Terror era, she said. \nThe military tribunals contravened due process stipulated by the Code of Criminal Procedures, and grave human rights violations were committed in detaining, interrogating and trying the villagers, Kao said. \n\u201cThe defendants\u2019 arguments were ignored out of hand and none of the accused were able to confront witnesses. The verdicts and judgements were marked by undue haste. Several people were detained and executed without their family ever being informed,\u201d Kao said. \nIn the 1990s, the government paid the victims more than NT$500 million \uff08US$16.53 million at the current exchange rate\uff09 in compensation, Kao said. \nThe compensation was authorized by the Act Governing the Recovery of Damage of Individual Rights during the Period of Martial Law \uff08\u6212\u56b4\u6642\u671f\u4eba\u6c11\u53d7\u640d\u6b0a\u5229\u56de\u5fa9\u689d\u4f8b\uff09 and the Compensation Act for Wrongful Trials on Charges of Sedition and Espionage During the Martial Law Period \uff08\u6212\u56b4\u6642\u671f\u4e0d\u7576\u53db\u4e82\u66a8\u532a\u8adc\u5be9\u5224\u6848\u4ef6\u88dc\u511f\u689d\u4f8b\uff09, she added. \nHowever, only those who were convicted by Ku\u2019s personal testimony and the 19 people he enslaved were eligible for compensation, she said. \n\u201cA number of people were tortured before their release and there is no record of their suffering and therefore no recompense. Those people include the child of Luku\u2019s village head, who was severely beaten and later released on account of being too young to stand trial,\u201d Kao said. \nLi Shih-Cheng, a victim of the Luku Incident, on Feb. 16, 2015 stands in front of Kuang Ming Temple in New Taipei City, where more than 200 villages were incarcerated and interrogated in the 1950s.
