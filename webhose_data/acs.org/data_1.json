A new analytical method can make it easier to be sure. Credit: Shutterstock Biofuel or not? A new analytical method can make it easier to be sure. Credit: Shutterstock \nFor those seeking carbon credits for selling or using biofuels, it\u2019s important to know that the fuel actually came from plants that were recently alive, and not from fossil fuels, which are made of plant matter that\u2019s been dead for hundreds of millions of years. Researchers now have an easier way of determining the source of those hydrocarbon molecules. A team from the National Institute of Standards & Technology has designed a benchtop spectrometer that can do radiocarbon analysis more easily and less expensively than standard methods ( J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2017, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b02105 ). \nThe most reliable way to tell fossil fuels apart from biofuels lies in their carbon isotope composition: In fossil fuels, all of the carbon-14, which has a 5,730-year half-life, has undergone radioactive decay long ago, while biofuels retain a 14 C signal. The trouble is that even in biofuels, the 14 C concentration is miniscule, so distinguishing these two carbon sources requires isotope detection at limits that challenge most benchtop instruments. \nThe gold standard for 14 C analysis\u2014best known as a way to date fossils and artifacts\u2014is accelerator mass spectrometry, which can determine the age of a specimen to within 0.2-0.4%. The technique works by accelerating ions from a sample to high speeds in order to separate the isotopes by mass and count them. But it\u2019s expensive: accelerator mass spectrometers cost about $6 million, so most scientists must ship their samples to a dedicated facility, where sample preparation and analysis can come to about $500 per sample. \nSo researchers, including the NIST team, have been developing potentially cheaper, more accessible radiocarbon analysis using optical techniques. In cavity ring-down absorption spectrometry, for example, near-infrared light from a continuous-wave laser tuned to the wavelength absorbed by 14 C is bounced between two mirrors inside an optical cavity, until the signal eventually leaks out or \u201crings down\u201d and is detected by the instrument. When a sample of 14 C-containing gas is introduced into the cavity, it absorbs some of the light, changing the ring-down interval, which can be used to calculate the amount of 14C present. \nAnother group previously used a variation on this ring-down technique to measure 14 C with 0.4% precision, but their method required fairly complex modeling to determine the 14 C concentration ( Optica 2016, DOI:10.1364/OPTICA.3.000385 ). To get around this limitation, Adam J. Fleisher , David A. Long , and their colleagues at NIST decided instead to use linear cavity ring-down spectrometry, which requires less signal analysis, yielding more direct measurements. To detect 14 C at or below the parts per trillion levels in biofuel samples, the team designed a unit with a stable temperature of -55\uf0b0\u02daC; a very precise, fixed distance between mirrors; and improved laser technology and optics. They achieved a precision of 11% for analyzing samples of CO 2 produced by the combustion of fossil fuels and bioethanol. \nJocelyn C. Turnbull , a radiocarbon scientist at GNS Science, a geoscience consultancy in New Zealand, calls the result impressive. \u201cThe payoff will be huge when the instrument becomes available for widespread use at presumably much lower cost than traditional radiocarbon measurement methods.\u201d She says its current level of precision would be most useful for verifying bioproducts, but it\u2019s a long way from being useful for dating archaeological or geological artifacts, or for tracing the sources and fate of fossil fuel emissions in the atmosphere, which would require a precision of 0.2%. \nThe NIST team is now designing a next-generation instrument to target this threshold. The company Planetary Emissions Management , which focuses on applications for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions, has signed an agreement with NIST to commercialize the technology.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david a. long", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam j. fleisher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jocelyn c. turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national institute of standards & technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "planetary emissions management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gns science", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:16:38.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8297494034ea2d45a0b0ab21fc0169e077182a7d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTNC8D_liSgxUFNPzJ21y0qQ69_.0M4D5MkhRKdWGSvbN_eWRVnIXWyzYnl_1q3TWaWamhTpABu20b6fTGG3QJOW._6WcfI6WHbhpt8hfEpn.Urvn7SimWFN5.2FogwtbbFFEy6eynjrQfdck0c2XcS", "site_full": "cen.acs.org", "site": "acs.org", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/cen_latestnews", "site_categories": ["science", "chemistry"], "section_title": "Chemical & Engineering News: Latest News", "title": "Detection of gravitational waves wins 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics", "title_full": "Detection of gravitational waves wins 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics", "published": "2017-10-03T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3320, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8297494034ea2d45a0b0ab21fc0169e077182a7d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTNC8D_liSgxUFNPzJ21y0qQ69_.0M4D5MkhRKdWGSvbN_eWRVnIXWyzYnl_1q3TWaWamhTpABu20b6fTGG3QJOW._6WcfI6WHbhpt8hfEpn.Urvn7SimWFN5.2FogwtbbFFEy6eynjrQfdck0c2XcS", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "\"Mitch Jacoby\" (nobody@acs.org)", "published": "2017-10-03T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Detection of gravitational waves wins 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics", "text": "Credit: MIT, Caltech, Caltech Alumni Association Weiss, Barish, Thorne Credit: MIT, Caltech, Caltech Alumni Association \nThose waves remained elusive for a century. But in 2015, the tiny signals, which are easily swamped by numerous sources of noise, were detected for the first time by LIGO\u2019s enormous and ultrasensitive interferometers. One of them is located in Livingston, La., the other is in Hanford, Wash. \nThe instruments consist of a powerful laser and an interferometer with a pair of 4-km-long arms. A gravitational wave passing through the area of the detector causes a momentary subatomic-scale change in the length of one arm relative to the other. \nThe LIGO team, which includes roughly 1,000 scientists, had just completed an upgrade of their optical equipment when they finally saw the signal they had been searching for. They eventually determined that it came from gravitational waves that were generated 1.3 billion years ago. The waves formed as two black holes\u2014roughly 29- and 36-times the mass of the sun\u2014merged, forming a single black hole. \nA few months later, in December 2015, the LIGO team detected another black-hole merger. Several more gravitational waves have been detected since then. \nAt the press conference announcing this year\u2019s prize, Weiss, who spoke by phone, said that like many of his team members, he did not believe that the first signal detected in 2015 was real. The signal could have been fake results that were injected in the data stream to test the equipment and the team\u2019s ability to recognize such signals. It took team members two months to convince themselves that the observations were real, Weiss said. \nSpeaking at the Nobel Prize conference, Uppsala University particle physicist Olga Botner commented that the first detection of gravitation waves \u201ccaused a sensation worldwide.\u201d Now the observations are starting to pile up. Botner pointed out that just last week the LIGO team along with scientists at VIRGO , a new gravitational-wave detector near Pisa, announced that all three detectors measured signals that correspond to yet another black-hole merger. \u201cThis truly the dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy,\u201d Botner said. \nReflecting on the honor of winning the Nobel Prize, Weiss said, \u201cIt\u2019s really wonderful. It recognizes the work of 1,000 people that has been going on for nearly 40 years.\u201d He added that the team continues to work on increasing the sensitivity of the detectors. The goal, he said, \u201cis to look deeper and deeper into the universe and to study its beginnings.\u201d \nThe 4-km-long arms of the LIGO interferometer seen here extend into the green countryside of Livingston, La. Hanford, Wash., hosts a second, nearly identical instrument.

Abstract Single-phase bismuth silver oxysulfide (BiAgOS) was prepared by a hydrothermal method. Its structural, morphological, and optoelectronic properties were investigated and compared with those of bismuth copper oxysulfide (BiCuOS). Rietveld refinement of the powder X-ray diffraction measurements revealed that the BiAgOS and BiCuOS crystals have the same structure as ZrSiCuAs, tetragonal space group P 4/ nmm . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirmed that BiAgOS has a high purity, in contrast with BiCuOS, which tends to have Cu vacancies. The Ag has a monovalent oxidation state, whereas Cu is present in the +1 and +2 oxidation states in the BiCuOS system. Combined with experimental measurements, density functional theory calculations employing the range-separated hybrid HSE06 exchange-correlation functional with spin\u2013orbit coupling quantitatively elucidated photophysical properties such as absorption coefficients, effective masses, and dielectric constants. BiCuOS and BiAgOS were found to have indirect bandgaps of 1.1 and 1.5 eV, respectively. Both possess high dielectric constants and low electron and hole effective masses. Therefore, these materials are expected to have strong exciton dissociation capabilities and excellent carrier diffusion properties. This study reveals that BiAgOS is a promising candidate for photoconversion applications.

Abstract In this work, we have quantitatively elucidated the source of the hydrogen content in the atomic layer deposition of Al 2 O 3 at different temperatures (80\u2013220 \u00b0C), by replacing the H 2 O precursor with heavy water (D 2 O) to use as a tracer and discern between the H coming from the unreacted metal precursor ligands and that from the unreacted \u2212OD (hydroxyl) groups coming from the (heavy) water. The main source of impurities arises from the unreacted hydroxyl groups (\u2212OD), reaching \u223c18 atom % of deuterium at a deposition temperature of 80 \u00b0C. Reconsidering carefully our own and literature experimental data, we concluded that the generally accepted mechanism of steric hindering by monodentate Al(CH 3 ) 2 adsorbates (dimethylaluminum) cannot be solely responsible for the retention of hydroxyls during atomic layer deposition (ALD). On this regard, we propose two additional mechanisms that can lead to sterically hinder hydroxyl groups which will then remain unreacted in the film: surface rehydroxylation resulting in the reconfiguration of bidentate or tridentate adsorbates into monodentate adsorbates and hindered subsurface hydroxyl groups during the (heavy) water pulse and the hydroxylation of sterically hindered dissociated methyl chemisorbed species. Based on these three steric hindrance mechanisms, we constructed a growth model that consists of the initial chemisorption configurations of trimethyl-aluminum molecules with the alumina surface and the subsequent reconfiguration of the resulting adsorbates into a monodentate configuration that consequently leads to sterically hindered hydroxyl groups. The fraction of AlOx adsorbates arranged in monodentate and bidentate configurations entails a specific number of O/Al atoms and unreacted hydroxyl groups inside the film. This model was able to explain the deuterium content, the O/Al ratio, and the density obtained from Rutherford back-scattering and heavy ion elastic recoil detection analysis measurements. Furthermore, this model was able to predict more accurately the growth per cycle to what has been reported to be the ALD window of alumina. Our findings will spur further detailed investigations of the reaction and growth modes in ALD films.

Abstract Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Along with an increasing number of elderly worldwide, it poses a great challenge for the society and health care. Although sporadic AD is the common form of AD, 2\u20133% of the AD cases are expected to be due to mutations in the \u03b2 region of the amyloid precursor protein, which is referred to as autosomal dominant AD (ADAD). These mutations may cause changes in the secondary structure of the amyloid \u03b2 fibrils and may alter the fibrillization rate leading to changes in the disease development and could also affect the binding to tracers used in diagnosis. In particular, from some recent clinical studies using PET tracers for detection of fibrillar amyloids, it is evident that in ADAD patients with Arctic mutation no amyloid plaque binding can be detected with the 11 C-Pittsburgh Compound B ( 11 C-PIB). However, for in vitro conditions, significant binding of 3 H-PIB has been reported for the amyloid fibrils carrying the Arctic mutation. The aim of the present study is to investigate if there is any mutation specific binding of commonly used amyloid tracers, namely, florbetaben, florbetapir, FPIB, AZD4694, and AZD2184, by means of molecular modeling techniques. Other than Arctic, ADAD mutations, such as the Dutch, Italian, Iowa, and Flemish mutations, are considered in this study. We report that all tracers except florbetapir show reduced binding affinity toward amyloid \u03b2 fibrils with the Arctic mutation when compared to the native type. Moreover, florbetapir is the only tracer that binds to all mutants with increased affinity when compared to the native fibril.

Abstract The crystal structure prediction (CSP) of a given compound from its molecular diagram is a fundamental challenge in computational chemistry with implications in relevant technological fields. A key component of CSP is the method to calculate the lattice energy of a crystal, which allows the ranking of candidate structures. This work is the second part of our investigation to assess the potential of the exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) dispersion model for crystal structure prediction. In this article, we study the relatively large, nonplanar, mostly flexible molecules in the first five blind tests held by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. Four of the seven experimental structures are predicted as the energy minimum, and thermal effects are demonstrated to have a large impact on the ranking of at least another compound. As in the first part of this series, delocalization error affects the results for a single crystal (compound X), in this case by detrimentally overstabilizing the \u03c0-conjugated conformation of the monomer. Overall, B86bPBE-XDM correctly predicts 16 of the 21 compounds in the five blind tests, a result similar to the one obtained using the best CSP method available to date (dispersion-corrected PW91 by Neumann et al.). Perhaps more importantly, the systems for which B86bPBE-XDM fails to predict the experimental structure as the energy minimum are mostly the same as with Neumann\u2019s method, which suggests that similar difficulties (absence of vibrational free energy corrections, delocalization error,...) are not limited to B86bPBE-XDM but affect GGA-based DFT-methods in general. Our work confirms B86bPBE-XDM as an excellent option for crystal energy ranking in CSP and offers a guide to identify crystals (organic salts, conjugated flexible systems) where difficulties may appear.   10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00715 .

Abstract Wave functions restricted to electron-pair states are promising models to describe static/nondynamic electron correlation effects encountered, for instance, in bond-dissociation processes and transition-metal and actinide chemistry. To reach spectroscopic accuracy, however, the missing dynamic electron correlation effects that cannot be described by electron-pair states need to be included a posteriori . In this Article, we extend the previously presented perturbation theory models with an Antisymmetric Product of 1-reference orbital Geminal (AP1roG) reference function that allows us to describe both static/nondynamic and dynamic electron correlation effects. Specifically, our perturbation theory models combine a diagonal and off-diagonal zero-order Hamiltonian, a single-reference and multireference dual state, and different excitation operators used to construct the projection manifold. We benchmark all proposed models as well as an a posteriori Linearized Coupled Cluster correction on top of AP1roG against CR-CC(2,3) reference data for reaction energies of several closed-shell molecules that are extrapolated to the basis set limit. Moreover, we test the performance of our new methods for multiple bond breaking processes in the homonuclear N 2 , C 2 , and F 2 dimers as well as the heteronuclear BN, CO, and CN + dimers against MRCI-SD, MRCI-SD+Q, and CR-CC(2,3) reference data. Our numerical results indicate that the best performance is obtained from a Linearized Coupled Cluster correction as well as second-order perturbation theory corrections employing a diagonal and off-diagonal zero-order Hamiltonian and a single-determinant dual state. These dynamic corrections on top of AP1roG provide substantial improvements for binding energies and spectroscopic properties obtained with the AP1roG approach, while allowing us to approach chemical accuracy for reaction energies involving closed-shell species.   10.1021/acs.jctc.6b01134 .

Abstract Virtually all biological processes depend on the interaction between proteins at some point. The correct prediction of biomolecular binding free-energies has many interesting applications in both basic and applied pharmaceutical research. While recent advances in the field of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have proven the feasibility of the calculation of protein\u2013protein binding free energies, the large conformational freedom of proteins and complex free energy landscapes of binding processes make such calculations a difficult task. Moreover, convergence and reversibility of resulting free-energy values remain poorly described. In this work, an easy-to-use, yet robust approach for the calculation of standard-state protein\u2013protein binding free energies using perturbed distance restraints is described. In the binding process the conformations of the proteins were restrained, as suggested earlier. Two approaches to avoid end-state problems upon release of the conformational restraints were compared. The method was evaluated by practical application to a small model complex of ubiquitin and the very flexible ubiquitin-binding domain of human DNA polymerase \u03b9 (UBM2). All computed free energy differences were closely monitored for convergence, and the calculated binding free energies had a mean unsigned deviation of only 1.4 or 2.5 kJ\u00b7mol \u20131 from experimental values. Statistical error estimates were in the order of thermal noise. We conclude that the presented method has promising potential for broad applicability to quantitatively describe protein\u2013protein and various other kinds of complex formation.

Abstract The higher order (HO) correlation beyond the coupled-cluster single double (triple) CCSD(T) level of theory, second-order spin\u2013orbit coupling (SOC), and core\u2013valence (CV) correlation effects on bond length, r e , vibrational frequency, \u03c9 e , and dissociation energy, D e , are studied for a set of 17 lanthanide containing diatomics, including lanthanum, europium, ytterbium, and lutetium oxides and halides. Convergence in the magnitudes of the SOC, CV, and HO corrections with respect to basis set size is examined using a sequence of double, triple, and quadruple-\u03b6 basis sets, with the complete basis set (CBS) limit estimates provided in most cases. The CV effects on D e , r e , and \u03c9 e are calculated to amount up to 1.3 kcal\u00b7mol \u20131 , 0.008 \u00c5, and 5 cm \u20131 , respectively. A detailed analysis of the origin of the CV effect with a particular accounting for various subvalence shells reveals that, generally, the Ln 4d correlation makes a major contribution, although in some instances the lower-lying 4sp shells contribute largely and even more substantially than 4d. The second-order SOC effect evaluated via two-component and four-component relativistic techniques proves to be non-negligible, especially for heavier species, e.g., LaI, in which it is as large as 0.8 kcal\u00b7mol \u20131 in D e , 0.002 \u00c5 in r e , and 1.3 cm \u20131 in \u03c9 e . Higher order correlation effects assessed through the CCSDT(Q) level are mostly less than 0.8 kcal\u00b7mol \u20131 , 0.004 \u00c5, and 5 cm \u20131 ; however, in species with prominence of nondynamical correlation, e.g., EuO, YbF, and LuO, the HO correction can amount to 1.2\u20131.6 kcal\u00b7mol \u20131 , 0.005\u20130.008 \u00c5, and 8\u201330 cm \u20131 in D e , r e , and \u03c9 e , respectively. In general, the [CCSD(T)+CV]/CBS + SOC + HO composite results are in good agreement with the available experimental data, exhibiting a mean absolute deviation of 1.8 kcal\u00b7mol \u20131 in D e , 0.0023 \u00c5 in r e , and 3.5 cm \u20131 in \u03c9 e .

Recently, cesium metal halides (CsMX 3 , M = Pb or Sn; X = I, Br, Cl or mixed halides) as a class of inorganic perovskites showed great promise for PSCs and other optoelectronic devices. However, CsMX 3 -based PSCs usually exhibit lower power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than organic\u2013inorganic hybrid PSCs, due to the unfavorable band gaps. Herein, a novel mixed-Pb/Sn mixed-halide inorganic perovskite, CsPb 0.9 Sn 0.1 IBr 2 , with a suitable band gap of 1.79 eV and an appropriate level of valence band maximum, was prepared in ambient atmosphere without a glovebox. After thoroughly eliminating labile organic components and noble metals, the all-inorganic PSCs based on CsPb 0.9 Sn 0.1 IBr 2 and carbon counter electrodes exhibit a high open-circuit voltage of 1.26 V and a remarkable PCE up to 11.33%, which is record-breaking among the existing CsMX 3 -based PSCs. Moreover, the all-inorganic PSCs show good long-term stability and improved endurance against heat and moisture. This study indicates a feasible way to design inorganic halide perovskites through energy-band engineering for the construction of high-performance all-inorganic PSCs.   10.1021/jacs.7b07949 .

Box 1, 2600 MA Delft, The Netherlands. E-mail: . Abstract Young wines are supersaturated in potassium bitartrate, which induces rather uncontrolled crystallization processes. Delayed crystallization may occur even after bottling of the young wines, which is undesirable because it gives rise to a visual defect in the wine. Colloids such as mannoproteins, metatartaric acid, and carboxymethylcellulose are available on the market and may be added to delay crystallization. It has been a matter of debate whether such hydrocolloids prevent nucleation, growth of crystals, or both. It was the objective of this investigation to study the crystallization event by a new approach using dynamic light scattering and to clarify the mode of action of these hydrocolloids. To achieve this, model solutions and standardized wines were enriched with potassium bitartrate (KHT) to trigger crystallization. In this way, it was possible to distinguish between the influence of the hydrocolloids on nucleation and on crystal growth. It was found that the hydrocolloids do not prevent KHT nucleation. Instead, these compounds delay or even arrest the outgrowth of the crystals to a macroscopic, visual size.

Abstract Phytoprostanes and phytofurans (PhytoPs and PhytoFs, respectively) are nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation products derived from \u03b1-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3), considered biomarkers of oxidative degradation in plant foods. The present work profiled these compounds in white and brown grain flours and rice bran from 14 rice cultivars of the subspecies indica and japonica by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization and triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. For PhytoPs, the average concentrations were higher in rice bran (0.01\u20139.35 ng g \u20131 ) than in white and brown grain flours (0.01\u20131.17 ng g \u20131 ). In addition, the evaluation of rice flours for the occurrence PhytoFs evidenced average values 1.77, 4.22, and 10.30 ng g \u20131 dw in rice bran, brown grain flour, and white grain flour, respectively. A significant correlation was observed between total and individual compounds. The concentrations retrieved suggest rice bran as a valuable source of PhytoPs and PhytoFs that should be considered in further studies on bioavailability and bioactivity of such compounds.

The present study describes the organ-specific chemical composition of the cuticular waxes and the cutin and compares three developmental stages of fruits (green, turning, and black) with the leaf surface. Numerous organ-specific differences, such as the total coverage of cutin monomeric components (1034.4 \u03bcg cm \u20132 and 630.5 \u03bcg cm \u20132 ) and the cuticular waxes (201.6 \u03bcg cm \u20132 and 320.4 \u03bcg cm \u20132 ) among all three fruit stages and leaves, respectively, were detected. Water permeability as the main cuticular function was 5-fold lower in adaxial leaf cuticles (2.1 \u00d7 10 \u20135 m s \u20131 ) in comparison to all three fruit stages (9.5 \u00d7 10 \u20135 m s \u20131 ). The three fruit developmental stages have the same cuticular water permeability. It is hypothesized that a higher weighted average chain length of the acyclic cuticular components leads to a considerably lower permeability of the leaf as compared to the fruit cuticle.

Abstract Photocatalytic chemical synthesis by coupling abiotic photosensitizers to purified enzymes provides an effective way to overcome the low conversion efficiencies of natural photosynthesis while exploiting the high catalytic rates and selectivity of enzymes as renewable, earth-abundant electrocatalysts. However, the selective synthesis of multiple products requires more versatile approaches and should avoid the time-consuming and costly processes of enzyme purification. Here we demonstrate a cell-based strategy supporting light-driven H 2 evolution or the hydrogenation of C\u2550C and C\u2550O bonds in a nonphotosynthetic microorganism. Methylviologen shuttles photoenergized electrons from water-soluble photosensitizers to enzymes that catalyze H 2 evolution and the reduction of fumarate, pyruvate, and CO 2 in Shewanella oneidensis . The predominant reaction is selected by the experimental conditions, and the results allow rational development of cell-based strategies to harness nature\u2019s intrinsic catalytic diversity for selective light-driven synthesis of a wide range of products.

Abstract Amorphous materials are widely used as components of solid catalysts and have been the subject of much applied research. In some instances, their catalytic performance is demonstrably superior to that of their crystalline counterparts, due in part to their greater flexibility. Amorphous or disordered phases can also be generated from crystalline phases under reaction conditions, and thus, ex situ observations of long-range order may provide an incomplete or misleading picture. Until recently, theorists and experimentalists have mostly neglected these important materials in fundamental studies, preferring instead to study \u201cwell-defined\u201d (often crystalline) catalysts that are potentially more tractable and amenable to computational modeling of their structure\u2013activity relationships. The amorphous materials were assumed to be simply nonuniform versions of compositionally similar materials with long-range order, having the same key features at short and medium length scales. In this Perspective, shortcomings of this assumption are discussed, as well as challenges inherent in tackling amorphous catalysts more directly, namely, identifying and describing the active sites (especially under reaction conditions), discerning how subtle structural variations modulate site activity, and building atomically detailed models of amorphous catalysts. Three important classes of amorphous catalytic materials are highlighted to illustrate key issues: amorphous oxides, metal ions atomically dispersed on amorphous supports, and supported metal clusters. Amorphous and disordered silicas, aluminas, and silica\u2013aluminas are discussed in terms of challenges and progress toward identifying how their local structural disorder and surface heterogeneity may impact the behavior of active sites. Promising models of amorphous materials with atomistic detail and increased fidelity to experiment are becoming available. However, for reactions in which small fractions of sites dominate the total activity, computational estimates of the observed kinetics will require statistical sampling methods, even for the most detailed catalyst models. Further developments in in situ and operando characterization techniques and computational modeling will advance our understanding of amorphous catalytic materials and the impact of structural disorder.

Abstract The fabrication of luminescent defects in single-crystal diamond upon Sn implantation and annealing is reported. The relevant spectral features of the optical centers (emission peaks at 593.5, 620.3, 630.7, and 646.7 nm) are attributed to Sn-related defects through the correlation of their photoluminescence (PL) intensity with the implantation fluence. Single Sn-related defects were identified and characterized through the acquisition of their second-order autocorrelation emission functions, by means of Hanbury-Brown and Twiss interferometry. The investigation of their single-photon emission regime as a function of excitation laser power revealed that Sn-related defects are based on three-level systems with a 6 ns radiative decay lifetime. In a fraction of the studied centers, the observation of a blinking PL emission is indicative of the existence of a dark state. Furthermore, absorption dependence on the polarization of the excitation radiation with \u223c45% contrast was measured. This work shed light on the existence of a new optical center associated with a group-IV impurity in diamond, with similar photophysical properties to the already well-known Si\u2013V and Ge\u2013V emitters, thus, providing results of interest from both the fundamental and applicative points of view.

Abstract Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) media disclose the peculiarities of electrodynamics in the limit of infinite wavelength but nonzero frequency for experiments and applications. Theory suggests that wave interaction with obstacles and disturbances dramatically changes in this domain. To investigate the optics of those effects, we fabricated a nanostructured 2D optical ENZ multilayer waveguide that is probed with wavelength-tuned laser light via a nanoscale wave launch configuration. In this experimental framework, we directly optically measure wave propagation and diffraction in a realistic system with the level and scale of imperfection that is typical in nanooptics. As we scan the wavelength from 1.0 to 1.7 \u03bcm, we approach the ENZ regime and observe the interference pattern of a microscale Young\u2019s double slit to steeply diverge. By evaluating multiple diffraction orders we experimentally determine the effective refractive index n eff and its zero-crossing as an intrinsic measured reference, which is in agreement with theoretical predictions. We further verify that the double-slit and specifically placed scattering objects become gradually invisible when approaching the ENZ regime. We also observe that light\u2013matter interaction intensifies toward ENZ and quantify how speckle noise, caused by tiny random imperfections, increasingly dominates the optical response and blue-shifts the cutoff frequency.

Abstract Anthropogenic emissions of the toxic heavy metal mercury (Hg) have substantially increased atmospheric Hg levels during the 20th century compared to preindustrial times. However, on a regional scale, atmospheric Hg concentration or deposition trends vary to such an extent during the industrial period that the consequences of recent Asian emissions on atmospheric Hg levels are still unclear. Here we present a 320 year Hg deposition history for Central Asia, based on a continuous high-resolution ice-core Hg record from the Belukha glacier in the Siberian Altai, covering the time period 1680\u20132001. Hg concentrations and deposition fluxes start rising above background levels at the beginning of the 19th century due to emissions from gold/silver mining and Hg production. A steep increase occurs after the 1940s culminating during the 1970s, at the same time as the maximum Hg use in consumer products in Europe and North America. After a distinct decrease in the 1980s, Hg levels in the 1990s and beginning of the 2000s return to their maximum values, which we attribute to increased Hg emissions from Asia.

Abstract Bioavailability-modifying factors such as soil type and aging have only rarely been considered in assessing toxicity of metal-containing nanoparticles in soil. Here, we examined the toxicity to barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) of CuO nanoparticles (CuO-NPs) relative to CuO bulk particles (CuO-BPs) and Cu acetate (Cu(OAc) 2 ) in six different soils with or without aging. The set up allows identifying whether or not NPs-derived colloidal Cu in soil porewater contributes to toxicity. Ultrafiltration (50 kDa) was performed together with geochemical modeling to determine {Cu 2+ } (free Cu 2+ activity in soil porewater). Based on total soil Cu concentration, toxicity measured with seedling root elongation ranked Cu(OAc) 2 > CuO-NPs > CuO-BPs in freshly spiked soils. The differences in toxicity among the three toxicants became smaller in soils aged for 90 days. When expressing toxicity as {Cu 2+ }, there was no indication that nanoparticulate or colloidal Cu enhanced toxicity. A calibrated bioavailability-based model based on {Cu 2+ } and pH successfully explained ( R 2 = 0.78, n = 215) toxicity of all Cu forms in different soils with and without aging. Our results suggest that toxicity predictions and risk assessment of CuO-NPs can be carried out properly using the bioavailability-based approaches that are used already for their non-nano counterparts in soil.

Abstract Efforts to develop inhibitors, activators, and effectors of biological reactions using small molecule libraries are often hampered by interference compounds, artifacts, and false positives that permeate the pool of initial hits. Here, we report the discovery of a promising initial hit compound targeting the Fanconi anemia ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ube2T and describe its biophysical and biochemical characterization. Analysis of the co-crystal structure led to the identification of a contaminating zinc ion as solely responsible for the observed effects. Zinc binding to the active site cysteine induces a domain swap in Ube2T that leads to cyclic trimerization organized in an open-ended linear assembly. Our study serves as a cautionary tale for screening small molecule libraries and provides insights into the structural plasticity of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes.

Abstract Aryl substituted 1-(\u03b2- d -glucosaminyl)-1,2,3-triazoles as well as C -\u03b2- d -glucosaminyl 1,2,4-triazoles and imidazoles were synthesized and tested as inhibitors against muscle and liver isoforms of glycogen phosphorylase (GP). While the N -\u03b2- d -glucosaminyl 1,2,3-triazoles showed weak or no inhibition, the C -\u03b2- d -glucosaminyl derivatives had potent activity, and the best inhibitor was the 2-(\u03b2- d -glucosaminyl)-4(5)-(2-naphthyl)-imidazole with a K i value of 143 nM against human liver GPa. An X-ray crystallography study of the rabbit muscle GPb inhibitor complexes revealed structural features of the strong binding and offered an explanation for the differences in inhibitory potency between glucosyl and glucosaminyl derivatives and also for the differences between imidazole and 1,2,4-triazole analogues.

Abstract Fragment-based lead discovery has emerged as a leading drug development strategy for novel therapeutic targets. Although fragment-based drug discovery benefits immensely from access to atomic-resolution information, structure-based virtual screening has rarely been used to drive fragment discovery and optimization. Here, molecular docking of 0.3 million fragments to a crystal structure of cancer target MTH1 was performed. Twenty-two predicted fragment ligands, for which analogs could be acquired commercially, were experimentally evaluated. Five fragments inhibited MTH1 with IC 50 values ranging from 6 to 79 \u03bcM. Structure-based optimization guided by predicted binding modes and analogs from commercial chemical libraries yielded nanomolar inhibitors. Subsequently solved crystal structures confirmed binding modes predicted by docking for three scaffolds. Structure-guided exploration of commercial chemical space using molecular docking gives access to fragment libraries that are several orders of magnitude larger than those screened experimentally and can enable efficient optimization of hits to potent leads.

The conversion reaction is important in lithium-ion batteries because it governs the overall battery performance, such as initial Coulombic efficiency, capacity retention, and rate capability. Here, we have demonstrated in situ observation of the complete conversion reaction and agglomeration of nanoparticles (NPs) upon lithiation by using graphene liquid cell transmission electron microscopy. The observation reveals that the Sn NPs are nucleated from the surface of SnO 2 , followed by merging with each other.

Abstract We integrated first-principles calculations and surface characterization techniques to reveal a new molecular adsorption mechanism of antiwear (dialkyl dithiophosphate ester, EAK) and anticorrosion (2,5-bis(ethyldisulfanyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole, DTA) additives on the Cu surface during the rolling process. For direct comparison of modeling and experiments, the Cu(110) surface was used in the model based on the strong (220) preferred orientation observed in the microstructures of the rolled copper foil. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to obtain the adsorption energy, the optimized adsorption structures, and the charge transfer due to adsorption for EAK and DTA on the Cu(110) surface. It was found that the anticorrosion additive, DTA, decomposed and chemically adsorbed on the Cu(110) surface strongly via multiple Cu\u2013N and Cu\u2013S bonds, while the antiwear additive, EAK, adsorbed weakly due to one Cu\u2013O bond. The predicted chemical bonds formation with the Cu surface reasonably agreed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. A new anticorrosion mechanism, due to DTA decomposition and stronger chemisorption than that of EAK, was therefore proposed based on the simulation.

Abstract Application of Li-ion batteries for transportation not only requires long cycling life but also the preservation of the electrochemical performance during the resting period. For certain car usage this resting time could be predominant compared with the cycling activity and is referred to as calendar aging. To understand the aging mechanisms during calendar aging, an extensive post-mortem study was conducted on commercial 16 Ah NMC/graphite pouch cells stored at 5, 25, 45, and 60 \u00b0C. The post-mortem analyses were performed in parallel within three separate laboratories across Europe. They included visual inspection and structural and microstructural analysis along with a combination of analytical techniques to determine accurately the composition of positive (NMC) and negative (graphite) electrodes and the electrolyte. A direct correlation was established between the calendar-aging temperature and the degradation of the cells. The measurements revealed a severe deterioration phenomenon for the electrodes aged at 45 and 60 \u00b0C. These results are explained by the formation of a resistive interface on top of the negative electrodes due to a continuous and heterogeneous growth of a surface layer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements confirm the resistance increase during cell degradation. At high temperatures, this occasionally leads to a Li deposition phenomenon. Nonetheless, we revealed that this degradation process does not affect the bulk structure of the materials but only the surface of the particles.

Abstract Designing a heterojunction semiconductor is an efficient strategy to extend the light response of a photocatalyst to the visible range and thus improve photocatalytic activity. Starting with mesoporous anatase TiO 2 microspheres, mesoporous TiO 2 /g-C 3 N 4 microspheres were prepared via a facile nanocoating procedure, with the porous TiO 2 as the active supporting scaffold and g-C 3 N 4 (3 wt %) as the visible light sensitizer. Heterojunctions formed at the TiO 2 /g-C 3 N 4 interfaces separated photogenerated charges. The TiO 2 surface (64.4 m 2 g \u20131 ) was mostly covered by a photoactive g-C 3 N 4 layer, while the interconnected porous network featured a large pore volume (0.30 cm 3 g \u20131 ) for mass diffusion. The g-C 3 N 4 precursor, cyanamide, a nitrogen-rich molecule, also acted as a nitrogen source to form TiO 2\u2013 x N x . Substitution of N in the TiO 2 lattice triggered a visible light response due to an additional N level above the TiO 2 valence band that resulted in band gap narrowing to 1.5 eV. Compared with mesoporous g-C 3 N 4 , the composite microspheres were 8.5 times more active in degrading phenol under visible light irradiation.

E-mail: . Abstract We found epitaxial growth of needle-like nanosized crystals of methylene blue (MB). The nanosized crystals grew spontaneously along the c -axis of the (110) surface of a TiO 2 single crystal by using the dip-coating method from solution. This epitaxial growth of the nanosized crystals is induced by the bridging oxygen rows align along the crystal c -axis. We also found that the alignment direction could be controlled by rubbing the surface of the substrate prior to dye-loading. The memory of the alignment direction induced by the rubbing treatment was erased by thermal annealing at 620 K. These findings suggest that the nanostructure on the TiO 2 surface plays an important role in the aligned growth of MB nanosized crystals.

Abstract Spherical MoS 2 nanoparticles are fabricated by laser ablation of MoS 2 target in water. The obtained nanoparticles are mostly nearly perfectly spherical in shape with smooth surface, and tens to hundreds of nanometers in diameters. Such spherical MoS 2 nanoparticles are built by concentrically curved {002} planes and show onion-like structure. Further examination has revealed that there exist shrinkage cavities (or voids) in the central part of the MoS 2 nanoparticles or small pores dispersed in the particles and a few tadpole-like long-tailed nanoparticles in the products, indicating the marks of melting and molten liquid droplets\u2019 solidification during laser ablation. A model is thus presented based on laser-induced MoS 2 liquid droplets\u2019 generation and inward {002}-oriented growth via radial solidification, which reveals the growth mechanism of the spherical MoS 2 nanoparticles with onion-like structure. Interestingly, such onion-like structured spherical MoS 2 nanoparticles have exhibited much higher surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect than the MoS 2 nanoplates prepared by conventional methods. This work not only presents the route to the spherical MoS 2 nanoparticles with onion-like structure but also reveals the formation process for the MoS 2 nanoparticles in laser ablation in water.

Abstract The optical properties of structured metal surfaces and nanoparticles can be engineered to influence the fluorescence properties of nearby quantum emitters through the manipulation of the local density of optical states (LDOS). Applying these techniques to F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is appealing but has proven to be a complicated and debated issue. In this paper, surface plasmons modes for a gold nanograting are found to enhance the FRET efficiency between nearby donor and acceptor molecules. Nanogratings support traveling surface plasmon waves with a broad range of wavelengths that follow a dispersion relationship, allowing for increases in the LDOS at targeted portions of the spectra of FRET paired molecules. Nearby excited fluorescent molecules may decay by launching a surface plasmon wave that couples into free-space light, which can be recovered. With this system, we measured the FRET efficiency for different plasmon wavelengths spanning both the donor and acceptor emission spectra. The increase in efficiency was found to be greatest when the surface plasmon modes, and therefore the increase in LDOS, overlapped the acceptor emission spectrum.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ldos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:52:00.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ae8d78215119e4d2d1a7bac8619f421b2c657a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxTtS33H4XhyvkS2XdDIP_rNXciDfmxoOjqLtG7P_sCjSOT8UsdoKEf3aIIRQo.5gY-", "site_full": "pubs.acs.org", "site": "acs.org", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpccck", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "The Journal of Physical Chemistry C: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)", "title": "Visible Emission in Nanocrystalline Rutile: Free Exciton and Water as Probes for Midgap States in Adsorption/Desorption Using \u201cConventional\u201d and Synchronous Luminescence Spectroscopy", "title_full": "Visible Emission in Nanocrystalline Rutile: Free Exciton and Water as Probes for Midgap States in Adsorption/Desorption Using \u201cConventional\u201d and Synchronous Luminescence Spectroscopy", "published": "2017-10-03T18:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/0/jpccck.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcc.7b02540/20171003/images/medium/jp-2017-02540u_0010.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3320, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ae8d78215119e4d2d1a7bac8619f421b2c657a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxTtS33H4XhyvkS2XdDIP_rNXciDfmxoOjqLtG7P_sCjSOT8UsdoKEf3aIIRQo.5gY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alexander Samokhvalov", "published": "2017-10-03T18:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Visible Emission in Nanocrystalline Rutile: Free Exciton and Water as Probes for Midgap States in Adsorption/Desorption Using \u201cConventional\u201d and Synchronous Luminescence Spectroscopy", "text": "  September 21,   *E-mail: . Abstract We studied absorption and emission transitions in the visible range through three distinct electronic midgap states in nanocrystalline rutile TiO 2 using absorption spectroscopy, \u201cconventional\u201d photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, synchronous luminescence spectroscopy for the first time, and complementary methods. We have used free exciton in rutile as an intrinsic midgap state (obtained under the subbandgap photoexcitation at 430 nm) to assign luminescence bands of \u201cgreen light\u201d (ca. 520 nm) and \u201cgreen\u2013yellow light\u201d (ca. 560 nm) at 25 \u00b0C. Further, we utilized water in the vapor phase as spectroscopic probe to learn about origin of visible emission in rutile. Visible photoluminescence is increased by factor \u00d720 after water desorption and reversibly decreased (quenched) upon water adsorption in air under ambient conditions. Preferential quenching of \u201cgreen\u2013yellow light\u201d by adsorbed water occurs versus \u201cgreen light\u201d as originating from surface vs subsurface oxygen vacancies. Water \u201cadsorption/desorption\u201d was repeated three times with adsorbed amount of about three monolayers. While \u201cconventional\u201d PL emission spectra of hydrated rutile (after adsorption of water vapor) at 25 \u00b0C are weak and featureless, synchronous luminescence spectra are well resolved into characteristic peaks due to relaxation through the midgap states. In addition, synchronous luminescence spectroscopy was utilized to determine the energy of free exciton midgap state in rutile and found more reliable than \u201cconventional\u201d PL spectroscopy.

The 3.5 monolayer (ML) Zn films deposited on p-type Si(100) at liquid nitrogen temperature grows in a layer-by-layer fashion. Electronic structure measurements by extreme ultraviolet (XUV) photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that the films are metallic in nature, creating a Schottky barrier at the 3.5 ML Zn/p-Si(100) interface. Utilizing a 35 fs, 800 nm pump pulse at a pump intensity of (2.5\u20136) \u00d7 10 9 W/cm 2 to excite the Si and a time-delayed extreme ultraviolet pulse to probe the Zn, we observed large transient surface photovoltage shifts of 0.3\u20132.2 eV at carrier densities of (1.5\u20134.5) \u00d7 10 20 cm \u20133 . Three shifts are determined the Zn 3d core level, the photoemission onset, and the metallic Fermi level. The photovoltages increase with laser excitation intensity, and the Zn 3d core level exhibits the largest binding energy shifts due to pronounced screening of the core level. The large observed shifts are rationalized on the basis of the energetics of band flattening and carrier accumulation in the metallic layer of the Zn/p-Si(100) heterojunction at high carrier densities. The observed carrier recombination dynamics are biexponential in character, with similar time constants for both the Zn 3d and photoemission onset binding energy shifts. The Zn 3d core level shifts are also found to be sensitive to the electron temperature.

Phys. Chem. C   September 25,   *E-mail: . Abstract Single molecule tunnel junctions (SMTJs) can provide important physical insights into electronic and vibrational phenomena at the molecular scale. However, observations and analysis are typically confined to sufficiently low temperatures as to suppress molecular motion and the resulting stochastic fluctuations in the tunneling current. In this work, we introduce and experimentally validate a methodology whereby a slightly higher temperature (9 K) compared to a typical SMTJ study can be used to induce sparse fluctuations in the inelastic tunneling current and provide the fingerprints of dynamics between the conformational states of the molecule. Two examples of benzene dithiol and cysteine are studied in electromigratively formed W/Au nanowire SMTJs on SiO 2 at 9 K. The second-order transform of the tunneling current reveals the expected vibrational spectra. However, we show that temporal fluctuations can be analyzed using a hidden Markov Model to reveal dynamics assigned to millisecond rearrangements of the molecule, with apparent energy barriers ranging from 35 to 66 meV, consistent with theoretical predictions. The observed transitions are consistent with a model of lateral migration of the thiol-anchored molecules in an asymmetric junction.

Abstract The synthesis and characterization of a suite of melamine dendrons on FDU-12 and pore-expanded FDU-12 are reported. FDU-12, a mesoporous material with cubic arrays of pores possessing cage apertures of approximately 4 nm is not an efficient support for growing dendrons. However, pore-expanded FDU-12 (PE-FDU-12) is an effective support, and it is an efficient substrate for growing dendrons with high free volumes, i.e., bulkier spacer diamines, as compared to SBA-15. Extensive MALDI-MS and solution NMR on the cleaved dendrons validate the other analytical methods used and confirm that the target fragments are formed.

Abstract Alkaline-earth hydrides (AH 2 ) are considered as potential hydrogen storage material. Due to high decomposition temperature and slow sorption kinetics, these hydrides cannot be used for energy storage applications. As fluorine is more electronegative than hydrogen, substitution of hydrogen by fluorine will bring anisotropic bonding interaction, and hence, it may improve the hydrogen storage properties. Hence, the structural stability, electronic structure, and chemical bonding of AH 2 and fluorinated AH 2 (AH 2\u2013 x F x ) are delineated using ab initio calculations. From the calculated enthalpy of formation we have predicted that AH 2\u2013 x F x are relatively more stable than the corresponding pure hydrides. The positive and very low value of enthalpy of mixing for AH 2\u2013 x F x imply that single-phase of AH 2\u2013 x F x may form at reasonable temperatures. The band structure and density of states (DOS) calculations reveal that AH 2\u2013 x F x are insulators. Partial DOS, charge density, electron localization function, and crystal orbital Hamiltonian population analyses conclude that these compounds are governed mainly by ionic bonding. The calculated H site energy increases as the fluorination increases and thus fluorination bring extra stability in the lattice. The present results suggest that hydrogen closer to fluorine can be removed more easily than that far away from fluorine. Hence, the fluorination brings disproportionation in the bonding between the constituents.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:52:02.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af842f70834392fa832a9433f70b1e1fc5e1ec4c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxTtS33H4XhyvkS2XdDIP_rNXciDfmxoOjqLtG7P_sCjSOT8UsdoKEfPh1bVPhuW4I-", "site_full": "pubs.acs.org", "site": "acs.org", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpccck", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "The Journal of Physical Chemistry C: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)", "title": "Nanoscale Chain Alignment and Morphology in All-Polymer Blends Visualized Using 2D Polarization Fluorescence Imaging: Correlation to Power Conversion Efficiencies in Solar Cells", "title_full": "Nanoscale Chain Alignment and Morphology in All-Polymer Blends Visualized Using 2D Polarization Fluorescence Imaging: Correlation to Power Conversion Efficiencies in Solar Cells", "published": "2017-10-03T15:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/0/jpccck.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcc.7b05244/20171002/images/medium/jp-2017-05244f_0006.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3320, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af842f70834392fa832a9433f70b1e1fc5e1ec4c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxTtS33H4XhyvkS2XdDIP_rNXciDfmxoOjqLtG7P_sCjSOT8UsdoKEfPh1bVPhuW4I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Daniela Ta\u0308uber, Yuxi Tian, Yuxin Xia, Olle Ingana\u0308s and Ivan G.

Abstract All-polymer blends are promising materials for organic electronics. Their performance critically depends on the quality of mixing of the electron donor and acceptor polymers and on the local chain organization. We investigated spatially resolved photoluminescence properties of as-prepared and annealed blends of poly[2,3-bis(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-5,8-diyl- alt -thiophene-2,5-diyl] (TQ1) and poly( N , N -bis-2-octyldodecyl-naphtalene-1,4,5,8-bisdicarboximide-2,6-diyl- alt -5,5\u20132,2-bithiophene) (N2200) using two-dimensional polarization imaging (2D POLIM). N2200 is known to aggregate into fiber-like morphologies with a few hundreds of nanometers lateral extensions. Our findings suggest a highly parallel chain organization within individual domains. Comparing blends differing in the batch of the N2200 component, we could relate decreased power conversion efficiencies of the corresponding devices to aggregation of N2200 in tens of micrometer-sized elongated structures. TQ1 showed less sensitivity to preparation conditions. Other than N2200, TQ1 is liquid crystalline, and its side chain structure hinders aggregation. It thus might be feasible to consider similar properties for the design of acceptor polymers as well.

Abstract Exploiting earth-abundant and low-cost photocatalysts for high efficiency photocatalytic water splitting is of profound significance. Herein, we report an improved photocatalytic water splitting activity by P and As substitution at the N-site in the C 2 N monolayer using state-of-the-art hybrid density functional calculations. Our results show that the band gap can be reduced in C 2 N by increasing the concentrations of P and As substitution, and at the same time the obtained band gap value is higher than the free energy of water splitting except for As with concentrations of x = 0.333. This indicates that these new compositions of P/As substituted C 2 N monolayers are thermodynamically suitable to drive hydrogen evolution reaction. The calculated effective mass of charge carriers illustrates that charge transfer to the reactive sites would be easier in the substituted system than the pure C 2 N, and also our results suggest that the recombination rate would be lower in the substituted system, indicating the enhancement in the efficiencies of photocatalytic water splitting. The band edge position with respect to the redox potentials of water shows that P/As substituted C 2 N monolayers are the potential photocatalysts for water splitting than the pristine C 2 N monolayer. From the optical absorption spectra, we found that P/As substituted C 2 N monolayer shows optical absorption extended more into the visible region, indicating enhanced energy harvesting. Our results reflect that the P/As substituted C 2 N monolayer could be the potential visible-light photocatalyst for overall water splitting.

Abstract Controlling the phononic properties of materials provides opportunities for better thermal insulation, reduction of sound noise, and conversion of wasted heat into electricity. Phononic crystals are periodically structured media composed of two or more dissimilar materials offering a unique pathway to control the transmission of phonons, responsible for sound and heat transport. In particular, phononic crystals with cubic network structure possessing complete phononic bandgaps are highly desirable for energy applications but have not been thoroughly investigated, hampering progress in this field. Here we computationally obtained phononic band structures of 16 cubic network structures that could be made by fabrication techniques including block copolymer self-assembly and identified six structures that exhibit complete phononic bandgaps. The champion phononic bandgap structure is the so-called I-WP structure with a bandgap width of 0.41. On the basis of simulation results, design rules to tailor network structures for larger phononic bandgaps are elucidated. We expect that our results will provide guidance to develop novel materials for sonic and thermal devices.

These ACI methods aim to describe multiple electronic states with equal accuracy, including challenging cases like multielectron, charge-transfer, and near-degenerate states. We develop both state-averaged and state-specific approaches to compute excited states whose absolute energy error can be tuned by a user-specified energy error threshold, \u03c3. State-averaged schemes are found to be more efficient in that they obtain all of the states simultaneously in one computation, but they lose some degree of statewise tunability.

Abstract A major stumbling block in the development of high energy density graphene-based supercapacitors has been maintaining high ion-accessible surface area combined with high electrode density. Herein, we develop an ionic liquid (IL)\u2013surfactant microemulsion system that is found to facilitate the spontaneous adsorption of IL-filled micelles onto graphene oxide (GO). This adsorption distributes the IL over all available surface area and provides an aqueous formulation that can be slurry cast onto current collectors, leaving behind a dense nanocomposite film of GO/IL/surfactant. By removing the surfactant and reducing the GO through a low-temperature (360 \u00b0C) heat treatment, the IL plays a dual role of spacer and electrolyte. We study the effect of IL content and operating temperature on the performance, demonstrating a record high gravimetric capacitance (302 F/g at 1 A/g) for 80 wt % IL composites. At 60 wt % IL, combined high capacitance and bulk density (0.76 g/cm 3 ), yields one of the highest volumetric capacitances (218 F/cm 3 , at 1 A/g) ever reported for a high-voltage IL-based supercapacitor. While achieving promising rate performance and cycle-life, the approach also eliminates the long and costly electrolyte imbibition step of cell assembly as the electrolyte is cast directly with the electrode material.

Abstract Self-healing materials that can spontaneously repair damage under mild conditions are desirable in many applications. Significant progress has recently been made in the design of polymer materials capable of healing cracks at the molecular scale using reversible bonds; however, such a self-healing mechanism has rarely been applied to rigid inorganic materials. Here, we demonstrate the self-healing ability of lamellar silica-based thin films formed by self-assembly of silica precursors and quaternary ammonium-type surfactants. Specifically, spontaneous healing of cracks (typically less than 1.5 \u03bcm in width) was achieved under humid conditions even at room temperature. The randomly oriented lamellar structure with thin silica layers is suggested to play an essential role in crack closure and the reformation of siloxane networks on the fracture surface. These findings will lead to the creation of smart self-healing silica-based materials based on reversible siloxane bonds.

Abstract Cellular uptake by macrophages and ensuing clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system stands as a significant biological barrier for nanoparticle therapeutics. While there is a growing body of work investigating the design principles essential for imparting nanomaterials with long-circulating characteristics and macrophage evasion, there is still a widespread need for examining stimuli-responsive systems, particularly well-characterized soft materials, which differ in their physiochemical properties prior to and after an applied stimulus. In this work, we describe the synthesis and formulation of polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) and soluble homopolymers (Ps) encoded with multiple copies of a peptide substrate for proteases. We examined the macrophage cell uptake of these materials, which vary in their peptide charge and conjugation ( via the N- or C-terminus). Following treatment with a model protease, thermolysin, the NPs and Ps undergo changes in their morphology and charge. After proteolysis, zwitterionic NPs showed significant cellular uptake, with the C-terminus NP displaying higher internalization than its N-terminus analogue. Enzyme-cleaved homopolymers generally avoided assembly and uptake, though at higher concentrations, enzyme-cleaved N-terminus homopolymers assembled into discrete cylindrical structures, whereas C-terminus homopolymers remained dispersed. Overall, these studies highlight that maintaining control over NP and polymer design parameters can lead to well-defined biological responses.

Abstract Electrophotorheological (EPR) fluids, whose rheological activity is dually responsive to light and electric fields ( E fields), is formulated by mixing photosensitive spiropyran-decorated silica (SP-sSiO 2 ) nanoparticles with zwitterionic lecithin and mineral oil. A reversible photorheological (PR) activity of the EPR fluid is developed via the binding and releasing mechanism of lecithin and merocyanine (MC, a photoisomerized form of SP) under ultraviolet (UV) and visible (VIS) light applications. Moreover, the EPR fluid exhibits an 8-fold higher electrorheological (ER) performance compared to the SP-sSiO 2 nanoparticle-based ER fluid (without lecithin) under an E field, which is attributed to the enhanced dielectric properties facilitated by the binding of the lecithin and SP molecules. Upon dual application of UV light and an E field, the EPR fluid exhibits high EPR performance ( ca . 115.3 Pa) that far exceeds its separate PR ( ca . 0.8 Pa) and ER ( ca . 57.5 Pa) activities, because of the synergistic contributions of the PR and ER effects through rigid and fully connected fibril-like structures. Consequently, this study offers a strategy on formulation of dual-stimuli responsive smart fluid systems.

Abstract Tremendous strides in experimental capabilities of scanning transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) over the past 30 years made atomically resolved imaging routine. However, consistent integration and use of atomically resolved data with generative models is unavailable, so information on local thermodynamics and other microscopic driving forces encoded in the observed atomic configurations remains hidden. Here, we present a framework based on statistical distance minimization to consistently utilize the information available from atomic configurations obtained from an atomically resolved image and extract meaningful physical interaction parameters. We illustrate the applicability of the framework on an STM image of a FeSe x Te 1\u2013 x superconductor, with the segregation of the chalcogen atoms investigated using a nonideal interacting solid solution model. This universal method makes full use of the microscopic degrees of freedom sampled in an atomically resolved image and can be extended via Bayesian inference toward unbiased model selection with uncertainty quantification.

Abstract MoN 2 and MoS 2 sheets are representatives of two-dimensional transition metal dinitrides and dichalcogenides, respectively. Their similarity in atomic ratios misled people to make an incorrect assumption in previous studies that the former adopts the geometry of the latter. However, compared with S, N is smaller and has fewer valence electrons, and N is more effective in mediating magnetic couplings; therefore, a different geometry and different properties can be expected for the MoN 2 sheet. Here using a global structure search, for the first time we have identified the ground state geometry of this sheet named Tetra-MoN 2 that is much more stable than the H phase proposed previously. Different from the metallic nature of H-MoN 2 , Tetra-MoN 2 is a semiconductor having an indirect band gap of 1.41 eV with a flexible strain tunability.

Abstract Fatigue resistance of hydrogels is critical to their applications in load-bearing sites of soft tissues that are usually subjected to continuous loadings, such as joint cartilage. However, hydrogels usually swell under physiological conditions and exhibit inevitable fatigue during excessive mechanical loadings. Here we show that hydrogels cross-linked by multivalent host\u2013guest interactions can effectively dissipate a large fraction of the loading energy (>50%) under excessive compressions (over 80% strain, 1000 cycles) despite their high water contents (95%) under physiological conditions. No fatigue is observed in such highly swollen hydrogels during continuous cyclic compressions. We demonstrate that such hydrogels can be used as 3D cell carriers for excessive mechanical stimulation of the encapsulated stem cells, making them promising soft biomaterials for tissue engineering.

Abstract Chemical reactions at the solid electrolyte (SE) and Li metal interface form an interphase before electrochemical reactions occur. This study investigates the effects of the chemically formed interphase between Li metal and Li 1.5 Al 0.5 Ge 1.5 (PO 4 ) 3 (LAGP) on cell failures under various experimental conditions. LAGP forms a black interphase by chemically reacting with Li metal. The interphase comprises a stoichiometrically changed LAGP and Li-related oxides and behaves as a mixed ionic and electronic conductor with the electronic conductivity dominating. Thus, upon application of an electrical current to Li metal anode, most of the Li ions can be reduced at the SE side surface of the interphase rather than the Li metal side, causing a local volumetric increase that triggers cracks in the SE. This crack formation process continues the pulverization of SE, leading to a gradual increase in cell resistance. Under cell operating conditions, electrochemical reactions with the chemically formed interphase can lead to the mechanical deterioration of the SE, leading to cell failure. Furthermore, the chemically formed interphase between melted Li and LAGP above 200 \u00b0C induces a rigorous chemical reaction with Li that leads to a thermal runaway. The chemical stability of the SE against Li metal can strongly affect the solid-state cell\u2019s electrical properties, mechanical integrity, and thermal stability.

In this paper, new software-based methodologies were developed for locating multiple leaks in a natural gas pipeline. Two types of multiple leaks, subsequent and simultaneous multiple leaks, from a natural gas pipeline were studied, separately. For both subsequent and simultaneous leaks, case studies with two leak occurrences were demonstrated using MATLAB simulation. For detecting and locating subsequent multiple leaks, an unknown input observer was designed and applied, which was modified from our previous study. New optimization methodology for locating simultaneous multiple leaks was demonstrated. Leak locations were estimated by solving a nonlinear global optimization problem. The global optimization problem contained constraints of partial differential equations, integer, and continuous variables. A new discretization approach was proposed and demonstrated, which required significant less computation effect comparing to conventional global optimization algorithms.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T03:01:09.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "89b00f817432825c12a9b363c3d938f16e2a9737", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxTtS33H4XhyvkS2XdDIP_rNXciDfmxoOjqLtG7P_sCjSD9gmltoV_c93cZ7KiWEZ0-", "site_full": "pubs.acs.org", "site": "acs.org", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/iecred", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)", "title": "Optimal Design and Planning of Glycerol-Based Biorefinery Supply Chains under Uncertainty", "title_full": "Optimal Design and Planning of Glycerol-Based Biorefinery Supply Chains under Uncertainty", "published": "2017-10-03T16:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/iecred/0/iecred.ahead-of-print/acs.iecr.7b02882/20171003/images/medium/ie-2017-02882d_0013.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3320, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "89b00f817432825c12a9b363c3d938f16e2a9737", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxTtS33H4XhyvkS2XdDIP_rNXciDfmxoOjqLtG7P_sCjSD9gmltoV_c93cZ7KiWEZ0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Carina L.

E-mail: . Abstract The optimal design and planning of glycerol-based biorefinery supply chains is critical for the development and implementation of this concept in a sustainable manner. To achieve this, a decision-making framework is proposed in this work, to holistically optimize the design and planning of the glycerol-based biorefinery supply chains under uncertainties. This framework presents a multilayered strategy composed of different steps, and it is strongly based on optimization techniques, detailed economic and environmental assessment, and multiobjective optimization under a stochastic environment. To maximize the business value, the economic objective is measured by the Net Present Value (NPV), whereas the environmental performance is measured by the estimation of a Single Indicator (SI) through the application of LCA methods. As part of the framework, a stochastic multiperiod, multiproduct, and multiechelon mixed integer linear programming problem is proposed based upon a previous model, GlyThink. In the new formulation, market uncertainties are taken into account at the strategic planning level. The robustness of the supply chain structures is analyzed based on statistical data provided by the implementation of the Monte Carlo method, where a deterministic optimization problem is solved for each scenario. Furthermore, the solution of the stochastic multiobjective optimization model points to the Pareto set of trade-off solutions obtained when maximizing the NPV and minimizing environmental consequences. Therefore, the proposed framework ultimately leads to the identification of the optimal design and planning decisions for the development of environmentally conscious biorefinery supply chains. The effectiveness of the presented approach is demonstrated through its application to the realistic case study of the glycerol-based biorefinery in Europe, where the results showed that the optimal solution under market uncertainties is obtained by establishing a multiplant supply chain for the glycerol-based integrated biorefinery, built upon two plant site locations (Germany, France) based on the production of succinic acid and lactic acid.

Abstract A catalysis/membrane filtration system combining a catalytic reaction and a separation process can realize the in situ separation of ultrafine catalysts from the reaction mixture and make the production continuous. In this study, a side-stream catalysis/membrane filtration system was developed for the first time for the continuous liquid-phase hydrogenation of phenol over Pd@CN to produce cyclohexanone. The operating parameters including the reaction and filtration conditions were optimized by balancing their influences on the catalytic and separation properties. It was found that the properties of the side-stream catalysis/membrane filtration system depended strongly on the operating conditions. Continuous phenol hydrogenation over Pd@CN was performed under the optimized operating conditions. A stable operation of 30 h was achieved with both a phenol conversion and a cyclohexanone selectivity of greater than 85%, and the ceramic membrane showed excellent stability.

Abstract We have performed an in-depth study of the chemical bonding in manganese oxide (MnO) and carbodiimide (MnNCN) from correlated spin-polarized density functional calculations. The chemical-bonding data were produced using the LOBSTER package, which has recently been enabled to process PAW-based output from Quantum ESPRESSO. Our results show that the ground states of MnO and MnNCN are similar, namely, antiferromagnetic structures whose axes are the MnO cubic [111] and the MnNCN hexagonal [001] axes, in agreement with experimental results. The results also evidence MnNCN being more covalent than MnO, in harmony with chemical intuition and spectroscopic data. In addition, the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis evidences that adopting the ground-state magnetic structures by MnO and MnNCN makes the cation\u2013anion bonds optimized and annihilates obvious instability issues, that is, the existence of antibonding states in the vicinity of the Fermi level. We also detail the interactions involved in the systems using the recently introduced density-of-energy analysis and by partitioning the total and band-structure energies. While it is trivial that the total energy points toward the true magnetic ground state taken, the COHP integral of the metal\u2013nonmetal bond is also capable of correctly delivering that particular information.

Abstract Group 6 metal oxide fluoride molecules in the form of OMF 2 and OMF (M = Cr, Mo, W) were prepared via the reactions of laser-ablated metal atoms and OF 2 in excess argon. Product identifications were performed by using infrared spectroscopy, 18 OF 2 samples, and electronic structure calculations. Reactions of group 6 metal atoms and OF 2 resulted in the formation of ternary OCrF 2 , OMoF 2 , and OWF 2 molecules with C 2 v symmetry in which the tetravalent metal center is coordinated by one oxygen and two fluorine atoms. Both OCrF 2 and OMoF 2 are computed to possess triplet ground states, and a closed shell singlet is the ground state for OWF 2 . Triatomic OCrF, OMoF, and OWF molecules were also observed during sample deposition. All three molecules were computed to have a bent geometry and quartet ground state. A bonding analysis showed that the OMF 2 molecules have highly ionic M\u2013F bonds. 3 OCrF 2 and 3 OMoF 2 have an M\u2013O double bond composed of a \u03c3 bond and a \u03c0 bond. 1 OWF 2 has an M\u2013O triple bond consisting of a \u03c3 bond, a \u03c0 bond, and a highly delocalized O lone pair forming the other \u03c0 bond. The M\u2013O bonds in the OMF compounds have triple-bond character for all three metals.

Abstract A density functional theory (DFT)-based ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) has been applied to simulate models of single and mixed alkali silicate glasses with two different molar concentrations of alkali oxides. The structural environments and spatial distributions of alkali ions in the 10 simulated models with 20% and 30% of Li, Na, K and equal proportions of Li\u2013Na and Na\u2013K are studied in detail for subtle variations among the models. Quantum mechanical calculations of electronic structures, interatomic bonding, and mechanical and optical properties are carried out for each of the models, and the results are compared with available experimental observation and other simulations. The calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental data. We have used the novel concept of using the total bond order density (TBOD), a quantum mechanical metric, to characterize internal cohesion in these glass models. The mixed alkali effect (MAE) is visible in the bulk mechanical properties but not obvious in other physical properties studied in this paper. We show that Li doping deviates from expected trend due to the much stronger Li\u2013O bonding than those of Na and K doping. The approach used in this study is in contrast with current studies in alkali-doped silicate glasses based only on geometric characterizations.

Abstract In LaMer burst nucleation, the individual nucleation events happen en masse , quasi-simultaneously, and at nearly identical homogeneous conditions. These properties make LaMer burst nucleation important for applications that require monodispersed particles and also for theoretical analyses. Sugimoto and co-workers predicted that the number of nuclei generated during a LaMer burst depends only on the solute supply rate and the growth rate, independent of the nucleation kinetics. Some experiments confirm that solute supply kinetics control the number of nuclei, but flaws in the original theoretical analysis raise questions about the predicted roles of growth and nucleation kinetics. We provide a rigorous analysis of the coupled equations that govern concentrations of nuclei and solutes. Our analysis confirms that the number of nuclei is largely determined by the solute supply and growth rates, but our predicted relationship differs from that of Sugimoto et al. Moreover, we find that additional nucleus size dependent corrections should emerge in systems with slow growth kinetics. Finally, we show how the nucleation kinetics determine the particle size distribution. We suggest that measured particle size distributions might therefore provide ways to test theoretical models of homogeneous nucleation kinetics.

Abstract The products following Cl atom initiated reactions of FC(O)OOC(O)OCH 3 in 50\u2013760 Torr of N 2 at 296 K were investigated using FTIR. Reaction of Cl atoms with methyl fluoroformyl peroxycarbonate proceeds mainly via attack at the methyl group, forming FC(O)OOC(O)OCH 2 \u2022 radicals. Further reaction of this kind of radical with Cl 2 forms three new compounds: FC(O)OOC(O)OCH 2 Cl, FC(O)OOC(O)OCHCl 2 , and FC(O)OOC(O)OCCl 3 , whose existence was characterized experimentally by FTIR spectroscopy assisted by ab initio calculations at the B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) level. Relative rate techniques were used to measure k (Cl+FC(O)OOC(O)OCH3) = (4.0 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10 \u201314 cm 3 molecule \u20131 s \u20131 and k (Cl+FC(O)OOC(O)OCH2Cl) = (3.2 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10 \u201314 cm 3 molecule \u20131 s \u20131 .

Fax: +61 7 33462090 . Phone: +61 7 33462044 . Abstract Tachyplesin-1 (TP1; 1 ) is a cationic \u03b2-hairpin antimicrobial peptide with a membranolytic mechanism of action. While it possesses broad-spectrum, potent antimicrobial activity, 1 is highly hemolytic against mammalian erythrocytes, which precludes it from further development. In this study, we report a template-based approach to investigate the structure\u2013function and structure\u2013toxicity relationships of each amino acid of 1 . We modulated charge and hydrophobicity by residue modification and truncation of the peptide. Antimicrobial activity was then assessed against six key bacterial pathogens and two fungi, with toxicity profiled against mammalian cells. The internal disulfide bridge Cys7-Cys12 of 1 was shown to play an important role in broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against all pathogenic strains tested. Novel peptides based on the progenitor were then designed, including 5 (TP1[F4A]), 12 (TP1[I11A]), and 19 (TP1[C3A,C16A]). These had 26- to 64-fold improved activity/toxicity indices and show promise for further development. Structural studies of 5 (TP1[F4A]) and 12 (TP1[I11A]) identified a conserved \u03b2-hairpin secondary structure motif correlating with their very high stablility in mouse and human plasma. Membrane binding affinity determined by surface plasmon resonance confirmed their selectivity toward bacterial membranes, but the degree of membrane binding did not correlate with the degree of hemolysis, suggesting that other factors may drive toxicity.

Both compounds contain a novel hybrid spin ladder which represents a combination of a 2-leg rectangular ladder and a necklace ladder. They show three successive phase transitions between 40 and 120 K, demonstrating the complex magnetic behaviors induced by their unique ladder topology. Abstract Small single crystals of Sr 2 Fe 3 Ch 2 O 3 (Ch = S, Se) have been synthesized by flux methods, and bulk materials have been obtained by solid state reactions. Both compounds are isostructural to the compound Sr 2 Co 3 S 2 O 3 (space group Pbam ), which contains a novel hybrid spin ladder: a combination of a 2-leg rectangular ladder and a necklace ladder.

Synopsis Ternary oxidovanadium(IV) complexes of curcumin and dipicolylamine (dpa) having boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) pendants were prepared, and their photo-cytotoxicity was studied. The curcumin\u2212dpa complex was structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. The emissive BODIPY complex showed mitochondrial localization. The diiodo-BODIPY complex displayed excellent PDT activity in visible light. The apoptotic cell death resulted from photogenerated 1 O 2 from the BODIPY moiety and \u00b7OH from the curcumin ligand. Curcumin showed significant hydrolytic stability on binding to the VO 2+ moiety. Abstract Ternary oxidovanadium(IV) complexes of curcumin (Hcur), dipicolylamine (dpa) base, and its derivatives having pendant noniodinated and di-iodinated boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) moiety (L 1 and L 2 , respectively), namely, [VO(dpa)(cur)]ClO 4 ( 1 ), [VO(L 1 )(cur)]ClO 4 ( 2 ), and [VO(L 2 )(cur)]ClO 4 ( 3 ) and their chloride salts ( 1a \u2013 3a ) were prepared, characterized, and studied for anticancer activity. The chloride salts were used for biological studies due to their aqueous solubility. Complex 1 was structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The complex has a VO 2+ moiety bound to dpa ligand showing N,N,N-coordination in a facial mode, and curcumin is bound in its mono-anionic enolic form. The V\u2013O(cur) distances are 1.950(18) and 1.977(16) \u00c5, while the V\u2013N bond lengths are 2.090(2), 2.130(2), and 2.290(2) \u00c5. The bond trans to V\u2550O is long due to trans effect. The complexes are stable in a solution phase over a long period of time of 48 h without showing any apparent degradation of the curcumin ligand. The diiodo-BODIPY ligand (L 2 ) or Hcur alone showed limited solution stability in dark. The emissive BODIPY (L 1 ) containing complex 2a showed preferential mitochondrial localization in MCF-7 cells in cellular imaging experiments. The cytotoxicity of the complexes was studied by MTT assay. The BODIPY complex 3a showed excellent photodynamic therapy effect in visible light (400\u2013700 nm) giving IC 50 values of 2\u20136 \u03bcM in HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells, while being less toxic in dark (\u223c100 \u03bcM). The cell death was apoptotic in nature involving reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mechanistic data from pUC19 DNA photocleavage studies revealed photogenerated ROS as primarily 1 O 2 from the BODIPY moiety and \u00b7OH radicals from the curcumin ligand.   10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b01924 .

Photoelectrochemical studies combined with surface characterization techniques show that the hybrid cathode achieves an activity of 17.6 H 2 s \u22121 Co \u22121 , the highest value reported to date for a molecular-modified semiconductor operating at the reversible hydrogen electrode potential under 1-sun illumination. The reported synthetic methodology introduces a useful, yet easily accessible, motif for preparing and studying molecular-modified substrates. Abstract Hybrid materials that link light capture and conversion technologies with the ability to drive reductive chemical transformations are attractive as components in photoelectrosynthetic cells. We show that thin-film polypyridine surface coatings provide a molecular interface to assemble cobalt porphyrin catalysts for hydrogen evolution onto a visible-light-absorbing p-type gallium phosphide semiconductor. Spectroscopic techniques, including grazing angle attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, confirm that the cobalt centers of the porphyrin macrocycles coordinate to pyridyl nitrogen sites of the organic surface coating. The cobalt porphyrin surface concentration and fraction of pyridyl sites coordinated to a cobalt center are quantified using complementary methods of ellipsometry, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In aqueous solutions under simulated solar illumination the modified cathode is photochemically active for hydrogen production, generating the product gas with near-unity Faradaic efficiency at a rate of \u224810 \u03bcL min \u20131 cm \u20132 when studied in a three-electrode configuration and polarized at the equilibrium potential of the H + /H 2 couple. This equates to a photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction activity of 17.6 H 2 molecules s \u20131 Co \u20131 , the highest value reported to date for a molecular-modified semiconductor. Key features of the functionalized photocathode include (1) the relative ease of synthetic preparation made possible by application of an organic surface coating that provides molecular recognition sites for immobilizing the cobalt porphyrin complexes at the semiconductor surface and (2) the use of visible light to drive cathodic fuel-forming reactions in aqueous solutions with no added organic acids or sacrificial chemical reductants.   10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b01509 .

Synopsis X-ray absorption fine structures (XAFS) of the Tb L III edge were measured to explain the difference in the luminescence intensities in perovskite-type AeSnO 3 (Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba) and the enhancement of the luminescence intensities by Mg codoping in CaMO 3 (M = Sn, Zr). The XAFS spectra revealed that not only the local structure or local symmetry of Tb ions but also the presence of Tb 4+ ions largely influence the luminescence intensities in these samples. Abstract The difference in Tb 3+ green luminescence intensities in doped perovskite(ABO 3 )-type alkaline earth stannates, AeSnO 3 (Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba), and the Mg codoping effect on the luminescence intensities in doped CaMO 3 (M = Sn, Zr) were investigated utilizing the X-ray absorption fine structures (XAFS) of the Tb L III absorption edge. It is considered that the local symmetry at A sites is responsible for the different Tb 3+ luminescence intensities in AeSnO 3 (Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba) doped with Tb ions at A sites. However, it was found from the XAFS spectra that some Tb ions are unintentionally stabilized at B sites as Tb 4+ , especially in BaSnO 3 . Not only the central symmetry for Tb 3+ at A sites but also the presence of Tb 4+ at B sites were considered to bring about the absence of Tb 3+ luminescence in doped cubic BaSnO 3 . No obvious changes in the Tb 3+ local structure at A sites were detected between Tb single doped and Tb\u2013Mg codoped CaMO 3 (M = Sn, Zr) from the extended XAFS oscillation, but the trace of Tb 4+ at B sites in the Tb single doped sample was observed in the X-ray absorption near edge structures. It is, therefore, considered that the Tb 3+ luminescence enhancement by Mg codoping is primarily attributed to the charge compensation rather than the changes in the local structure around Tb 3+ at A sites.   10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b02165 .

Deprotection of the carbohydrate was accomplished at the iridium complex and produced complexes that were catalytically more active in acceptorless alcohol and amine oxidation compared to the carbohydrate-protected anaolgues, indicating a beneficial role of the unprotected carbohydrate functional group. Abstract Acetylglucose- and acetylgalactose-functionalized triazolylideneruthenium(II) and -iridium(III) complexes were synthesized and fully characterized. Subsequent carbohydrate deprotection yielded the first examples of glucose- and galactose-functionalized 1,2,3-triazolylideneiridium complexes. Base-free oxidation of alcohols and amines was used to probe the catalytic potential of the metal complexes and the influence of the carbohydrate wingtip group. Generally, the performance of these complexes is higher in amine oxidation than in alcohol oxidation. While the stereochemistry at the carbohydrate C4 position had no marked influence (galactose vs glucose), the ruthenium complexes typically exhibited higher substrate selectivity and product specificity compared to the analogous iridium species. Most noteworthy is the fact that the catalytic performance is significantly enhanced when the carbohydrate functionality is deprotected, suggesting an active role of the carbohydrate substituent in these transformations.   10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b01899 .

Abstract We recently showed that the time-structure-based independent component analysis method from Markov state model literature provided a set of variationally optimal slow collective variables for metadynamics (tICA-metadynamics). In this paper, we extend the methodology toward efficient sampling of related mutants by borrowing ideas from transfer learning methods in machine learning. Our method explicitly assumes that a similar set of slow modes and metastable states is found in both the wild type (baseline) and its mutants. Under this assumption, we describe a few simple techniques using sequence mapping for transferring the slow modes and structural information contained in the wild type simulation to a mutant model for performing enhanced sampling. The resulting simulations can then be reweighted onto the full-phase space using the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio, allowing for thermodynamic comparison against the wild type. We first benchmark our methodology by recapturing alanine dipeptide dynamics across a range of different atomistic force fields, including the polarizable Amoeba force field, after learning a set of slow modes using Amber ff99sb-ILDN. We next extend the method by including structural data from the wild type simulation and apply the technique to recapturing the effects of the GTT mutation on the FIP35 WW domain.

E-mail: . Abstract A wide range of cellular processes initiates upon recognizing and binding of proteins to specific DNA sites. Typically, the recognition process is incredibly fast owing to a complex mechanism that combines different 3D and 1D modes of translocation of the protein. While few studies performed on selected DNA topologies suggested that the DNA topology might alter the balance between these two modes and therefore the target search kinetics, its detailed role in the target search mechanism remains unclear. Here, we present a discrete-state stochastic approach that allows us to incorporate the topological information of DNA molecule explicitly and predict its role during the process when proteins search for their specific binding sites on DNA. Applying the theory to the closed loop and different supercoiled DNA topologies, we find that the target search efficiency of the protein is strongly influenced by the DNA topology. Furthermore, if the topology is such that it promotes juxtaposition of distant DNA sites, the number, position and relative distances between such juxtaposition sites play a crucial role in facilitating the search process by providing additional routes to approach the target site. Our predictions are validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b08199 .

Abstract The ability of aliphatic amines (AAs), namely, tripropylamine (TPrA), trisobutylamine (TisoBuA), and tributylamine (TBuA), to form ion pairs with perchlorate anion (ClO 4 \u2013 ) in biphasic aqueous/dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2 ) mixtures containing ClO 4 \u2013 0.1 M has been demonstrated by GC with flame ionization (FID) and mass detectors (MS) and by NMR measurements. The extraction efficiency of the AAs to the organic phase was modeled by equations that were used to fit the experimental GC data, allowing us to determine values for K P (partition constant of the free AA), K IP (formation constant of the ion pair), and K P IP (partition constant of the ion pair) for TPrA, TisoBuA, and TBuA at 25 \u00b0C. Ion pairs were shown to form in CH 2 Cl 2 also when ClO 4 \u2013 is replaced by other inorganic anions, like NO 3 \u2013 , ClO 3 \u2013 , Cl \u2013 , H 2 PO 4 \u2013 , and IO 3 \u2013 . No ion pairs formed when CH 2 Cl 2 was replaced by n -hexane, suggesting that aliphatic amine ion pairs can form in polar organic solvents but not in nonpolar ones.

However, several studies evidenced that they may also limit fast (\u223cpicosecond\u2013nanosecond, ps\u2013ns) and small-amplitude (\u223c\u00c5) motions of proteins, which govern their stability in freeze-dried sugar mixtures. To determine how they interact with proteins and sugars in glassy matrices and, thereby, modulate their fast dynamics, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of lysozyme/trehalose/glycerol (LTG) and trehalose/glycerol (TG) mixtures at low glycerol and water concentrations. Upon addition of glycerol and/or water, the glass transition temperature, T g , of LTG and TG mixtures decreases, the molecular packing of glasses is improved, and the mean-square displacements (MSDs) of lysozyme and trehalose either decrease or increase, depending on the time scale and on the temperature considered. A detailed analysis of the hydrogen bonds (HBs) formed between species reveals that water and glycerol may antiplasticize the fast dynamics of lysozyme and trehalose by increasing the total number and/or the strength of the HBs they form in glassy matrices.

Abstract Nanoporous proton-transporting media are critical components in fuel cells and other electrochemical devices, yet general molecular design criteria for new materials with enhanced performance remain obscure. Aqueous lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) comprise a platform for detailed studies of the molecular-level features governing proton transport in monodisperse, water-filled nanopores lined with well-defined chemical functionalities. We report new alkylsulfonic acid LLCs that exhibit H + conductivities as high as \u03c3 = 380 mS/cm at 80 \u00b0C, which rival those of more acidic, perfluorinated polymers, thus demonstrating that the acidity of the pore functionality is not the sole determinant of proton transport. Direct experimental comparisons of LLCs with convex and concave nanopores of similar dimensions indicate that H + conductivities therein sensitively depend on the hydration state of the acid functionalities and the pore curvature. These experiments suggest that judicious manipulation of pore curvature provides a new means for optimizing the activities of proton-exchange membranes and nanoporous solid acid catalysts.

The detector is based on a tunable microwave interferometer (MIM) with a vector network analyzer (VNA) for signal measurement and a computer for system control. A microstrip-line-based 0.3 \u03bcL flow cell is built and incorporated into the MIM. With syringe pump injection, the detector is evaluated by measuring a few common chemicals in DI water at multiple frequencies from 0.98 to 7.09 GHz. Less than 30 ng minimum detectable quantity (MDQ) is demonstrated. An algorithm is provided and used to obtain sample dielectric permittivity at each frequency point. When connected to a commercial HPLC system and injected with a 10 \u03bcL aliquot of 10 000 ppm caffeine DI-water solution, the microwave detector yields a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) up to 10 under isocratic and gradient elution operations. The maximum sampling rate is 20 Hz. The measurements show that MIM tuning, aided by a digital tunable attenuator (DTA), can automatically adjust MIM operation to retain detector sensitivity when mobile phase changes. Furthermore, the detector demonstrates a capability to quantify coeluted vitamin E succinate (VES) and vitamin D 3 (VD 3 ).

Abstract Fragile transition metal complex ions such as [Cr(H 2 O) 4 Cl 2 ] + , difficult to be observed by gas-phase spectroscopy, are detected easily with carbon nanotube (CNT)-assisted low-voltage ambient ionization mass spectrometry. Observation of various substituted ions with D 2 O and ROH (R = CH 3 , C 2 H 5 , ...) established the versatility of the technique in detecting diverse species. Ligand substitution occurring in solution was captured by the low-voltage technique. The extreme softness of the technique coupled with nanoscale ion sources enabled the creation of such species. Analysis was extended to other halides as well. The intensity of these fragile ions gradually disappeared at voltages beyond 500 V and are completely absent in standard high-voltage ionization. Detection of inorganic complexes further enhances the scope of low-voltage ionization.

Abstract As well-known, the excessive discharge of heavy-metal mercury not only destroys the ecological environment, bust also leads to severe damage of human health after ingestion via drinking and bioaccumulation of food chains, and mercury ion (Hg 2+ ) is designated as one of most prevalent toxic metal ions in drinking water. Thus, the high-performance monitoring of mercury pollution is necessary. Functional nucleic acids have been widely used as recognition probes in biochemical sensing. In this work, a carbazole derivative, ethyl-4-[3,6-bis(1-methyl-4-vinylpyridium iodine)-9H-carbazol \u22129-yl)] butanoate (EBCB), has been synthesized and found as a target-lighted DNA fluorescent indicator. As a proof-of-concept, Hg 2+ detection was carried out based on EBCB and Hg 2+ -mediated conformation transformation of a designed DNA probe. By comparison with conventional nucleic acid indicators, EBCB held excellent advantages, such as minimal background interference and maximal sensitivity. Outstanding detection capabilities were displayed, especially including simple operation (add-and-read manner), ultrarapidity (30 s), and low detection limit (0.82 nM). Furthermore, based on these advantages, the potential for high-performance screening of mercury antagonists was also demonstrated by the fluorescence change of EBCB. Therefore, we believe that this work is meaningful in pollution monitoring, environment restoration and emergency treatment, and may pave a way to apply EBCB as an ideal signal transducer for development of high-performance sensing strategies.

Abstract In this work, we report a fundamental mechanistic study of the electrochemical oxidative carbonylation of methanol with CO for the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate on metallic electrodes at low overpotentials. For the first time, the reaction was shown to take place on the metallic catalysts without need of oxidized metals or additives. Moreover, in-situ spectroelectrochemical techniques were applied to this electrosynthesis reaction in order to reveal the reaction intermediates and to shed light into the reaction mechanism. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy was used with different electrode materials (Au, Pd, Pt, and Ag) to assess the effect of the electrode material on the reaction and the dependence of products and intermediates on the applied potentials. It was observed that the dimethyl carbonate is only formed when the electrode is able to decompose/oxidize MeOH to form (adsorbed) methoxy groups that can further react with CO to dimethyl carbonate. Furthermore, the electrode needs to adsorb CO not too strongly; otherwise, further reaction will be inhibited because of surface poisoning by CO.   10.1021/jacs.7b08208 .

Although bulk viscosity (macroviscosity) is typically used to predict or interpret radical recombination efficiencies, the work reported here shows that microviscosity is a much better parameter. The use of microviscosity is valid over a range of different solvent system types, including nonpolar, aromatic, polar, and hydrogen bonding solvents. In addition, the relationship of F cP to microviscosity holds for solvent systems containing mixtures of these solvent types. The microviscosities of the solvent systems were straightforwardly determined by measuring the diffusion coefficient of an appropriate probe by NMR DOSY spectroscopy. By using solvent mixtures, selective solvation was shown to not affect the correlation between F cP and microviscosity. In addition, neither solvent polarity nor radical rotation affects the correlation between F cP and the microviscosity.   10.1021/jacs.7b04499 .

In contrast to the well-established roles of 5-methylcytosine for epigenetic regulation of gene expression, the functional roles of N 6 -mA remain elusive. In particular, the impact of N 6 -mA modification of the DNA template on RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription elongation is not known. In this work, using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pol II transcriptional elongation system as a model, we investigated the molecular mechanism of pol II recognition and processing of N 6 -mA sites via both biochemical and structural approaches. We found that N 6 -mA causes site-specific pol II pausing/stalling. Structural analysis revealed that while N 6 -mA can reach the +1 template position, the stability of the N 6 -mA and UTP base pairing is compromised. Taken together, we reveal that the presence of the 6-methyl group on adenine reduces incorporation efficiency and promotes backtracking translocation.

Despite the stability of aromatic rings, bacteria are able to degrade the aromatic compounds into simple metabolites and use them as growth substrates under oxic or even under anoxic conditions. In anaerobic microorganisms, most monocyclic aromatic growth substrates are converted to the central intermediate benzoyl-coenzyme A, which is enzymatically reduced to cyclohexa-1,5-dienoyl-CoA. The strictly anaerobic bacterium Geobacter metallireducens uses the class II benzoyl-CoA reductase complex for this reaction. The catalytic BamB subunit of this complex harbors an active site tungsten-bis-pyranopterin cofactor with the metal being coordinated by five protein/cofactor-derived sulfur atoms and a sixth, so far unknown, ligand. Although BamB has been biochemically and structurally characterized, its mechanism still remains elusive. Here we use continuum electrostatic and QM/MM calculations to model benzoyl-CoA reduction by BamB. We aim to elucidate the identity of the sixth ligand of the active-site tungsten ion together with the interplay of the electron and proton transfer events during the aromatic ring reduction. On the basis of our calculations, we propose that benzoyl-CoA reduction is initiated by a hydrogen atom transfer from a W(IV) species with an aqua ligand, yielding W(V)\u2013[OH \u2013 ] and a substrate radical intermediate. In the next step, a proton-assisted second electron transfer takes place with a conserved active-site histidine serving as the second proton donor. Interestingly, our calculations suggest that the electron for the second reduction step is taken from the pyranopterin cofactors rather than from the tungsten ion. The resulting cationic radical, which is distributed over both pyranopterins, is stabilized by conserved anionic amino acid residues. The stepwise mechanism of the reduction shows similarities to the Birch reduction known from organic chemistry. However, the strict coupling of protons and electrons allows the reaction to proceed under milder conditions.   10.1021/jacs.7b07012 .

Abstract Conspectus Despite the development of medical technology, cancer still remains a great threat to the survival of people all over the world. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a minimally invasive method for selective photothermal ablation of cancer cells without damages to normal cells. Recently, copper chalcogenide semiconductors have emerged as a promising photothermal agent attributed to strong absorbance in the near-infrared (NIR) region and high photothermal conversion efficiency. An earlier study witnessed a rapid increase in their development for cancer therapy, including CuS, Cu 2\u2013 x Se and CuTe nanocrystals. However, a barrier is that the minimum laser power intensity for effective PTT is still significantly higher than the conservative limit for human skin exposure. Improving the photothermal conversion efficiency and reducing the laser power density has become a direction for the development of PTT. Furthermore, in an effort to improve the therapeutic efficacy, many multimode therapeutic nanostuctures have been formulated by integrating the photothermal agents with antitumor drugs, photosensitizers, or radiosensitizers, resulting in a synergistic effect. Various functional materials also have been absorbed, attached, encapsulated, or coated on the photothermal nanostructures, including fluorescence, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, realizing cancer diagnosis, tumor location, site-specific therapy, and evaluation of therapeutic responses via incorporation of diagnosis and treatment. In this Account, we present an overview of the NIR-responsive photothermal semiconductor nanomaterials for cancer theranostics with a focus on their design and functionalization based on our own work. Our group has developed a series of chalcogenides with greatly improved NIR photoabsorption as photothermal agents, allowing laser exposure within regulatory limits. We also investigated the photothermal bioapplications of hypotoxic oxides including WO 3\u2013 x , MoO 3\u2013 x , and RuO 2 , expanding their applications into a new field of photothermal materials. Furthermore, considering a much more enhanced therapeutic effect of multifunctional nanoagents, our group elaborately designed many nanocomposites, such as core\u2013shell nanoparticles of Fe 3 O 4 @Cu 2\u2013 x S and Cu 9 S 5 @mSiO 2 , based on the integration of photothermal agents with contrast agents or other anticancer medicines, achieving cancer theranostic and synergistic treatment. Ternary compound nanocrystals were also prepared with synthetic simplicity for multimodal imaging-guided therapy for cancer. This Account summarizes our past work, including the design and concept, synthesis, and characterization for in vitro and in vivo applications. Then, we analyzed the tendencies of the NIR-responsive photothermal semiconductor nanomaterials for clinical applications, highlighting their prospects and challenges. We believe that the photothermal technology from the NIR-responsive photothermal semiconductor nanomaterials would promote cancer theranostics to result in giant strides forward in the future.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xiaojuan huang", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "guosheng song", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jianghong rao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rujia zou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wenlong zhang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donghua   junqing hu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guoqiang guan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhuang liu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ptt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tsukuba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soochow university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hu   university of science & technology of china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institute for materials science", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donghua university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east china university of science and technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city university of hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of materials science and engineering", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shanghai university of engineering science", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T03:25:57.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c04ea76181092860cdd82f53bf52dd47ca683805", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxTtS33H4XhyvkS2XdDIP_rNXciDfmxoOjqLtG7P_sCjQZF7yTcg2PT30h6jvtlUkD4bRyR5jy6WA--", "site_full": "pubs.acs.org", "site": "acs.org", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jnprdf", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Journal of Natural Products: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)", "title": "Cytotoxic Prenylated Stilbenes Isolated from Macaranga tanarius", "title_full": "Cytotoxic Prenylated Stilbenes Isolated from Macaranga tanarius", "published": "2017-10-03T22:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jnprdf/0/jnprdf.ahead-of-print/acs.jnatprod.7b00409/20171003/images/medium/np-2017-004096_0006.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3320, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c04ea76181092860cdd82f53bf52dd47ca683805", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxTtS33H4XhyvkS2XdDIP_rNXciDfmxoOjqLtG7P_sCjQZF7yTcg2PT30h6jvtlUkD4bRyR5jy6WA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tiphaine Pe\u0301resse, Gwenae\u0308lle Je\u0301ze\u0301quel, Pierre-Marie Allard, Van-Cuong Pham, Doan T.

HMBA is an excellent antimicrobial agent with additional antiaflatoxigenic potency. On the other hand, cinnamaldehyde from cinnamon is a widely employed flavor with significant antiaflatoxigenic activity. We have attempted the enhancement of antiaflatoxigenic and antimicrobial properties of HMBA, cinnamaldehyde, and similar molecules via Schiff base formation accomplished from condensation reaction with amino sugar ( d -glucamine). HMBA derived Schiff bases exhibited commendable antiaflatoxigenic activity at the concentration 0.1 mg/mL resulting in 9.6 \u00b1 1.9% growth of Aspergillus flavus and subsequent 91.4 \u00b1 3.9% reduction of aflatoxin B 1 with respect to control.

Abstract An electrochemical sensor using ultralight and porous copper\u2013nitrogen-doped graphene (CuNRGO) nanocomposite as the electrocatalyst has been constructed to simultaneously determine DNA bases such as guanine (G) and cytosine (C), adenine (A), and thymine (T). The nanocomposite is synthesized by thermally annealing an ice-templated structure of graphene oxide (GO) and Cu(phen) 2 . Because of the unique structure and the presence of Cu 2+ -N active sites, the CuNRGO exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of free DNA bases. After optimizing the experimental conditions, the CuNRGO-based electrochemical sensor shows good linear responses for the G, A, T, and C bases in the concentration ranges of 0.132\u20136.62 \u03bcM, 0.37\u20135.18 \u03bcM, 198.2\u20135551 \u03bcM, and 270.0\u20131575 \u03bcM, respectively. The results demonstrate that CuNRGO is a promising electrocatalyst for electrochemical sensing devices.

Abstract Sample preparation is the most common bottleneck in the analysis and processing of forensic evidence. Time-consuming steps in many forensic tests involve complex separations, such as liquid and gas chromatography or various types of extraction techniques, typically coupled with mass spectrometry (e.g., LC-MS). Ambient ionization ameliorates these slow steps by reducing or even eliminating sample preparation. While some ambient ionization techniques have been adopted by the forensic community, there is significant resistance to discarding chromatography as most forensic analyses require both an identification and a confirmation technique. Here, we describe the use of a paper substrate, the surface of which has been inkjet printed with silver nanoparticles, for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The same substrate can also act as the paper substrate for paper spray mass spectrometry. The coupling of SERS and paper spray ionization creates a quick, forensically feasible combination.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "sers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T03:37:40.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "543fb37a665e4171882f8029a3feb2298e886ba6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxTtS33H4XhyvkS2XdDIP_rNXciDfmxoOjqLtG7P_sCjSYBUS8xkpTnCuzWc6LbaHVJEVty5UsHgA--", "site_full": "pubs.acs.org", "site": "acs.org", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/ancham/", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Analytical Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)", "title": "Development of a Quenchbody for the Detection and Imaging of the Cancer-Related Tight-Junction-Associated Membrane Protein Claudin", "title_full": "Development of a Quenchbody for the Detection and Imaging of the Cancer-Related Tight-Junction-Associated Membrane Protein Claudin", "published": "2017-10-03T22:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/ancham/0/ancham.ahead-of-print/acs.analchem.7b02047/20171003/images/medium/ac-2017-02047g_0006.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3320, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "543fb37a665e4171882f8029a3feb2298e886ba6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxTtS33H4XhyvkS2XdDIP_rNXciDfmxoOjqLtG7P_sCjSYBUS8xkpTnCuzWc6LbaHVJEVty5UsHgA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hee-Jin Jeong, Takuya Kawamura, Manami Iida, Yumi Kawahigashi, Mutsumi Takigawa, Yuki Ohmuro-Matsuyama, Chan-I Chung, Jinhua Dong, Masuo Kondoh and Hiroshi Ueda", "published": "2017-10-03T22:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Development of a Quenchbody for the Detection and Imaging of the Cancer-Related Tight-Junction-Associated Membrane Protein Claudin", "text": "  October 3,   *Tel/Fax: +81-45-924-5248 . E-mail: (H.U.). Abstract Claudins (CLs) are membrane proteins found in tight junctions and play a major role in establishing the intercellular barrier. However, some CLs are abnormally overexpressed on tumor cells and are valid clinical biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. Here, we constructed antibody Fab fragment-based Quenchbodies (Q-bodies) as effective and reliable fluorescent sensors for detecting and visualizing CLs on live tumor cells. The variable region genes for anti-CL1 and anti-CL4 antibodies were used to express recombinant Fab fragments, and clones recognizing CL4 with high affinity were selected for making Q-bodies. When two fluorescent dyes were conjugated to the N-terminal tags attached to the Fab, the fluorescent signal was significantly increased after adding nanomolar-levels of purified CL4. Moreover, addition of the Q-body to CL4-expressing cells including CL4-positive cancer cells led to a clear fluorescence signal with low background, even without washing steps. Our findings suggested that such Q-bodies would serve as a potent tool for specifically illuminating membrane targets expressed on cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo .

Synopsis An aminated stereotriad [( tert -butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-4-ethynyl-4-(1-fluorohexyl)-1,2,3-oxathiazocane-2,2-dione ( 1 ) undergoes a second-order phase transition, while [( tert -butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-4-ethenyl-4-(1-fluorohexyl)-1,2,3-oxathiazocane-2,2-dione ( 2 ) remains stable. The transformation was linked to the partial ordering of the positional disorder of the high temperature phase, which yields a low temperature phase with Z \u2032 = 12. In situ powder X-ray diffraction studies reveal amorphization during the transition and a potential for a new phase below 100 K. Abstract A structural study of the complex aminated stereotriads [( tert -butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-4-ethynyl-4-(1-fluorohexyl)-1,2,3-oxathiazocane-2,2-dione ( 1 ) and its reduced analogue [( tert -butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-4-ethenyl-4-(1-fluorohexyl)-1,2,3-oxathiazocane-2,2-dione ( 2 ) revealed a k 12-type second-order phase transition in 1 and phase stability of 2 over the temperature range 100\u2013298 K. The observed phase change in 1 has been linked to the partial ordering of the extensive positional disorder of the high temperature phase upon cooling as revealed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The ordering breaks the translational symmetry, introduces differences in the molecular volumes of the packed species, and results in a low-temperature crystal structure with Z \u2032 = 12. The in situ powder X-ray diffraction studies suggest that the transition occurs between 237 and 180 K upon cooling, but complete amorphization in the range of 244\u2013274 K during heating complicated the assignment of the transition temperature. The observed loss of crystallinity has been linked to the phase transition and implies that the loss of long-range order is due to the crystallites undergoing the transformation independently from one another.

Synopsis Arginine, glycine, aspartic, and glutamic acid all display favorable free energies of binding on hydrous and anhydrous amorphous calcium carbonate. These surfaces display an increase mobility of the ions at the interface with the solution, allowing these to remodel around the incoming molecule. Results analyzing the effect of the interface between amorphous calcium carbonate and the solution are also presented. Abstract Amorphous calcium carbonate is often the first phase to precipitate from solution during the mineralization of calcium carbonate, before the formation of one of the crystalline polymorphs. In vivo , this phase is believed to be essential for the manufacture of minerals displaying nonequilibrium morphologies. The precipitation of this, usually transient, phase and its subsequent transformation into one of the crystalline polymorphs can be controlled by organic molecules. Here, we present a series of molecular dynamics simulations that explore the amorphous calcium carbonate\u2013water interface, the attachment of amino acids onto both hydrous and anhydrous amorphous calcium carbonate, and their effect on the surface. The results show that surface ions have a different coordination number distribution from bulk ions and can diffuse up to two orders of magnitude faster than their bulk counterparts, suggesting that crystallization is much more likely to occur in this region. All the amino acids investigated bind to the amorphous calcium carbonate surfaces. However, acidic amino acids have a clear preference for the surface of amorphous CaCO 3 \u00b7H 2 O. The favored mode of interaction of the amino acids is through amine and/or guanidine moieties. The important ramifications of the results for our understanding of protein\u2013mineral interactions are discussed.

The Termination of Acrylate Radicals in ATRP", "text": "  3,   *(R.P.) E-mail: ., *(K.M.) E-mail: . Abstract The termination of acrylate radicals in atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) can involve either conventional bimolecular radical termination (RT) or catalytic radical termination (CRT). These processes were investigated using a poly(methyl acrylate)\u2013Br macroinitiator under different initial conditions tuned to change the RT/CRT ratio. The polymers, obtained from alkyl halide chain-end activation by [Cu I (L)] + (L = tris[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine (Me 6 TREN), tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA), or tris(3,5-dimethyl-4-methoxy-2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA* 3 )) in the absence of monomer, were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). RT-promoting conditions resulted in the increase of a shoulder with double molecular weight (MW) relative to the macroinitiator distribution, indicating that RT occurred predominantly via radical combination. Conversely, when CRT was promoted, the macroinitiator distribution did not shift, indicating a disproportionation-like pathway. The termination reactions for the TPMA system were further analyzed via PREDICI simulations, which showed the significant impact of midchain radicals, arising from backbiting, on the overall termination profile. In all cases, CRT and cross-termination between secondary chain-end and tertiary midchain radicals contributed the most to the overall amount of terminated chains.

Abstract Aliphatic poly(H-phosphonate)s were obtained by polyesterification of dimethyl H-phosphonate with bio-based long-chain diols. Nonadecane-1,19-diol, tricosane-1,23-diol, and octatetracontane-1,48-diol with dimethyl H-phosphonate yield the corresponding polyphosphoesters ( PPE19H , PPE23H , and PPE48H ) with molecular weights ( M n ) up to 4.3 \u00d7 10 4 g mol \u20131 . Postfunctionalization of these polymers via Hirao cross-coupling yields the selectively functionalized poly(H-phosphonate)s PPE19Ph , PPE23Ph , and PPE48Ph . DSC analysis revealed significantly enhanced crystallinities and melting points (up to T m = 110 \u00b0C) with increasing methylene sequence lengths. Hydrolytic degradation of polymer powder of poly-(H-phosphonate) occurred up to 95% in 2 days. The degradation rates decreased with increasing methylene sequence length. After postfunctionalization, degradation occurred only to a minimal extent over 3 months in basic and in acidic media.
