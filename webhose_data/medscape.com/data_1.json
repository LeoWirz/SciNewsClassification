Similar response rates were seen across three treatments cycles with Botox Cosmetic. \n\"As a physician, I've been using Botox Cosmetic since it was FDA approved in 2002, but for years my patients have also inquired about how to treat forehead lines. With this latest indication for Botox Cosmetic, I have an FDA-approved product I already know and trust, that can improve the appearance of the forehead,\" Steven Fagien, MD, an oculoplastic surgeon in Boca Raton, Florida, and lead clinical trial investigator, said in the release. \nBotox Cosmetic has a boxed warning saying the effects of the botulinum toxin may spread from the area of injection to other areas of the body, causing symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects. Those symptoms include swallowing and breathing difficulties that can be life-threatening. \nFor more news, join us on Facebook and Twitter Cite this article: FDA OKs Botox for Forehead Lines, Its Third Facial Indication - Medscape - Oct 03, 2017.

Topol", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Leading Science Journalist Carl Zimmer on His Genome", "text": "Download Slides A Journalist Takes On the Beat of Life \nEric J. Topol, MD: Hello. I'm Eric Topol, editor-in-chief of Medscape. It's a privilege today to be visiting with Carl Zimmer, one of the most accomplished journalists in science and medicine. We're going to explore some of his work and thoughts. Welcome, Carl. \nCarl Zimmer: My pleasure. \nDr Topol: You were at Yale for your English degree. Then, somehow, you took on the beat of life. How did that happen? \nMr Zimmer: I had always been interested in science, and biology in particular. I didn't really put two and two together. I wanted to be a writer in high school; I wrote for my school newspaper, and that was the idea I had going to college. I took science classes on the side, just because I enjoyed them, and that should have been a clue. It took me a while to figure it out. I got a job as an assistant copy editor at a science magazine\u2014 Discover Magazine \u2014a couple of years out of college. I was reading these stories and saying, \"Wow, this is actually really interesting.\" They let me write a few tiny stories and I really enjoyed that. That was it. I stayed there for 10 years before going out on my own. \nDr Topol: It's an extraordinary jump. You went from that post to becoming a multi-award-winning journalist\u2014from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Guggenheim Fellowship, the National Academy of Sciences, the Steven Jay Gould Prize\u2014there are so many. What's your secret? What do you do when you put together these pieces that separates you from others? \nMr Zimmer: I don't know; I think somebody else would need to judge that, as a reader. All I'm trying to do is tell stories about science, particularly about life. I see that as a very broad portfolio. I recently wrote an article about the oldest fossils of life on Earth, and I'm writing about genome sequencing this week. I see all of that as being part of trying to understand what life is and how we fit into it. \nDr Topol: Well, somehow that has become very popular. You work with Matter, the column in the New York Times , and for STAT News. Are those the two main venues that you write for these days? \nMr Zimmer: For the past couple of years, yes. I write a column for the New York Times once a week, and I'm a contributor and national correspondent for STAT. Every month I do things for them. I balance this with other magazines, like National Geographic , and books as well. As a writer, you're always trying to balance different projects to figure out how much you can handle without overloading. \nDr Topol: I neglected to mention that you've written 12 books. Do you have another one cooking right now? \nMr Zimmer: Yes. I'm writing a book about heredity. \nDr Topol: Well, that's apropos to the genomic medicine story. \nMr Zimmer: Absolutely. Writing About What Matters \nDr Topol: That's great. Let's go back. For Matter, as a column, do you pick the stories or are they assigned to you? How does it work? \nMr Zimmer: I prefer to write about things that I pick\u2014topics that really excite me. Sometimes people will say, \"Would you mind writing about this?\" but if my heart is not in it and if I don't think it's a particularly good study or subject, I get very resentful and cranky, and it comes through in the article. I look for stories that really excite me. I can't wait to get to work in the morning and get at that story. I look around and I'm constantly trying to pull stories and ideas from meetings, or I'm looking at what is coming up in journals, or just getting on the phone with scientists and asking what has just come out that has really excited them. It's impossible to evaluate everything in bio-medicine; it's insane how much is coming out. You need ways to navigate through that world. \nDr Topol: On the concept of being quite prolific, there isn't a week that you don't have an article in the Times or elsewhere. How do you balance it all? \nMr Zimmer: Scientists and doctors sometimes ask me this question. And I say, \"Well, you have to remember that I don't have a lab. I don't do experiments, I don't teach full time, I don't have patients; I write.\" That's what I do, and I like to do it. People will sometimes say, \"Wow, you write a lot. How do you do that? I hate it.\" I say, \"Well, I start by not hating it, and there's nothing I like better than doing research, talking with people, getting notes together, and figuring out how to tell a story. I enjoy it. I love it.\" \nDr Topol: You are also prolific on Twitter, which perhaps is also a source. I get a lot of my news from you, actually. I keep up with the world outside of science\u2014politics and what's going on with all the turmoil in our country\u2014through you. How do you do that? You could easily get distracted from the focus of the life beat by trying to figure out what's going to happen to this country of ours. \nMr Zimmer: Twitter and other kinds of social media are, to me as a journalist, fascinating in how they channel information and how news flows through them. You can build Twitter into something that really lets you know about things in a way that complements traditional journalism. It's very hard to keep up with all of the news in politics. There are a few political journalists who I really admire\u2014they're on Twitter and they're very careful about the information they provide. That guides me to the things that I have time to read. I like to perform that service for people. \nScience and politics have always been intertwined, and people who claim that there is no politics in science are fooling themselves. It's always been that way. Right now, a lot of people in the scientific community are becoming keenly aware of just how much politics and science can intersect. Sometimes people say, \"Why don't you stick to the science?\" I say, \"Well, let's see if your research is supported in a few months by the government; we'll find out how you feel about it then.\" \nDr Topol: Does it distract you from your focus? \nMr Zimmer: My wife gets that sense; she'll walk into my office and see a big TweetDeck window on my big screen. She'll say, \"How is that book coming?\" It's a nice distraction from working on big projects\u2014these little chunks of information. I like it, and who knows how long Twitter will stay in business. They're not as big as Facebook or Snapchat, so we'll see, but I'm enjoying it for now. A Peculiar Genomic Journey \nDr Topol: Here at the Future of Genomic Medicine, you gave a pretty hilarious talk yesterday. It was about you having your genome sequenced. Can you summarize what that experience was like? \nMr Zimmer: It was a very peculiar experience, because I have written about genomics for 20 years\u2014even before genomes were being sequenced. I got an opportunity to go to a meeting where you could have your genome sequenced as part of the experience, and clinical geneticists would look at it and so on. It was very exciting. It was really built up, like, \"Oh, I'm going to discover myself.\" I got a clinical report that said, basically, \"You have no disease-causing variants; goodbye.\" And that was it. \nDr Topol: That's worth a few thousand or so. \nMr Zimmer: Exactly. At least I got STAT to pay for it. I was a little worried, because I thought they were going to be a little annoyed that they paid for my genome, and what do I have to say about it? It's a non-thing, like going to the doctor's office when you aren't feeling well and you want them to tell you that you have got some exotic serious illness. If they tell you to just go to sleep for a couple days and you'll be better, you almost feel annoyed. I wanted to find out something. A boring genome is a good genome. I knew that I wasn't going to let things stop there. I needed to get my hands on the raw data. I wanted to write a piece for STAT about it. \nGetting data, as you have often said, can be a big challenge, and I didn't really appreciate just how much of a challenge it is to be able to get your hands on a hard drive with the raw data of the reads of your genome. It took me months, actually, and finding all of the little tricks that I wrote about in STAT. I would talk to scientists who study the human genome and are curious to look at their own genomes to see how they fit into the scope of humanity, but they can't figure out how to do it. They'd have to be part of a research study, but then they would have to have the research study give them their genome under certain rules. You can't just get it. Some of these new genomics companies that are offering custom genome sequencing are not offering the raw data either. Nobody wants to give you the data. I give people the benefit of the doubt and understand that they are dealing with a very tricky landscape of regulation, and they've seen what happened to 23andMe. They're going to play it safe. I get that, but it leaves us in this kind of absurd situation. A Bald, Powerful Warrior? \nDr Topol: It's crazy. It's your DNA; it should be yours. Hiding behind regulations is crazy. You did a pretty serious hunt and went to various labs and got your information, and then you went beyond that with the warrior gene. Can you tell us about the other things that you found out? \nMr Zimmer: I wanted to see how scientists study genomes, so I said, \"Here's mine; let's do it.\" It was really fascinating to see how bioinformatics work. How you take all of this raw data\u2014much of which is wrong\u2014and assemble it into a sequence that you can trust and analyze. I ended up working with a couple dozen scientists, and everybody involved just said that there was a little bit of art to this science. I went to one group and they looked at how many of these variants I had\u2014how many SNPs I had compared with the reference genome. One group said about 3.5 million. They could look at them and say things about them. \nI went to another group and they said, \"We have calculated your SNPs and you have 3.9 million SNPs; isn't that interesting?\" It was very awkward. The other group told me that I have 3.5 million\u2014that's 400,000 fewer. There is no way that they could both be right. It felt very awkward to say that to him because he had worked really hard with all of his students on this. He started to explain to me how different approaches to sequencing a genome will give you different results. Even just using the same method on the same genome sequence can sometimes leave you with different results. That's just where we are. \nDr Topol: I thought it was appropriate that you titled your talk the \"Library of Babel.\" Then you brought in the humor of looking for these crazy genes that have absolutely no basis. \nMr Zimmer: A pretty bad movie, called Assassin's Creed came out, and a genetics testing company had a tie-in offer in which they would sequence your DNA, typically for genealogy, but they threw in a warrior gene test. Do you have the warrior gene? Some research 20 years ago found that one variant seemed to be elevated in some people who showed aggression, so people spun this up into a big story\u2014that if you have this variant, you are a warrior. They call it the warrior gene. Google \"warrior gene.\" It's amazing. \nDr Topol: Amazing\u2014and you paid $99 for that? I have the warrior gene, which is ridiculous. I have also been told I have a gene that makes me prone to male pattern baldness. \nMr Zimmer: It was $89. I paid for that myself because it was so ridiculous; I wasn't going to ask anybody to pay for that. I have the warrior gene, which is ridiculous. I have also been told I have a gene that makes me prone to male pattern baldness. \nDr Topol: It doesn't look like that one had penetrance. \nMr Zimmer: It also says I have incredible muscular power. Anybody who knows me knows that's a lie. I'm not a bald, powerful warrior; that isn't me. \nDr Topol: This exemplifies that when healthy people have their genome sequenced, they should at this point not expect too much, and they might want to save their money until the price drops and it's more informative. When hundreds of millions of people are sequenced, we will know a lot more. \nMr Zimmer: People are being flooded with advertising. \nDr Topol: I know. A lot of these companies that are direct-to-consumer have no legitimacy; it's a real problem. Contributing to STAT News \nDr Topol: Besides writing for the New York Times , STAT News is an up-and-coming source for biomedical news; it has actually taken the world by storm in some respects. Can you tell us about how that all came together? In only a year and a half, it seems to come out with nuggets every day. \nMr Zimmer: It came out of the blue for me as well. I got a call from someone I worked with in the past and he said, \"I am involved in this new project called STAT; we are going to be unveiling it in a few months and we want to talk to you about maybe getting involved.\" It was the brainchild of John Henry, the owner of the Boston Globe. He looked around the Boston area and saw all of this amazing stuff happening in biotechnology and medicine, and felt that things were not being reported enough. There was just so much opportunity. He decided that he was going to launch a publication and he was not going to just hire a few interns to steal copy from other people. \nHe hired Rick Berke, who had been at the New York Times a long time, and then at Politico . Rick was building this team of great journalists\u2014really seasoned people like Sharon Begley and Helen Branswell, and also young and up-and-coming people. The mission was to bring tough, insightful, and also sometimes fun journalism to this world, and to take advantage of being a website as opposed to a paper or journal like the Boston Globe . I have been doing a video series. They have lots of animations, and they do all sorts of things. They are very active in social media and so on. They've been breaking big stories and really holding people to task. There are a lot of serious problems in our medical system, in addition to all of the great, promising research. \nDr Topol: They were the first, or one of the very first, to write about the CRISPR patent award. At the same time, the Wall Street Journal coverage has collapsed. They used to have a big Tuesday Personal Journal, and people like Ron Winslow and many others are no longer at the Wall Street Journal . They were one of the go-to publications and they just abandoned it, essentially. They have very little dedicated coverage, so it's great that there is a STAT News. Did She Just Call Journalists Parasites? \nDr Topol: There's a tapeworm species named after you. How did that happen? \nMr Zimmer: I wrote a book about parasites called Parasite Rex . The thrust of the book is that parasites as a life form have been given a bad rap. They're just considered degenerate things that you don't need to think about, when in fact parasites have basically won the game. There are more species of parasites by far than any other form of life, and they take all sorts of crazy bizarre forms. They push life to its limits. Parasites can go from one host to another, among four or five different species, and transform themselves into radically different forms along the way and manipulate their behavior. They're amazing. I wrote this book, and a few people have gotten in touch with me and said that they had read the book and that influenced them in terms of their career choice. One of these people read the book in college and said, \"Oh, there are actually grown-ups who study parasites?\" She became a parasitologist. As part of her PhD project, she had several species of tapeworms from a giant shark-like fish caught off the coast of Indonesia, and there were new species. She named one Acanthobothrium zimmeri for me. \nDr Topol: That's cool; it's a great story. In some ways, it correlates with this amazing journey you have been on where you start off with a background in English and then you become one of the leading science writers of our era. It's fantastic to have the chance to visit with you, Carl, and to learn about the things that you're doing. We know that you're going to keep doing them, and we are looking forward to Heredity . When do you expect that to come out? \nMr Zimmer: The plan is for that to come out in the fall of 2018. \nDr Topol: That's terrific. We look forward to that. Thank you very much for joining us in this conversation with Carl Zimmer, and we look forward to bringing you more of some of the most interesting people in biomedicine. Thank you. \nFollow @EricTopol and @carlzimmer on Twitter \nMedscape \u00a9 2017 WebMD, LLC Any views expressed above are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect the views of WebMD or Medscape.

Log out Cancel News > Reuters Health Information Americans Want Required Food Labels Even if They Don't Read Them By Chris Prentice and Chris Kahn October 03, 2017 \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A majority of Americans want the U.S. government to require nutrition labels on food packaging, including people who do not read them, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released as the Trump administration delays tougher new requirements. \nThe government has delayed the introduction of mandatory labeling of sugars added to packaged food and use of genetically-engineered ingredients, marking a change from the Obama administration and a victory for food companies which lobbied against them as too costly and confusing for consumers. \nOn Friday, the Food and Drug Administration proposed giving manufacturers an extra 1-1/2 years to comply with new nutrition facts label requirements, drawing criticism from nutritionists. \nThe results of the poll, released on Monday, underscore that transparency is key for consumers, a fact that is becoming more apparent to food manufacturers. \nEighty-four percent of adults agreed that \"the government should require nutrition information labels on all packaged food sold in grocery stores\" and 64% wanted similar requirements for restaurants, according to the poll. \nMost people wanted those labels even though relatively few said they read them. Only 13% said they \"always\" read the nutrition facts when deciding to buy a product. \nMarsha Klemundt, a 67-year-old poll respondent, said she had little interest in learning more about nutrition when she shops at grocery stores or eats at restaurants. But she added that it felt good to know the government is requiring them to track what they put into food. \n\"We should know what we're buying,\" Klemundt said. \nPoll respondents who were curious about nutrition information were mostly interested in how it could affect their waistlines. Sixty percent or more said they wanted to know about sugar, calories, salt and fat content in packaged food. \nFor some, it's a matter of trying to follow a doctor's orders, including Republicans who say they understand that other issues are a bigger priority for President Donald Trump. \nThe delay is a concern, said Ronald Lessard, 74, of Louisiana, who noted that he watches his intake of added sugars. \"If you don't know it's in there, you can't cut down.\" \nLess than half of those surveyed said they would be willing to pay more for foods that are organic, grass-fed or contain no added sugars or genetically-engineered ingredients. The item the majority of Americans would consider paying more for is locally grown food, at 57%. \nThe poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States from July 8 to July 17. It included responses from 3,024 adults and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points. \nReuters Health Information \u00a9 2017 Cite this article: Americans Want Required Food Labels Even if They Don't Read Them - Medscape - Oct 02, 2017.

Is Nebulized Hypertonic Saline More Effective for Bronchiolitis? Hypertonic Versus Normal Saline Nebulizer Treatments \nThe goal of a recent study [ 1 ] was to evaluate whether nebulized hypertonic saline (3%) was more beneficial than nebulized normal saline (0.9%) in the treatment of infants presenting to the emergency department (ED) with bronchiolitis. This randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in 24 pediatric EDs in France from October 2012 through April 2014, covering two bronchiolitis seasons. \nThe infants were 6 weeks to 12 months old, and all were experiencing their first episode of bronchiolitis. Infants were excluded for prematurity or any other chronic medical condition as well as if they were admitted to the intensive care unit from the ED. Both groups received two nebulization treatments after presentation, with each treatment lasting 20 minutes. The treatments were given 20 minutes apart. The nebulizer treatments were delivered by facemask and with oxygen flow. The treatment teams were masked to the intervention being provided. \nI admit, it\u2019s crazy to think that we\u2019ve made little improvement in the treatment of bronchiolitis, at least from a true therapeutic standpoint, over 25 years of practice. \nThe primary outcome of interest was whether the child was admitted to the hospital within 24 hours after enrollment. The treating sites also recorded symptom severity before and after treatment. Finally, telephone follow-up at multiple points up to 28 days after the ED visit obtained information on symptoms after the original visit.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T19:40:41.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "427c7cd1279e31c14af8bb8bc20e366ce71186a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9xSUNP4js44h7ku0gfRqIL6kbcM5p47Xm0X0rCC1c4iZxk.ZmU.SVP", "site_full": "www.medscape.com", "site": "medscape.com", "site_section": "http://odreport.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["orthopedics", "health"], "section_title": "The Overdose Report", "title": "A Delicate Balance: Pain Management and Opioid Use Disorder", "title_full": "A Delicate Balance: Pain Management and Opioid Use Disorder", "published": "2017-10-10T17:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1745, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "427c7cd1279e31c14af8bb8bc20e366ce71186a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9xSUNP4js44h7ku0gfRqIL6kbcM5p47Xm0X0rCC1c4iZxk.ZmU.SVP", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-10T17:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Delicate Balance: Pain Management and Opioid Use Disorder", "text": "  A Delicate Balance: Pain Management and Opioid Use Disorder A Delicate Balance: Pain Management and Opioid Use Disorder \nThe data within the report confirm that drug overdose is now the leading cause of death from unintentional injury in the United States.

Largest Trial to Date \nAnxiety disorders are among the most common mental health disorders in children, the investigators note. Further, they point out that if these disorders are not treated successfully, they can lead to significant long- and short-term impairment and \u201ctremendous societal cost.\u201d \nCAMS is the largest randomized controlled trial for childhood anxiety disorders to date. \nPublished in 2008, the original findings gave empirical support to the use of sertraline and CBT; the combined treatment yielded the best outcomes. At that time, the investigators stated that all three treatments could be recommended for pediatric anxiety. \nThe upshot was that many physicians and parents opted for CBT as first-line therapy before starting medication. In the current secondary analysis of the CAMS data, the investigators sought to identify predictors and moderators that may affect various treatment outcomes and to help physicians prescribe the most effective therapy for particular patient populations. \nThey integrated baseline anxiety levels and receiver operating characteristics into the analysis and examined predictors and moderators of parent- and child-rated anxiety outcomes.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T02:30:21.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a1d86a0027f645e92acdf60f099c96c482495109", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeHGcENeX17LJt49.EgQ2XjDSJwvvVQiZwwocNOVSfLvwVUb9wxvZR", "site_full": "www.medscape.com", "site": "medscape.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["orthopedics", "health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Vegetarianism Linked to Depression", "title_full": "Vegetarianism Linked to Depression", "published": "2017-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.163, "main_image": "https://img.medscape.com/thumbnail_library/dt_171011_man_eating_salad_800x600.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1745, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1301, "comments": 0, "shares": 1301}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 221}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a1d86a0027f645e92acdf60f099c96c482495109", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeHGcENeX17LJt49.EgQ2XjDSJwvvVQiZwwocNOVSfLvwVUb9wxvZR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Vegetarianism Linked to Depression", "text": "October 11, 2017 \nMale vegetarians are at greater risk for depression than their meat-eating counterparts, new research suggests. \nA National Institutes of Health (NIH) study of more than 9600 men showed that those who reported being vegetarians or vegans had significantly higher scores on a depression-measuring scale than nonvegetarians. \nIn addition, significantly more of the vegetarian/vegan group had a score >10 on the measure, signifying mild to moderate depression. \n\"Nutritional deficiencies (eg, in cobalamin or iron) are a possible explanation for these findings,\" write the investigators. \nLead author Capt Joseph R. Hibbeln, MD, acting chief of the Section on Nutritional Neurosciences at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism at the NIH, added that because red meat is rich in vitamin B12, that nutrient may have played a part in the results. Capt Joseph R. Hibbeln, MD \n\"If someone chooses to be vegetarian or chooses to eat less meat, they should follow guideline recommendations to ensure they have a good vitamin B12 status,\" Dr Hibbeln told Medscape Medical News . \nThe findings are published in the current issue of the Journal of Affective Disorders . Adverse Consequences \nAlthough vegetarian diets have been linked to several health benefits, little is known about benefit or risk to mental health, note the investigators. \n\"Vegetarian diets have been associated with decreased risks of cardiovascular death, obesity, and diabetes, prompting questions as to whether potential benefits extend to mental health or, in contrast, whether diminished intakes of nutrients that are abundant in excluded foods cause adverse consequences to mental well-being,\" they write. \nPrevious research has shown that low levels of vitamin B12 and folate are associated with an increased risk for depression, and \"one meta-analysis suggests that vitamin B12 intervention may prevent depressive symptoms in specialized populations,\" report the researchers. However, better-designed trials are needed to delve into these issues. \nThe population-based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) enrolled 14,541 pregnant women who lived in the United Kingdom and whose expected delivery dates were between April 1991 and December 1992. \nQuestionnaires were completed by the women and by 9845 of their partners; 9668 of these men were included in the current analysis. \nThe questionnaires asked for background information, as well as information on diet. Because relatively few of the men self-reported being vegan (n = 39), vegans and vegetarians were combined in one group (combined n = 350; 3.6% of the cohort). \nThe men also completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) between weeks 18 and 20 of their partner's gestation. A score >10 indicated a high probability of mild to moderate depression. \nResults showed that for the vegetarian/vegan group, the mean EPDS score was 5.26, vs 4.18 for the nonvegetarian group ( P < .0001). \nIn addition, 12.3% vs 7.4% of the vegetarian/vegan group and the nonvegetarian group, respectively, had an EPDS score >10 ( P = .001); 6.8% vs 3.9% had a score >12, signifying probable severe depression ( P < .01). \nThe unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for an EPDS score >10 was 1.75 for the vegetarians/vegans (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 - 2.43). After fully adjusting for a variety of confounders, including age, family history of depression, and religion, the OR was still 1.67 (95% CI, 1.14 - 2.44). \nAlthough not significant, there was also a trend for an association between depressive symptoms and duration of vegetarianism. \nThe investigators note that not all individuals who identify as vegetarians eat the same things, especially when it comes to fish, eggs, and dairy products. \nNot surprisingly, the nonvegetarians in this analysis ate more meat, sausages, poultry, and white fish than the vegetarian group. But 51.6% vs 52.3% reported eating oily fish; and 23.3% vs 28.6% reported eating shellfish. \n\"To our knowledge this is the first large epidemiological study to show a relationship between vegetarianism and significant depressive symptoms among adult men,\" write the researchers. \n\"Since exclusion of red meat primarily characterizes vegetarians, lower intakes of vitamin B12 merit consideration as a contributing factor\" to depression, they add. \nStill, they note that \"reverse causation cannot be ruled out.\" Dr Hibbeln said that more studies, especially randomized controlled trials, are definitely needed. \nBut he is optimistic about the future \u2015 he reported that the first conference of the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research (ISNPR), which was held this past summer, drew more than 500 attendees. \n\"It's my opinion that, after the many years I've been working in this area, it's really coming together and being recognized as a field,\" said Dr Hibbeln. Consistent Findings \u2015 With Caveats \nCommenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News , Felice Jacka, PhD, director of the Food and Mood Center at Deakin University, Geelong, Australia, and president of the ISNPR, said that ALSPAC \"is possibly the best cohort study in the world, certainly one of the best,\" and that this new study is \"really good.\" Dr Felice Jacka \n\"The important caveat is that we don't know whether it's cause or effect for vegetarianism because a vegetarian diet may be associated with personality factors or other factors that might increase depression. That's a caveat with any observational study: correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation,\" she said. \n\"However, the findings are consistent with the previous literature, including a study we published back in 2012.\" \nThat study assessed red meat consumption among more than 1000 Australian women. \"We found a very clear U-shaped relationship between the self-reported intake of red meat and clinical depressive and anxiety disorders, and that was excluding vegetarians deliberately,\" said Dr Jacka. \n\"Taking into account the overall quality of people's diet, those who had low intake (less than the national recommendations) and those with high red meat intake were twice as likely to have major depressive disorder, dysthymia, or a diagnosed anxiety disorder,\" she reported. \nShe added that the way the meat industry is conducted in Australia \"and probably in the UK\" is different from the way it is conducted in the United States. \"It's a pretty healthy way, where it's predominantly grass-fed as opposed to feed lots.\" \nDr Jacka noted that she grew up as a vegetarian, \"but that changed with the research. I noticed growing up that I was probably very deficient in iron, and I was constantly falling asleep in class. Red meat is actually important for zinc and iron, etc,\" she said. \n\"But I think we have to have the caveat that more isn't necessarily better. It might be about small quantities of good-quality meat. Larger amounts might be detrimental.\" SMILES \nShe added that blanket statements cannot be made. \"People seem to metabolize and respond to food quite differently, based on their gut microbiome. And that's something we're increasingly interested in and doing research on,\" said Dr Jacka. \n\"As we move towards making individual recommendations, I think we're going to get much more granularity in the data.\" \nFindings from Dr Jacka and colleagues' SMILES study were published earlier this year. SMILES was a randomized controlled trial that assessed a dietary support-group intervention in 67 adults with major depression. \nAfter 12 weeks, the dietary support group showed significantly greater improvement from baseline on the Montgomery-\u01fasberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) than a \"social support\" control group. \nIn addition, 32% vs 8% of each group achieved remission, defined as a score <10 on the MADRS. \n\"This was the first intervention study to show that if you help people to improve quality of their diet, there's a marked impact on their depressive symptoms,\" said Dr Jacka. \nShe noted that this type of interventional research is difficult to conduct. \"So we really have to be looking to the observational data.\" \nIn the current study from Dr Hibbeln and colleagues, as well as other studies, \"the observational data show that not consuming red meat may be a risk factor for some people for depression.\" \nThe study was supported by a grant from the UK Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust and by the University of Bristol, the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the Waterloo Foundation, and a personal gift from John M. Davis, MD. The study authors have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. The SMILES study was supported by a grant from Meat and Livestock Australia, but Dr Jacka reports that that support came after her study on red meat consumption and depression. \nJ Affect Disord. 2017;225:13-17.

Log out Cancel News > Reuters Health Information Senators Reach Bipartisan Deal on Short-term Obamacare Fix Yasmeen Abutaleb, Richard Cowan October 17, 2017 \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) \u2015 Two U.S. senators on Tuesday announced a bipartisan breakthrough to shore up Obamacare, an agreement that would revive federal subsidies for health insurers, and President Donald Trump voiced support for the deal. \nThe agreement worked out by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray would meet some Democratic objectives, including a revival of the subsidies for Obamacare and restoring $106 million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans. \nIn exchange, Republicans would get more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage. \nThe Trump administration announced last week it would stop paying billions of dollars to insurers to help low-income Americans pay out-of-pocket medical expenses, part of the Republican president's effort to dismantle Obamacare, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. \nTrump, who campaigned for president last year on a pledge to repeal Obamacare, has repeatedly criticized the 2010 law, the Affordable Care Act. \nBut, speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Trump suggested he could get behind the plan for a short-term fix that Alexander and Murray had settled on. \nHe said it would help get Obamacare through a \"very dangerous little period.\" But he also said he was still committed to a broader overhaul of the program. \n\"The solution will be for about a year or two years,\" Trump said at a joint news conference with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. \nShares of U.S. hospital operators, including Tenet Healthcare Corp and HCA Healthcare Inc, moved higher after news of the deal. Tenet shares were last up 4 percent, while HCA was 2.3 percent higher. Shares of some U.S. health insurers also extended their gains on the day, with Anthem Inc last up 2.5 percent and Centene Corp rising 2.8 percent. \nReporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb, Richard Cowan and Lewis Krauskopf; Writing by Yasmeen Abutaleb and Caren Bohan; Editing by Paul Simao and Jonathan Oatis \nReuters Health Information \u00a9 2017 Cite this article: Reuters Staff.

Should Doctors Embrace or Reject Alternative Treatments? Hi. I\u2019m Art Caplan and I am the head of medical ethics at New York University School of Medicine. I want to welcome you to Both Sides Now. We are going to look at a controversial issue that will really merit your attention. It\u2019s the topic of alternative and complementary medicine, and by that I am referring to treatments that are untested and unregulated. While there may not be hard data about them, there are often stories and testimonials that people have that say things work.\nIt is said, for example, that Steve Jobs regretted trying to cure himself through some alternative forms of healing\u2014acupuncture, fruit juices, and visiting spiritualists\u2014while he delayed having an operation and chemotherapy for his pancreatic cancer, which ultimately killed him. There is a downside that many are well aware of and invoke about alternative and complementary medicine. \nOn the other hand, more and more consumers say that they find relief, and benefit from alternative and complementary medicine. More medical centers are adding nontraditional therapy options for patients in their cancer centers. What are we actually talking about in this topic area? \nAlternative medicine is used instead of traditional therapy. We see alternative as an \u201cinstead of,\u201d such as using acupuncture instead of chemotherapy or radiation. Complementary is used together with conventional medicine; it might be to supplement something. You might use massage therapy or yoga or tai chi, or supplements and herbs. \nIntegrative medicine is a holistic approach that uses conventional and alternative medicine together; it might say, \u201cTake your medicine, but here is your acupuncture.\u201d \nThere are different definitions for \u201ccomplementary,\u201d\u201calternative,\u201d\u201cintegrative,\u201d and \u201cholistic.\u201d Some of the things we are talking about in terms of the alternative or the complementary are acupuncture, biofeedback, chelation therapy (which claims to remove toxic substances and heavy metals from an individual\u2019s bloodstream), chiropractic, osteopathy, homeopathy, massage, meditation, special diets, and supplements. \nAmericans are becoming increasingly involved in their own health. Many of them put a lot of credence in alternative and complementary treatments. They say that traditional medicines do not work for their problem\u2014\u201dWhy should I use it?\u201d You see that all over the Internet. \nThe danger is, though, that a patient could go on a special diet that claims to cure cancer instead of taking known effective, evidence-based drugs that their oncologist might prescribe to them. \nWell, plenty to talk about here, and we have two guests who will shed a lot of light on the pros and cons of complementary and alternative medicine. Dr Steven Novella is at the Yale School of Medicine. He believes that complementary and alternative medicine is more a scam than it is something that we ought to be pursuing and that it can be counterproductive. \nDr Ronald Hoffman, who I have had the chance to talk with in the past, is the founder and medical director of an independent clinic, The Hoffman Center, in New York City. He is a complementary medicine practitioner, a certified physician, and believes that a natural or nontraditional medical approach can be the key to wellness, a way to optimize or make someone healthier than they might otherwise have been. \nIt is a real pleasure to have both of you here to talk about this thorny area. I will ask you first, Ron. I gave a couple of quick definitions for alternative, complementary, integrative, and holistic. Was I in the ballpark? Are we accurate with those definitions? \nRonald Hoffman, MD: I appreciate the clarification because when we talk about alternative medicine, it is sort of an all-or-nothing proposition. If you have cancer, are you going to eschew conventional therapies, and are you going to adopt taking herbs or using special diets to cure your cancer? What I am personally interested in is integrating traditional conventional medical therapies with natural approaches. I think that is where it works best. \nDr Caplan: That supplement or complement that. \nDr Hoffman: I call this intelligent medicine\u2014using the best resources from both sides, because there clearly are benefits and drawbacks to both approaches and often you can integrate them. The task is to properly mix them so that one doesn\u2019t interfere with the other. \nDr Caplan: Steve, how do you see the geography here? \nSteven Novella, MD: I think you have to ask me, what are you integrating? We start from a point of view that we need to have one rational science-based standard, basically the best methods possible to decide what works and what does not work, what is safe, to establish risk versus benefit. If you agree that there should be one fair science-based standard, then either you pass that standard or you don\u2019t. \nIf you are carving out a double standard for things that don\u2019t meet this sort of reasonable standard for risk versus benefit for using treatments that work, I do not think that is in anyone\u2019s best interest, unless you are making money from it. The patients are certainly not benefiting from lowering the standard and using treatments which probably do not work because they are either implausible, they have already failed clinical trials, or they are untested. \nMost ideas in medicine turn out to fail; only a very, very tiny percentage actually are of net benefit to a patient. If we are shooting in the dark, if we are going back to the pre-scientific Wild West of medicine, that was not a good day for patients. \nDr Caplan: Back to leeching and purging. \nDr Novella: This is not in the interest of patients at all. \nDr Caplan: We did a poll. We found out that of 800 survey respondents\u2014it is not a structured sample, but a large number of folks responded to the poll from Medscape\u2014about 80% of them (physicians and other practitioners) said they will not work with patients around alternative and complementary medicine. About 20% in this poll said they would. I do not know what the overall picture is. \nI do know, however, that there are a lot of medical schools that are teaching alternative, complementary, and integrative medicine. Mine happens to be one that has at least a course. There are plenty of places. I think the Yale Cancer Center does, and I know that Penn\u2019s Cancer Center has options of alternative and complementary opportunities for patients. \nHow would you respond if somebody said, \u201cWait a minute\u2014aren\u2019t you guys offering some of these things within your own domains?\u201d \nDr Novella: Well, yes, that really blurs the lines, and I think the whole category of \u201calternative,\u201d or however you want to rebrand it, is about blurring those lines, so they do a number of things. I can give you a lot of personal experience. At Yale, for example, they said that the medical student association says you have to teach students about alternative medicine. They do not tell you how you have to teach them, but old-school physicians do not really know a lot about it. They say, \u201cOkay, we will let the people who are prescribing it teach the classes.\u201d Then all I really had to do was show them what they were proposing to teach, for them to be utterly scandalized about the horrible pseudoscience that they were about to teach their own medical students. \nA lot of academics are just seriously not paying attention. Hospitals can offer new treatments [and get] incremental income for things they use that are often low-tech and do not really have a lot of infrastructure costs. That is just a win-win for them. \nA lot of centers, like Yale\u2019s Cancer Center, for example, offer things they have always offered and just rebranded it as alternative and complementary: quality-of-life type of stuff, like massage or whatever, which are fine as long as you are not making claims that go beyond the evidence. They just sort of rebranded lifestyle and quality-of-life interventions as alternative, but it really is not. That is just marketing. \nDr Caplan: It is sometimes pointed out that a lot of what medicine does is not evidence-based because it is either grandfathered in or no one got around to a clinical trial or the trials are weak. Other people might say, \u201cFor certain things, if I feel better, I am okay with a testimonial. I had my massage, I felt good.\u201d What is your position or stance when somebody says, \u201cWhere are the data?\u201d \nDr Hoffman: I am on the same page as Dr Novella. I really do believe in evidence-based therapies. Some therapies, which have been branded quackery or implausible, have been put to the test, an example of which is chelation therapy.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T03:10:25.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "150628297fd492b3774cc89a01968a2e56f35d0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeHGcENeX17LJt49.EgQ2X6.ngk9_EyuiKnbwv9IOhp8YYB22OVjgO", "site_full": "www.medscape.com", "site": "medscape.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["orthopedics", "health"], "section_title": "", "title": "AHA Council on Hypertension - AHA Council on Kidney in Cardiovascular Disease - American Society of Hypertension Joint Scientific Sessions 2017", "title_full": "AHA Council on Hypertension - AHA Council on Kidney in Cardiovascular Disease - American Society of Hypertension Joint Scientific Sessions 2017", "published": "2017-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.277, "main_image": "https://img.medscape.com/thumbnail_library/Social_Facebook_806x806.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1745, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "150628297fd492b3774cc89a01968a2e56f35d0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeHGcENeX17LJt49.EgQ2X6.ngk9_EyuiKnbwv9IOhp8YYB22OVjgO", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Medscape Medical News", "published": "2017-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "AHA Council on Hypertension - AHA Council on Kidney in Cardiovascular Disease - American Society of Hypertension Joint Scientific Sessions 2017", "text": "Medscape Medical News , September 19, 2017 Popular Hypertension News \nHypertension in 40s Linked to Later Dementia, but Only in Women A new study shows hypertension in earlier midlife than studied before may be a risk factor for dementia, particularly in women.

Log out Cancel News > Reuters Health Information Estrogen Production Increases With Adiposity in Postmenopausal Women By Will Boggs MD October 18, 2017 \nNEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Estrogen production increases along with increases in fat tissues in postmenopausal women, researchers from Finland report. \n\"Adipose tissue is an important peripheral producer of active estrogens after menopause, and the accumulation of visceral fat increases in postmenopausal women,\u201d Dr. Natalia Hetemaki from University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, in Finland, told Reuters Health by email. \u201cOur study sheds light on the physiological production and metabolism of estrogens in two different types of adipose tissue, and our results highlight the role of visceral fat in this respect.\u201d \nDr. Hetemaki and colleagues compared estrogen concentrations and metabolic pathways producing estrone and estradiol in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue samples obtained from 37 postmenopausal women undergoing laparoscopic or abdominal surgery for nonmalignant indications. \nThe findings were published online September 29 in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism. \nEstrone, the predominant estrogen in adipose tissue, was present at higher concentrations in visceral than in subcutaneous fat, whereas estradiol concentration was similar in the two compartments. \nEstrone concentrations were 8 times higher in subcutaneous adipose tissue and 11 times higher in visceral adipose tissue, compared with circulating estrogen levels, and estradiol concentrations were about 3 times higher in adipose tissue than in serum. \nEstrone concentrations in visceral adipose tissue correlated positively with body mass index (BMI), whereas subcutaneous adipose tissue concentrations of estrone correlated negatively with age. \nThe activity of steroid sulfatase, which hydrolyzes estrone sulfate to estrone, was similar in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, while 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs), which transform estrone into estradiol, were more active in subcutaneous than in visceral adipose tissue. \nIn visceral adipose tissue, conversion of estrone to estradiol increased with waist circumference, and estradiol concentrations correlated positively with mRNA expression of HSD17B7. \n\"Although subcutaneous adipose tissue is quantitatively more important, comprising some 85% of total adipose tissue, increased visceral adipose tissue is associated with risks for diseases such as hormone receptor-positive breast cancer,\" the researchers note. \n\u201cBased on our results, it may be that with increasing obesity, the production of active estrogens is enhanced in visceral more than in subcutaneous fat tissue,\u201d Dr. Hetemaki said. \n\u201cWe will subsequently assess the effect of exogenous estrogens on adipose tissue estrogen metabolism by studying postmenopausal women using systemic postmenopausal hormone therapy,\u201d she added. \nDr. Kimberly Cox-York from Colorado State University, in Fort Collins, who recently found age-related differences in subcutaneous adipose tissue estrogen receptor mRNA expression in women, told Reuters Health by email, \"This study extends the implications of central adiposity from a matter of lipid handling and chronic inflammatory profiles to direct contributions of adipose tissue to prevailing estrogen profiles. This is of particular concern as we continue to learn more about the associations of lifetime circulating estrogens (estradiol, estrone, and estrogen metabolites) and chronic diseases such as metabolic disease and cancer.\u201d \n\u201cQuantifying the contribution of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue to estrogen metabolism will allow for a more targeted understanding of the risks associated with abdominal adiposity, and the potential to modulate estrogen profiles as women age,\u201d she said. \n\u201cIt is, of course, possible that the prevailing estrogen profile is a feed-forward mechanism for increasing central adiposity, given the observation that adipose tissue distribution shifts from the lower body to the upper body with time since menopause,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will be a difficult timeline to resolve.\u201d \n\u201cThis work further emphasizes the risk associated with increasing abdominal adiposity,\u201d Dr. Cox-York said. \u201cPhysicians should continue to encourage pre- and postmenopausal women to maintain a balanced diet and exercise regimen. Estrogen metabolism and action are complex processes, and no single tissue or enzyme directs the outcome. However, we know enough about the major players to guide women toward behaviors that support health.\u201d \nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/2xN4TWP \nJ Clin Endocrinol Metab 2017. \nReuters Health Information \u00a9 2017 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "will boggs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "natalia hetemaki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kimberly cox-york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cox-york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hetemaki", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "medscape", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reuters health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of helsinki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helsinki university hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cancel news > reuters health information estrogen production increases with adiposity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters health information", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fort collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-21T15:16:40.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6fddf1338b1e6d42ad274052ba862daea1be9e1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeHGcENeX17LJt49.EgQ2XjDSJwvvVQiZL8fHyNjtueKUy9nt.Mv8Z", "site_full": "www.medscape.com", "site": "medscape.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["orthopedics", "health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Judge Rejects Bid by 18 US States to Revive ACA Subsidies", "title_full": "Judge Rejects Bid by 18 US States to Revive ACA Subsidies", "published": "2017-10-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://img.medscape.com/thumbnail_library/Social_Facebook_806x806.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1745, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 92, "comments": 0, "shares": 92}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6fddf1338b1e6d42ad274052ba862daea1be9e1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeHGcENeX17LJt49.EgQ2XjDSJwvvVQiZL8fHyNjtueKUy9nt.Mv8Z", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Judge Rejects Bid by 18 US States to Revive ACA Subsidies", "text": "Judge Rejects Bid by 18 US States to Revive ACA Subsidies October 25, 2017 \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A US judge in California on Wednesday refused to block President Donald Trump's decision to end subsidy payments to health insurers under Obamacare, rejecting a request by Democratic attorneys general from 18 US states. \nUS District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco sided with the Trump administration, saying the government does not have to make the payments while litigation over the subsidies unfolds. \nChhabria, appointed by Democratic former President Barack Obama, wrote that although the case appears to be a close call \"it appears initially that the Trump administration has the stronger legal argument.\" The Trump administration this month terminated the payments to the insurers, which help cover medical expenses for low-income Americans, as part of several moves to dismantle Obama's signature healthcare law formally known as the Affordable Care Act. \nThe subsidies were due to cost $7 billion this year and were estimated at $10 billion for 2018, according to congressional analysts. Trump had threatened to cut off the subsidies for months, prompting health insurers to raise premiums or exit insurance markets set by under Obamacare. The payments amount to nearly $600 million a month, according to a Justice Department court filing. Democratic attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia sued the federal government and asked for an immediate order halting Trump's move while the case is being litigated. They argued that terminating the payments harmed customers by raising insurance rates. While Democrats accused Trump of sabotaging Obamacare, the president argued that the subsidies enriched insurance companies. \nInsurers say they do not profit from the subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income people. \nBecause insurers would raise premiums on policies in the absence of the subsidies, the government would be compelled to spend more on financial assistance to low-income Americans. \nEarlier on Wednesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that a bipartisan Senate proposal to shore up Obamacare insurance marketplaces by reviving the subsidies would cut the US deficit by $3.8 billion over the next decade. \nReuters Health Information \u00a9 2017 Cite this article: Judge Rejects Bid by 18 US States to Revive ACA Subsidies - Medscape - Oct 25, 2017.

23, 2017 \nLong-term statin use is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes of approximately 30% in individuals at high risk of the disease, even after taking into account known risk factors and potential confounders, say US researchers. \nThey looked at the development of diabetes among statin users in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), which included more than 3200 participants. \nOver 10 years, statin use was linked to a 36% increased risk of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, falling to 27% after taking into account baseline risk factors and clinical criteria used to determine the need for statins. \nThe findings are consistent with previous studies suggesting that statin use substantially increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. \nThe new study was published online October 23 in BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care by lead author Jill P Crandall, MD, department of medicine and diabetes research center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York, and colleagues. \nAs previously reported by Medscape Medical News , a study of more than 8700 Finnish men aged 45 to 73 years showed that over 6 years of statins therapy were linked to a 46% increased risk of type 2 diabetes \u2014 more than double prior estimates. \nThis was followed by recent data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health , which indicated that, among almost 8400 women aged 76 to 82 years, the risk of new-onset diabetes ranged from 17% with the lowest statin doses to 51% with the highest doses. \nDespite accumulating evidence, the current researchers still maintain that the overall healthcare advice remains unchanged \u2014 the benefits of statins outweigh the risks. \n\"For individual patients, a potential modest increase in diabetes risk clearly needs to be balanced against the consistent and highly significant reductions in myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death associated with statin treatment,\" they state. \nThey add: \"Nonetheless, glucose status should be monitored and healthy lifestyle behaviors reinforced in high-risk patients who are prescribed statins for cardiovascular disease prophylaxis.\" First Look at Diabetes Risk From Statins in High-Risk Patients \nThe researchers point out that the diabetogenic effect of statins has previously been studied in individuals typically at relatively low risk of diabetes and that the incidence of disease was based on self-report, rather than being the primary outcome. \nThey therefore set out to examine the issue in DPP participants, which included 3234 US adults randomized to intensive lifestyle intervention, metformin, or placebo. \nAfter a mean follow-up of 3.2 years, participants were invited to take part in the DPP outcomes study, which included quarterly lifestyle sessions alongside open-label metformin for those originally randomized to the drug and two additional lifestyle programs per year for those originally randomized to the lifestyle intervention. \nApproximately 50% of DPP participants were from ethnic groups and 20% were aged \u2265 60 years. To be included, they had to be aged \u2265 25 years and have a body mass index \u2265 24 kg/m 2 . They also had to have a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 95\u2013125 mg/dL and impaired glucose tolerance, placing them at high risk of type 2 diabetes. \nThe primary end point was diabetes diagnosis using an annual 75-g oral glucose tolerance test or semiannual FPG level with repeat confirmation testing. Lipids and blood pressure were assessed annually and statin use was based on self-report. \nFrom a baseline of approximately 4%, statin use progressively increased at the 10-year follow-up to reach 35% in the placebo group, 37% in the metformin group, and 33% in the lifestyle intervention group ( P = .36 between groups). \nSimvastatin was the most commonly used statin, taken by 40% of participants, followed by atorvastatin by 37% and, much less frequently, lovastatin and pravastatin, by 9% and 8%, respectively. \nStatins users were typically older and more likely to be men than nonusers but did not differ by ethnicity. Compared with nonusers, they also had modestly higher baseline FPG and HbA 1c , higher baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides, and were more likely to have a history of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. \nTaking into account age, sex, and ethnicity, researchers found that statin use was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing diabetes, at a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.36 for all three groups combined. \nFurther adjustment for baseline diabetes risk factors, including family history of diabetes and FPG, reduced the HR to 1.35, and additional adjustment for statin treatment confounders, such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, baseline cardiovascular risk factors, and socioeconomic status, lowered the HR to 1.27. \nDiabetes risk did not differ depending on statin potency or magnitude of LDL-cholesterol reduction, although longer statin use was significantly associated with greater diabetes risk (HR per visit with statin use, 1.06; P =.007). Mechanisms Underlying Effect \"Poorly Understood\" \nDiscussing the findings, the researchers say that \"it has been suggested that statins may 'uncover' diabetes in individuals at high risk, which on a population basis, could result in modest increase in diabetes risk.\" \nThey point out, however, that \"variation in baseline diabetes risk factors failed to explain the further risk associated with statin therapy in our cohort, and the HR estimate was greatest among our lifestyle participants, who experienced the largest study-related reductions in diabetes risk.\" \nThe mechanisms underlying any diabetogenic effect of statins are \"poorly understood,\" they add. \nAlthough several studies have looked at changes in insulin sensitivity during statin use, \"we saw no evidence of an effect of statins to modify insulin resistance, assessed as fasting insulin concentrations,\" they write. \nAnd although statins have been reported to reduce pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion in vitro, \"the relevance to insulin secretion in vivo is not known,\" they state. \nTaken together, evidence from studies published so far points to \"an acceleration of typical glycemic deterioration, rather than a unique or statin-specific mechanism,\" they conclude. \nThe research was supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, General Clinical Research Center Program, National Center for Research Resources, Department of Veterans Affairs, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institute on Aging, National Eye Institute, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Research on Women's Health, National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and American Diabetes Association.

events. \n\"It's well-known that overt hyperthyroidism and also subclinical hyperthyroidism are associated with atrial fibrillation, but what's new is that we showed that it's actually free thyroxine within the normal range and not TSH that dictates the risk in euthyroid persons,\" first author Dr Christine Baumgartner (Bern University Hospital, Switzerland) told theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology . \nHigher FT4 levels may be an additive risk factor for adverse cardiac outcomes, but FT4 is not ready for use as a screening tool in euthyroid patients, Baumgartner and her colleagues note in their October 23, 2017 online report in Circulation . \n\"Free thyroxine might be helpful to assess atrial-fibrillation risk in patients, but right now we can't recommend measuring free thyroxine because we would still need to know that we can do something about it to decrease their atrial-fibrillation risk,\" she said. \nThe investigators looked at individual data on 30,085 participants age 40 or older (median age 69) from 11 prospective cohort studies. Of these, 1958 (6.5%) had subclinical hypothyroidism at baseline and 2574 (8.6%) developed AF over 278,955 person-years of follow-up. The reference range for TSH was 0.45\u20134.49 mIU/L and for FT4 was based on study-specific cutoffs. \nCompared with the lowest FT4 quartile in the normal range, AF risk increased 17% in the second quartile (hazard ratio 1.17, 95% CI 1.02\u20131.35), 25% in the third quartile (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09\u20131.43), and 45% in the highest quartile (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.26\u20131.66) after adjustment for age and sex. \nSensitivity analyses and multivariable analyses yielded similar results. There was no association between FT4 levels and AF risk in patients with previous CV disease, but this finding may be affected by selection bias since patients with prevalent AF at baseline were excluded, Baumgartner and colleagues note. \nIncreasing FT4 levels were associated with higher AF risk in 1146 thyroxine users, most of whom had a FT4 level in the highest quartile. Their relatively small numbers, however, precludes meaningful interpretation of the AF risk associated with FT4 levels in those on thyroxine, one of the most frequently prescribed drugs in the US. \nNo association was found in age- and sex-adjusted analyses between AF risk and TSH levels in the reference range or for subclinical hypothyroidism. \nThe results align with data from two recent population-based studies including the investigators' recent report [ 2 ] from the Rotterdam Study showing an increased 10-year risk of AF with higher FT4 levels within the normal range, particularly in younger participants < 65 years. \nThe second study in older adults [ 3 ] showed that higher FT4 within the normal range was positively associated with mortality, AF, and heart failure. In contrast, TSH within the normal range but not FT4 was associated with dementia, suggesting that thyroid metabolism and action differ between target organs such as the heart and brain, Baumgartner and colleagues write. \nWhile TSH is typically the first test used to evaluate thyroid function and thought to be more sensitive than FT4 to predict outcomes, they point out that TSH is a marker of pituitary effects of thyroid function, whereas FT4 is converted to triiodothyronine, which executes its effects on end-organs. \n\"We think free thyroxine has a more direct function at the level of the heart than TSH, so that's why we think we can see this association between thyroxine and atrial fibrillation and why other researchers have also seen an association with sudden cardiac death and high blood pressure,\" Baumgartner said. \nThe study was supported by grants from the Swiss National Science Foundation and Swiss Heart Foundation. Baumgartner reports no relevant financial relationships. Disclosures for the coauthors are listed in the paper. \nFollow Patrice Wendling on Twitter: @pwendl .

Don't Use Ultrasonic Aspirators to Remove Uterine Fibroids FDA States October 31, 2017, 01:00:00PM . By Lucy Campbell Washington, DC The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided the medical community with guidance on the use of ultrasonic surgical aspirators. Specifically, the agency is advising companies that make the devices to label them as contraindicated for the removal of uterine fibroids. The non-binding guidance from the agency serves to strengthen its recent warnings about the use of power morcellators to remove uterine fibroids. The concern around the use of ultrasonic aspirators appears to be similar to that of power morcellators, in that the device could inadvertently spread cancerous cells during procedures to remove uterine fibroids. READ MORE Power Morcellators LEGAL NEWS Ovarian Cancer Survivor Blames Power Morcellator Ultrasonic aspirators are used surgically to break up both hard and soft tissues with ultrasound energy. The device then sucks out the broken up tissue from the body through a small incision. They're used by a wide variety of surgeons in both open and laparoscopic procedures. The FDA states in its guidance document that despite the suction of the ultrasonic aspirator, the oscillating tip of the device can disperse the fragmented tissue, which poses a risk of spreading cancerous tissue. Therefore, the agency states that in removing uterine fibroids, the benefits do not outweigh the risks, \"particularly since there are alternative treatment options available,\" the FDA states. Accordingly, the FDA is recommending the following addition to labels for ultrasonic aspirators indicated for laparoscopic, open, or gynecologic surgery: \"Contraindication: This ultrasonic surgical aspirator device is not indicated for and should not be used for the fragmentation, emulsification, and aspiration of uterine fibroids.\" READ MORE [ Drugs/Medical LEGAL NEWS ] Power Morcellators Legal Help If you or a loved one have suffered losses in this case, please click the link below and your complaint will be sent to a drugs & medical lawyer who may evaluate your claim at no cost or obligation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ultrasonic aspira", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lucy campbell washington", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-31T22:29:26.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8f5c32648ab07287ed249a2826fa3baabd3490c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeHGcENeX17LJt49.EgQ2XjDSJwvvVQiZL8fHyNjtueIdfhn3z7ROc", "site_full": "www.medscape.com", "site": "medscape.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["orthopedics", "health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Gastric Cancer Risk Doubled With Long-term PPI Use", "title_full": "Gastric Cancer Risk Doubled With Long-term PPI Use", "published": "2017-10-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.037, "main_image": "https://img.medscape.com/thumbnail_library/dt_171031_stomach_cancer_tumor_800x600.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1745, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5439, "comments": 0, "shares": 5439}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 100}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8f5c32648ab07287ed249a2826fa3baabd3490c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeHGcENeX17LJt49.EgQ2XjDSJwvvVQiZL8fHyNjtueIdfhn3z7ROc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Gastric Cancer Risk Doubled With Long-term PPI Use", "text": "Gastric Cancer Risk Doubled With Long-term PPI Use Megan Brooks October 31, 2017 \nUse of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) after Helicobacter pylori eradication more than doubles the risk for gastric cancer, according to a population-based study from Hong Kong. \nThe \"clear dose-response and time-response\" trend in PPI use and gastric cancer risk observed suggests the need for \"caution when prescribing long-term PPIs to these patients even after successful eradication of H. pylori, \" write Wai Keung Leung, MBChB, MD, from Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, and colleagues. \nThe study was published online October 31 in Gut . \nThe researchers point out, however, that this was an observational study, which can't prove cause and effect. \nH pylori eradication has been shown to reduce the risk for gastric cancer by 33% to 47%, but many patients develop gastric cancer even after eradication of H pylori. PPI therapy, \"although generally considered safe,\" is associated with worsening gastric atrophy, particularly in H pylori\u2013infected patients, the researchers point out. A recent meta-analysis found a 43% increased risk for gastric cancer among long-term PPI users, but it is was unable to adjust for H pylori, the major confounding factor. \nUsing a territory-wide health database in Hong Kong, Dr Leung and colleagues compared the risk for gastric cancer in PPI users and histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) users among 63,397 adults successfully treated with a 7-day course of triple therapy to eradicate H pylori between 2003 and 2012. \n\"PPIs are much more potent than H2RA in terms of gastric acid suppression, and previous studies did not reveal any association between gastric cancer development and H2RA. Hence, H2RA was selected as a negative control exposure in our study,\" the researchers explain. \nDuring a median follow-up of 7.6 years, 153 (0.24%) people developed gastric cancer after H pylori eradication therapy, mostly in noncardia regions (62%). None of the patients with gastric cancer tested positive for H pylori at diagnosis, but all had long-standing gastritis. The median age at cancer diagnosis was 71.4 years, and the median time from H pylori eradication to gastric cancer was 4.9 years. \nAfter propensity score adjustment, people taking PPIs at least weekly had a greater than twofold increased risk for gastric cancer development (hazard ratio [HR], 2.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.42 - 4.20). The propensity score\u2013adjusted absolute risk difference between PPI use and non-PPI use was 4.29 excess gastric cancer cases per 10,000 person-years. \nH2RA users had no increased risk (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.48 - 1.07), which \"further supports the specific role of PPIs on gastric cancer development,\" the researchers say. \nAfter stratification by tumor site, PPI use was only significantly associated with an increased risk for noncardia gastric cancer (HR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.42 - 4.72) but not cardia cancer (HR, 1.97; 95% CI, 0.57 - 6.82); \"although this result should be interpreted with caution as this subgroup analysis has a relatively small number of cardia cancers,\" the researchers say. \nGastric cancer risk increased with longer duration of PPI use. The HR was 5.04 (95% CI, 1.23 - 20.61) for 1 year of use or longer, 6.65 (95% CI, 1.62 - 27.26) for 2 years of use or longer, and 8.34 (95% CI, 2.02 - 34.41) for 3 years use or longer. \nMore frequent use was also associated with greater risk. When compared with the reference group (less than weekly use), gastric cancer risk progressively increased with more frequent PPI use. The HR was 2.43 (95% CI, 1.37 - 4.31) for weekly to less than daily use, increasing to 4.55 (95% CI, 1.12 - 18.52) for daily PPI use. \nThe results remained significant by various sensitivity analyses. \nA strength of the study is its use of data from a large population-based database with complete information on subsequent diagnoses and drug prescriptions, which minimizes selection, information, and recall biases, the researchers say. Use of strict exclusion criteria as well as propensity score adjustment to control for potential confounders and restricting the sample to patients with successful H pylori eradication are other strengths. \nIn terms of study weaknesses, the researchers lacked information on some risk factors, such as diet, family history, and socioeconomic status. And despite the large sample of more than 63,000 H pylori \u2013infected patients, the small number of gastric cancer cases did not allow for any \"meaningful evaluation of the dosage effect and role of different PPIs,\" the researchers say. \nThe team also notes that PPIs users may have a higher chance of undergoing endoscopy than non-PPI users, leading to discovery of more gastric cancers due to surveillance bias. \nDespite these limitations, Dr Leung and colleagues write that, to their knowledge, \"this is the first study to demonstrate that long-term PPIs use, even after H. pylori eradication therapy, is still associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer. This is likely related to the profound acid suppression of PPIs that worsens atrophic gastritis, particularly in those patients with established gastric atrophy as a result of chronic H. pylori -induced inflammation.\" \nThe study had no specific funding. Dr Leung has received honorarium for attending advisory board meetings of Takeda and Abbott Laboratories. \nGut . Published online October 31, 2017.
